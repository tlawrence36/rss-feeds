      "VENICE, Italy -- VENICE, Italy (AP) \u2014 Kathryn Bigelow tackles geopolitics in her new film \u201cA House of Dynamite,\u201d which has its world premiere on Tuesday at the Venice Film Festival.",
      "The film is about an imminent missile strike on the U.S., from an unknown aggressor, and how the White House responds.",
      "\u201cI grew up in an era when hiding under your school desk was considered the go-to protocol for surviving an atomic bomb,\u201d Bigelow said in her director\u2019s statement. \u201cToday, the danger has only escalated. Multiple nations possess enough nuclear weapons to end civilization within minutes. And yet, there\u2019s a kind of collective numbness \u2014 a quiet normalization of the unthinkable.\u201d",
      "She added that she wanted to make a film that confronts this paradox \u2014 \u201cto explore the madness of a world that lives under the constant shadow of annihilation, yet rarely speaks of it.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s Bigelow\u2019s first film since the 2017 release of \u201cDetroit.\u201d Her most acclaimed films have been politically themed, from \u201cThe Hurt Locker,\u201d for which she became the first woman to win the best director Oscar, to \u201cZero Dark Thirty.\u201d",
      "\u201cA House of Dynamite\u201d was written by former NBC News President Noah Oppenheim, who won best screenplay at the festival for \u201cJackie\u201d in 2016.",
      "\u201cA House of Dynamite\u201d is one of three Netflix films playing in competition, alongside Guillermo del Toro\u2019s classically gothic \u201cFrankenstein\u201d and Noah Baumbach\u2019s Hollywood drama \u201cJay Kelly.\u201d The streamer still doesn't have a best picture win in its arsenal, and Venice has proved itself to be a solid launching pad for awards hopefuls.",

      "It stars heartthrobs Ryo Yoshizawa and Ryusei Yokohama who portray longtime rivals and soulmates. They are both Kabuki \u201connagata\u201d actors, meaning they specialize in women roles, from gorgeous princesses to damsels in distress.",

      "It also pays homage to old-style yakuza movies, as well as obliquely to Western gangster films, like \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d because one of the heroes is the son of a gangster.",
      "In short, it\u2019s not the kind of material that usually makes a hit movie in Japan, where action-packed blockbusters or animation based on popular manga comics or spectacular special effects have drawn audiences in the past.",
      "But the movie\u2019s theme explores something intrinsically Japanese and hit a raw nerve in a country where soul-searching about national pride is on the rise amid a widespread perception that economic and political clout is on the decline.",
      "Being an outsider was the theme that jumped out for tourism science scholar Yosuke Kon.",
      "\u201cThe Kabuki world seems very special, but a Kabuki kind of mentality exists in many places in Japan,\u201d he told The Associated Press, noting a closed mentality is prevalent in the village, as well as local governments he has worked with.",

      "The film is dominated by stage scenes from Kabuki, an art form dating to the 17th century, which combines stylized dance and acting to live music. It\u2019s been stereotyped as catering to old people, as younger generations turn to Western and modern forms of entertainment like boys\u2019 bands, baseball games and streaming services.",
      "In Kabuki, all the roles are played by men, wearing thick makeup and elaborate kimono, delivering sing-song lines in tales of intrigue and violence set in the samurai era.",
      "The film shows the dazzling esoteric elements of Kabuki, such as the backstage where actors apply makeup with their fingertips, or the flutter of paper snowflakes or flower petals on the stage.",

      "A woman charged with selling Matthew Perry the ketamine that killed him is set to plead guilty",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A woman who has come to be known as the \u201cKetamine Queen\u201d is set to plead guilty Wednesday to selling Matthew Perry the drug that killed him.",
      "Jasveen Sangha is scheduled to change her previous not guilty plea at a federal court in Los Angeles and would become the fifth and final defendant charged in the overdose death of the \u201cFriends\u201d star to plead guilty after a deal with prosecutors.",
      "She agreed in a signed statement to plead to five federal charges, including providing the ketamine that led to Perry\u2019s death. Her trial had been planned to start later this month.",
      "In a brief statement when the deal was announced on Aug. 18, Sangha's lawyer Mark Geragos said only, \u201cShe's taking responsibility for her actions.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors had cast Sangha, a 42-year-old citizen of the U.S. and the U.K., as a prolific drug dealer who was known to her customers as the \u201cKetamine Queen,\u201d using the term often in press releases and court documents.",
      "Her guilty pleas are set to include one count of maintaining a drug-involved premises, three counts of distribution of ketamine, and one count of distribution of ketamine resulting in death.",
      "Prosecutors agreed to drop three other counts related to the distribution of ketamine, and one count of distribution of methamphetamine that was unrelated to the Perry case.",
      "The final plea deal came a year after federal prosecutors announced that five people had been charged in Perry\u2019s Oct. 28, 2023 death after a sweeping investigation.",
      "If Sangha pleads guilty as planned, a judge will schedule sentencing for Sangha. She could get up to 45 years in prison. The judge is not bound to follow any terms of the plea agreement, but prosecutors said in the document that they will ask for less than the maximum. None of the co-defendants have been sentenced yet.",
      "Sangha and Dr. Salvador Plasencia, who pleaded guilty in July, had been the primary targets of the investigation. Three other defendants \u2014 Dr. Mark Chavez, Kenneth Iwamasa and Erik Fleming \u2014 pleaded guilty in exchange for their cooperation, which included statements implicating Sangha and Plasencia.",
      "Perry was found dead in his Los Angeles home by Iwamasa, his assistant. The medical examiner ruled that ketamine, typically used as a surgical anesthetic, was the primary cause of death.",

      "Perry had been using ketamine through his regular doctor as a legal, but off-label, treatment for depression, which has become increasingly common. Perry, 54, sought more ketamine than his doctor would give him, and his search for more led him to Sangha through his friend Fleming about two weeks before his death, prosecutors said.",
      "Fleming messaged Perry's assistant saying her ketamine was \u201camazing\u201d and that she deals only \u201cwith high end and celebs.\u201d",
      "Perry bought large amounts of ketamine from Sangha, including 25 vials for $6,000 in cash four days before his death, prosecutors said.",
      "On the day of Perry\u2019s death, Sangha told Fleming they should delete all the messages they had sent each other, according to her indictment.",

He starred alongside Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004 on NBC\u2019s megahit series.",

      "Dwayne Johnson takes a serious turn as UFC fighter Mark Kerr in \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d that has premiered Monday at the Venice Film Festival",
      "VENICE, Italy -- Dwayne Johnson takes a serious turn as UFC fighter Mark Kerr in \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d which had its world premiere Monday at the Venice Film Festival.",
      "\u201cI have for a long time wanted this,\u201d Johnson said before the premiere. \u201cThe transformation part was something I was really hungry to do. I\u2019ve been very fortunate to have the career that I\u2019ve had and make the films that I have, but there was just this voice inside of me, this little voice, like what if I can do more.\u201d",
      "The actor, best known for big budget action movies and comedies, is already sparking Oscar buzz for his transformation in the film from Benny Safdie. The festival has launched several recent best actor Oscar winners, from Brendan Fraser in \u201cThe Whale\u201d to Adrien Brody in \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d Like both of those films, \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d is being released by A24.",
      "\u201cThe box office in our business is very loud,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAnd it can push you into a category and into a corner: This is your lane, this is what you do, this what people want you to be in and this is what Hollywood wants you to be. And I understood that. And I made those movies, and I like them and they were fun. And some were really good and did well and some not so good.\u201d",
      "But he felt like he had more to give, not to prove something to Hollywood, but to himself. The push to take on a new challenge came in part from his co-star and friend Emily Blunt, who he worked with in \u201cJungle Cruise,\" and who encouraged him to draw on everything he'd gone through in life and put it into his work.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019ve been pigeonholed into something it\u2019s hard to know, wait, can I do that?\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes it takes people you know and love, like Emily and Benny, to say you can.\u201d",
      "Johnson was joined in Venice not only by Safdie and Blunt, but also the man he's portraying in the film. Kerr is a two-time UFC heavyweight tournament winner and MMA fighter who retired in 2009. Known as \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d Kerr also struggled with addiction to painkillers and opioids, overdosing twice.",
      "Before Johnson was best known as the star of franchises like \u201cJumanji\u201d and the \u201cFast & Furious\u201d series, as well as a producer and business owner, he made his name in wrestling. A third-generation wrestler, he won eight WWE championships.",
      "\u201cI loved wrestling and I had such a great time, but it's very bombastic,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "He remembered meeting Kerr in the late 1990s and said how much he looked up to him. This film, he said, feels like a full circle moment.",
      "\u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d takes place between the years 1997 and 2000, a tumultous time in both Kerr\u2019s professional and personal life. His relationship with then girlfriend Dawn Staples was particularly volatile.",
      "Blunt got to know and spend time with her counterpart as well. She said she was excited to show the \u201cfull weather system\u201d of a relationship.",
      "\u201cI've been part of a lot of relationships that are essentially more curated to a movie, a moviefied relationship,\u201d Blunt said. \u201cThis felt like the full spectrum of what a relationship really looks like. Because humans change within the hour. I think we got to show that.\u201d",

      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The Amsterdam museum that displays a priceless collection of works by one of the world's most popular artists, Vincent van Gogh, may have to close if the Dutch government doesn't help foot the bill for major repairs to its aging building, the museum's director said Thursday.",
      "Since its opening in 1973, nearly 57 million visitors have passed through the Van Gogh Museum to gaze at iconic works including one of his paintings of a vase of sunflowers as well as \u201cAlmond Blossom,\u201d \u201cThe Potato Eaters\u201d and a colorful depiction of his bedroom in the French town of Arles.",
      "But Director Emilie Gordenker says the original building, which is owned by the Dutch state, is in such poor condition it needs urgent and extensive repairs to keep its priceless collection and visitors safe.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t address the major maintenance that needs to happen, we will have to close,\" she told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. The New York Times first reported on her concerns on Wednesday.",
      "She said the 50-year-old building needs \"major maintenance,\u201d and two years of talks with the government have not resolved a dispute about how to pay for repairs expected to start in 2028, last three years and cost 104 million euros ($121 million).",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s now getting very urgent,\u201d she said.",
      "She said that during the renovation, the museum would be partly closed and would therefore earn less from ticket sales. \u201cThe only thing we\u2019re asking them to do is to help us finance the basic maintenance,\u201d she said.",

      "The dispute has its origins in a decision by Van Gogh\u2019s family to transfer a trove of his art \u2014 more than 200 paintings, 500 drawings and 900 letters along with works by contemporaries such as Paul Gauguin \u2014 to a foundation set up in 1962 to keep the collection together. In return, the government pledged to build and maintain a museum where the works could be displayed, the museum said in a statement.",

      "Lee Corso gets to experience that on Saturday.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s a gamut of different emotions. I\u2019m trying to stay in the celebratory lane this weekend,\u201d said GameDay analyst Kirk Herbstreit, who has sat next to Corso since 1996. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be emotional or sad when it\u2019s his last show. We can be sad next week. But this weekend, we need to be celebrating him. Everything he\u2019s meant to us and to the sport.\u201d",
      "Corso, who turned 90 on Aug. 7, has been a part of \u201cGameDay\u201d since its start in 1987 and has made pregame shows entertaining under a simple philosophy: \u201cFootball is just the vehicle. It\u2019s entertainment, sweetheart.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlmost everyone, no matter what they accomplish in our industry, sort of gets dragged out boots first. They don\u2019t really get a chance to say farewell,\u201d GameDay host Rece Davis said on Friday after a production meeting. \u201cI think it\u2019s a real blessing that we\u2019re able to give Lee his flowers on a day when he\u2019s feeling great, doing great, and excited for a game.\u201d",

      "Corso has worn 69 different schools\u2019 mascot headgear and has dressed up as Notre Dame\u2019s Fighting Irish leprechaun, the Stanford tree, and historic figures James Madison and Benjamin Franklin. However, Brutus remains Corso\u2019s first love, wearing it 45 times.",

      "The firing of the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the resignation of several high-profile agency leaders pose immediate challenges to the operations of the nation's premiere public health agency, experts said.",
      "It could take \u201cseveral months\u201d to identify and confirm a replacement for CDC Director Susan Monarez, who was terminated Wednesday after less than a month on the job, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, director of the American Public Health Association. And it could take more time to fill at least four key vacated positions that oversee disease outbreaks, vaccines and public health data.",
      "\u201cThe whole chain of command has just been disrupted,\u201d Benjamin told The Associated Press. \u201cIt's like getting rid of your generals in the middle of a war.\u201d",
      "Health experts said Americans could see immediate effects, from confusion over the availability of COVID-19 vaccines to delayed responses to outbreaks of infectious diseases such as measles or foodborne illnesses caused by germs such as E. coli or listeria.",
      "\u201cThe average American should worry about their safety and their health and whether information coming out of Health and Human Services is reliable or trustworthy,\u201d said Dr. Anne Schuchat, former principal deputy director of the CDC, who left the agency in 2021.",
      "Here's what you need to know about the sudden changes at the CDC.",
      "The White House ousted Monarez on Wednesday after apparent clashes between the CDC director and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over changes to the nation's vaccine policy.",
      "Officials at the White House said Monarez was dismissed because she was not aligned with President Donald Trump's agenda and refused to resign.",
      "That action coincided with the resignation this week of at least four top CDC agency leaders: Dr. Debra Houry, the agency\u2019s deputy director; Dr. Daniel Jernigan, leader of the agency\u2019s work on emerging infectious diseases; Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a top vaccine official; and Dr. Jennifer Layden, who led public health data efforts.",
      "Monarez was the first CDC director to require Senate confirmation under a law that took effect in 2023. Replacing her would require Trump to nominate a new director, who would then need to be considered and confirmed by the Senate. On Thursday, Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy said the high-profile departures will \u201crequire oversight\u201d of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which he chairs.",
      "In the meantime, the president could name an acting CDC director, Benjamin noted.",
      "Replacing the leaders in the other positions, including those who held the jobs for years, will be difficult, Schuchat said.",
      "\u201cThe four people who resigned led important parts of the agency and had the respect of the nation and the world,\u201d she said.",

      "\u201cSo we need to look at the priorities of the agency, if there\u2019s really a deeply, deeply embedded, I would say, malaise at the agency,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cAnd we need strong leadership that will go in there and that will be able to execute on President Trump\u2019s broad ambitions.\u201d",
      "The clash at CDC was apparently triggered by conflict over changes in policy regarding recommendations for COVID-19 vaccinations that could make getting a shot more complicated for people.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration approved updated COVID-19 shots on Wednesday but limited their use for many Americans \u2014 and removed one of the two vaccines available for young children. The new jabs from three manufacturers are approved for all seniors, but the FDA narrowed their use for adults and children to those with high-risk health conditions, such as asthma or obesity.",
      "The FDA approval is typically reviewed by a CDC vaccine advisory committee, which makes recommendations for use. Monarez said she would not automatically sign off on recommendations of the committee, which was handpicked by Kennedy, according to Dr. Richard Besser, a former CDC acting director. (Besser is now president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which helps support The Associated Press Health and Science Department.)",
      "The changes present new barriers to access for millions of Americans, who would have to prove their risk, and others who may want the shots but suddenly no longer qualify. The vaccines were previously recommended for Americans 6 months and older.",
      "\u201cThese decisions, made without supporting evidence, reflect a troubling pattern by HHS of interfering in the relationship between patients and their healthcare providers and limiting access to vaccines \u2014 public health tools proven to save lives and reduce costs,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease researcher.",
      "In addition, the disruption at the CDC could jeopardize many local health services undergirded by the agency's support and expertise, Schuchat noted. That could mean tracking a simmering infectious disease outbreak, such as measles, or outbreaks of foodborne illness.",
      "\u201cIt's the water that you drink, the lead in your pipes. Look around your community,\" she said. \u201cIf people are doing well and healthy, it's probably partly because of the CDC.\u201d",

      "It was a far cry from the military might the country will display Wednesday in a parade marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. A Japanese invasion before and during the conflict devastated China and left millions of people dead.",
      "\u201cNow you see our country\u2019s planes ... no one dares to mess with them,\u201d the veteran told journalists at a war museum in the city of Shenyang. His chest covered with ribbons and medals, Yang expressed pride in his country's rise.",

      "To the outside world, the missiles, tanks and fighter jets at the parade will be a show of strength as China seeks to portray itself as an alternative to the American-dominated postwar era.",
      "Domestically, the commemoration is an effort to show how far the country has come \u2014 and in so doing, build support for the party and its leader, President Xi Jinping. China was a major front in World War II, a fact often overlooked in accounts that focus more on the fight for Europe and U.S. naval battles in the Pacific.",

      "Rubio, speaking to reporters before boarding his plane to Mexico, said Trump \u201cis going to be on offense against drug cartels and drug trafficking in the United States. It destabilizes not just the country but the entire Caribbean basin.\u201d",

      "The nation of over 50 million people has a long history of conflicts, including the one that created South Sudan in 2011. It\u2019s also known for its seasonal flooding that kills hundreds of people every year. Climate change has made the rainfall and flooding more deadly and destructive in recent years.",
      "After days of heavy rainfall, a landslide on Sunday wiped out the village of Tarasin in the Marrah Mountains area, more than 900 kilometers (560 miles) west of the capital, Khartoum.",

      "The group\u2019s spokesman Mohamed Abdel-Rahman al-Nair said search efforts were underway and that about 100 bodies were recovered as of Tuesday evening. The U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Sudan, Luca Renda, said \u201cbetween 300-1,000 people may have lost their lives,\u201d citing local sources.",
      "Marrah Mountains, where the village is located, are hard to reach. The UNESCO World Heritage site is located in a volcanic area with a summit of 3,000 meters (9,840 feet).",
      "The landslide happened in the peak of Sudan\u2019s flooding season, which runs from July to October. Widespread damage have been reported in other areas in Sudan in recent weeks, including Sofia village in South Darfur province where 100 houses were destroyed also on Sunday, according to the International Organization for Migration.",
      "Sudan plunged into chaos when simmering tensions between the military and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces exploded into street fighting in April 2023 in the capital, Khartoum and elsewhere in the country. The war has turned into a regional proxy conflict in which each side is backed by foreign governments.",
      "Darfur, which has suffered from decades of conflict and witnessed the first genocide in the 21st century, was among the worst hit areas in the ongoing war.",
      "The front lines have shifted following the military\u2019s capture of Khartoum and its sister city of Omdurman, in a major setback to the paramilitaries. Most of the fighting have occurred in Darfur and the south-central region of Kordofan.",

      "There was no shortage of pageantry at Wednesday\u2019s military parade in Beijing, but beyond the spectacle, it also provided the first good look at China\u2019s latest military hardware",
      "BANGKOK -- Soldiers in pristine and pressed uniforms marched in lockstep, their boots clacking a steady cadence on the pavement and their eyes following leader Xi Jinping as he drove by in review. Helicopters flew overhead, forming the numbers 8 and 0 in honor of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.",
      "There was no shortage of pageantry at Wednesday's military parade in Beijing, but beyond the spectacle, it also provided the first good look at China's latest military hardware. New missiles, drones and other high-tech equipment have been added to its arsenal as part of a massive modernization program with the goal, according to the official parade announcers, of producing a force \u201cwith both nuclear and conventional capabilities able to deter wars in all battle spaces.\u201d",
      "Here are some of the highlights:",
      "China's nuclear arsenal still lags far behind that of the United States and Russia, but it has been rapidly expanding. In its annual report to Congress on China, the U.S. Department of Defense estimated that Beijing now has more than 600 warheads and will have more than 1,000 by 2030.",
      "The parade featured many of the missiles capable of delivering those warheads, from air, sea and land. China's official Xinhua News Agency said it was the first time the military's \u201ctriad of strategic nuclear forces was presented in a concentrated fashion,\u201d calling it \u201cChina's strategic trump card for safeguarding national sovereignty and defending national dignity.\u201d",
      "The display of the three systems together is noteworthy, said Meia Nouwens, senior fellow for Chinese security and defense policy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.",
      "\u201cAll of that, of course, goes back to this key point about deterrence and the messaging that the PLA (People\u2019s Liberation Army) and Xi Jinping are seeking to send to the U.S. and other partners and allies in the region and further afield,\" she said.",
      "Among the nuclear-capable missiles seen was the DF-61, a new intercontinental ballistic missile which can be fired from a mobile launching platform. Details on its capabilities are scant, but its predecessor has a range of more than 12,000 kilometers (7,500 miles) and can carry multiple warheads. It also debuted the newest variant of the silo-based DF-5, the DF-5C, whose range has been estimated at 20,000 kilometers.",
      "Also featured were the JL-1 air-launched long-range missile and the JL-3 sea-launched missile, both of which are also nuclear-capable.",
      "The parade saw the debut of other new missiles, including several designed to attack ships. These are likely of particular interest to the U.S., whose naval power is a key component of its Asia-Pacific defense strategy.",
      "China claims the self-governing democracy of Taiwan as its own, and Xi has not ruled out taking the island by force. In the event of a Chinese invasion, if the U.S. were to come to Taiwan's aid, China would need to hold off the U.S. Navy long enough to consolidate control of the island.",

      "China has already built the world's largest navy, though it is still well behind the U.S. in the number of aircraft carriers it has. It could use missiles, however, to try to keep American carriers out of effective range.",
      "The parade showcased for the first time the YJ-15, YJ-17, YJ-19 and YJ-20 anti-ship missiles, all capable of operating at long ranges and hypersonic, making them difficult to intercept.",
      "It also displayed missiles meant to intercept incoming anti-ship missiles, including the HQ-16C and HQ10A, and presented the aircraft-carrier version of the J-35 stealth multirole fighter for the first time.",
      "\u201cThese are capabilities that are increasingly meant to signal to the United States they should think twice about entering into a conflict, if there ever is one, in support of Taiwan,\u201d Nouwens said.",
      "Seven types of reconnaissance and attack aerial drones were on display that were not immediately identified by official commentators, but some of which appeared to be new.",
      "A small surface drone ship was also on display but not identified, as well as carrier-based uncrewed helicopters.",
      "China also showed off two submarine drones, the older-model HSU001 and debuting the much larger AJX002. China's official Xinhua News Agency called them \u201ccutting-edge surprise weapons for naval combat\u201d designed for \u201ccovert deployment and blockade, autonomous detection and identification, and swarm-networked attacks.\u201d",
      "\u201cLong gone are the days where China was reliant on Russia or other foreign systems,\u201d wrote Mick Ryan, a retired Australian army major general and analyst at the Lowy Institute, in a research note on the drones and other systems on display. \u201cThis level of indigenous capacity infers high levels of sustainability in any future conflict.\u201d",
      "Still, he cautioned, \u201cnewer does not always mean better.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile most Western military equipment has been tested in Iraq, Ukraine and elsewhere, none of China's new kit has.\u201d",

      "LA PAZ, Bolivia -- Struck by lightning during a roaring thunderstorm 10 years ago, an ancient pine tree in Bolivia's capital of La Paz is thriving.",
      "Known as the \u201cmiracle tree,\u201d this giant conifer now draws devotees from across the country to La Paz\u2019s largest public cemetery, founded two centuries ago on a pre-Columbian burial plot. Pilgrims stream through the alleys bearing offerings \u2014 coins, flowers, sweets, handwritten disclosures of secret wishes \u2014 to stuff into bark crevices.",
      "On a chilly afternoon last week during the throes of an election season, pilgrims made their way to the miracle tree through the winding alleys of the cemetery packed with over 200,000 graves, many belonging to decorated soldiers and dignitaries.",
      "As Bolivia is now heralding the end of almost two decades of leftist rule under its first Indigenous president, Evo Morales, and his successor, even electoral drama and economic collapse seemed eclipsed by other concerns for devotees of the miracle tree.",
      "\u201cPeople ask for love, work, health, children, even to bring back their lost pet,\u201d explained Javier Cordero, who leads funeral prayers at the cemetery. \u201cIf the person comes with a lot of faith, the tree will fulfill their wishes.\u201d",
      "Some of the devotees were young, having recently discovered the story of the tree on TikTok.",
      "Others were regulars, older Bolivians long convinced of the tree\u2019s sacred powers, like 79-year-old prayer leader Ricardo Quispe, who was taking refuge beneath the tree\u2019s sheltering limbs when lightning struck on that stormy afternoon a decade ago. He claims the lightning bolt also gave him psychic powers.",
      "Far from pulverizing the tree, the rogue bolt of lightning left a scar on its trunk that now oozes aromatic resin. The towering tree in the La Paz cemetery now appears healthier than ever.",
      "A study probing how certain trees may benefit from lightning strikes \u2014 published earlier this year in the journal New Phytologist \u2014 offers some scientific basis for this tree\u2019s surprising transformation. But long before such forest ecology studies, Indigenous Aymara shamans in Bolivia believed lightning strikes bestowed divine powers upon their survivors, whether people or trees.",
      "Such rites abound in this Andean nation, where ancient pre-Hispanic beliefs underlay the Catholicism brought by Spanish colonizers.",
      "Yatiris, specialists in divining good luck and performing energy cleansings, fill the streets of La Paz and the neighboring Aymara city of El Alto, selling their services to anyone in need of blessings \u2014 from women trying to get pregnant to farmers hoping for healthy crops.",

      "MANILA, Philippines -- The Philippine president and Congress have begun looking into possibly massive corruption in flood control projects that may implicate public works officials and engineers, construction firms and politicians in one of the countries most vulnerable to typhoons.",
      "The House of Representatives infrastructure committee opened a nationally televised hearing Tuesday. The Senate\u2019s powerful blue ribbon committee resumed on Monday a separate inquiry, where senators grilled a private contractor who has denied any wrongdoing but faced intense questioning over her family\u2019s fleet of at least 28 luxury cars and SUVs.",
      "Rep. Elajiah San Fernando said that given the huge budget allocated for flood control infrastructure and water resource development in the Philippines, including more than 308 billion pesos ($5.4 billion) this year, the scale of the corruption could be \u201cof the grandest kind.\u201d",
      "Addressing construction companies, private contractors and politicians involved in anomalies or \u201cghost projects,\u201d San Fernando warned that Congress has \u201cno other objective but to see your heads rolling, to hold you into account and lock you up in jail.\u201d",
      "In July, back-to-back typhoons and seasonal monsoon downpours set off massive floods that affected millions of people, displaced more than 300,000 others, damaged nearly 3,000 houses and left extensive infrastructure and agricultural losses. At least 26 people died in the weather onslaught.",
      "\u201cWhen it floods, it\u2019s not the wealthy engineers or politicians or senators or congressmen or contractors living in mansions with dozens of SUVs who suffer,\u201d San Fernando said. \u201cWhen flood control fails, the ordinary Filipino gets to be hurt first.\u201d",
      "Another House member, Walfredo Dimaguila Jr., blamed past public works officials for poorly planned projects that aimed to ease the flooding in metropolitan Manila but have caused frequent flooding in his province of Laguna, south of the capital. He presented video footage showing school buildings and houses engulfed in recent knee-deep floodwaters. Villagers wade through the water and others row their way aboard small wooden boats along flooded streets.",
      "After inspecting provincial flood control projects in recent weeks and discovering substandard quality and other anomalies, Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said Monday that he would form an independent commission to investigate the corruption that likely has hounded such projects and file criminal charges against those responsible.",
      "Marcos said more than 6,000 of the 9,000 flood control projects implemented so far in his more than three years in office have inadequate or unusual specifications that should be looked into. A website launched by the president to allow people to report potential anomalies has been swamped with complaints.",

      "In Monday's Senate inquiry, Sen. Jinggoy Estrada expressed suspicion on how private contractor Sarah Discaya, a former dental clinic receptionist and nurse abroad, managed to grow rich over the years after she and her husband ventured into the construction business and won a large number of government contracts, including many flood control projects.",
      "\u201cThis is unbelievable,\u201d Estrada said after Discaya acknowledged owning at least 28 of the world's most expensive cars. \u201cIt\u2019s only now that I\u2019ve heard of one person or a couple owning such a big number of very expensive cars.\u201d",
      "Under intense questioning, Discaya repeatedly denied that she and the nine construction companies she owned with her husband resorted to corruption and bribery to win contracts from the Department of Public Works and Highways. The department, which oversees the country\u2019s infrastructure projects, has been hounded by allegations of corrupt deals for years.",

As she watched hypersonic missiles roll down Beijing\u2019s Chang\u2019an Avenue and troops march in lockstep, she didn\u2019t feel like they posed a threat to Taiwan, the self-ruled island China claims as its own.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s essentially a double-edged sword,\u201d Yang added. \u201cOn the one hand, China\u2019s attempt to regularize military operations around Taiwan in recent years has forced Taiwanese people to view these activities as part of a \u2018new normal\u2019 in their everyday life. However, China\u2019s increasing military presence also reduces the effect of these intimidation tactics on the Taiwanese public.\u201d",
      "Taiwan\u2019s government used the event to renew alarm over Beijing\u2019s military intimidation of the island. China sends military jets and ships near Taiwan almost daily and hasn\u2019t renounced the use the force to take over the territory, which it considers a breakaway province.",

      "At President Donald Trump's news conference, Fox News' Peter Doocy asked something that surely baffled those who avoided social media over Labor Day: \u201cHow did you find out over the weekend that you were dead?\u201d",
      "Early in Donald Trump's news conference Tuesday, Fox News' Peter Doocy asked a question that surely baffled people who avoided social media for Labor Day.",
      "\u201cHow did you find out over the weekend that you were dead?\u201d Doocy said to the president.",
      "Doocy was referring to speculation about Trump's health that spread online during the long Labor Day weekend, fueled in part by the president's relative absence from the public for several days. The incident has renewed \u2014 for a different president \u2014 questions about how journalists should handle the sensitive issue of how healthy an aging leader of the free world actually is.",
      "Trump said he was more active than had been apparent publicly and criticized the media. \u201cIt's fake news \u2014 it's so fake,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's why the media has so little credibility.\u201d",
      "A year ago, President Joe Biden, now 82, abandoned his reelection effort after a halting, confused performance in a debate with Trump provoked concerns about his ability to serve another four-year term. Journalists who covered the White House faced attacks for not doing enough to investigate Biden's health and condition.",
      "Trump, who turned 79 in June, is the oldest person to be inaugurated as president. Pictures showing him with bruises on his hands and apparent swelling in his legs circulated online recently, as did clips of misstatements in public, such as mistakenly referring to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer last month as \u201cKristi.\u201d",
      "None of these is evidence of serious illness.",
      "The White House has said Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, which means veins in the legs can\u2019t properly carry blood back to the heart, causing it to pool in the lower legs. It\u2019s a fairly common condition for older adults.",
      "As far as the bruising, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said it\u2019s from \u201cfrequent handshaking and the use of aspirin,\u201d which Trump takes regularly to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke. Easy bruising in general could have several relatively benign causes, including old age or side effects from medications like blood thinners.",
      "Besides creating spikes in online activity through sites like X, Facebook and TikTok, stories speculating about Trump's health appeared in outlets like The Hill, the New York Post, People, Rolling Stone, Raw Story and Breitbart in recent days, according to NewsWhip.",
      "But outlets like The New York Times, The Associated Press, MSNBC and Fox News Channel did not write about it or discuss it, at least prior to the issue being brought up at Trump's news conference.",
      "On CNN Tuesday morning, anchor Audie Cornish had a short discussion about the topic. \u201cAt one point the term \u2018Trump is dead\u2019 was trending on social media,\" Cornish said. \u201cNot true.\u201d She noted one of Trump's social media posts from Labor Day, when he wrote, \u201cNEVER FELT BETTER IN MY LIFE.\u201d",

      "On the conservative outlet Newsmax, anchor Rick Leventhal read a series of social media messages about the issue. \u201cThe left did not hesitate to take to social media sending ill will the president's way,\u201d he said.",
      "After Trump's 50-minute Oval Office appearance, televised in full on Fox News, network anchor Martha MacCallum laughed at a reference to the issue. \u201cBiden was missing in action for days or weeks,\u201d she said.",
      "Trump sought to make his predecessor's condition an issue both before and after voters returned him to the presidency. In June, Trump ordered an investigation into Biden's use of the autopen for presidential signatures and whether his aides purposely shielded the public from evidence of Biden's physical and mental decline.",
      "In part because of that, former NBC \u201cMeet the Press\u201d anchor Chuck Todd said in a podcast Tuesday that Trump and his team had only themselves to blame for the way the president's health became an issue. \u201cI do think they're susceptible to a feeding frenzy,\u201d he said.",
      "Beyond punditry, however, news outlets face serious questions about how to handle the story, much like they did with Biden. The physical signs that have been pointed out online should trigger serious probes into the president's health. Some critics, like historian Garrett Graff, said it was puzzling that many in the media hadn't treated it like a news story \u2014 although the timing over a holiday weekend surely made it more challenging.",
      "\u201cEvidence-based assessments of a president's health are absolutely fair game,\u201d said Bill Grueskin, a Columbia University journalism professor. That could include observations like the president's bruising or falling asleep at meetings, and analyses of what drugs the president is taking and why.",
      "\u201cSimilarly, radio silence from a prominent office holder, especially one who appears on media frequently, is a valuable thing for journalists to report,\u201d Grueskin said. \u201cI don't think that news organizations need to publish those \u2018everyone is talking about XYZ on social media, so we need to repeat it\u2019 stories.\u201d",
      "The issue of press coverage of Biden's health was widely discussed last year, and renewed again this spring with the publication of \u201cOriginal Sin: President Biden\u2019s Decline, Its Cover-up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again\u201d by journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson.",
      "Given all that, Graff wrote in a Substack post that \u201cyou'd think reporters would be falling all over themselves to dig deeper right now. Clearly, there's enough smoke to warrant at least a major story in a major outlet investigating whether there is fire.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court has ruled in favor of the Trump administration's effort to freeze billions in funds for nonprofits running a \"green bank\" for climate-friendly projects",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration was handed a win by a federal appeals court on Tuesday in its effort to freeze billions of dollars and terminate contracts for nonprofits to run a \u201cgreen bank\u201d aimed at financing climate-friendly projects.",
      "The head of the Environmental Protection Agency had blasted the Biden-era program as a waste of taxpayer money, tried to claw back funding that had already been distributed and accused the nonprofits of mismanagement \u2014 misuse accusations that Justice Department lawyers did not back up in court.",
      "The decision by the 2-1 majority on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit finds that federal officials have broad latitude to cancel funds that have been appropriated by Congress without facing allegations in federal district court that they broke the law. A strongly worded dissent said the outcome was a loss not just for the five green bank groups who sued the EPA, but for the authority of Congress to write policy and maintain its traditional power of the purse.",
      "In an opinion written by Judge Neomi Rao, the appeals court said the dispute should be heard in a federal claims court that considers contract disputes. Rao was appointed by President Donald Trump in his first term.",
      "\u201cIn sum, district courts have no jurisdiction to hear claims that the federal government terminated a grant agreement arbitrarily or with impunity. Claims of arbitrary grant termination are essentially contractual,\u201d Rao wrote in a decision supported by Judge Gregory Katsas, also a Trump appointee.",
      "The green bank groups said the federal claims court is limited to awarding possible monetary damages. The groups were seeking an order allowing them immediate access to their funds, which total about $16 billion.",
      "EPA press secretary Brigit Hirsch said in a statement that the decision reaffirmed EPA's \"duty to be an exceptional steward of taxpayer dollars.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic to see reason prevail in the court system,\" she said.",
      "A lower court had previously said the EPA couldn\u2019t support Administrator Lee Zeldin\u2019s accusations of wrongdoing and that the nonprofits should not have their contracts terminated and must have access to certain funding that had been frozen. The majority ruling overturned that decision Tuesday, although the order won\u2019t go into effect immediately to allow for an opportunity to appeal.",
      "The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, commonly referred to as a \u201cgreen bank,\u201d was authorized by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the climate law approved by congressional Democrats. However, its goals run counter to the Trump administration\u2019s opposition to climate-friendly policies and its embrace of fossil fuels such as oil and coal. Zeldin quickly made the bank a target, characterizing the billions in grants as a \u201cgold bar\u201d scheme marred by conflicts of interest and potential fraud.",
      "In terminating the grants, Zeldin cited a conservative journalist\u2019s undercover video made late last year that showed a former EPA employee saying the agency was throwing \u201cgold bars off the Titanic\u201d \u2014 presumably a reference to spending before the end of Biden's term.",
      "In a February interview with Fox News, Zeldin said he suspected the green bank \u201cwas a clear-cut case of waste and abuse\u201d and an example of what he called \u201cself-dealing\u201d among the Biden administration and like-minded groups.",
      "The appeals court said the lower court was too quick to dismiss the EPA's concerns that the program lacked sufficient oversight.",

      "\u201cThe court disregarded the government\u2019s interest in prudent management of the grant programs and the government\u2019s representations that it planned to properly supervise, rather than abandon, the grantmaking process,\u201d Rao wrote.",
      "Climate United Fund and four other groups sued the EPA, Zeldin and Citibank, which held the grant money on behalf of the agency, saying they had illegally denied the groups access to funds awarded last year. They wanted access to those funds again, saying the freeze had paralyzed their work and jeopardized their basic operations.",
      "Climate United CEO Beth Bafford said in a statement Tuesday, \u201cThis is not the end of our road.\u201d",

      "\"Those unprecedented and unfounded actions were part of EPA\u2019s hunt for reasons to shut down the congressionally mandated program and claw back the funding that had already been disbursed to Plaintiffs and committed to infrastructure projects,'' she wrote.",

      "The judge is trying to rein in Google by prohibiting some of the tactics the company deployed to drive traffic to its search engine and other services. The ruling also will pry open some of the prized databases of closely guarded information about search that have provided Google with a seemingly insurmountable advantage.",
      "The handcuffs being slapped on Google will preclude contracts that give its search engine, Gemini AI app, Play Store for Android and virtual assistant an exclusive position on smartphone, personal computers and other devices.",
      "But Mehta stopped short of banning the multi-billion dollar deals that Google has been making for years to lock in its search engine as the default on smartphones, personal computers and other devices. Those deals, involving payments of more than $26 billion annually, were one of the main issues that prompted the judge to conclude Google\u2019s search engine was an illegal monopoly, but he decided banning them in the future would do more harm than good.",
      "The judge also rejected the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s effort to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, concluding it was an unwarranted step that \u201cwould be incredibly messy and highly risky.\u201d",
      "Partially because he is allowing the default deals to continue, Mehta is ordering Google to give its current and would-be rivals access to some of its search engine\u2019s secret sauce \u2014 the data stockpiled from trillions of queries that it used to help improve the quality of its search results. That is a measure that Google had also fiercely opposed, contending it was unfair and would raise privacy and security risk for the billions of people who have posed questions to its search engine \u2014 sometimes delving into sensitive issues.",
      "The Justice Department's antitrust chief, Gail Slater, hailed the decision as a \u201cmajor win for the American people,\u201d even though the agency didn't get everything it sought. \u201cWe are now weighing our options and thinking through whether the ordered relief goes far enough,\u201d Slater wrote in a post.",
      "In its own post, Google framed Mehta's ruling as a vindication of its long-held position that the case never should have been brought. The decision \u201crecognizes how much the industry has changed through the advent of AI, which is giving people so many more ways to find information,\u201d wrote Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs. \u201cThis underlines what we\u2019ve been saying since this case was filed in 2020: Competition is intense and people can easily choose the services they want.\u201d",
      "The Mountain View, California, company has already vowed to appeal the judge\u2019s monopoly findings issued 13 months ago that led to Tuesday's ruling.",

      "Investors seemed to interpret the ruling as a relatively light slap on the wrist for Google, as the stock price of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., surged more than 7% in extended trading. That would translate into a nearly $200 billion increase in Alphabet's market value, if the shares follow a similar trajectory in Wednesday's regular trading session.",
      "Allowing the default search deals to continue is more than just a victory for Google. It\u2019s also a win for Apple, which receives more than $20 billion annually from Google, and other recipients of the payments.",
      "In hearings earlier this year, Apple warned the judge that banning the contracts would deprive the company of money that it funnels into its own innovative research. The Cupertino, California, company also cautioned that the ban could have the unintended consequence of making Google even more powerful by pocketing the money it had been spending on deals while most consumers will still end up flocking to Google\u2019s search engine anyway.",

      "Apple's shares rose 3% in extended trading after the ruling came out.",

      "Chrome would have been a hot commodity had the judge forced Google to put it on the auction block. Perplexity submitted an unsolicited $34.5 billion offer to buy Chrome last month. And during court testimony earlier this year, a ChatGPT executive left no doubt that service\u2019s owner, OpenAI, would be interested in be interested in buying Chrome, too.",
      "But the judge decided forcing Google to open up parts of its search data to rivals such as DuckDuckGo, Bing, and others will offer he best and fairest way to foster more compelling competition. In doing so, Mehta still narrowed the scope of the Justice Department's request and will limit the access to Google's search index and query histories.",
      "While the wrangling over Mehta's ruling continues, Google is facing another potentially debilitating threat in another antitrust case brought by the Justice Department targeting the digital ad empire that was built up around its search engine. After different federal judge in Virginia declared that some of the technology underlying the ad network to be an illegal monopoly earlier this year, the Justice Department plans to make its case for another proposed breakup  in a trial scheduled to begin later this month.",

      "Leaving devices plugged in can result in phantom energy, which is the power consumed by appliances that draw electricity even when they\u2019re turned off or not in use",
      "The lights are off, the house is quiet and nothing seems to be running. But electricity is silently flowing through the plugs in your home. This hidden drain is known as phantom energy.",
      "Also called vampire energy, the wasted electricity comes from leaving devices plugged in when they're not in use. That could range from household items such as phone chargers and microwaves to TVs and gaming consoles.",
      "This wasted electricity accounts for about 5% to 10% of home energy use, depending on factors like the age of the equipment, according to Alexis Abramson, dean of the Columbia Climate School.",
      "\u201cPhantom energy depends on ... what kind of systems you have and how much they\u2019ve improved over time,\u201d said Abramson.",
      "For example, televisions that are connected to the internet and have smart wake features that allow them to interact with phones and other devices can consume up to 40 watts of energy during the hours of the day that the TV would normally be off, according to Matt Malinowski, director of the buildings program at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. That's almost 40 times as much as a regular television.",
      "\u201cThe good news is there have been new, renewed efforts to tackle this,\u201d said Malinowski.",
      "He said advocates and manufacturers have come up with a voluntary agreement seeking to reduce the amount of energy smart televisions use when they're in standby mode.",
      "Phantom energy contributes to climate change because power drawn by unused devices can increase demand for electricity from sources that release planet-warming emissions. Aidan Charron, associate director of Global Earth Day, said that while the amount may seem small when a person looks at their individual utility bill, the environmental toll of phantom energy is significant when multiplied over homes across the country.",
      "\u201cJust take a little step of unplugging the things that you\u2019re not using,\u201d said Charron. \u201cIt will save you money and it\u2019ll save emissions in the long run.\u201d",
      "Some of the main culprits when it comes to draining energy are appliances that are constantly connected to electricity, such as those with a clock.",
      "\u201cDo you really need your microwave to tell you the time, or can you unplug your microwave when you\u2019re not using it?\u201d said Charron.",
      "While unplugging devices may seem burdensome, it significantly contributes to reducing emissions.",
      "Charron recommends starting with small steps like unplugging chargers for phones and other devices once the battery is fully charged. The next step is moving to other appliances such as unplugging an unused lamp.",

Those actions could contribute to reducing U.S. emissions by about 20% per year, which equals about 450 tons (408 metric tons) of carbon dioxide, according to Jonathan Gilligan, a professor of earth and environmental science at Vanderbilt University.",
      "The choices individuals take in their daily lives all add up, Gilligan said, mainly because of how much the U.S. population contributes to direct greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "\u201cThe question becomes, what can we do to try to address this?\u201d said Gilligan. \u201cPhantom power is one part of this.\u201d",
      "The more individuals decrease their footprint, the more likely it is that others will follow, too, and eventually, those actions may turn to societal norms, according to Gilligan, because individuals don\u2019t want to feel like they\u2019re being irresponsible.",

The other, currently called North American Grocery Co., will include brands such as Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles and Lunchables. The official names of the two companies will be released later.",
      "Kraft Heinz said in May that it was conducting a strategic review of the company, signaling a potential split.",
      "The company in 2015 wanted to capitalize on its massive scale, but shifting tastes complicated those plans, with households seeking to introduce healthier options at the table. Kraft Heinz and other food producers have shifted offerings to follow that trend.",
      "\u201cKraft Heinz\u2019s brands are iconic and beloved, but the complexity of our current structure makes it challenging to allocate capital effectively, prioritize initiatives and drive scale in our most promising areas,\u201d Executive Chair Miguel Patricio said in a statement.",
      "The path to the merger of Kraft and Heinz began in 2013, when billionaire investor Warren Buffett teamed up with Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital to buy H.J. Heinz Co. At the time, the $23 billion deal was the most expensive ever in the food industry.",
      "3G was also behind the formation of Restaurant Brands International \u2014 a merger of Burger King, Tim Hortons and Popeyes \u2014 and Anheuser-Busch InBev.

      "Families that lost loved ones in two crashes of Boeing 737 Max jetliners may be getting their last chance to demand the American aerospace company\u2019s criminal prosecution",
      "Families who lost loved ones in two crashes of Boeing 737 Max jetliners may get their last chance to demand the company face criminal prosecution Wednesday. That's when a federal judge in Texas is set to hear arguments on a U.S. government motion to dismiss a felony charge against Boeing.",
      "U.S. prosecutors charged Boeing with conspiracy to commit fraud in connection with the crashes that killed 346 people off the coast of Indonesia and in Ethiopia. Federal prosecutors alleged Boeing deceived government regulators about a flight-control system that was later implicated in the fatal flights, which took place less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019.",
      "Boeing decided to plead guilty instead of going to trial, but U.S. District Chief Judge Reed O\u2019Connor rejected the aircraft maker's plea agreement in December. O'Connor, who also will consider whether to let prosecutors dismiss the conspiracy charge, objected to diversity, equity and inclusion policies potentially influencing the selection of an independent monitor to oversee the company's promised reforms.",
      "Lawyers representing relatives of some of the passengers who died cheered O'Connor's decision, hoping it would further their goal of seeing former Boeing executives prosecuted during a public trial and more severe financial punishment for the company. Instead, the delay worked to Boeing's favor.",
      "The judge\u2019s refusal to accept the agreement meant the company was free to challenge the Justice Department\u2019s rationale for charging Boeing as a corporation. It also meant prosecutors would have to secure a new deal for a guilty plea.",
      "The government and Boeing spent six months renegotiating their plea deal. During that time, President Donald Trump returned to office and ordered an end to the diversity initiatives that gave O\u2019Connor pause.",
      "By the time the Justice Department\u2019s criminal fraud section briefed the judge in late May, the charge and the plea were off the table. A non-prosecution agreement the two sides struck said the government would dismiss the charge in exchange for Boeing paying or investing another $1.1 billion in fines, compensation for the crash victims' families, and internal safety and quality measures.",
      "The Justice Department said it offered Boeing those terms in light of \u201csignificant changes\u201d Boeing made to its quality control and anti-fraud programs since entering into the July 2024 plea deal.",
      "The department also said it thought that persuading a jury to punish the company with a criminal conviction would be risky, while the revised agreement ensures \"meaningful accountability, delivers substantial and immediate public benefits, and brings finality to a difficult and complex case whose outcome would otherwise be uncertain.\u201d",
      "Judge O'Connor has invited some of the families to address the court on Wednesday. One of the people who plans to speak is Catherine Berthet, whose daughter, Camille Geoffrey, died at age 28 when a 737 Max crashed shortly after takeoff from Ethiopia's Addis Ababa Bole International Airport.",
      "Berthet, who lives in France, is part of a group of about 30 families who want the judge to deny the government's request and to appoint a special prosecutor to take over the case.",
      "\u201cWhile it is no surprise that Boeing is trying to buy everyone off, the fact that the DOJ, which had a guilty plea in its hands last year, has now decided not to prosecute Boeing regardless of the judge\u2019s decision is a denial of justice, a total disregard for the victims and, above all, a disregard for the judge,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "Justice Department lawyers maintain the families of 110 crash victims either support a pre-trial resolution or do not oppose the non-prosecution agreement. The department's lawyers also dispute whether O'Connor has authority to deny the motion without finding prosecutors acted in bad faith instead of the public interest.",

      "The case revolves around a new software system Boeing developed for the Max. In the 2018 and 2019 crashes, the software pitched the nose of the plane down repeatedly based on faulty readings from a single sensor, and pilots flying then-new planes for Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines were unable to regain control.",

      "TOKYO -- The former chief executive of Japanese beverage giant Suntory acknowledged he was investigated on suspicion of possessing an illegal drug but asserted his innocence despite resigning from his position.",
      "\u201cI have not broken the law. I believe I am innocent,\u201d Takeshi Niinami told reporters Wednesday.",
      "Suntory Holdings President Nobuhiro Torii, a member of the company\u2019s founding family, held a news conference Tuesday to announce Niinami had resigned. Torii declined to give many details, saying the case was still under investigation. Police in Fukuoka, southwestern Japan, confirmed Niinami was being investigated in a possible drug case without giving further details.",
      "Niinami said Wednesday the case involved a health supplement he called \u201ca CBD supplement\u201d that was made in the U.S. and recommended by a friend who sent it to him by mail. CBD stands for \u201ccannabidiol\u201d and contains a component of marijuana.",
      "Niinami assumed the supplement was \u201clegal 100%\u201d and he wanted to try the product, which was cheaper than versions sold in Japan, to help relieve jet lag from overseas trips. He was traveling when the package arrived and he did not receive it, he said.",
      "\u201cI want to apologize to society,\u201d Niinami, 66, said after bowing deeply. He noted Suntory makes supplements in addition to whisky, beer and non-alcoholic beverages, so his actions showed carelessness.",
      "Niinami is credited with guiding strong growth at Suntory, founded in 1899, including its overseas expansion such as the acquisition of Beam Inc. for $16 billion a decade ago. That deal included iconic brands such as Jim Beam Bourbon, Sauza Tequila and Canadian Club Whisky and helped make Suntory a well-known alcoholic brand in the U.S.",

    "story": [
      "Nonprofits are increasingly using storytelling to connect with donors",
      "MIAMI -- Cindy Eggleton has always believed in the power of a story.",
      "But the CEO and co-founder of Brilliant Cities, a Detroit-based early childhood development nonprofit that supports learning in underserved communities, never expected someone to tell hers. And definitely not in a sleek documentary with a slick soundtrack and plenty of images of other Detroit institutions, such as General Motors, Diana Ross, and the historic Fox Theatre.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s never been about me,\u201d said Eggleton, adding that participating in the \u201cNevertheless: The Women Changing the World\u201d documentary series on YouTube was her way of honoring her late mother, Geraldine, who inspired her to speak out and help others in their community.",
      "However, as they face an increasingly uncertain funding landscape, nonprofits are focusing more on storytelling in outreach to donors \u2013 both big and small \u2013 and raising production values for videos and podcasts.",
      "\u201cStorytelling is how we\u2019re able to draw people in and get them to connect to a deeper truth about themselves or about the world or a problem that needs to be solved,\u201d said Elevate Prize Foundation CEO Carolina Jayaram Garcia. \u201cIt\u2019s connecting those issues back to you as a human and not saying, \u2018Well, that\u2019s their problem. That\u2019s all the way over there.\u2019 The story allows it to be human.\u201d",
      "The foundation launched the production house Elevate Studios earlier this year to tell more of those stories, Jayaram Garcia said. \u201cNevertheless: The Women Changing the World,\u201d Elevate Studios\u2019 first series, has already generated more than 3 million views on YouTube and will debut its second season in the summer of 2026.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been incredible to see the growth we\u2019ve had on YouTube and how it\u2019s resonated so quickly with so many people,\u201d Jayaram Garcia said. \u201cWe know we\u2019re on to something here.\u201d",
      "Philanthropic support of storytelling has been ongoing for decades, mostly through donors funding documentary projects. Open Society Foundations created the Soros Documentary Fund in 1996 before the Sundance Institute took it over in 2002, with the George Soros-backed nonprofit\u2019s continued monetary support. The Ford Foundation formalized its funding plans in 2011, creating its JustFilms program that still supports 25-30 documentary films annually. Earlier this month, Firelight Media, a New York-based nonprofit supporting documentary filmmakers of color, launched the Firelight Fund, which will offer directors $50,000 grants for their projects.",
      "But Lance Gould, founder and CEO of media strategy firm Brooklyn Story Lab, says what Elevate Prize Foundation and others are doing is different. He says it reflects both technological improvements that have lowered the cost of documentary storytelling and the rise of social media, which allows nonprofits to interact with donors directly.",
      "\u201cBeing able to tell your story well is paramount,\u201d said Gould, whose firm works with nonprofits to help them produce their own story-driven content. \u201cBut storytelling is not only about reaching viewers, it\u2019s also about having the right message for the right viewers.\u201d",
      "He suggests that nonprofits connect their work to larger initiatives like the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals \u2014 an ambitious list of 17 efforts from eliminating extreme poverty and hunger to guaranteeing every child a quality secondary education by 2030 \u2014 to attract more attention and support.",
      "Gould, who was previously executive editor of The Huffington Post and editor in chief of The Boston Phoenix, said \u201ceveryone can be their own media company at this point.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s a point Nicole Bronzan, vice president of communications and content for the Council on Foundations, hopes is not lost in the push for more storytelling.",

      "In a Council on Foundations report released last year, \u201c A New Voice for Philanthropy: How Deeper Stories and Clearer Language Can Build Trust,\u201d researchers, including Bronzan, reported that people had positive attitudes toward foundations, but most didn\u2019t really understand how foundations worked. Bronzan said stories that provide more transparency about how donations are used and how those decisions are made help connect people to a nonprofit and its work.",

      "So far, that has been the case for Brilliant Cities, which saw an increase in donations after Eggleton\u2019s episode debuted on YouTube.",
      "\u201cWe have a funder who wants to increase his gift from $7,000 to $100,000,\u201d said Eggleton, whose nonprofit turns a neighborhood\u2019s vacant homes into community centers with family services ranging from tutoring to mental health support groups. She said new donors have also reached out. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of incredible.\u201d",
      "Though Brilliant Cities doesn\u2019t rely on federal funding for its services, Eggleton said government aid cuts have made a tough funding environment even tougher because the competition for non-governmental donations becomes even tougher.",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s being told what\u2019s being taken away,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are pulling at grant officers and individuals with stock market gains. I think it\u2019s more than the funding, though. I think it\u2019s about really recognizing how the world already feels so disconnected and now feels even more so.\u201d",
      "Storytelling, Eggleton said, helps reduce that. By focusing on female changemakers, Elevate Studios makes an even stronger point, she said, adding she\u2019s been quoting Spanish poet Antonio Machado \u2014 \u201cThere is no path/We make the path by walking\u201d \u2014 as she explains the power of the series.",
      "\u201cThis is the time that we really do need to figure out how we build empathy through stories and not necessarily saying, \u2018You\u2019re wrong or you\u2019re right,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just show the world what can be and what should be.\u201d",

      "A hearing in Texas could be the final chance for families of Boeing 737 Max crash victims to demand criminal prosecution of the company",
      "DALLAS -- A hearing set for Wednesday in federal court in Texas could provide families of the victims killed in two crashes of Boeing 737 Max jetliners with their final opportunity to demand that the company face criminal prosecution.",
      "U.S. District Chief Judge Reed O'Connor will hear arguments on a motion by the federal government to dismiss a felony fraud charge against Boeing in connection with the crashes that killed 346 people off the coast of Indonesia and in Ethiopia. In exchange, Boeing said it would pay or invest another $1.1 billion in fines, compensation for the crash victims\u2019 families, and internal safety and quality measures.",
      "Prosecutors have said that Boeing deceived government regulators about a flight-control system that was later implicated in the fatal flights, which happened less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019.",
      "The hearing in Fort Worth comes more than four years after the Justice Department first announced it had charged Boeing in January 2021 and reached a $2.5 billion settlement with the aircraft maker. That deal would have protected Boeing from criminal prosecution if it strengthened its ethics and legal compliance programs, but prosecutors revived the charge last year after they said Boeing had violated the agreement.",
      "Boeing decided to plead guilty instead of going to trial, but in December 2024, O\u2019Connor rejected that plea agreement. O'Connor, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, cited concerns he had over how diversity policies both at the federal government and at Boeing could influence the selection of an independent monitor charged with overseeing the company's promised reforms.",
      "Lawyers representing relatives of some of the victims who want a public trial and for the company to receive more severe financial punishment welcomed the judge's decision. But the delay worked in Boeing's favor.",
      "The judge\u2019s refusal to accept the agreement meant the company was free to challenge the Justice Department\u2019s rationale for charging Boeing as a corporation. It also meant prosecutors would have to secure a new deal for a guilty plea, and they spent six months renegotiating with Boeing.",
      "During that time, President Donald Trump returned to office and ordered an end to the diversity initiatives that gave O\u2019Connor pause.",
      "By late May, the two sides struck a new deal that took both the criminal charge and Boeing's guilty plea off the table. The Justice Department said it offered those terms in light of \u201csignificant changes\u201d Boeing has made to its quality control and anti-fraud programs since last summer.",
      "O\u2019Connor has invited some of the families to speak on Wednesday. That includes relatives traveling from France, Ireland and Canada who plan to ask the judge to deny the government\u2019s request and appoint a special prosecutor to take over the case, according to lawyers for the families.",
      "Chris and Clariss Moore of Toronto, whose 24-year-old daughter, Danielle, died when a 737 Max crashed shortly after takeoff from Ethiopia\u2019s Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, said in a statement that the pending agreement would allow Boeing to escape justice.",

The Justice Department has also asked the judge to leave open the possibility of refiling the conspiracy charge if the company does not hold up its end of the deal over the next two years.",
      "The department said it thought that persuading a jury to punish the company with a criminal conviction would be risky, while the new deal ensures \"meaningful accountability, delivers substantial and immediate public benefits, and brings finality to a difficult and complex case whose outcome would otherwise be uncertain.\u201d",
      "While federal judges typically defer to the discretion of prosecutors in such situations, court approval is not automatic.",
      "The yearslong case centers around a software system that Boeing developed for the Max, which began flying in 2017.",
      "In the 2018 and 2019 crashes, that software pitched the nose of the plane down repeatedly based on faulty readings from a single sensor, and pilots flying then-new planes for Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines were unable to regain control. After the Ethiopia crash, the planes were grounded worldwide for 20 months while the company redesigned the software.",
      "Investigators found that Boeing did not inform key Federal Aviation Administration personnel about changes it had made to the software before regulators set pilot training requirements for the Max and certified the airliner for flight.",
      "Acting on the incomplete information, prosecutors said, the FAA approved minimal, computer-based training for Boeing 737 pilots, avoiding the need for flight simulators that would have made it more expensive for airlines to adopt the latest version of the jetliner.",
      "The initial 2021 settlement agreement was on the verge of expiring last year when a panel covering an unused emergency exit blew off a 737 Max during an Alaska Airlines flight over Oregon. No one was seriously injured, but it put Boeing\u2019s safety record under renewed scrutiny.",

      "Under Holness, Jamaica has seen a 43% drop in killings so far this year, marking the most significant decline in decades. The improvement is largely credited to the current administration\u2019s increase in firearm seizures and a stronger, coordinated security force presence across the Caribbean island.",
      "The Jamaica Labor Party is campaigning on this tangible success, positioning itself as the government that pulled the island back from the brink of widespread violence.",
      "While crime statistics have improved, the shadow of Jamaica\u2019s violent past still lingers. The measures taken by the current government, including implementing states of emergency in certain areas, have drawn both support and criticism.",
      "The private sector and many Jamaicans have praised the effectiveness of such measures, with the number of killings dropping by as much as 70% in some regions, like the tourist parish of St. James.",
      "However, human rights organizations have raised concerns about the use and potential abuse of such measures, highlighting alleged illegal detentions, as they call for balanced approaches to protect security and civil liberties.",
      "The Jamaica Labor Party also has emphasized fiscal responsibility, a low unemployment rate and the importance of continuity as it urged voters not to risk reversing the progress achieved so far.",

      "A decline in foreign visitors traveling to the United States has stretched well into the summer",
      "LAS VEGAS -- For a few hopeful weeks this summer, a bright billboard on the major highway linking Toronto to New York greeted Canadian drivers with a simple message: \"Buffalo Loves Canada.\u201d",
      "The marketing campaign, which included a $500 gift card giveaway, was meant to show Buffalo's northern neighbors they were welcome, wanted and missed.",
      "At first, it seemed like it might work, said Patrick Kaler, CEO of the local tourism organization Visit Buffalo Niagara. More than 1,000 people entered the giveaway. But by the end of July, it was clear the city's reliable summer wave of Canadian visitors would not arrive this year.",
      "Buffalo\u2019s struggle reflects a broader downturn in international tourism to the U.S. that travel analysts warn could persist well into the future. From northern border towns to major hot spots like Las Vegas and Los Angeles, popular travel destinations reported hosting fewer foreign visitors this summer.",
      "Experts and some local officials attribute the trend that first emerged in February to President Donald Trump's return to the White House. They say his tariffs, immigration crackdown and repeated jabs about the U.S. acquiring Canada and Greenland alienated travelers from other parts of the world.",
      "\"To see the traffic drop off so significantly, especially because of rhetoric that can be changed, is so disheartening,\u201d Kaler said.",
      "The World Travel & Tourism Council projected ahead of Memorial Day that the U.S. would be the only country among the 184 it studied where foreign visitor spending would fall in 2025. The finding was \u201ca clear indicator that the global appeal of the U.S. is slipping,\u201d the global industry association said.",
      "\u201cThe world\u2019s biggest travel and tourism economy is heading in the wrong direction,\u201d Julia Simpson, the council\u2019s president and CEO, said. \"While other nations are rolling out the welcome mat, the U.S. government is putting up the \u2018closed\u2019 sign.\u201d",
      "Travel research firm Tourism Economics, meanwhile, predicted this month that the U.S. would see 8.2% fewer international arrivals in 2025, an improvement from its earlier forecast of a 9.4% decline but well below the numbers of foreign visitors to the country before the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cThe sentiment drag has proven to be severe,\u201d the firm said, noting that airline bookings indicate \u201cthe sharp inbound travel slowdown\u201d of May, June and July would likely persist in the months ahead.",
      "Deborah Friedland, managing director at the financial services firm Eisner Advisory Group, said he U.S. travel industry faced multiple headwinds \u2014 rising travel costs, political uncertainty and ongoing geopolitical tensions.",
      "Since returning to office, Trump has doubled down on some of the hard-line policies that defined his first term, reviving a travel ban targeting mainly African and Middle Eastern countries, tightening rules around visa approvals and ramping up mass immigration raids. At the same time, the push for tariffs on foreign goods that quickly became a defining feature of his second term gave some citizens elsewhere a sense they were unwanted.",
      "\u201cPerception is reality,\u201d Friedland said.",

About half of attendees each year come from outside the U.S., primarily from Canada and France, she said.",
      "Contest organizers are considering whether to host the annual competition in another country until Trump's presidency ends, Morales said.",

      "Sauce Gardner and Aaron Rodgers are set to face off as opponents on Sunday after being teammates with the New York Jets the past two years",
      "FLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- Sauce Gardner shared a special handshake and plenty of laughs with Aaron Rodgers during their two years as teammates with the New York Jets.",
      "They'll square off as opponents Sunday when Rodgers and the Pittsburgh Steelers come to MetLife Stadium for one of the juiciest storylines in Week 1 of the NFL season.",
      "Just don't expect the Jets to add any extra spice this week when it comes to talking about their former quarterback.",
      "\u201cI don't know,\u201d a smiling Gardner said Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m just preparing like any other game.\u201d",
      "Truth is, it's not quite that simple.",
      "After all, it's not often that one of the greatest passers in league history is cut by a team after two years of Super Bowl aspirations that fizzled miserably \u2014 helped in large part by a season-ending injury four snaps into his debut with his new squad \u2014 and then signs, at 41, with one of the league's most decorated franchises.",
      "And to top it off, Rodgers will take the field for the first time with his new team against his former team.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t care who\u2019s back there,\u201d insisted edge rusher Jermaine Johnson, who's on track to return from a torn Achilles tendon in Week 2 last season. \u201cI've got a job to do for this team. And whoever the quarterback is, I get paid to put him down. So whoever\u2019s back there, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d",
      "Nope, no extra juice.",
      "Oh, but then there's this: Justin Fields \u2014 who ended up replacing Rodgers in New York \u2014 will face the team for which he started last season before hitting the bench after leading the Steelers to a 4-2 start.",
      "\u201cI mean, yeah, the storyline\u2019s crazy,\u201d a smiling Fields acknowledged. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s why the NFL set us up for Week 1, just for that. But, yeah, it\u2019s cool. Cool to kind of see that. And it\u2019s gonna be fun going up against these guys on Sunday.\u201d",
      "All the hype, though, is for outside the Jets' facility.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s no storyline for me,\u201d Fields said. \u201cIt\u2019s ball for me. So, I\u2019ll let you guys kind of handle the storylines, the news lines and stuff like that. In the locker room, we just keep it straight ball.\u201d",
      "Rodgers came to the Jets in 2023 with lots of hype and even greater expectations, as the Jets were labeled Super Bowl contenders. But a torn Achilles tendon sunk New York's season just as it started, and then Rodgers and the Jets struggled to a 5-12 finish last year that ended up costing coach Robert Saleh and general manager Joe Douglas their jobs.",

      "Glenn did call Rodgers \u201ca future Hall of Famer\u201d who is \u201cgoing to cause problems no matter what\u201d when he takes the field. Glenn game-planned against him plenty when he was in Detroit as a defensive coordinator and as an assistant in New Orleans before that.",

Physically, we all start to wane at some point as we get older, but I know at that position, when mentally you are on point, man, he makes it a challenge.",
      "\"On tape, you will continue to see that. When he was here, you see that.\u201d",
      "Gardner, whose handshake with Rodgers during which they pretend to smoke went viral, said it was \u201ca great experience\u201d learning on the practice field from a player with his experience. He also wouldn't be surprised if Rodgers used his departure from the Jets as a little bit of added fuel Sunday.",
      "\u201cI mean, you know, we are human,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cWe use a lot of things as motivation and there\u2019s things every day I use for motivation. I\u2019m sure I could say the same thing. I\u2019m sure there are guys in this locker room that can say the exact same thing, so, you know, that\u2019s just how I feel about that.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhat I\u2019m proudest of is it\u2019s not easy to come off the bench. It really isn\u2019t, and I have never had a layoff that long. It brought new challenges that I wasn\u2019t ready for in so many ways. So I\u2019m very proud that I ... stayed myself. I didn\u2019t try to play another game. I didn\u2019t try to play it safe. I went for it, and that\u2019s who I am. I go for it. When you go for it, good things happen,\u201d Williams said. \u201cPerhaps I didn\u2019t get there this time, but I know who I am, and I know that I can work once I have a little chance.\u201d",
      "She said she wasn't sure of future plans but made it sound as if she plans to play again.",
      "\u201cSeeing Venus playing on court for joy just kind of brought me back as to why I started playing tennis,\u201d said Fernandez, a 22-year-old from Canada who was the 2021 singles runner-up in New York.",

      "Novak Djokovic is 38 and trying to conquer a much younger man\u2019s game as he heads into the U.S. Open semifinals",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Novak Djokovic is 38 and trying to conquer a younger man's game as he heads into the U.S. Open semifinals on Friday. It's been two years since his most recent Grand Slam title, which \u2014 to him \u2014 must feel like an eternity.",
      "Last season was his first without earning at least one since 2017. And Djokovic is clear that, at this point in his career, those big trophies from the sport's four biggest events are all he really cares about.",
      "At this year's three other major tournaments, he exited in the semifinals, two after getting hurt: quitting at the Australian Open because of a torn hamstring and clearly limited at Wimbledon by an injured groin muscle. He hadn't competed anywhere since leaving the All England Club in July until arriving at Flushing Meadows.",
      "Now Djokovic is back in the final four in New York, and there's a daunting road ahead. Next up is No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz, who is 22. Win that, and a final on Sunday against No. 1 Jannik Sinner, 23, could await, if the defending champion beats Lorenzo Musetti in the quarterfinals and whoever his semifinal opponent is.",
      "After reaching a 53rd major semifinal, and 14th at the U.S. Open, by eliminating No. 4 seed Taylor Fritz, 27, in four sets Tuesday night, Djokovic fiddled with his beard while pondering what's to come.",
      "\u201cWell, it\u2019s not going to get easier, I'll tell you that,\u201d he said with a wry smile. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to take one day at a time. Really take care of my body. Try to relax and recover. The next couple of days is really key for me to really get my body in shape and ready to battle five sets, if it\u2019s needed. I just would really love that.\"",
      "Djokovic already owns nearly every record of any significance in men's tennis, including 24 major championships, 37 major final appearances and the most weeks at No. 1 in the rankings.",
      "And so on.",
      "What's new for him is adjusting to contending at this age.",
      "\u201cNormally I like to play the big matches on a big stage. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m not really sure how the body is going to feel in the next few days. But I\u2019m going to do my very best with my team to be fit for that,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of running involved, that\u2019s for sure. It\u2019s not going to be short points.\u201d",
      "He owns a 5-3 head-to-head mark against Alcaraz, who has won five Slam titles already and combined with Sinner to claim the last seven and nine of the past 12.",
      "Not to be forgotten: The other three in that span went to Djokovic, most recently at the 2023 U.S. Open.",

      "Alana, younger than Chelsea by nearly two years at 28, started rugby like many women do, in a mixed team as a kid. Her determination was obvious. First-class debut at 17, Canterbury player of the year at 18, captain at 23.",

      "\u201cSometimes we underestimate how cool this situation is; to be in it at the same time,\u201d Alana told Rugby Pass.",
      "The Feleus were born in France but grew up on the French island of Futuna, between Fiji and Samoa. Their father, a sports teacher, coached them. In 1993, Mana\u00e9 played with France men's international Yoram Moefana in an under-11 tournament on Wallis; she was the scrumhalf, he was the flyhalf. They won.",
      "\u201cOne day (at age 7) I tried it out and it just clicked,\u201d T\u00e9ani told the Six Nations website. \u201cI was free to express myself however I wanted to in rugby. I had more fun. I let off more steam. As soon as I started rugby, I knew it was the sport I wanted to do. I was in it to have fun.\u201d",

      "T\u00e9ani, three years younger at 22, plays with Mana\u00e9 at Grenoble Amazones and moved from France's sevens to 15s in 2024. They both played against Italy on the World Cup\u2019s opening weekend.",
      "Also known as Bella and Ella, the Manusina's youngest players and first twins turn 21 this Sunday. Christabelle is a flanker and Demielle is a lock/flanker. Both played in Samoa's World Cup pool games against Australia and England.",
      "They may have been destined to play for Samoa. Their father, Setu Tuilaepa, represented Samoa in 15s and sevens and was their first coach. Their mother, Beth Onesemo, managed their youth teams and was a Rugby Samoa board member.",
      "Their first big splash was in rugby league, representing New Zealand last year on Australia's Gold Coast in a championship for rising women's talent. Before then, they admitted to googling the rules of rugby league on the car drive to their first game.",
      "Back in rugby union, they made their test debuts in June against Tonga. One of their older sisters, Rialani, debuted for Manusina later that month against Australia A.",
      "\u201cGrowing up, playing rugby, the resources we had were limited,\u201d Christabelle told ABC Australia. \u201cWe didn't get to go to the gym, we just had to train with what we had. Looking how far we've come, (we're) just grateful to be where we are and what we've become.\u201d",
      "Keilamarita and Risaleaana, better known as Risi, are daughters of a Samoan mother, Lealofi, and New Zealand Maori father, Kevin. They moved as kids from Australia to New Zealand.",
      "Risi earned her first-class debut and first national contract at 17, and two years later in 2019 she began playing sevens for New Zealand. She won Olympic gold in Tokyo and Paris. She made her 15s test debut in May at scrumhalf.",
      "Keilamarita, four years older at 29, committed to Samoa early to try and qualify for the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics. Her rugby road hasn\u2019t been as prominent as Risi\u2019s but she answered another call by Samoa in 15s and the outside center played the first two test matches of her career in this World Cup against Australia and England.",
      "After facing Australia in Manchester, Keilamarita made the two-hour drive to York the next day to watch Risi\u2019s own World Cup debut against Spain.

Training with England prop Sarah Bern, England training squad prop Simi Pam and Wales loosehead prop Gwenllian Pyrs elevated her game.",

      "Manu'a told Faitala first. They're not just sisters but best friends who lift each other and ground each other. They've shared the same rugby path for years, starting with impromptu dad-supervised games with their brothers in a park near their old Penrith home.",

      "What makes the head-shaking feat of two sets of sisters in one squad even more amazing is that they all come from the same club.",
      "Nant Conwy lies in a valley on the edge of Eryri National Park, Wales' mountain region in the north. The club was formed only in 1980. All four women started in mixed teams and moved into girls' sides at age 12.",
      "\u201c(The club) have always been so supportive of us, they've been a massive part of all four of our journeys,\u201d Nel said.",
      "Loosehead prop Gwenllian was the senior among them; she's appearing at her third World Cup at 27. Sister Alaw, a 19-year-old lock, joined her as a Wales international last September.",
      "Nel, a wing/fullback, was picked by Wales in 2023. She's 20, two years older than Branwen, who captained Wales in the Under-20 Six Nations this year. The back-rower received her first senior cap off the bench last Saturday against Canada.",
      "\u201cWords can't even describe how proud I am,\u201d Nel said. \u201cI've watched her work so hard, coming back from an ACL injury not too long ago. She fully deserves to be here.\u201d",

      "Carlos Alcaraz finger-wagged the crowd, beat Jiri Lehecka to the net and cruised his way into the semifinals at the U.S. Open",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Carlos Alcaraz finger-wagged the crowd, beat Jiri Lehecka to the net and cruised into the semifinals at the U.S. Open.",
      "The second-seeded Spaniard beat Lehecka 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 in the quarterfinals on Tuesday, making some highlight-reel shots and putting his hand to his ear afterward to encourage more cheers from fans at Arthur Ashe Stadium. It's his first hard-court semifinal appearance at a major since winning his first Grand Slam title at the U.S. Open in 2023.",
      "\u201cI kind of met the Grand Slam version of Carlos,\u201d Lehecka said. \u201cHe just showed that he is one of the contenders, for sure. Everyone knew that, and he proved that.\u201d",
      "Alcaraz is just 22 years old and is in the semifinals at a major for the ninth time. Only Rafael Nadal with 10 has more before turning 23.",
      "Next up for Alcaraz is Novak Djokovic, the 24-time Grand Slam champion who knocked him out of the Australian Open quarterfinals in January and beat him for the gold medal at the Paris Olympics last year.",
      "Djokovic got past Taylor Fritz 6-3, 7-5, 3-6, 6-4 at night.",
      "Alcaraz would supplant Jannik Sinner \u2014 whom he lost to in the Wimbledon final and beat in the French Open final \u2014 atop the rankings if he wins the U.S. Open for a second time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult not to think about it,\u201d Alcaraz said. \u201cEvery time that I step on the court, I am trying not to think about it. If I think about the No. 1 spot too much, I think I\u2019m going to put pressure on myself and I just don\u2019t want to do that. I just want to step on the court, try to do my things, try to follow my goals in the match and try to enjoy as much as I can. The No. 1 is there, but I\u2019m trying not to think so much about it.\u201d",
      "Before facing Fritz or Djokovic on Friday night, Alcaraz plans to play golf Wednesday with 2017 Masters champion Sergio Garcia. He thinks his countryman owes him more than a few strokes.",
      "\u201cHe has to give me at least between 10 and 15 shots,\u201d Alcaraz said. \u201cIt's going to be great. I'm not that good, Sergio, come on.\u201d",
      "On the women's side, Jessica Pegula broke through her quarterfinal wall again at the U.S. Open, defeating Barbora Krejcikova 6-3, 6-3 to get to the semifinals at a Grand Slam tournament for just the second time in her career.",
      "She failed to advance into the semis in her first 22 main draw appearances at a major before reaching the final at Flushing Meadows a year ago, when she lost to Aryna Sabalenka. They'll meet again in the semifinals on Thursday after Sabalenka advanced in a walkover when Marketa Vondrousova withdrew because of injury.",
      "\u201cMy biggest accomplishment last year was just getting past the quarterfinals,\u201d Pegula said. \u201cNow I can say I\u2019ve done it twice.\u201d",

      "Pegula, 31, is seeded fourth at the U.S. Open and aiming for her first Grand Slam championship. She and No. 8 Amanda Anisimova are the only Americans left in the women's singles field.",
      "Krejcikova knocked out one of them, Taylor Townsend, who failed to convert eight match points when they met in the quarterfinals on Sunday. Pegula was not perfect, but she played well enough to stay in control at all times and broke Krejcikova one final time to end the match in under 90 minutes \u2014 on her first match point attempt.",
      "\u201cShe had a couple really good returns when I was serving at 4-1,\" Pegula said. \u201cWe all saw what she did against Taylor, so I was happy that we\u2019re done.\u201d",
      "Venus Williams and Leylah Fernandez lost to the top-seeded pair of Townsend and Katerina Siniakova 6-1, 6-2 in the women's doubles quarterfinals, ending the 45-year-old Williams' first Grand Slam tournament in two years.",
      "Felix Auger-Aliassime of Canada and Alex de Minaur of Australia kick things off on Ashe, followed by Anisimova against second-seeded Iga Swiatek.

      "Devers hammered a sweeper over the right field wall and then Freeland took exception with Devers' celebration, shouting at him as he neared first base.",

    "story": [
      "The NFL has introduced several rule changes for the new season, including making last year's experimental kickoff permanent with some tweaks",
      "A new NFL season is set to begin with last year's experiment on the new kickoff becoming permanent with a new tweak and several other changes in rules and officiating.",
      "The league also will implement changes to the overtime rule for the regular season, expand replay assist, crack down on bad sportsmanship and use Hawk-Eye virtual measuring to replace the old-time chains to determine first downs.",
      "The league experimented with the so-called dynamic kickoff in 2024 in hopes of more returns while also making the play safer. Owners voted in April to make the change permanent while moving touchbacks on kicks that reach the end zone on the fly from the 30 to the 35, which is expected to lead to more kicks in play and more returns.",
      "There was no change in the tush push play that Philadelphia used so successfully on the way to winning the Super Bowl last season.",
      "Here\u2019s an explanation of some of the new rules that will be in place.",
      "The league was mostly pleased with the experimental kickoff put in place for 2024 that led to the rate of kickoff returns increasing from a record-low 21.8% in 2023 to 32.8% last season, while reducing the rate of injuries on what had been the game\u2019s most dangerous play.",
      "The rule made kickoffs more like scrimmage plays by placing the coverage players and blockers close together to eliminate the high-speed collisions that had contributed to so many injuries on the play. The league said the rate of concussions dropped 43% on returns, with a significant reduction as well in lower-body injuries.",
      "The problem last season was many teams still opted to kick the ball in the end zone because the touchback wasn\u2019t punitive enough. The average starting field position on a touchback was only 2.4 yards further than the average starting position after returns, which was the 27.6-yard line.",
      "By moving the touchback to the 35, the league projects that the return rate will rise to somewhere between 60% and 70%, with a similar increase in long returns, adding more excitement to the game.",
      "The league also approved a small tweak to how blockers on the return team are allowed to line up in the setup zone that could lead to longer returns.",
      "Teams returned just over 76% of kicks in the preseason, up from 70% in the 2024 preseason. But that number typically drops in the regular season when teams don't use kickoffs to evaluate players for spots at the end of the roster.",
      "Teams will still need to declare their intention to try an onside kick because of the different formation. But a new change will allow trailing teams to try one before the start of the fourth quarter after Kansas City had to kick deep while down 28 points in the final minute of the third quarter in the Super Bowl.",
      "Coverage players will also be allowed to line up one yard closer in hopes of increasing the rate of recovery from about 6% over the past three seasons to at least 10%.",
      "The league approved a proposal to make the regular season overtime more like the postseason, with both teams getting a chance at a possession, even if the team that gets the ball first scores a touchdown.",
      "The NFL added regular season overtime in 1974, adding a 15-minute sudden death period that ended on any score. In 2010, the rule was tweaked to a modified sudden death that required an opening possession touchdown to immediately end the game instead of only a field goal. That was in effect in both the regular season and the playoffs.",
      "Overtime then was shortened for the regular season to only 10 minutes in 2017. A rule change in 2022 for the playoffs only gave both teams the chance to score even with a touchdown on the opening possession.",

      "8 minutes ago",
      "Now that will be the case in the regular season, after the improved field position on kickoffs made winning in OT on an opening possession TD easier.",
      "According to Sportradar, six of the 16 overtime games last season ended on an opening-drive TD for the most overtime games ended on the first drive since the rule change went into effect in 2010.",
      "In all, teams that won the overtime toss won 75% of the time last season, according to Sportradar, and have a .606 winning percentage in overtime since it was cut to 10 minutes.",
      "The league kept the 10-minute overtime period instead of expanding it back to 15 minutes like was originally proposed by Philadelphia, which could lead to teams opting to go for 2 and a win if they match an opening-drive TD with one of their own since there might not be time for another possession.",
      "The NFL expanded its replay assist system to overturn objective calls if there was \u201cclear and obvious\u201d evidence that a foul didn\u2019t occur. The calls could include facemask penalties, whether there was forcible contact to the head or neck area, horse-collar tackles and tripping. Replay also would be able to overturn a roughing-the-kicker or running-into-the-kicker penalty if video showed the defender made contact with the ball.",
      "The league has been using replay assist in recent years to overturn obvious errors on aspects like whether a pass is caught or where the ball should be spotted without the referee needing to stop the game for a review.",
      "The Competition Committee says there\u2019s no interest in allowing replay assists to call penalties on plays missed by officials on the field.",
      "Referees will no longer use the chains to determine first downs, opting instead for a virtual measuring system. This won\u2019t eliminate the officials who manually spot the ball and use chains to mark the line to gain.",
      "The Hawk-Eye system consists of six 8K cameras for optical tracking of the position of the ball with the result shown on stadium scoreboards. The league estimates that measurements will take about 30 seconds \u2014 about 40 seconds fewer than the average with the chains \u2014 although it took longer at times in the preseason.",
      "The league is also emphasizing sportsmanship and cracking down on violent and sexually suggestive gestures this season.",
      "In April, the NFL expanded prohibited acts to include banning the \u201cnose wipe\u201d gesture that league executive Troy Vincent said is affiliated with gangs.",
      "The unsportsmanlike conduct rule now states: \u201cany violent gesture, which shall include but not be limited to a throat slash, simulating firing or brandishing a gun, or using the \u2018nose wipe\u2019 gesture, or an act that is sexually suggestive or offensive.\"",

      "A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a shake-up of Google\u2019s search engine in an attempt to curb the corrosive power of an illegal monopoly while rebuffing the U.S. government\u2019s attempt to break up the company and impose other restraints",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a shake-up of Google\u2019s search engine in an attempt to curb the corrosive power of an illegal monopoly while rebuffing the U.S. government's attempt to break up the company and impose other restraints.",
      "The 226-page decision made by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington, D.C., will likely ripple across the technological landscape at a time when the industry is being reshaped by breakthroughs in artificial intelligence \u2014 including conversational \u201canswer engines\u201d as companies like ChatGPT and Perplexity try to upend Google\u2019s long-held position as the internet\u2019s main gateway.",
      "The innovations and competition being unleashed by AI also reshaped the judge\u2019s approach to the remedies in the nearly five-year-old antitrust case brought by the U.S. Justice Department during President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration and carried onward by President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "\u201cUnlike the typical case where the court\u2019s job is to resolve a dispute based on historic facts, here the court is asked to gaze into a crystal ball and look to the future. Not exactly a judge\u2019s forte,\u201d Mehta wrote.",
      "The judge is trying to rein in Google by prohibiting some of the tactics the company deployed to drive traffic to its search engine and other services. The ruling also will pry open some of the prized databases of closely guarded information about search that have provided Google with a seemingly insurmountable advantage.",
      "The handcuffs being slapped on Google will preclude contracts that give its search engine, Gemini AI app, Play Store for Android and virtual assistant an exclusive position on smartphone, personal computers and other devices.",
      "But Mehta stopped short of banning the multi-billion dollar deals that Google has been making for years to lock in its search engine as the default on smartphones, personal computers and other devices. Those deals, involving payments of more than $26 billion annually, were one of the main issues that prompted the judge to conclude Google\u2019s search engine was an illegal monopoly, but he decided banning them in the future would do more harm than good.",
      "The judge also rejected the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s effort to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, concluding it was an unwarranted step that \u201cwould be incredibly messy and highly risky.\u201d",
      "Partially because he is allowing the default deals to continue, Mehta is ordering Google to give its current and would-be rivals access to some of its search engine\u2019s secret sauce \u2014 the data stockpiled from trillions of queries that it used to help improve the quality of its search results. That is a measure that Google had also fiercely opposed, contending it was unfair and would raise privacy and security risk for the billions of people who have posed questions to its search engine \u2014 sometimes delving into sensitive issues.",
      "The Justice Department's antitrust chief, Gail Slater, hailed the decision as a \u201cmajor win for the American people,\u201d even though the agency didn't get everything it sought. \u201cWe are now weighing our options and thinking through whether the ordered relief goes far enough,\u201d Slater wrote in a post.",
      "In its own post, Google framed Mehta's ruling as a vindication of its long-held position that the case never should have been brought. The decision \u201crecognizes how much the industry has changed through the advent of AI, which is giving people so many more ways to find information,\u201d wrote Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs. \u201cThis underlines what we\u2019ve been saying since this case was filed in 2020: Competition is intense and people can easily choose the services they want.\u201d",
      "The Mountain View, California, company has already vowed to appeal the judge\u2019s monopoly findings issued 13 months ago that led to Tuesday's ruling.",

      "Investors seemed to interpret the ruling as a relatively light slap on the wrist for Google, as the stock price of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., surged more than 7% in extended trading. That would translate into a nearly $200 billion increase in Alphabet's market value, if the shares follow a similar trajectory in Wednesday's regular trading session.",
      "Allowing the default search deals to continue is more than just a victory for Google. It\u2019s also a win for Apple, which receives more than $20 billion annually from Google, and other recipients of the payments.",
      "In hearings earlier this year, Apple warned the judge that banning the contracts would deprive the company of money that it funnels into its own innovative research. The Cupertino, California, company also cautioned that the ban could have the unintended consequence of making Google even more powerful by pocketing the money it had been spending on deals while most consumers will still end up flocking to Google\u2019s search engine anyway.",
      "Others, such as the owners of the Firefox search engine, asserted that losing the Google contracts would threaten their future survival by depriving them of essential revenue.",
      "Apple's shares rose 3% in extended trading after the ruling came out.",
      "Mehta refrained from ordering a sale of Chrome because he decided there wasn't adequate proof the browser served as an essential ingredient in Google's search monopoly, making a divestiture \u201ca poor fit for this case.\u201d",
      "Chrome would have been a hot commodity had the judge forced Google to put it on the auction block. Perplexity submitted an unsolicited $34.5 billion offer to buy Chrome last month. And during court testimony earlier this year, a ChatGPT executive left no doubt that service\u2019s owner, OpenAI, would be interested in be interested in buying Chrome, too.",
      "But the judge decided forcing Google to open up parts of its search data to rivals such as DuckDuckGo, Bing, and others will offer he best and fairest way to foster more compelling competition. In doing so, Mehta still narrowed the scope of the Justice Department's request and will limit the access to Google's search index and query histories.",
      "While the wrangling over Mehta's ruling continues, Google is facing another potentially debilitating threat in another antitrust case brought by the Justice Department targeting the digital ad empire that was built up around its search engine. After different federal judge in Virginia declared that some of the technology underlying the ad network to be an illegal monopoly earlier this year, the Justice Department plans to make its case for another proposed breakup  in a trial scheduled to begin later this month.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Scientists revealed Wednesday that Mars\u2019 innermost core appears to be a solid hunk of metal just like Earth\u2019s.",
      "The Chinese-led research team based their findings on seismic readings from NASA\u2019s InSight lander on Mars, which recorded more than 1,300 marsquakes before shutting down in 2022. The spacecraft landed on a broad plain near Mars\u2019 equator in 2018.",
      "Previous studies pointed to liquid at the heart of the red planet. The latest findings indicate the inner core, while small, is indeed solid and surrounded by molten metal \u2014 a liquid outer core.",
      "The Martian inner core extends from the planet\u2019s center out to a radius of approximately 380 miles (613 kilometers), according to the scientists whose findings appeared in the journal Nature.",
      "It\u2019s likely composed of iron and nickel, the same ingredients as Earth\u2019s core, but quite possibly also enriched with lighter elements like oxygen.",
      "Mars\u2019 liquid outer core is bigger, stretching from 380 miles (613 kilometers) to as much as 1,100 miles (1,800 kilometers) from the planet\u2019s center.",
      "Crystallization of Mars\u2019 inner core may have occurred in the past and still be occurring today, one of the lead investigators, Daoyuan Sun of the University of Science and Technology of China, said in an email.",

      "For their study, Sun and his team relied primarily on 23 marsquakes recorded by InSight, all of them relatively weak. The epicenters were 740 miles to 1,465 miles (1,200 kilometers to 2,360 kilometers) away from the lander.",

    "story": [
      "Bulgarian authorities aren't investigating a suspected Russian interference operation involving a plane carrying European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen because they say the interference is now common",
      "LONDON -- Bulgaria will not investigate suspected Russian electronic interference with a top European official's plane, officials said Monday \u2014 because this kind of GPS jamming is now so common.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was flying to Plovdiv, Bulgaria on Sunday when her plane was hit by GPS jamming. It landed safely but the disruption was the latest in a string of almost 80 incidents tracked by The Associated Press and blamed on Russia by Western officials since Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022.",
      "This year, Nordic and Baltic nations \u2014 including Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia \u2014 have repeatedly warned about greater electronic interference from Russia disrupting communications with planes, ships and drones.",
      "While Russian authorities suggest the jamming is defensive \u2014 to protect key cities and military infrastructure from Ukrainian drone attacks \u2014 Baltic officials say the depth of electronic interference has increased, causing navigation failures far from Russia's borders.",
      "In 2024, a plane carrying the British defense secretary had its satellite signal jammed as it flew near Russian territory, while a Finnish airline temporarily suspended flights to the Estonian city of Tartu.",
      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said the interference experienced by von der Leyen's plane was part of a complex campaign by Russia against Europe which could have \u201cpotentially disastrous effects.\u201d",
      "Satellite communications systems \u2014 known collectively as the Global Navigation Satellite System or GNSS \u2014 receive precise time signals from satellites around 20,000 kilometers (12,400 miles) away in space. A smartphone, car, marine or aircraft navigation system compares how long it takes to receive signals from several different satellites to calculate an exact location.",
      "But the signals can be interfered with \u2014 commonly known as jamming or spoofing.",
      "Jamming means a receiver is overwhelmed by a strong radio signal transmitted in the same range where GNSS and other satellite navigation signals operate, leaving the receiver unable to fix a location or time. Spoofing involves transmitting fake signals which imitate a real GNSS satellite signal \u2014 commonly known as GPS \u2014 to mislead a phone, ship or aircraft into thinking it is in a different place.",
      "In a military context, jamming could be used to stop an incoming missile or drone attack, whereas the idea behind spoofing is to \u201ccreate deception,\u201d said Thomas Withington, an expert in electronic warfare at the Royal United Services Institute in London.",
      "It's possible that Israel used spoofing technology to fly into Iranian airspace in June, when it killed top generals and struck nuclear sites, Withington suggested. Spoofing, he said, could have helped Israel deceive Iranian radar.",
      "Long before the invasion of Ukraine, Russian authorities deployed spoofing technology around the Kremlin in Moscow, causing chaos for taxi drivers or other motorists using GPS.",
      "Russia \u201cdoes not mind\u201d if its own infrastructure is affected, as long as enemy activity is deterred, said Withington.",
      "In August, Latvia\u2019s Electronic Communications Office said it had identified at least three hot spots for electronic interference along borders with Russia in the Kaliningrad, Leningrad and Pskov regions. All three regions host important Russian military bases.",
      "In April 2024, Finland's national carrier Finnair temporarily suspended flights to Tartu, Estonia after it said two of its planes were prevented from landing because of GPS disruptions. At that time, Tartu airport required approaching planes to use GPS to land, although planes have \u2014 and use \u2014 other forms of navigation.",
      "These include radio navigation and Inertial Navigation Systems, which determine where an aircraft \u2014 or submarine \u2014 is located by measuring its position in the air or water without relying on GPS.",

      "While countries along Russia's border appear to have largely mitigated the impact of Russian jamming in the air, there is potential for a serious incident at sea.",

      "Oliver McCann, a British AI music creator, uses AI to produce songs across various genres",
      "LONDON -- When pop groups and rock bands practice or perform, they rely on their guitars, keyboards and drumsticks to make music. Oliver McCann, a British AI music creator who goes by the stage name imoliver, fires up his chatbot.",
      "McCann's songs span a range of genres, from indie-pop to electro-soul to country-rap. There\u2019s just one crucial difference between McCann and traditional musicians.",
      "\u201cI have no musical talent at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t sing, I can\u2019t play instruments, and I have no musical background at all.\"",
      "McCann, 37, who has a background as a visual designer, started experimenting with AI to see if it could boost his creativity and \"bring some of my lyrics to life.\u201d Last month, he signed with independent record label Hallwood Media after one of his tracks racked up 3 million streams, in what's billed as the first time a music label has inked a contract with an AI music creator.",
      "McCann is an example of how ChatGPT-style AI song generation tools like Suno and Udio have spawned a wave of synthetic music. A movement most notably highlighted by a fictitious group, Velvet Sundown, that went viral even though all its songs, lyrics and album art were created by AI.",
      "It fueled debate about AI's role in music while raising fears about \"AI slop\" \u2014 automatically generated low quality mass produced content. It also cast a spotlight on AI song generators that are democratizing song making but threaten to disrupt the music industry.",
      "Experts say generative AI is set to transform the music world. However, there are scant details, so far, on how it's impacting the $29.6 billion global recorded music market, which includes about $20 billion from streaming.",
      "The most reliable figures come from music streaming service Deezer, which estimates that 18% of songs uploaded to its platform every day are purely AI generated, though they only account for a tiny amount of total streams, hinting that few people are actually listening. Other, bigger streaming platforms like Spotify haven't released any figures on AI music.",
      "Udio declined to comment on how many users it has and how many songs it has generated. Suno did not respond to a request for comment. Both have free basic levels as well as pro and premium tiers that come with access to more advanced AI models.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a total boom. It\u2019s a tsunami,\u201d said Josh Antonuccio, director of Ohio University's School of Media Arts and Studies. The amount of AI generated music \u201cis just going to only exponentially increase\u201d as young people grow up with AI and become more comfortable with it, he said.",
      "Yet generative AI, with its ability to spit out seemingly unique content, has divided the music world, with musicians and industry groups complaining that recorded works are being exploited to train AI models that power song generation tools.",
      "Record labels are trying to fend off the threat that AI music startups pose to their revenue streams even as they hope to tap into it for new earnings, while recording artists worry that it will devalue their creativity.",
      "Three major record companies, Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group and Warner Records, filed lawsuits last year against Suno and Udio for copyright infringement. In June, the two sides also reportedly entered negotiations that could go beyond settling the lawsuits and set rules for how artists are paid when AI is used to remix their songs.",
      "GEMA, a German royalty collection society, has sued Suno, accusing it of generating music similar to songs like \u201cMambo No. 5\u201d by Lou Bega and \u201cForever Young\u201d by Alphaville.",
      "More than 1,000 musicians, including Kate Bush, Annie Lennox and Damon Albarn, released a silent album to protest proposed changes to U.K. laws on AI they fear would erode their creative control. Meanwhile, other artists, such as will.i.am, Timbaland and Imogen Heap, have embraced the technology.",

      "Smith, 56 and a semi-retired former U.S. Navy public affairs officer in Portland, Oregon, said \u201cmusic producers have lots of tools in their arsenal\u201d to enhance recordings that listeners aren't aware of.",

      "Biologists are using drones to scare wolves away from cattle",
      "For millennia humans have tried to scare wolves away from their livestock. Most of them didn\u2019t have drones.",
      "But a team of biologists working near the California-Oregon border do, and they're using them to blast AC/DC\u2019s \u201cThunderstruck,\u201d movie clips and live human voices at the apex predators to shoo them away from cattle in an ongoing experiment.",
      "\u201cI am not putting up with this anymore!\u201d actor Scarlett Johansson yells in one clip, from the 2019 film \u201c Marriage Story.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith what? I can't talk to people?\u201d co-star Adam Driver shouts back.",
      "Gray wolves were hunted nearly to extinction throughout the U.S. West by the first half of the 20th century. Since their reintroduction in Idaho and at Yellowstone National Park in the mid-1990s, they've proliferated to the point that a population in the Northern Rockies has been removed from the endangered species list.",
      "There are now hundreds of wolves in Washington and Oregon, dozens more in northern California, and thousands roaming near the Great Lakes.",
      "The recovering population has meant increasing conflict with ranchers \u2014 and increasingly creative efforts by the latter to protect livestock. They've turned to electrified fencing, wolf alarms, guard dogs, horseback patrols, trapping and relocating, and now drones. In some areas where nonlethal efforts have failed, officials routinely approve killing wolves, including last week in Washington state.",
      "Gray wolves killed some 800 domesticated animals across 10 states in 2022, a previous Associated Press review of data from state and federal agencies found.",
      "Scientists with the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service developed the techniques for hazing wolves by drone while monitoring them using thermal imaging cameras at night, when the predators are most active. A preliminary study released in 2022 demonstrated that adding human voices through a loudspeaker rigged onto a drone can freak them out.",
      "The team documented successful interruptions of wolf hunts. When Dustin Ranglack, the USDA\u2019s lead researcher on the project, saw one for the first time, he smiled from ear to ear.",
      "\u201cIf we could reduce those negative impacts of wolves, that is going to be more likely to lead to a situation where we have coexistence,\u201d Ranglack said.",
      "The preloaded clips include recordings of music, gunshots, fireworks and voices. A drone pilot starts by playing three clips chosen at random, such as the \u201cMarriage Story\u201d scene or \u201cThunderstruck,\u201d with its screams and hair-raising electric guitar licks.",
      "If those don't work, the operator can improvise by yelling through a microphone or playing a different clip that's not among the randomized presets. One favorite is the heavy metal band Five Finger Death Punch 's cover of \u201cBlue on Black,\u201d which might blast the lyric \u201cYou turned and you ran\u201d as the wolves flee.",

Patrols extended south to the Sierra Valley in August for the first time, according to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether the wolves might become accustomed to the drones. Herders and wolf hunters in Europe have long deterred them with long lines hung with flapping cloth, but the wolves can eventually learn that the flags are not a threat.",
      "Environmental advocates are optimistic about drones, though, because they allow for scaring wolves in different ways, in different places.",
      "\u201cWolves are frightened of novel things,\u201d said Amaroq Weiss, a wolf advocate with the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cI know that in the human imagination, people think of wolves as big, scary critters that are scared of nothing.\u201d",
      "There are also drawbacks to the technology. A drone with night vision and a loudspeaker costs around $20,000, requires professional training and doesn't work well in wooded areas, making it impractical for many ranchers.",
      "Ranchers in Northern California who have hosted USDA drone patrols agree that they have reduced livestock deaths so far.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very appreciative of what they did. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a long-term solution,\u201d said Mary Rickert, the owner of a cattle ranch north of Mount Shasta. \u201cWhat I\u2019m afraid of is that after some period of time, that all of a sudden they go, \u2018Wow, this isn\u2019t going to hurt me. It just makes a lot of noise.\u2019\u201d",
      "Ranchers are compensated if they can prove that a wolf killed their livestock. But there are uncompensated costs of having stressed-out cows, such as lower birth rates and tougher meat.",
      "Rickert said if the drones don't work over the long term, she might have to close the business, which she's been involved in since at least the 1980s. She wants permission to shoot wolves if they're attacking her animals or if they come onto her property after a certain number of attacks.",

      "TOKYO -- Japan plans to deploy its domestically developed long-range missiles a year earlier than planned, the Defense Ministry announced Friday, as the country steps up efforts to strengthen its strike-back capability in response to rising challenges in the region.",
      "Under the new schedule, a first batch of the domestically developed Type-12 anti-ship missiles will be installed at its army's Camp Kengun in Japan's southwestern prefecture of Kmuamoto by March 2026, the ministry said. The Type-12 missile has a range of about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles).",
      "Japan is seeking to create a more self-sufficient military as a deterrence against China\u2019s increasingly assertive naval activity in regional seas. Japan in June spotted two Chinese aircraft carriers almost simultaneously operating near southern Japanese islands for the first time.",
      "Japan also has concerns about the rising tensions caused by North Korea and Russia.",
      "These efforts mark a historic shift. Japan, under its post-World War II pacifist constitution, used to limit the use of force for self-defense only. But it made a major break from that policy in 2022 when it adopted a five-year security strateg y that names China as its biggest strategic challenge and calls for a closer Japan-U.S. alliance and more offensive roles for Japan's Self-Defense Forces.",

      "With domestically produced missiles still under development, Japan plan to deploy U.S.-developed Tomahawks later this year.",
      "The ministry is also seeking to deploy unmanned air, sea-surface and underwater drones for surveillance to defend Japanese coastlines, as a country with an aging and declining population struggles with an understaffed military.",

      "Online age checks are on the rise in the U.S. and elsewhere, asking people for IDs or face scans to prove they are over 18 or 21 or even 13",
      "Online age checks are on the rise in the U.S. and elsewhere, asking people for IDs or face scans to prove they are over 18 or 21 or even 13. To proponents, they're a tool to keep children away from adult websites and other material that might be harmful to them.",
      "But opponents see a worrisome trend toward a less secure, less private and less free internet, where people can be denied access not just to pornography but news, health information and the ability to speak openly and anonymously.",
      "\u201cI think that many of these laws come from a place of good intentions,\u201d said Jennifer Huddleston, a senior technology policy fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. \u201cCertainly we all want to protect young people from harmful content before they\u2019re ready to see it.\u201d",
      "More than 20 states have passed some kind of age verification law, though many face legal challenges. While no such law exists on the federal level in the United States, the Supreme Court recently allowed a Mississippi age check law for social media to stand. In June, the court upheld a Texas law aimed at preventing minors from watching pornography online, ruling that adults don't have a First Amendment right to access obscene speech without first proving their age.",
      "Elsewhere, the United Kingdom now requires users visiting websites that allow pornography to verify their age. Beyond adult sites, platforms like Reddit, X, Telegram and Bluesky have also committed to age checks. France and several other European Union countries also are testing a government sponsored verification app.",
      "And Australia has banned children under 16 from accessing social media.",
      "\u201cPlatforms now have a social responsibility to ensure the safety of our kids is a priority for them,\u201d Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters in November. The platforms have a year to work out how they could implement the ban before penalties are enforced.",
      "To critics, though, age check laws raise \u201csignificant privacy and speech concerns, not only for young people themselves, but also for all users of the internet,\u201d Huddleston said. \u201cBecause the only way to make sure that we are age verifying anyone under the age of 18 is to also age verify everyone over the age 18. And that could have significant impacts on the speech and privacy rights of adults.\u201d",
      "The state laws are a hodgepodge of requirements, but they generally fall into two camps. On one side are laws \u2014 as seen in Louisiana and Texas \u2014 that require websites comprised of more than 33% of adult content to verify users' ages or face fines. Then there are laws \u2014 enacted in Wyoming or South Dakota \u2014 that seek to regulate sites that have any material that is considered obscene or otherwise harmful to minors.",
      "What's considered harmful to minors can be subjective, and this is where experts believe such laws run afoul of the First Amendment. It means people may be required to verify their ages to access anything, from Netflix to a neighborhood blog.",
      "\u201cIn places like Australia and the U.K., there is already a split happening between the internet that people who are willing to identify themselves or go through age verification can see and the rest of the internet. And that's historically a very dangerous place for us to end up,\u201d said Jason Kelley, activism director at the nonprofit digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation.",
      "What's behind the gates is determined by a \u201chundred different decision-makers,\" Kelley said, from politicians to tech platforms to judges to individuals who have sued because they believe that a piece of content is dangerous.",

      "While many companies are complying, verifying users' ages can prove a burden, especially for smaller platforms. On Friday, Bluesky said it will no longer be available in Mississippi because of its age verification requirements. While the social platform already does age verification in the U.K., it said Mississippi\u2019s approach \u201cwould fundamentally change how users access Bluesky.\u201d",
      "That's because it requires every user to undergo an age check, not just those who want to access adult content. It would also require Bluesky to identify and track users that are children.",
      "\u201cWe think this law creates challenges that go beyond its child safety goals, and creates significant barriers that limit free speech and disproportionately harm smaller platforms,\u201d the company said in a blog post.",
      "Some websites and social media companies, such as Instagram's parent company Meta, have argued that age verification should be done by app store owners, such as Apple and Google, and not individual platforms. This would mean that app stores need to verify their users\u2019 ages before they allow them to download apps. Unsurprisingly, Apple and Google disagree.",
      "\u201cBilled as \u2018simple\u2019 by its backers, including Meta, this proposal fails to cover desktop computers or other devices that are commonly shared within families. It also could be ineffective against pre-installed apps,\u201d Google said in a blog post.",
      "Nonetheless, a growing number of tech companies are implementing verification systems to comply with regulations or ward off criticism that they are not protecting children. This includes Google, which recently started testing a new age-verification system for YouTube that relies on AI to differentiate between adults and minors based on their watch histories.",
      "Instagram is testing a similar AI system to determine if kids are lying about their ages. Roblox, which was sued by the Louisiana attorney general on claims it doesn't do enough to protect children from predators, requires users who want to access certain games rated for those over 17 to submit a photo ID and undergo a face scan for verification. Roblox has also recently begun requiring age verification for teens who want to chat more freely on platform.",
      "Face scans that promise to estimate a person\u2019s age may address some of the concerns around IDs, but they can be unreliable. Can AI accurately tell, for instance, if someone is 17.5 or just turned 18?",
      "\u201cSometimes it\u2019s less accurate for women or it\u2019s less accurate for certain racial or ethnic groups or for certain physical characteristics that then may mean that those people have to go through additional privacy invasive screenings to prove that they are of a certain age,\u201d Huddleston said.",
      "While IDs are a common way of verifying someone\u2019s age, the method raises security concerns: What happens if companies don't delete the uploaded files, for instance?",
      "Case in point: the recent data breaches at Tea, an app for women to anonymously warn each other about the men they date, speak to some of these concerns. The app requires women who sign up to upload an ID or undergo a scan to prove that they are women. Tea wasn't supposed to keep the files but it did, and stored them in a way that allowed hackers to not only access the images, but also their private messages.",

      "ATHENS, Greece -- Climate change that has driven scorching temperatures and dwindling rainfall made massive wildfires in Turkey, Greece and Cyprus this summer burn much more fiercely, said a new study released Thursday.",
      "The study by World Weather Attribution said the fires that killed 20 people, forced 80,000 to evacuate and burned more than 1 million hectares (2.47 million acres) were 22% more intense in 2025, Europe\u2019s worst recorded year of wildfires.",

      "WWA, a group of researchers that examines whether and to what extent extreme weather events are linked to climate change, called its findings \u201cconcerning.\"",

      "The study found winter rainfall ahead of the wildfires had dropped by about 14% since the pre-industrial era, when a heavy reliance on fossil fuels began. It also determined that because of climate change, weeklong periods of dry, hot air that primes vegetation to burn are now 13 times more likely.",
      "The analysis also found an increase in the intensity of high-pressure systems that strengthened extreme northerly winds, known as Etesian winds, that fanned the wildfires.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A Social Security official who has filed a whistleblower complaint alleging the Department of Government Efficiency officials mishandled Americans' sensitive information says he's resigning his post because of actions taken against him since making his complaint.",
      "Charles Borges, the agency's chief data officer, alleged that more than 300 million Americans\u2019 Social Security data was put at risk by DOGE officials who uploaded sensitive information to a cloud account not subject to oversight. His whistleblower disclosure was submitted to the special counsel\u2019s office on Tuesday.",
      "In a letter to SSA Commissioner Frank Bisignano, Borges claimed that since filing his whistleblower complaint, the agency's actions make his duties \u201cimpossible to perform legally and ethically\u201d and have caused him \u201cphysical, mental and emotional distress.\u201d",
      "\u201cAfter reporting internally to management and externally to regulators, serious data and security and integrity concerns impacting our citizens\u2019 most sensitive personal data, I have suffered exclusion, isolation, internal strife, and a culture of fear, creating a hostile work environment and making work conditions intolerable,\u201d Borges added.",
      "The Project Government Accountability Office, which is representing him in his whistleblower case, posted Borges' resignation letter on its website Friday evening. Borges declined to comment.",
      "\u201cHe no longer felt that he could continue to work for the Social Security Administration in good conscience, given what he had witnessed,\u201d his attorney Andrea Meza said in a statement. She added that Borges would continue to work with the proper oversight bodies on the matter.",
      "In his whistleblower's complaint, Borges said the potentially sensitive information put at risk by DOGE's actions includes health diagnoses, income, banking information, familial relationships and personal biographic data.",

    "story": [
      "Oregon lawmakers are considering a proposal that would make the state the second in the nation to require electric vehicle owners to enroll in a pay-per-mile program",
      "Oregon could become the second U.S. state to require electric vehicle owners to enroll in a pay-per-mile program as lawmakers begin a special session Friday to fill a $300 million transportation budget hole that threatens basic services like snowplowing and road repairs.",
      "Legislators failed earlier this year to approve a transportation funding package. Hundreds of state workers' jobs are in limbo, and the proposal for a road usage charge for EV drivers was left on the table.",
      "Hawaii in 2023 was the first state to create a mandatory road usage charge program to make up for projected decreases in fuel tax revenue due to the growing number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars. Many other states have studied the concept, and Oregon, Utah and Virginia have voluntary programs.",
      "The concept has promise as a long-term funding solution, experts say. Others worry about privacy concerns and discouraging people from buying EVs, which can help reduce transportation emissions.",
      "\u201cThis is a pretty major change,\u201d said Liz Farmer, an analyst for The Pew Charitable Trusts\u2019 state fiscal policy team, noting \u201cthe challenge in enacting something that\u2019s dramatically different for most drivers.\u201d",
      "Oregon's transportation department says the budget shortfall stems from inflation, projected declines in gas tax revenue and other spending limits. Over the summer, it sent layoff notices to nearly 500 workers and announced plans to close a dozen road maintenance stations.",
      "Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek paused those moves and called the special session to find a solution. Republican lawmakers say the department mismanaging its money is a main issue.",
      "Kotek's proposal includes an EV road usage charge that is equivalent to 5% of the state's gas tax. It also includes raising the gas tax by 6 cents to 46 cents per gallon, among other fee increases.",
      "The usage charge would phase in starting in 2027 for certain EVs and expand to include hybrids in 2028. Should the gas tax increase be approved, EV drivers either would pay about 2.3 cents per mile, or choose an annual flat fee of $340. Drivers in the program wouldn't have to pay supplemental registration fees.",
      "Drivers would have several options for reporting mileage to private contractors, including a smartphone app or the vehicle's telematics technology, said Scott Boardman, policy adviser for the transportation department who works on the state's decade-old voluntary road usage charge program.",
      "As of May, there were over 84,000 EVs registered in Oregon, about 2% of the state's total vehicles, he said.",

      "Under Hawaii's program, which began phasing in last month, EV drivers can pay $8 per 1,000 miles driven, capped at $50, or an annual fee of $50.",
      "In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections. By 2033, the program is expected to expand to all light-duty vehicles.",
      "In past surveys commissioned by Oregon's transportation department, respondents cited privacy, GPS devices and data security as concerns about road usage charges.",
      "Oregon's voluntary program has sought to respond to such concerns by deleting mileage data 30 days after a payment is received, Boardman said. While plug-in GPS devices are an option in the program, transportation officials anticipate moving away from them because they're more expensive and can be removed, he added.",
      "Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge. Arizona voters will decide next year whether to ban state and local governments from implementing a tax or fee based on miles traveled after the measure was referred to the ballot by the Republican-majority Legislature.",
      "Many people don't realize that \"both your vehicle and your cellphone capture immense amounts of data about your personal driving habits already,\u201d said Brett Morgan, Oregon transportation policy director for the nonprofit Climate Solutions.",
      "Morgan added that road usage charges exceeding what drivers of internal combustion engines would pay in gas taxes could dissuade people from buying electric and hybrid cars. Already, federal tax incentives for EVs are set to expire under the tax and spending cut bill recently passed by the GOP-controlled Congress.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely supportive of a road usage charge that has EVs paying their fair share, but they should not be paying extra or a penalty,\u201d Morgan said.",

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California schools would have to create plans for notifying parents and teachers when immigration enforcement is on campus under a bill passed Tuesday by the state Legislature.",
      "The bill would also require California State universities and community colleges, and request University of California campuses, to send alerts to students, faculty and staff when immigration enforcement is present. It now heads to Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has until Oct. 12 to sign it into law. The legislation would remain in effect until 2031.",
      "\u201cStudents cannot learn unless they feel safe,\u201d Democratic Assemblymember Al Muratsuchi said. \u201cFor decades we had a bipartisan agreement to keep educational institutions, schools, campuses, free from immigration enforcement activities.\u201d",
      "The bill was part of a slate of proposals lawmakers passed Tuesday in an effort to protect families from the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown. The Legislature also advanced bills banning immigration enforcement from entering nonpublic areas of school or hospital grounds without a warrant.",

      "Yet, President Donald Trump has alienated many in the region \u2014 far beyond the usual array of U.S. antagonists like Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela \u2014 with persistent demands, coupled with threats of sweeping tariffs and massive sanctions for not complying with his desires.",
      "Shortly before Rubio left for Mexico, he and Trump announced the U.S. military had carried out a strike in the southern Caribbean against a vessel hauling drugs that departed from Venezuela.",

      "\u201cPlease let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!\u201d Trump said.",
      "Rubio, speaking to reporters before boarding his plane to Mexico, said Trump \u201cis going to be on offense against drug cartels and drug trafficking in the United States. It destabilizes not just the country but the entire Caribbean basin.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe president has been very clear that he\u2019s going to use the full power of America and the full might of the United States to take on and eradicate these drug cartels, no matter where they\u2019re operating from and no matter how long they\u2019ve been able to act with impunity,\u201d he said. \u201cThose days are over.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Trump has demanded, and so far won, some concessions from Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum's government, which is eager to defuse his tariff threats.",
      "Rubio arrived in Mexico City just a few hours after Sheinbaum had planned to lead a meeting of the country\u2019s most important security forum, which brings together all 32 governors, the army, navy, federal prosecutor\u2019s office and security commanders to coordinate actions across Mexico.",
      "Sheinbaum had been talking for weeks about how Mexico was finalizing a comprehensive security agreement with the State Department that, among other things, was supposed to include plans for a \u201cjoint investigation group\u201d to combat the flow of fentanyl and the drug's precursors into the U.S. and weapons from north to south.",

Routh, 59, has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and several firearm violations.",
      "Prosecutors have said Routh methodically plotted to kill Trump for weeks before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Trump played golf on Sept. 15, 2024, at his West Palm Beach country club. A Secret Service agent spotted Routh before Trump came into view. Officials said Routh aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot.",

      "Hawaii\u2019s Kilauea volcano has been repeatedly disgorging lava at its summit crater about once a week since late last year",
      "HONOLULU -- Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has been shooting lava from its summit crater about once a week since late last year, delighting residents, visitors and online viewers alike with a firehose of molten rock.",
      "On Tuesday, the volcano had its 32nd episode since December. Scientists believe they are all part of the same eruption because magma has been following the same pathway to the surface.",
      "The lava has been contained within the summit crater inside Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and hasn't threatened homes or buildings.",
      "Park visitors can see the eruption in person. Others can watch popular livestreams offering a choice of three different camera angles made possible by the U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "Kilauea is on Hawaii Island, the largest of the Hawaiian archipelago. It\u2019s about 200 miles (320 kilometers) south of the state\u2019s largest city, Honolulu, which is on Oahu.",
      "Here's what to know about the latest eruption at Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes:",
      "A lower magma chamber under Halemaumau Crater has been receiving magma directly from the earth\u2019s interior at about 5 cubic yards (3.8 cubic meters) per second, said Ken Hon, scientist-in-charge at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. This blows the chamber up like a balloon and forces magma into an upper chamber. From there it gets pushed above ground through cracks.",
      "Many of the eruptive episodes since December have featured lava soaring high into the air. In some cases the lava formed towers topping 1,000 feet (300 meters.) The fountains are generated in part because magma \u2014 which holds gases that are released as it rises \u2014 has been traveling to the surface through narrow, pipelike vents.",
      "The expanding magma supply is capped by heavier magma that had expelled its gas at the end of the prior episode. Eventually enough new magma accumulates to force the degassed magma off, and the magma shoots out like a Champagne bottle that was shaken before the cork was popped.",
      "This is the fourth time in 200 years that Kilauea has shot lava fountains into the air in repeated episodes. There were more episodes the last time Kilauea followed this pattern: The eruption that began in 1983 started with 44 sessions of shooting fountains. Those were spread out over three years, however. And the fountains emerged in a remote area, so few got to watch.",
      "The other two occurred in 1959 and 1969.",
      "Scientists don\u2019t know how the current eruption will end or how it may change.

      "The visit to Washington is Nawrocki's first overseas trip since taking office last month. It comes after Trump took the unusual step of involving himself in the elections of a longtime ally, Poland, and endorsing Nawrocki, the nationalist Law and Justice party candidate.",
      "Now in office, Nawrocki, a former amateur boxer and historian, is hoping to deepen his relationship with Trump at a fraught moment for Warsaw.",
      "Trump is increasingly frustrated by his inability to get Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to sit down for direct talks aimed at ending the more than three-year-old war between Poland's neighbors.",
      "Trump last month met with Putin in Alaska and then with Zelenskyy and several European leaders at the White House. He emerged from those engagements confident that he'd be able to quickly arrange direct talks between Putin and Zelenskyy and perhaps three-way talks in which he would participate.",

      "\u201cThe stakes are very high for President Nawrocki's visit,\u201d said Peter Doran, an analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. \u201cTrump will have an opportunity to size up Poland\u2019s new president, and Nawrocki also will have the chance to do the same. Failure in this meeting would mean a pullback of American force posture in Poland, and success would mean a clear endorsement of Poland as one of America\u2019s most important allies on the front line.\u201d",

      "The Democrat told reporters Tuesday, after welcoming children back to a public school in the Minneapolis suburb of Eagan, that he'll be making calls to lawmakers and working on a plan over the next couple of days. Walz said he intends to propose a \u201cvery comprehensive\u201d package that could include an assault-weapons ban.",
      "But it's not clear if new restrictions on guns could pass the closely divided Minnesota Legislature. A special election this month is expected to restore a 67-67 tie in the House under a Republican speaker, and Senate Democrats have just a one-vote majority.",
      "\u201cTo be very candid, just in a very evenly divided (Legislature), I\u2019m going to need some Republicans to break with the orthodoxy and say that we need to do something on guns,\u201d Walz said.",

      "Republican House Speaker Lisa Demuth, of Cold Spring, said she had a \"long overdue\" conversation with Walz later Tuesday.",
      "\u201cIf he decides to call a special session, anything that we do needs to have bipartisan support,\u201d Demuth said in a statement, noting that both parties showed they could work together in this year's regular session. \"If Governor Walz and Democrats are focused on partisan accusations and demands, this special session will not be productive for the people of Minnesota.\u201d",
      "Demuth indicated in an earlier statement that Republicans might be open to expanding school security funding to include private schools, and providing more money for mental health resources.",
      "While the governor didn't give many details of his proposals, he said they won't infringe on Second Amendment rights, but will protect students. He indicated his plan could include safe storage and liability insurance requirements, improvements to the state's 2023 \u201cred flag\u201d law, and more funding for mental health. He also said he's open to GOP ideas.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Novak Djokovic took a two-set lead against Taylor Fritz, an opponent he always beats, to close in on the semifinals, a round he often reaches at the U.S. Open, and marked the occasion by blowing kisses to those in Tuesday night's crowd pulling for the last American man in the field.",
      "That was just a taste of the back-and-forth between Djokovic and some of the folks in the Arthur Ashe Stadium seats, and there was still work that remained, but he would finish off a 6-3, 7-5, 3-6, 6-4 victory. Djokovic improved to 11-0 against 2024 runner-up Fritz and reached a record-extending 53rd Grand Slam semifinal, a total that includes a record-tying 14 at Flushing Meadows.",

      "He needed three match points to end it, and was leaning over, hands on knees, after the first two resulted in long rallies that went Fritz's way. But on the last, the contest ended anticlimactically with a double-fault by No. 4-seeded Fritz, whose exit means the U.S. drought will continue without a male singles champion at any major since 2003, when Andy Roddick won in New York.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, that\u2019s one of the things that makes the great players great,\u201d Fritz said about Djokovic. \u201cThey win the big points.\u201d",
      "On Friday, Djokovic will play in his fourth Slam semifinal of the season and take on five-time major champion Carlos Alcaraz, who hasn't dropped a set in the tournament. He was a 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 winner against No. 20 Jiri Lehecka earlier Tuesday.",
      "Djokovic leads No. 2 seed Alcaraz 5-3 head-to-head, winning their two most recent matchups \u2014 in the Australian Open quarterfinals this January and in the final at the Paris Olympics last year, when the Serbian finally fulfilled his wish to win a gold medal for his country.",

      "On Tuesday night, both men were dressed entirely in black \u2014 shirts, shorts, socks and shoes. Even Djokovic\u2019s wrist bands were black, as was Fritz\u2019s headband, which he had on wrong at the start, so the white lettering of his clothing sponsor\u2019s name was upside-down until he made a change after the second set.",
      "If the players\u2019 get-ups looked alike, that\u2019s where the similarities stopped. Djokovic, who has won four of his 24 major championships at the U.S. Open, most recently in 2023, did what he usually does to Fritz \u2014 and, to be fair, nearly everyone else \u2014 which is to say: return masterfully, control the longest points and serve to all the right spots, particularly in the clutch.",
      "In sum, the 38-year-old Djokovic was generally a step, and a thought, or two ahead of the 27-year-old Fritz, whose serve got better over the last two sets.",
      "Djokovic won 25 of the 42 points that lasted at least nine strokes. He saved 11 of the 13 break chances he faced. And he won 10 of the 11 points when he serve-and-volleyed.",

      "FORT WORTH, Texas -- Families of some of the 346 people killed in crashes of Boeing 737 Max jetliners held photos of their dead loved ones Wednesday outside a federal court in Texas, where a judge was hearing arguments on the U.S. government's motion to dismiss a felony conspiracy charge against the aerospace company in connection with the twin disasters.",
      "U.S. District Chief Judge Reed O\u2019Connor set aside time for relatives of the crash victims to speak during the hearing. Some traveled from countries in Europe and Africa to pursue what could be their final opportunity to demand that the company face criminal prosecution for the crashes off the coast of Indonesia and in Ethiopia.",
      "\u201cMy daughter died on a new airplane that was defective and that was in operation because they weren\u2019t complying with regulations and because of fraud,\u201d said Nadia Milleron, a Massachusetts resident whose 24-year-old daughter, Samya Stumo, was among the 157 passengers and crew members killed in the Ethiopia crash. \u201cI don\u2019t want any other any other family member to lose their loved ones because of this kind of fraud.\u201d",
      "In charging Boeing with conspiracy to defraud the government, prosecutors alleged Boeing deceived Federal Aviation Administration regulators about a flight-control system that was later implicated in the fatal flights, which happened less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019.",
      "The hearing in Fort Worth comes more than four years after the Justice Department announced it had charged Boeing and reached a $2.5 billion settlement with the aircraft maker. That deal would have protected Boeing from criminal prosecution if it strengthened its ethics and legal compliance programs. But prosecutors revived the charge last year after deciding the company had violated certain terms of the agreement.",
      "Boeing decided to plead guilty to avoid a trial, but O\u2019Connor rejected that deal in December. The judge, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, cited concerns he had over how diversity policies both at the federal government and at Boeing could influence the selection of an independent monitor charged with overseeing the company's promised reforms.",
      "The judge\u2019s refusal to accept the plea agreement meant the company was free to challenge the Justice Department\u2019s rationale for charging Boeing as a corporation. It also meant prosecutors would have to secure a new deal for a guilty plea, and they spent six months renegotiating with Boeing.",
      "In late May, the two sides struck a deal that took both the criminal charge and Boeing's guilty plea off the table. In exchange, Boeing said it would pay or invest another $1.1 billion in fines, compensation for the crash victims\u2019 families, and internal safety and quality measures.",
      "The Justice Department said it offered those terms in light of \u201csignificant changes\u201d Boeing has made to its quality control and anti-fraud programs since last summer. It said the certainty of the agreement also served the public interest more effectively than taking the long-running case to trial and risking a jury verdict that might spare the company further punishment.",

After the Ethiopia crash, the planes were grounded worldwide for 20 months.",
      "Investigators found that Boeing did not inform key Federal Aviation Administration personnel about changes it had made to the software before regulators set pilot training requirements for the Max and certified the airliner for flight.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- A day after President Donald Trump dramatically stepped up his administration\u2019s military role in the Caribbean with what he called a deadly strike on a Venezuelan drug cartel, Secretary of State Marco Rubio is meeting the president of Mexico, who has voiced fears of the U.S. encroaching on Mexican sovereignty.",

      "Trump has alienated many in the region with persistent demands and threats of sweeping tariffs and massive sanctions for refusing to follow his lead, particularly on migration and the fight against drug cartels. Likely to heighten their concerns is the expanded military footprint. The U.S. has deployed warships to the Caribbean and elsewhere off Latin America, culminating in what the administration said Tuesday was a lethal strike on an alleged Tren de Aragua gang vessel that U.S. officials say was carrying narcotics.",
      "\u201cPlease let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!\u201d Trump said of the strike, which he said had killed 11 gang members.",
      "Rubio, defending the strike, made clear that such operations would continue if needed. Though it was a military strike, America's top diplomat tweeted about it around when Trump announced it in the White House and then spoke to reporters about the operation.",
      "\u201cThe president has been very clear that he\u2019s going to use the full power of America and the full might of the United States to take on and eradicate these drug cartels, no matter where they\u2019re operating from and no matter how long they\u2019ve been able to act with impunity,\u201d Rubio said Tuesday. \u201cThose days are over.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Curtis Sliwa, the colorful creator of New York City's Guardian Angels anti-crime patrol group, ran for mayor four years ago and wound up losing to Democrat Eric Adams by almost 40 percentage points.",

      "\u201cZohran obviously is very unique. He's way to the left, but then again, Cuomo and Adams, listen to the way they talk. They're Zohran-lite,\" Sliwa told The Associated Press. \u201cI will be the alternative.\u201d",
      "Even if he doesn't win, Sliwa might play the spoiler. While some Mamdani critics have urged Sliwa to drop out and throw his support behind someone with a better chance of beating the Democratic nominee, Sliwa says that isn't happening.",
      "Sliwa is hoping to ride to victory on crime, an issue that helped Adams, a former police captain, win the pandemic-era 2021 election.",
      "This year's Democratic primary was dominated by discussions of New York's high cost of living, but Sliwa believes crime is \"beginning to creep up and almost be equal\u201d to other issues voters care about.",
      "Sliwa's Guardian Angels \u2014 a band of beret-wearing citizens \u2014 patrolled graffitied subway cars and the rough-and-tumble streets starting in the late 1970s, when crime was rampant.

Crime is down this year in nearly every category, according to police.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Federal grand jurors in the nation's capital have refused to indict two people who were charged separately with threatening to kill President Donald Trump, more evidence of a growing backlash against Trump's law enforcement intervention in Washington, D.C.",
      "It is extraordinarily rare for a grand jury to balk at returning an indictment, but it has happened at least seven times in five cases since Trump last month ordered a surge in patrols by federal agents and troops in the District of Columbia. One of the instances involved the case against a man charged with hurling a sandwich at a federal agent.",
      "The latest example occurred Tuesday, when Justice Department prosecutors told a magistrate judge that a grand jury declined to indict Edward Alexander Dana. He is accused of making a death threat against Trump while in police custody on Aug. 17. Dana also told police that he was intoxicated that night.",
      "Grand jurors also refused to hand up an indictment against Nathalie Rose Jones, who was arrested Aug. 16 in Washington on charges that she made death threats against Trump on social media and during an interview with Secret Service agents. Jones' attorney disclosed the decision in a court filing Monday.",
      "Dana's lawyer, Elizabeth Mullin, said she has never seen anything like this in over 20 years as a public defender in Washington. She said prosecutors are responding to Trump's surge by bringing \u201cweak cases\u201d that don't belong in federal court.",
      "\u201cAnd the grand juries are seeing through it,\u201d Mullin said. \u201cIt's a huge waste in resources.\u201d",
      "U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, whom Trump appointed to be the top federal prosecutor for Washington, said a grand jury\u2019s refusal to indict somebody for threatening to kill the president \u201cis the essence of a politicized jury.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe system here is broken on many levels,\u201d Pirro said in a statement. \u201cInstead of the outrage that should be engendered by a specific threat to kill the president, the grand jury in DC refuses to even let the judicial process begin. Justice should not depend on politics.\u201d",
      "Last month, a grand jury refused to indict a government attorney who was facing a felony assault charge for throwing a \u201csub-style\u201d sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection agent \u2014 a confrontation captured on a viral video.",

      "The series, which Rae and her collaborators started creating in 2019, features media icons such as Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Tracee Ellis Ross, Norman Lear and Shonda Rhimes.",
      "\"What inspired me to even get my start was just seeing the people that I love, the people that I know, the people that raised me on TV, and that representation was so essential for me to recognize that I could do it,\" Rae told \"CBS Mornings\" Tuesday about her inspiration growing up in the 90s.",
      "In the early 2000s, Rae said there was a \"disappearance all of the sudden\" of Black characters and shows on TV, but they reemerged about a decade later.",
      "In the 2010s, \"there were just so many new shows, new shows of color,\" she said. But now, Rae said TV and media is once again in an era where Black characters and shows have disappeared.",
      "\"I think the advent of cable made a huge difference where, you know, now these networks had to try to capture the broadest audience possible because they were losing audiences to different niche cable networks and so they were like, 'how can we maximize the audience we have?' and they have a tendency to go broad then, and broad sometimes just means White, the most eyeballs that you can get,\" she said.",
      "Even though shows like \"Family Matters\" and \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" were universal and watched by a broad audience, there is sometimes a feeling that Black shows may exclude an audience, she said.",

      "\"It makes such a difference when you're thinking about something as small as set design. I've seen that just even on my own productions and watching movies.

    "summary": "North Carolina was pummeled by TCU, 48-14, in the college coaching debut of NFL coaching legend Bill Belichick.",
    "story": [
      "Chapel Hill, N.C. \u2014 North Carolina's high-point moment in its first game under coach Bill Belichick came early.",
      "A festive pregame atmosphere led to a roar from the crowd at kickoff. And a season-opening drive moved at a crisp pace to the end zone.",
      "After that, well, Monday night's hyped-up debut turned into a romp by TCU - along with a reminder that even an NFL icon with six Super Bowl titles as a head coach can't just magically turn the Tar Heels into winners after decades of also-ran status.",
      "\"We played competitively but then just couldn't sustain it,\" Belichick said in the familiar low tone from his NFL news conferences after the 48-14 loss. \"Obviously, we have a lot of work to do. We need to do a better job all the way around \u2014 coaching, playing, all three phases of the game.\"",
      "CBSSports.com's Shehan Jeyarajah points out\u00a0that, \"The NFL is generally a defensive league where teams are close to evenly matched. At the college level, Belichick will come to understand just how big the talent differentials are between the good and bad teams \u2014 and he was on the wrong end.\"",
      "The blowout put a major damper on a night buzzing with optimism for the 73-year-old Belichick's college debut, only to see the Horned Frogs dominate so thoroughly they drove UNC fans to the Kenan Stadium exits by midway through the third quarter.",
      "\"It was a great environment tonight,\" Belichick said. \"I mean, the fans were awesome. There was great energy in the stadium. We just didn't do enough to keep it going. We've got to play better for the energy to be sustainable.\"",
      "By the end of the game, Kenan was a ghost town and the Tar Heels had given up more points than in any previous opener in their history, according to Sportradar.",
      "It was a jarring result, even amid uncertainty as to exactly what to expect from UNC with roughly 70 new players between transfers and incoming recruits. There were few highlights after that opening drive beyond Kaleb Cost's athletic reeling in of a deflected ball for an interception and quarterback Max Johnson returning in relief from a serious leg injury sustained in last year's opener at Minnesota.",
      "\"We're just moving forward, just moving forward,\" said Cost, offering an unintentional callback to Belichick's famous \"We're on to Cincinnati\" response to reporters' questions after a blowout loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in 2014.",
      "UNC was picked to finish eighth in the 17-team Atlantic Coast Conference, though that seemed almost entirely predicated on Belichick's mere presence. This is a man, after all, who teamed with legendary quarterback Tom Brady to win six world titles in his 24-year run with the New England Patriots. Someone who won more regular-season and playoff games in the NFL (333) than anyone other than Don Shula.",
      "So there was spectacle to Belichick's debut as he took the field sporting a familiar look from the pro sideline with a gray hoodie - only this one bearing the name \"Carolina Football\" in that distinctive shade of light blue.",
      "An estimated 5,000 fans packed onto a main campus quad for a pregame concert and throngs lined the team's walk to Kenan, where UNC has sold out all its season tickets \u2014 at an elevated price with Belichick's arrival \u2014 and single-game seats for the season. The game attracted ESPN to hold a pregame studio show from the sideline with a crew that included former Alabama coach Nick Saban, with Belichick popping over briefly to say hello.",
      "There were notable former UNC athletes from years past, including NBA legend Michael Jordan \u2014 who won a national championship under Dean Smith here in 1982 \u2014 and former UNC star linebacker Lawrence Taylor, who played under Belichick when he was an assistant and eventually defensive coordinator with the New York Giants during the 1980s.",
      "And it wasn't hard to spot Jordon Hudson \u2014 Belichick's 24-year-old girlfriend who has generated her own tabloid-level curiosity \u2014 as she walked the pregame sideline sporting Carolina blue pants shimmering with sequins-like additions on the legs.",
      "Belichick roamed the field during pregame warmups for the better part of a half-hour. At one point, he stood on the UNC end of the field with general manager Michael Lombardi, then shared a quick handshake with ACC commissioner Jim Phillips as he made his way toward midfield.",
      "Once there, Belichick shook hands with members of the officiating crew and watched the Horned Frogs warm up.",
      "The Tar Heels got off to a sprint of a start with an 83-yard drive that ended with Caleb Hood scoring through the right side from 8 yards out, followed by forcing a quick punt. But things soon started getting away.",
      "TCU \u2014 which lost in a similar scenario as the \"other\" team in Deion Sanders' debut at Colorado two years ago \u2014 never looked rattled or thrown. Bud Clark provided a highlight by jumping Gio Lopez's sideline throw for an easy 25-yard pick-six as TCU took a 20-7 lead into the break.",
      "It quickly got worse after halftime. Kevorian Barnes sprinted through the right side and down the sideline for a 75-yard touchdown on the first snap. Trent Battle added his own big run, slipping through the left side untouched and going 28 yards for a TD.",
      "And finally, Devean Deal had a 37-yard scoop-and-score on Lopez's fumble to make it 41-7 and start the Kenan exodus.",
      "By the end, UNC had just 222 total yards, 320 fewer than TCU, and a short week to fix problems before visiting Charlotte on Saturday.",
      "\"They were clearly the better team tonight,\" Belichick said. \"They deserved to win and they did it decisively.\"",

    "summary": "One of the founding members of Creedence Clearwater Revival lost control of his own songs when the band broke up in the early 1970s. Now, after buying back rights to his Creedence catalog, John Fogerty has come back to his music, recording the album \"Legacy.\"",
    "story": [
      "\"It was life and death,\" said musician John Fogerty. \"I used to tell myself that phrase: 'This is life and death.' You're against the whole world.\"",
      "He felt that as a young man: \"Yes, oh yes. I mean, there's a million records out there. It's me against everybody that's every recorded and ever will record. You've got to do a great job. It was either be great, or go home!\"",
      "You know how it turned out for Fogerty. \"Great\" is something of an understatement. That voice \u2026 that guitar \u2026 and those songs, so many of which became hits that are now classics. But Fogerty, who recently turned 80, says every time he steps up to the mic, he still has something to prove \u2013 and still feel a little nerve. \"Oh yeah, yeah, every time!\" he laughed. \"But I think the nerves is what gives you the edge.",
      "I asked, \"How do you do that? What's the magic there?\"",
      "\"I wish I had a really great, contrived answer for you, but I don't!\" he laughed.",
      "The answer seems quite simple when you watch Fogerty rehearse. There is love of craft, and love of family. (His sons, Shane and Tyler Fogerty, help lead his touring band.)",
      "The group that put Fogerty on the charts was Creedence Clearwater Revival, which got its start in the late 1950s. Though a native of Northern California, Fogerty soaked up the rhythms of the South, giving birth to his so-called \"swamp rock\" sound, which he honed in the mid-'60s.",
      "He recalled: \"I received my honorable discharge from the Army. And the first line I wrote was, 'Left a good job in the city, workin' for the man every night and day.' Well, of course that was the Army. I mean, it had just happened. But as I begin to strum, I started singing this phrase: 'Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river.' And at that point I'm, Well, what is this song? What is this? And I went to this songbook that I had just started keeping, and on the very first page, the very first entry, I had written the words 'Proud Mary.'",
      "\"And I actually understood right then that I'd written a classic song, a really great, American song,\" he said. \"And a few moments later, 'Oh my God. What if I never get to do this again? What if this is the only one that ever happens, and I'm a one-hit wonder?'\"",
      "Turns out, Fogerty was anything but that. Yet, after the 1972 breakup of Creedence, his solo career became mired in legal battles. He was stunned to discover he no longer had control over the use of the songs he wrote \u2013 and a limited share of the profits.",
      "Fogerty has looked on as others have endured similar challenges, and pain. The most famous current example: Taylor Swift, who earlier this year purchased the rights to her compositions, and won back control of her music.",
      "I asked, \"If you could pull her aside, John, and give her a piece of advice about how to get over the pain of a fight over your own music, what would you tell her?\"",
      "\"Well, I don't think you get over that kind of fight,\" he replied. \"What happened to me is, I stopped touring, and I stopped singing my own songs. I don't recommend that move to anybody. You become invisible. You're just forgotten about. It's like you died.\"",
      "I asked Julie, his wife of 34 years, if she ever doubted that he would be able to pull himself out of that anger. \"I think it was more sadness than anger,\" she said. \"And all he ever wanted to do in life was make music. That was his love. That was his best friend. And having that taken away and turned so bad was really hard for me to understand.\"",
      "Fogerty gives Julie credit for turning his life around. And she encouraged him not only to buy back the rights to his Creedence catalog, but to re-record those songs with his sons.\u00a0 The result: a new album, \"Legacy: The Creedence Clearwater Revival Years (John's Version).\"",
      "Julie said, \"Having those songs and being able to put his fist in the air and go, 'I own those songs,' I couldn't think of a better gift than having him record these with friends and family.\"",
      "You can stream John Fogerty's album \"Legacy: The Creedence Clearwater Revival Years (John's Version)\" by clicking on the embed below (Free Spotify registration required to hear the tracks in full):",
      "Since they were children, sons Shane and Tyler learned guitar from their father.\u00a0 The new album is a family affair, but it's also serious business. \"I have the feeling that somehow Julie knew, she knew that at some point, the life-and-death John would kick in and I would have to roll up my sleeves,\" Fogerty said. \"'Cause that's what happened. And literally, this was kind of when the record was done, I think she told me, she said she could see me going back in time. With each one of these tracks, especially when I was doing the lead vocal, I had to remember what I felt like when I sang it the first time.\"",
      "And what a time it has been. For John Fogerty, the highs and lows have landed him here: at peace with it all, and lucky enough to have his songs still playing.",
      "I asked, \"What's it like for you to hear your music everywhere, even now?\"",
      "\"I don't know the exact right words; I can almost not believe it actually happened, or that that was me,\" he said. \"It's a prideful thing. I think it makes you feel really happy that you are able to tune into the radio station that God delivers, you know, and receive a song like 'Proud Mary,' and write it down, and even take credit for it, right? And then have it go around the world like that? It's kind of too much to really be able to grab hold of.\"",

      "These days, the art world has caught up to Alex Katz's talent. His paintings can sell for millions of dollars, and exhibitions around the world have highlighted his work, including a show in 2022 at New York's Guggenheim Museum.",
      "Now famed for his portraits, Katz is also highly-regarded for his landscapes, often inspired by the picturesque scenes near his summer studio in Maine. \"It's a long way from Queens,\" he said, \"but it is like Queens. It's all kinda small!\"",
      "Katz says painting the outdoors heightened his creativity: \"I thought I was connecting with outdoor painting, but actually I was connecting with myself,\" he said. \"The painting was no longer cerebral. It was coming from the inside.\"",
      "This summer, Katz turned 98, and after a lifetime painting, he's focused on the work of other artists. He gifted a collection of more than a hundred paintings by emerging and established artists to Maine's Portland Museum of Art.",
      "\"As the art world has moved in different ways and fashions, Alex has always stayed true to his self,\" said museum director Mark Bessire. \"I see his love of artists taking chance and his love of artists emanating that sense of energy that he likes in a painting. He doesn't like a painting because it looks like his or it's figurative. He likes it 'cause it's got the energy, and it pops.\"",
      "The exhibit is called \"Painting Energy.\"",
      "Asked to describe the sensation of looking at some of those paintings, Katz replied, \"It's just like a pow! You get it right through the air. It's very quick. Sometimes you can get a whole show \u2013 as they open the elevator door, blink, and they shut it, you know what this painting's about.\"",
      "One painting that gave Katz that \"pow\" was Katherine Bradford's \"Shadows.\"",
      "Bradford said that when she learned Katz had bought one of her paintings, \"I just felt, 'Oh, wow! Maybe I am a little good!' And Alex Katz, he certainly is really good. Good eye, good person.\"",
      "Bradford didn't start painting until her 30s. Now she's 83, and her pieces typically sell for tens of thousands of dollars. \"Alex Katz is a leader in contemporary art,\" she said. \"But in the state of Maine, he's king. And we all look up to him. He decided to use what he had gained to give back to artists, to buy artists' work.\"",
      "Asked why he wanted to collect other artists' paintings, Katz said, \"Well, I wanted to help other people who went through the same difficulty that I did, you know? I know every little help I got in that period from 25-35, I really appreciated.\"",
      "Like when a paint manufacturer who recognized Katz's talent early on gave him art supplies as part of a deal: \"He got five or six little paintings, and I had free paints,\" said Katz. \"But the big thing was someone believed there was something in me.\"",
      "Katz still works seven days a week, and is still taking risks. \"Sometime, in about a week, I'll do the first painting of a new series,\" he said.",
      "\"And you seem excited about that?\" I asked.",
      "\"Excited and frightened,\" he laughed. \"Yeah, I'm scared it really won't work out.\"",
      "\"So, after all that you've accomplished, you still worry?\"",
      "\"Uh-huh. I want to go where I'm scared. And the new things might be better, they might be worse, but I have to do 'em.\"",

      "She chose September, that most excellent month, to make her move. The monsoon had receded, leaving Kerala gleaming like an emerald strip between the mountains and the sea. As the plane banked to land, and the earth rose to greet us, I couldn't believe that topography could cause such palpable, physical pain. I had never known that beloved landscape, never imagined it, never evoked it, without her being part of it. I couldn't think of those hills and trees, the green rivers, the shrinking, cemented-over rice fields with giant billboards rising out of them advertising awful wedding saris and even worse jewelry, without thinking of her. She was woven through it all, taller in my mind than any billboard, more perilous than any river in spate, more relentless than the rain, more present than the sea itself. How could this have happened? How? She checked out with no advance notice. Typically unpredictable.",
      "The church didn't want her. She didn't want the church. (There was savage history there, nothing to do with God.) So given her standing in our town, and given our town, we had to fashion a fitting funeral for her. The local papers reported her passing on their front pages, most national papers mentioned it, too. The internet lit up with an outpouring of love from generations of students who had studied in the school she founded, whose lives she had transformed, and from others who knew of the legendary legal battle she had waged and won for equal inheritance rights for Christian women in Kerala. The deluge of obituaries made it even more crucial that we do the right thing and send her on the way she deserved. But what was that right thing? Fortunately, on the day she died the school was closed and the children had gone home. The campus was ours. It was a huge relief. Perhaps she had planned that, too.",
      "Conversations about her death and its consequences for us, especially me, had begun when I was three years old. She was thirty then, debilitated by asthma, dead broke (her only asset was a bachelor's degree in education), and she had just walked out on her husband\u2014my father, I should say, although somehow that comes out sounding strange. She was almost eighty-nine when she died, so we had sixty years to discuss her imminent death and her latest will and testament, which, given her preoccupation with inheritance and wills, she rewrote almost every other week. The number of false alarms, close shaves, and great escapes that she racked up would have given Houdini pause for thought. They lulled us into a sort of catastrophe complacency. I truly believed she would outlive me. When she didn't, I was wrecked, heart-smashed. I am puzzled and more than a little ashamed by the intensity of my response.",

Our seventeenth-century lit class has only about thirty people, but Modern Furniture is held in an auditorium with cushioned seats set on a steep slope down to the professor at his podium. Behind him is a big screen that flashes pictures of Corbusier's B 306 chaise longue and Bauhaus nesting tables. I catch up on a lot of sleep in that class.",

      "\"I think between me and my friends and my family and the people that I always share my music and my art with first, it was \u2026 it just wasn't even a conversation. It was just, like, it's perfect. For what the album is, it's perfect for, you know, kind of what it represents.\"",
      "The cover depicted Carpenter kneeling on the ground. An individual is standing next to her with Carpenter's hand on the person's thigh as they're pulling her hair.",
      "She said her intention was to keep the cover open to interpretation.",
      "\"My interpretation is being in on the control. Being in on your lack of control and when you want to be in control,\" Carpenter said. \"I think as a young woman, you're just as aware of when you're in control as when you're not.\"",
      "She explained the album for her was about \"the humanity of allowing yourself to make those mistakes.\"",
      "Carpenter said she tries to take the critical comments lightly.",
      "\"My fans that know me and know the person behind the music will look at that photo and they know exactly what it is. People that have no idea who I am absolutely look at that photo and go, like, 'where are her parents?'\"",

      "In his new book, \"It Doesn't Have to Hurt: Your Smart Guide to a Pain-Free Life\" (published September 2 by Simon & Schuster), Dr. Sanjay Gupta, a neurosurgeon and chief medical correspondent for CNN, writes about chronic pain, and the innovative techniques now being used to study and treat it.",

      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Over a hundred years ago, William Osler, the Canadian physician and founding influence on modern medicine and medical education, is said to have instructed his students to \"listen to the patient. Quite often he is telling you the diagnosis.\"",
      "Today, the urgent search for meaningful insights into chronic pain has given that idea a new relevance, with impressive results. Health care providers now encourage patients to engage as partners in the treatment process. Research programs now routinely include people with lived experience\u2014patients, family members, caregivers\u2014as members of committees that advise and direct pain studies.",
      "Pain scientists are calling for a dramatic change that puts greater emphasis on the studies that draw first from people's real-life pain experience, then follows up with lab-based research to develop targeted solutions for effective pain management. This reverse translational research flips the classic bench-to-bedside process that starts in a laboratory and ends with a clinical trial.",
      "Reverse translational research begins with the patient's real-world experience and then tries to decipher the mechanisms through brain imaging and blood tests, correlated with the patient's symptoms and self-reports. Instead of the bench to the bedside, which was taught when I was in medical school, this is bedside to the bench research. The bench scientists then work with the findings to learn more about the basic mechanisms.",
      "Prasad Shirvalkar, a pain physician, neuroscientist, and the director of the Shirvalkar Lab at the University of California at San Francisco, used such a hybrid approach a couple of years ago to find the unicorn in pain science: objective biomarkers of a subjective experience. He started by implanting electrodes in the brains of patients, to measure brain signals. He then followed the trial participants home and, with the use of continuous surveys and digital monitoring, tracked their pain through everyday life and correlated those results with direct readings from the brain. The combination of lab-based and home-based monitoring led to a groundbreaking series of clinical trials that made headlines around the world. In 2023, his team was able to directly map signals of chronic pain for the first time in history. In more recent trials, the team used electrodes implanted in the brain to map the unique neural signature of each participant's pain experience over thousands of hours. The result was the ability, for the first time, to create an objective measure of an individual patient's subjective pain experiences.",
      "In a more recent and ongoing trial, the maps and electrodes were used to predict a pain burst, which was followed by the delivery of a carefully calibrated electrical impulse\u2014deep brain stimulation (DBS) to interrupt the pain, reducing or even eliminating it altogether. Predicting when pain might occur, objectively measuring its severity, and then quickly inhibiting it is in many ways the ultimate achievement.",
      "Ed Mowery's story is about someone using this remarkable treatment approach, but first a caveat. It's not currently available, or even feasible, for general use, so it can't deliver on the dream of a cure for chronic pain. But it does deliver evidence that pain circuitry in the brain is measurable and malleable. It can be targeted and treated, and we'll likely see the emergence of a range of approaches that can do so without brain surgery.",

    "summary": "Jane Pauley talks with the author of \"It Doesn't Have to Hurt\" about the body's defenses against pain; and with Ed Mowery, whose decades-long experience with pain led to a revolutionary surgery and treatment.",
    "story": [
      "Ed Mowery, the founder and lead singer of a death metal band, suffered unfathomable pain for decades: \"It was 24/7, 365,\" he said, likening it to \"lightning bolt razor snakes in my legs and nerve pain in my arms.",
      "\"Have you ever had a really bad burn when you're cooking? Imagine that really bad burn, multiply it by, say, 20 to 30, and then apply it from the neck down. And on top of that burn was the lightning bolt razor snakes in my legs and the crazy nerve burn in my arms. So, it was several different kinds of pain at once.\"",
      "It's a rare condition affecting 200,000 people in the U.S., called complex regional pain syndrome, or CRPS. But doctors could find no cause for it.",
      "\"There was nothing to point to and says, 'This is why it's hurting.' It was just a sort of unrelenting pain,\" said Dr. Sanjay Gupta, best known as chief medical correspondent at CNN. A neurosurgeon and author, his latest book, \"It Doesn't Have to Hurt,\" explores the mystery of pain \u2013 mundane aches and pains, or excruciating pain like Mowery suffered.",
      "A lot of Americans are hurting; the CDC says approximately 20% are in pain. And while writing the book, Gupta found one of them was his mother \u2013 83-year-old Damyanti Gupta, who had a fall right outside her front door.",
      "\"I had osteoporosis,\" she said, \"and I think one of my bones must have given up, I think, because I didn't trip over anything.\"",
      "Imaging showed a compressed lumbar vertebra. But pain doesn't appear on X-rays and MRIs.\u00a0 \"You know how they ask you, doctors tell me, 'From a scale of one to 10, what is your pain?' I would've said 100,\" Damyanti said. \"You don't really realize 'til you have it. I never realized that pain can be that terrible. You don't want to even live anymore.\"",
      "\"I don't want to live anymore \u2013 coming from my mom, obviously it's really painful to hear,\" said Dr. Gupta. \"But also this was someone who'd never complained about anything. So, you had a sense of just how significant an impact this was on her.\"",
      "Spinal surgery successfully repaired the injured spine, and immediately Damyanti's pain went from 100 to about 3.",
      "The surprising source of pain",
      "As a brain surgeon, Gupta sees patients in pain every day, but he personally experienced serious pain when he was a kid who thought he could vault over a spiked fence. \"I don't know what I was thinking,\" he said. \"But I didn't make it. And this spike from the fence went right through the back of my skin on the side, and came right out the front. So, I was essentially pinned and impaled on top of this fence.\"",
      "As the shock wore off, the future doctor \u2013 still on the fence \u2013 took note: \"The pain started to come in waves. So it was there, felt like someone was sort of slapping my back, but then after a while it just didn't hurt that much anymore. And there was a couple of times when I had to reach back around and say, 'It's still there, right?' Even at the time, that struck me as a really surprising experience. Like, I had a hot poker thing going through my back, and yet I'm not feeling pain? Like, why would that be?\"",
      "Later, he learned the reason why. \"It took years to sort of understand this,\" he said. \"My body's endogenous opioid system \u2013 we have our own opioid system \u2013 it reacted, and it reacted in a big, big way. Because the body is just flooded with all these opioids and it improves my mood, it decreases my memory of the painful experience, and obviously it helps with the overall hurt.",
      "\"These are endorphins, and by the way, endorphins \u2013 endo, which means comes from your body, and phin, morphine\u2014so it's like your body's own natural morphine,\" he said.",
      "After years of suffering despite pain medication (including morphine), Ed Mowery joined a clinical trial at the University of California at San Francisco, which not only found the source of those \"lightning bolt razor snakes,\" but would make headlines around the world.",
      "Treating Chronic Pain Is Hard. An Experimental Approach Shows Promise (New York Times)",
      "Treating Chronic Pain Is Hard. An Experimental Approach Shows Promise (New York Times)",
      "The source of the pain, said Gupta, was \"the brain. It's hard to conceptualize, I realize this. But Ed is sort of this daredevil guy. He had a lot of injuries over his life. He had had a knee operation, and it was after that knee operation that, for some reason, his brain had taken the experience of his knee surgery and started to memorize it, and got it a little bit wrong. So instead of saying, 'Hey, your knee hurts,' it just went into this hyper-drive. The best metaphor would be something known as 'phantom pain.' That's when someone loses a limb and then they still hurt, even though that limb doesn't even exist anymore. How can that happen? The brain. The brain is creating that pain. Why that's happening exactly, we're not sure.\"",
      "\"Shutting off\" the pain",
      "Mowery had volunteered for a study in deep brain stimulation and pain, and three rounds of brain surgery. \"I had nodes sticking out of my head,\" Mowery said. \"And I had 144 wires going to two computers. And I had a turban on my head. And I also had a lot more hair!\"",
      "Gupta said, \"After weeks they were able to draw this link between Ed's pain and these changes in the brain. And what they found with Ed was not only could they start to predict that Ed was gonna have pain, they could quantify how bad that pain was likely to be, and they could even interrupt the pain by giving a little stimulation. So even before the pain would get to conscious awareness, the stimulator would go off and it would start to interrupt that pain cycle.\"",
      "Gupta predicts Mowery's story is just the beginning: \"What these doctors were able to do, they were essentially able to put these probes all over the brain and just leave these probes in sort of to listen to Ed's brain.\"",
      "Even now, a computer can recognize his pain coming on \u2013 and shut it off.",
      "It's been life-changing for Mowery, who spoke about the clinical trial at the National Institutes of Health: \"The last two days of testing, the signal started working, and killing my pain,\" he said. \"I was beside myself.\"",
      "Though a small study, the implications for managing all sorts of pain are far-reaching. \u00a0As Gupta explains, the brain is the source of every sensation of pain, from a paper cut, to a broken vertebra, to \"razor snakes.\"",
      "I asked Mowery, \"Did you know when you signed up for this, what you were signing up for?\"",
      "\"It's funny you ask that question, because when I first found out, I said, 'There's no way. I'm not doing three brain surgeries. You're not going into my brain. No way,\" Mowery said. \"And then a year-and-a-half later, I was in so much pain, I just didn't care anymore.\"",
      "\"You seem very comfortable when you describe this as your brain,\" I said.",
      "\"It took me a while to wrap my brain around the fact that this is a brain disease,\" Mowery replied. \"It took a long time for me to just say, oh, you know, this is actually all in my head. But it wasn't imaginary. It was real.\"",
      "Today, Mowery is playing his music again, and looking forward to touring internationally with his band. \"I never lost hope,\" he said, \"because I knew something would come along to help me. And I think that's part of what got me through all this, was my attitude towards the whole thing.\"",

      "A new study released Friday found that young children diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, are often prescribed medication too quickly.",
      "The study, led by Stanford Medicine and published in JAMA Network Open, examined the health records of nearly 10,000 preschool-aged children ages 3 to 5 between 2016 and 2023 who were diagnosed with ADHD.",
      "\"ADHD is a disorder characterized by difficulty paying attention, or what we call hyperactivity, which is sort of like kids that have a hard time sitting still, they have a lot of energy,\" explained Jamie Howard, a senior clinical psychologist with the Child Mind Institute, which specializes in treating anxiety and mood disorders in children.",
      "Howard, who was not involved in the study, said that when treating ADHD in young children, clinical guidelines call for starting with \"behavioral intervention.\"",
      "\"We always want to start with the lowest possible harm,\" Howard said. \"It does very little harm doing a behavioral intervention.\"",
      "The Stanford study found that about 68% of those children who were diagnosed with ADHD were prescribed medications before age 7, most often stimulants such as Ritalin, which can help children focus their attention and regulate their emotions.",
      "The turn to medication often came quickly, according to the study. About 42% of the children who were diagnosed with ADHD were prescribed drugs within 30 days of diagnosis, the study found.",
      "\"We don't have concerns about the toxicity of the medications for 4- and 5-year-olds, but we do know that there is a high likelihood of treatment failure, because many families decide the side effects outweigh the benefits,\" Dr. Yair Bannett, assistant professor of pediatrics at Stanford Medicine and the lead author of the study, said in a statement.",
      "Those side effects can include irritability, aggressiveness and emotional problems, according to Bannett.",
      "\"The high rate of medication prescriptions among preschool-age children with ADHD and the lack of delay between initial diagnosis and prescription require further investigation to assess the appropriateness of early medication treatment,\" the researchers concluded.",
      "The study also found that the vast majority of the young children diagnosed with ADHD, about 76%, were boys.",
      "\"I think that people have an association with ADHD and stimulant medication,\" Howard said. \"...But there is actually a lot more than that. And we want to give kids the opportunity to use these other strategies first, and then if they need medication, it can be incredibly helpful for a lot of kids.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, called on the Department of Health and Human Services Thursday to \"indefinitely postpone\" its vaccine advisory committee meeting next month amid a slew of departures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "\"If the meeting proceeds, any recommendations made should be rejected as lacking legitimacy given the seriousness of the allegations and the current turmoil in CDC leadership,\" Cassidy said in a statement.",
      "The Trump administration is trying to fire CDC Director Susan Monarez, less than a month after she was confirmed by the Senate, although her lawyers have pushed back on the legality of her ouster.",
      "Meanwhile, several other top CDC officials resigned Wednesday, pointing to disagreements with the Trump administration over its vaccine policy, among other things.",
      "The\u00a0agenda\u00a0for the Sept. 18 vaccine advisory committee meeting is set to include discussions of vaccines for COVID-19, Hepatitis B, RSV and the MMRV measles, mumps, rubella, varicella vaccine, and could entail scheduling votes on recommendations for these vaccines.",
      "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he wouldn't comment on personnel issues in an appearance on Fox News Thursday, but claimed that \"the CDC has problems,\" citing COVID-19 protocols among them.",
      "\"We need to look at the priorities of the agency, if there's really a deeply, deeply embedded, I would say, malaise at the agency,\" Kennedy said. \"And we need strong leadership that will go in there and that will be able to execute on President Trump's broad ambitions.\"",
      "In June, Kennedy said he was \"retiring\" all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, independent medical and public health experts who advise and vote on the CDC's vaccine recommendations. Kennedy replaced the committee members with eight of his own picks.",
      "Cassidy's call to postpone the vaccine meeting is the second he's made under Kennedy's leadership \u2014 after he did the same in June\u00a0\u2014 and represents a break with the HHS secretary. In February, Kennedy's confirmation to the post came only after Cassidy delivered the key vote to advance the nomination out of committee. The Louisiana Republican, a medical doctor, had expressed misgivings over Kennedy's nomination because of the doubts he has raised about vaccines for decades.",
      "Cassidy ultimately supported Kennedy's nomination, citing \"serious commitments\" he said he'd received from the administration. He later said Kennedy and the administration had agreed that he would speak with the secretary multiple times a month, and the pair \"would have an unprecedentedly close collaborative working relationship.\"",
      "In his statement Thursday, Cassidy said allegations have been made about the vaccine meeting \"agenda, membership, and lack of scientific process being followed.\"",
      "\"These decisions directly impact children's health and the meeting should not occur until significant oversight has been conducted,\" the Louisiana senator said.",
      "Cassidy said in a post on X after news of the CDC departures Wednesday that the \"high profile departures will require oversight by the HELP Committee.\"",
      "Ranking Member Bernie Sanders sent a letter to Cassidy Thursday calling for a bipartisan investigation into Monarez's firing. The Vermont senator also urged the chairman to hold a hearing with Kennedy, Monarez and the CDC leaders who stepped down.",
      "\"The American people should hear directly from Secretary Kennedy and Dr. Monarez and every member of our committee should be able to ask questions and get honest answers from them,\" Sanders said.",

    "summary": "Wasted energy is a hidden drain on household electricity but small steps can contribute significantly to lowering costs and emissions.",
    "story": [
      "The lights are off, the house is quiet and nothing seems to be running. But electricity is silently flowing through the plugs in your home. This hidden drain is known as phantom energy.",
      "Also called vampire energy, the wasted electricity comes from leaving devices plugged in when they're not in use. That could range from household items such as phone chargers and microwaves to TVs and gaming consoles.",
      "This wasted electricity accounts for about 5% to 10% of home energy use, depending on factors like the age of the equipment, according to Alexis Abramson, dean of the Columbia Climate School.",
      "\"Phantom energy depends on ... what kind of systems you have and how much they've improved over time,\" said Abramson.",
      "For example, televisions that are connected to the internet and have smart wake features that allow them to interact with phones and other devices can consume up to 40 watts of energy during the hours of the day that the TV would normally be off, according to Matt Malinowski, director of the buildings program at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. That's almost 40 times as much as a regular television.",
      "\"The good news is there have been new, renewed efforts to tackle this,\" said Malinowski.",
      "He said advocates and manufacturers have come up with a voluntary agreement seeking to reduce the amount of energy smart televisions use when they're in standby mode.",
      "Phantom energy contributes to climate change because power drawn by unused devices can increase demand for electricity from sources that release planet-warming emissions. Aidan Charron, associate director of Global Earth Day, said that while the amount may seem small when a person looks at their individual utility bill, the environmental toll of phantom energy is significant when multiplied over homes across the country.",
      "\"Just take a little step of unplugging the things that you're not using,\" said Charron. \"It will save you money and it'll save emissions in the long run.\"",
      "Some of the main culprits when it comes to draining energy are appliances that are constantly connected to electricity, such as those with a clock.",
      "\"Do you really need your microwave to tell you the time, or can you unplug your microwave when you're not using it?\" said Charron.",
      "While unplugging devices may seem burdensome, it significantly contributes to reducing emissions.",
      "Charron recommends starting with small steps like unplugging chargers for phones and other devices once the battery is fully charged. The next step is moving to other appliances such as unplugging an unused lamp.",
      "If unplugging sounds too hard, regularly checking your settings and disabling any extra feature you're not using that could be draining energy help, too. For example, smart televisions often have optional features that can be turned off so the television isn't listening for signals from other devices while in standby mode.",
      "\"If you're not using it, then you're getting no benefit, yet you're paying the price and increased the energy use,\" said Malinowski.",
      "Individuals also tend to take more sustainable actions, such as unplugging devices, once they learn what they can do to decrease their household emissions efficiently. Those actions could contribute to reducing U.S. emissions by about 20% per year, which equals about 450 tons (408 metric tons) of carbon dioxide, according to Jonathan Gilligan, a professor of earth and environmental science at Vanderbilt University.",
      "The choices individuals take in their daily lives all add up, Gilligan said, mainly because of how much the U.S. population contributes to direct greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "\"The question becomes, what can we do to try to address this?\" said Gilligan. \"Phantom power is one part of this.\"",
      "The more individuals decrease their footprint, the more likely it is that others will follow, too, and eventually, those actions may turn to societal norms, according to Gilligan, because individuals don't want to feel like they're being irresponsible.",
      "\"This is a place where psychologists find that this effect is real. If people see that other people are doing actions to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, they want to do that\" said Giligan.",
      "When it comes to daily choices, individuals may think what they're doing isn't really making a big difference. But what they tend to overlook is how they influence others around them by choosing to live a more sustainable life.",
      "The impact may be much stronger than a lot of people realize, Gilligan said.",

    "summary": "The judge rejected the Justice Department's effort to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, concluding the request was a bridge too far.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a shake-up of Google's search engine in a crackdown aimed at curbing the corrosive power of an illegal monopoly while rebuffing the U.S. government's attempt to break up the company and impose other restraints.",
      "The 226-page decision made by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington, D.C., will likely ripple across the technological landscape at a time when the industry is being reshaped by breakthroughs in artificial intelligence \u2014 including conversational \"answer engines\" as companies like ChatGPT and Perplexity try to upend Google's long-held position as the internet's main gateway.",
      "The innovations and competition being unleashed by generative artificial intelligence, or \"GenAI,\" have reshaped the judge's approach to remedies in the nearly five-year-old antitrust case.",
      "\"Unlike the typical case where the court's job is to resolve a dispute based on historic facts, here the court is asked to gaze into a crystal ball and look to the future. Not exactly a judge's forte,\" Mehta wrote.",
      "Investors seemed to interpret the ruling as a relatively light slap on the wrist for Google, as the stock price of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., surged nearly 3% in extended trading.",
      "The judge is trying to rein in Google by prohibiting some of the tactics the company deployed to drive traffic to its search engine and other services.",
      "But Mehta stopped short of banning the multi-billion dollar deals that Google has been making for years to lock in its search engine as the default on smartphones, personal computers and other devices. Those deals, involving payments of more than $26 billion annually, were one of the main issues that prompted the judge to conclude Google's search engine was an illegal monopoly, but he decided banning them in the future would do more harm than good.",
      "Partially because he is allowing the default deals to continue, Mehta is ordering Google to give its current and would-be rivals access to some of its search engine's secret sauce \u2014 the data stockpiled from trillions of queries that it used to help improve the quality of its search results.",
      "The judge also rejected the U.S. Justice Department's effort to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, concluding it was an unwarranted step that \"would be incredibly messy and highly risky.\"",
      "\"Now the Court has imposed limits on how we distribute Google services, and will require us to share Search data with rivals,\" Google said in a statement provided to CBS News following the ruling. \"We have concerns about how these requirements will impact our users and their privacy, and we're reviewing the decision closely. The Court did recognize that divesting Chrome and Android would have gone beyond the case's focus on search distribution, and would have harmed consumers and our partners.\"",
      "\"We proved in court that competition had been frozen in place for two decades in internet search,\" Abigail Slater, assistant attorney general of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, wrote in a social media post. \"Google's tactics have excluded competition, harming consumers and slowing innovation. Today's remedy order agreed with the need to restore competition to the long-monopolized search market, and we are now weighing our options and thinking through whether the ordered relief goes far enough in serving that goal.\"",
      "Allowing the default search deals to continue is more than just a victory for Google. It's also something that Apple, which receives more than $20 billion annually from Google, and the beneficiaries of the payments urged Mehta to maintain.",
      "In hearings earlier this year, Apple warned the judge that banning the contracts would deprive the company of money that it funnels into its own innovative research. The Cupertino, California, company also cautioned that the ban could have the unintended consequence of making Google even more powerful by pocketing the money it had been spending on deals while most consumers will still end up flocking to Google's search engine anyway.",
      "Others, such as the owners of the Firefox search engine, asserted that losing the Google contracts would threaten their future survival by depriving them of essential revenue.",

      "Disney will pay $10 million to settle allegations by the Federal Trade Commission that the entertainment company facilitated the \"unlawful collection\" of children's personal data.",
      "In a complaint filed on Tuesday, the FTC\u00a0said that Disney Worldwide Services and Disney Entertainment Operations \u2014 two entities that offer technical support and media content \u2014 violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule, known as COPPA, by failing to properly label some videos uploaded to YouTube as \"made for kids.\" The mislabeling also exposed children to \"age-inappropriate YouTube features,\" the FTC said in a\u00a0statement.",
      "\"Our order penalizes Disney's abuse of parents' trust, and, through a mandated video-review program, makes room for the future of protecting kids online \u2014 age assurance technology,\" FTC Chairman Andrew N. Ferguson said in a statement.",

      "A new cryptocurrency issued by the Trump family's World Liberty Financial\u00a0and that started trading this week has boosted the family's wealth on paper by roughly $5 billion despite the digital token sinking in its first two days of being listed on the exchange.",
      "The crypto, called WLFI, reached a high of about 40 cents after launching on Monday, according to data from CoinMarketCap. By Tuesday morning, the value of the token had fallen to as low as about 21 cents, down 48% from its peak, before recovering to about 23 cents in the afternoon.",
      "Even with the decline, the Trump family's stake in WLFI is worth about $5 billion based on its holdings of 22.5 billion WLFI tokens. Mr. Trump and his family aren't yet able to sell their holdings as its founders' tokens remained locked, according to World Liberty Financial.",
      "World Liberty Financial didn't immediately return a request for comment. Here's what to know about the company's token.",
      "Trump's support for crypto",
      "Once an avowed skeptic of cryptocurrency, Mr. Trump has championed the digital asset in his second term, vowing to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "World Liberty Financial and the Trump family's other private crypto ventures have raised concerns among some watchdog groups and Democratic lawmakers over potential conflicts of interest.",
      "\"The media's continued attempts to fabricate conflicts of interest are irresponsible and reinforce the public's distrust in what they read,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Neither the president nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest.\"",
      "In July, Mr. Trump\u00a0signed the Genius Act, the first major federal law governing cryptocurrencies, into law. The act established federal regulations for \"stablecoins,\" which are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency because their value is pegged to fixed assets, like the dollar.",
      "The surging value of World Liberty Financial, whose co-founders include Mr. Trump and his sons Eric, Donald Jr. and Barron, underscores the president's growing interest in cryptocurrency, a focus that spans both personal investments and policy moves during his presidency. Those efforts include\u00a0$TRUMP and $Melania meme coins, which are cryptos whose value is linked to internet trends and which began trading in January.",
      "What is WLFI?",
      "WLFI is a token, or a digital asset, that guarantees its holders the right to vote on governance issues for World Liberty Financial, according to the company.",
      "World Liberty Financial cautions token owners that WLFI isn't an investment, with its terms stating: \"You should not acquire $WLFI as an investment on a speculative basis or otherwise, for a financial purpose or with an expectation of resale for a profit or otherwise.\"",
      "The early swing in WLFI's price isn't unusual for tokens making their market debut, said Nic Puckrin, CEO of Coin Bureau, a provider of crypto and blockchain information.",
      "\"The price action from 40 cents to 21 cents is typical for new token launches,\" Puckrin told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Early hype usually drives initial spikes, followed by a wave of selling as early entrants take profits.\"",
      "He added, \"Compared to other major token debuts, WLFI's decline is relatively moderate, and early backers have still seen strong returns from private sales.\"",
      "World Liberty Financial also offers a stablecoin called USD1, which is pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar. Because stablecoins are linked to fixed assets, they are generally seen as less volatile to other cryptos.",
      "\"WLFI is carving out a unique position by offering token holders real governance rights over the direction of USD1, a dollar-backed stablecoin that is growing rapidly,\" Puckrin said.",
      "That's important because WLFI holders, through their governance votes, can help influence the future development and policies of USD1 and World Liberty Financial's policies, he added. That capacity \"sets it apart in a crowded market,\" he said.",
      "What about insider concentration risk?",
      "The Trump family and other insiders own more than 20% of the WLFI tokens, according to World Liberty Financial's site.",
      "But World Liberty Financial's terms note that no single digital wallet can exercise more than 5% of governance power, which should deter outsized insider influence, Puckrin said.",
      "What's happening with Mr. Trump's other crypto ventures?",
      "In May, the $TRUMP meme coin drew scrutiny when the venture offered its top holders the chance to join Mr. Trump for dinner. Investors spent about $140 million to snap up the coins and secure an invite to the event, data showed at the time.",
      "That sparked concerns from government watchdogs and some Democratic lawmakers that the Trump-branded asset was being linked to gain access to the president.",
      "As investors snapped up the meme coin, the asset's value almost doubled to about $15 in May. Since then, the coin has given up most of the gains and was trading at about $8.30 on Tuesday, according to CoinMarketCap.",
      "Trump Media & Technology Group \u2014 the owner of the Truth Social app \u2014 has expanded into crypto in recent months. In July, it bought about $2 billion in cryptocurrencies\u00a0to refashion the business as an investment firm.",

Frontier is expanding the pass as low-cost competitor Spirit struggles with its second bankruptcy in less than a year, while rival Southwest's new policies, like ending its\u00a0free checked bag policy, have alienated some customers.",

      "\"I'm thrilled to announce that Chloe Malle will be the next Head of Editorial Content for our U.S. title, leading the American magazine and guiding its digital coverage,\" Wintour said in a\u00a0statement posted to Vogue.com.",
      "Wintour, who is widely considered to be the most powerful figure in the fashion industry,\u00a0announced in June she was taking a step back from her editorial duties. The 75-year-old has served as the magazine's editor-in-chief since 1988.",
      "Malle may be stepping into Wintour's low-heeled slingbacks, but she'll report to the original wearer while taking over day-to-day operations at the U.S. edition. In Vogue's online post, Wintour said she is excited to continue working with Malle as \"her mentor but also as her student.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 02 Sep 2025 08:22:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Courts weigh fairness of reimbursement formula as Arkansas jury finds against State Farm.",
    "story": [
      "An Arkansas jury found recently that a major car insurance carrier had shortchanged customers who had been in accidents that left their cars \"totaled,\" and now plaintiffs in other states are pursuing similar cases.",
      "The Arkansas lead plaintiff, Rose Chadwick, said she initially assumed the reimbursement for her \"totaled\" 2011 Hyundai was reasonable compensation, \"because that's what I pay them for, is to be fair with me.\"",
      "But after learning about potential legal action challenging the way insurance carrier State Farm calculated the replacement cost, she decided to bring her case to court. Her lawyers alleged that the company used technology to estimate the amount of buying a replacement. That program factored into the calculation the potential for the car buyer to negotiate a discount from used car dealers \u2014 a haggling discount that Chadwick's attorneys argued was no longer consistent with how modern-day used cars are priced and sold.",
      "\"The computer program that State Farm used to calculate the replacement value of the car, did it systematically unfairly,\" said Chadwick's attorney, Brian Glasser. Glasser says his firm argued that commonly used software systematically low-balled the value of total-loss cars for tens of thousands of drivers across the country.",
      "In an Arkansas federal court in June, a jury agreed \u2014 finding in favor of Chadwick and 37,000 other plaintiffs. The jury determined Chadwick had been underpaid by about $600 for a car worth $4,700.",
      "State Farm is fighting lawsuits on the issue in multiple states, arguing that the system the company used at the time was standard for most automobile insurers. It no longer uses the same program to calculate reimbursement amounts.",
      "\"State Farm always seeks to pay what we owe within the terms of the policy to help our customers recover from a loss,\" the company said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"We work with the policyholder to determine the actual cash value of a total loss vehicle considering the age, condition, equipment, mileage of the vehicle at the time of the loss,\" the company said, adding that customers are \"also invited to share additional information and has the option to use a third-party appraisal to help reach agreement on the value of their totaled vehicle.\"",
      "A \"totaled\" car is typically one that has sustained damage that would cost more to repair than the value of the car itself.",
      "Company officials noted that appellate courts in multiple jurisdictions have agreed with their contention that a challenge to the reimbursement process cannot be made en masse, in the form of a class action lawsuit, as it was in Arkansas. The courts have split over whether each reimbursement case is unique, and must be filed separately, or whether all customers whose loss was calculated the same way can file suit together as a class.",
      "Chadwick's case began five years ago, when her daughter borrowed her car for an early morning run to the store when she was struck from behind while going through an intersection.",
      "After learning of the reimbursement issue in a social media post, Chadwick became the lead plaintiff in a class action lawsuit against the insurance giant accusing it of undervaluing and shorting payouts on claims like hers.",
      "\"State Farm moves billions of dollars to people for their broken cars every year and, and insurance companies around America do similar numbers,\" Glasser said. \"So we're talking about these computer programs that calculate the value of your replacement vehicle that affect billions of dollars every year.\"",
      "Attorneys are launching similar cases against several insurance carriers in at least 19 states while regulators in some of those states weigh whether insurers must change how they value total loss cars.",
      "State Farm said customers are not without recourse if they have questions about the estimate the company provides to reimburse a customer whose car was a total loss. Among them, customers are encouraged to ask their insurer how they determined the payout amount, to an agreeable price, and to get an independent appraisal of what the car was worth.",
      "In the end, Chadwick said the dispute was less about the money than about principles.",
      "\"It was like hiding something and you shouldn't hide,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Kraft Heinz is splitting into two companies a decade after they joined in a massive merger that created one of the biggest food conglomerates on the planet.",
      "One of the companies, currently called Global Taste Elevation Co., will include shelf-stable meals and include brands such as Heinz, Philadelphia cream cheese and Kraft Mac & Cheese, Kraft Heinz said Tuesday. The other, currently called North American Grocery Co.,  will include brands such as Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles and Lunchables. The names of the two companies will be released later.",
      "Kraft Heinz said in May that it was conducting a strategic review of the company, signaling a potential split.",
      "The company's board \"unanimously approved a plan to separate the company into two independent, publicly traded companies through a tax-free spin-off,\" Kraft Heinz said.",
      "In 2015, when they merged, the company wanted to capitalize on its massive scale, but shifting tastes complicated those plans, with households seeking to introduce healthier options at the table. Kraft Heinz and other food producers have shifted offerings to follow that trend.",
      "\"Kraft Heinz's brands are iconic and beloved, but the complexity of our current structure makes it challenging to allocate capital effectively, prioritize initiatives and drive scale in our most promising areas,\" Kraft Heinz Executive Chair Miguel Patricio said in a statement.",
      "Kraft Heinz CEO  Carlos Abrams-Rivera said, \"This move will unleash the power of our brands and unlock the potential of our business. This next step in our transformation is only possible because of the commitment of our 36,000 talented employees who deliver quality and value for consumers every day. We will continue to operate as 'one Kraft Heinz' throughout the separation process.\"",
      "The path to the merger of Kraft and Heinz began in 2013, when billionaire investor Warren Buffett teamed up with Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital to buy H.J. Heinz Co. At the time, the $23 billion deal was the most expensive ever in the food industry.",
      "3G was also behind the formation of Restaurant Brands International \u2014 a merger of Burger King, Tim Hortons and Popeyes \u2014 and Anheuser-Busch InBev. It's known for strict cost controls and so-called zero-based budgeting, which requires all expenses to be justified each quarter.",
      "The deal was intended to help Heinz, which was founded in 1869 in Pittsburgh, expand sales of its condiments and sauces on grocery store shelves. Heinz's new owners also set about cutting costs, laying off hundreds of workers within months.",
      "At the same time Kraft, based in Chicago, sought a partner after a 2011 split from its snack division, which became Mondelez International.",
      "In 2015, Buffett and 3G decided to merge Heinz with Kraft. The merger created the 5th largest food and beverage company in the world, with annual revenue of $28 billion. Buffett and 3G each contributed $5 billion for a special dividend for Kraft shareholders.",
      "But the combined company struggled, despite layoffs of thousands of employees and other cost-cutting measures. Even at the time of the merger, many consumers were shifting away from the kinds of highly processed packaged foods that Kraft sells, like Velveeta cheese and Kool-Aid.",
      "Kraft Heinz also had trouble distinguishing its products from cheaper store brands. At Walmart, a 14-ounce bottle of Heinz ketchup costs $2.98; the same size bottle of Walmart's Great Value brand is 98 cents.",
      "In 2019, Kraft Heinz slashed the value of its Oscar Meyer and Kraft brands by $15.4 billion, citing operational costs and supply chain problems. But many investors blamed the company's leadership, saying its zeal for cost-cutting was hurting brand innovation.",
      "In 2021, Kraft Heinz sold both its Planters nut business and its natural cheese business, vowing to reinvest the money into higher-growth brands like P3 protein snacks and Lunchables.",
      "But the company's net revenue has fallen every year since 2020, when it saw a pandemic-related bump in sales. In April, Kraft Heinz lowered its full-year sales and earnings guidance, citing weaker customer spending in the U.S. and the impact of President Trump's tariffs.",
      "Carlos Abrams-Rivera will continue to serve as CEO of Kraft Heinz and will become CEO of North American Grocery Co. once the separation is complete. Kraft Heinz said its board is working with an executive search firm to identify potential CEO candidates for Global Taste Elevation Co.",
      "Kraft Heinz says it has no plans to change its current headquarter locations in Chicago and Pittsburgh. It currently expects the transaction to close in the second half of 2026.",

    "summary": "The number of immigrant workers has declined from January through the end of July, preliminary Census data shows.",
    "story": [
      "As millions of Americans gather Monday to celebrate Labor Day, federal data shows how President Trump's immigration policies are reshaping the U.S. workforce.",
      "The number of immigrant workers in the U.S. has declined by 1.2 million from January through the end of July, according to preliminary Census Bureau data, analyzed by the Pew Research Center. That figure includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.",
      "The labor market shakeup comes as the flow of immigrants into the U.S. has slowed significantly under Mr. Trump, who campaigned on a promise to deport millions of immigrants working illegally. He has said he is focusing deportation efforts on \"dangerous criminals,\" but most people detained by ICE have no criminal convictions. At the same time, the number of illegal border crossings has plunged under his policies.",
      "The overall number of people in the U.S. illegally peaked at an estimated 14 million in 2023, according to a Pew Research Center\u00a0estimate. However, the number of unauthorized immigrants has likely declined since then \"due in part to increased deportations and reduced protections under the Trump administration,\" the authors of the Pew Research Center report said.",
      "In an Aug. 28 report, Oxford Economics projects the slowdown will persist through Mr. Trump's presidency, with net immigration falling to an annualized 500,000 by year-end and holding at that level until 2028.",
      "Immigrants make up almost 20% of the U.S. workforce, and data shows 45% of workers in farming, fishing and forestry are immigrants, according to Pew senior researcher Stephanie Kramer. About 30% of all construction workers are immigrants and 24% of service workers are immigrants, she added.",
      "\"It's unclear how much of the decline we've seen since January is due to voluntary departures to pursue other opportunities or avoid deportation, removals, underreporting or other technical issues,\" Kramer said. \"However, we don't believe that the preliminary numbers indicating net-negative migration are so far off that the decline isn't real.\"",
      "To be sure, the loss of immigrant workers reflects a small share of the overall U.S. labor force of more than 171 million workers. But the decline could affect states and sectors that are more dependent on foreign workers, economists say.",
      "Potential implications for the labor market",
      "Immigrants play a key role in alleviating labor shortages, as the majority tend to be ages 25 to 54, Oxford Economics noted. Economists call that demographic \"prime working age\" because they tend to be in their most productive decades of work.",
      "Immigrants are also more willing to migrate to states with higher labor demand.",
      "\"This is critical to ease shortages in regional labor markets, especially as U.S. labor mobility has steadily declined since the 1980s,\" Oxford Economics researchers noted.",
      "However, states with large shares of undocumented residents \u2014 namely Louisiana, Florida and New York \u2014 are starting to see some of the biggest declines in unauthorized migration, the report says.",
      "Experts say the drop in workforce participation could ripple through the labor market, which is already under some strain as employers pull back on hiring. The average monthly payroll gain from May to July was only 35,000, down from an average of 123,000 from for the first four months of the year.",
      "\"The influx across the border from what we can tell is essentially stopped, and that's where we were getting millions and millions of migrants over the last four years,\" said Pia Orrenius, a labor economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. \"That has had a huge impact on the ability to create jobs.\"",
      "Immigrants normally contribute at least 50% of job growth in the U.S., according to Orrenius.",
      "The plunge in unauthorized immigration may also give the impression that the labor force is tighter than it actually is due to the higher ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers, Oxford Economics said. That could muddy the picture of what's going on in the labor market, the authors say.",
      "\"The Fed is highly sensitive to the downside risks to the labor market, but the immigration reversal will continue to complicate the signals from the labor market data,\" they write.",
      "ICE raids take a toll on farms",
      "Just across the border from Mexico in McAllen, Texas, corn and cotton fields are about ready for harvesting. Elizabeth Rodriguez worries there won't be enough workers available for the gins and other machinery once the fields are cleared.",
      "Immigration enforcement actions at farms, businesses and construction sites brought everything to a standstill, said Rodriguez, director of farmworker advocacy for the National Farmworker Ministry.",
      "\"In May, during the peak of our watermelon and cantaloupe season, it delayed it. A lot of crops did go to waste,\" she said.",
      "In Ventura County, California, northwest of Los Angeles, Lisa Tate manages her family business that grows citrus fruits, avocados and coffee on eight ranches and 800 acres (323 hectares).",
      "Most of the men and women who work their farms are contractor-provided day laborers. There were days earlier this year when crews would be smaller. Tate is hesitant to place that blame on immigration policies. But the fear of ICE raids spread quickly.",
      "Dozens of area farmworkers were arrested late this spring.",
      "\"People were being taken out of laundromats, off the side of the road,\" Tate said.",
      "Lidia, a farmworker who spoke to the AP through an interpreter, said her biggest fear is being sent back to Mexico. Now 36, she is married with three school-age children who were born here.",
      "\"I don't know if I'll be able to bring my kids,\" said Lidia. \"I'm also very concerned I'd have to start from zero. My whole life has been in the United States.\"",
      "Construction sites in and around McAllen also \"are completely dead,\" Rodriguez said.",
      "\"We have a large labor force that is undocumented,\" she said. \"We've seen ICE particularly targeting construction sites and attempting to target mechanic and repair shops.\"",
      "Construction jobs",
      "The number of construction jobs are down in about half of U.S. metropolitan areas, according to an Associated General Contractors of America analysis of government employment data. The largest loss of 7,200 jobs was in the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, California, area. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale area lost 6,200 jobs.",
      "\"Construction employment has stalled or retreated in many areas for a variety of reasons,\" said Ken Simonson, the association's chief economist. \"But contractors report they would hire more people if only they could find more qualified and willing workers and tougher immigration enforcement wasn't disrupting labor supplies.\"",
      "This may just be the tip of the iceberg: The Oxford report authors say that the increase in funding for immigration enforcement from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act could eventually lead to an \"even higher sustained rate of deportations.\"",
      "Kramer, with Pew, warns about the potential impact on health care. She says immigrants make up about 43% of home health care aides.",
      "The Service Employees International Union represents about 2 million workers in health care, the public sector and property services. An estimated half of long-term care workers who are members of SEIU 2015 in California are immigrants, said Arnulfo De La Cruz, the local's president.",
      "\"What's going to happen when millions of Americans can no longer find a home care provider?\" De La Cruz said. \"What happens when immigrants aren't in the field to pick our crops? Who's going to staff our hospitals and nursing homes?\"",

Some of them did \u2014 including the U.K., Japan and the EU \u2014 and agreed to deals with Mr. Trump to avoid even bigger tariffs.",
      "Countries that didn't comply faced higher tariffs earlier this month. Laos got rocked with a 40% tariff, for instance, and Algeria with a 30% levy. Mr. Trump also kept the baseline tariffs in place.",
      "What is the IEEPA?",
      "Mr. Trump justified the taxes under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, by declaring longstanding U.S. trade deficits \"a national emergency.\"",
      "In February, he'd invoked the law to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, saying that illegal immigration and drug trafficking amounted to a national emergency and that the three countries needed to do more to stop it.",
      "The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to set taxes, including tariffs. But lawmakers have gradually let presidents assume more power over tariffs \u2014 and Mr. Trump has made the most of it.",
      "Does the ruling apply to all tariffs?",
      "No, the court's ruling doesn't cover all of Mr. Trump tariffs. For instance, his levies on foreign steel, aluminum and autos were imposed under a different regulation after Commerce Department investigations concluded that those imports were threats to U.S. national security.",
      "Nor does it include tariffs that Mr. Trump imposed on China in his first term \u2014 and President Biden kept \u2014 after a government investigation concluded that the Chinese used unfair practices to give their own technology firms an edge over rivals from the U.S. and other Western countries.",
      "The administration had argued that courts had approved then-President Richard Nixon's emergency use of tariffs in the economic chaos that followed his decision to end a policy that linked the U.S. dollar to the price of gold. The Nixon administration successfully cited its authority under the 1917 Trading With Enemy Act, which preceded and supplied some of the legal language later used in IEEPA.",
      "In May, the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York rejected the argument, ruling that Trump's Liberation Day tariffs \"exceed any authority granted to the President'' under the emergency powers law. In reaching its decision, the trade court combined two challenges \u2014 one by five businesses and one by 12 U.S. states \u2014 into a single case.",
      "On Friday, the federal appeals court wrote in its 7-4 ruling that \"it seems unlikely that Congress intended to ... grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs.\"",
      "What happens next?",
      "The president vowed to take the fight to the Supreme Court. \"If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,\" he wrote on his social media platform on Friday.",
      "A dissent from the judges who disagreed with Friday's ruling clears a possible legal path for Mr. Trump, concluding that the 1977 law allowing for emergency actions \"is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority under the Supreme Court's decisions,\" which have allowed the legislature to grant some tariffing authorities to the president.",
      "The government has argued that if Mr. Trump's tariffs are struck down, it might have to refund some of the import taxes that it's collected, delivering a financial blow to the U.S. Treasury. Revenue from tariffs totaled $159 billion by July, more than double what it was at the same point the year before.",
      "Tariffs are paid by U.S. importers, such as American manufacturers or retailers that rely on foreign-made products. While the U.S. companies typically swallow some of the cost, they pass on much of the added expenses to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "The Justice Department warned in a legal filing this month that revoking the tariffs could mean \"financial ruin\" for the U.S.",
      "It could also put Mr. Trump on shaky ground in trying to impose tariffs going forward.",
      "\"While existing trade deals may not automatically unravel, the administration could lose a pillar of its negotiating strategy, which may embolden foreign governments to resist future demands, delay implementation of prior commitments or even seek to renegotiate terms,\" Ashley Akers, senior counsel at the Holland & Knight law firm and a former Justice Department trial lawyer, said before the appeals court decision.",
      "Does the Trump administration have other options?",
      "Mr. Trump does have alternative laws for imposing import taxes, but they would limit the speed and severity with which he could act.",
      "For instance, in its decision in May, the trade court noted that Mr. Trump retains more limited power to impose tariffs to address trade deficits under another statute, the Trade Act of 1974. But that law restricts tariffs to 15% and to just 150 days on countries with which the U.S. runs big trade deficits.",
      "The administration could also invoke levies under a different legal authority \u2014 Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 \u2014 as it did with tariffs on foreign steel, aluminum and automobiles. But that requires a Commerce Department investigation and cannot be imposed at the president's sole discretion.",
      "\"Even if the tariffs are struck down, we believe the Trump administration will look for new ways to tax imports or otherwise raise revenue from companies selling into the U.S.,\" noted Green of the deVere Group.",

      "Artificial intelligence programs like ChatGPT use AI to do thinking or writing or creating for you. Pretty amazing, but also a little terrifying. What happens to the people who used to do those jobs?",
      "Olivia Fair graduated four years ago. \"I've applied to probably over a hundred jobs in the past, I don't know, six months,\" she said. \"And yeah, none of them are landing.\"",
      "She's had a series of short-term jobs - one was in TV production, transcribing interviews. \"But now they don't have a bunch of people transcribing,\" she said. \"They have maybe one person overseeing all of that, and AI doing the rest. Which I think is true for a lot of entry-level positions. And it can be a very useful tool for those people doing that work. But then there's less people needed.\"",
      "According to Laura Ullrich, director of economic research at Indeed, the job-listings website, job postings have declined year over year by 6.7 percent. \"This is a tough year,\" she said. \"Younger job seekers, specifically those who are recent grads, are having a harder time finding work.\"",
      "Asked if there is a correlation between the rise in AI and the decline in jobs for recent graduates, Ullrich said, \"I think there is a cause-and-effect, but it's maybe not as significant as a lot of people would think. If you look specifically at tech jobs, job postings are down 36% compared to pre-pandemic numbers. But that decline started happening prior to AI becoming commonly used.\"",
      "Ullrich said in 2021-22, as the effects of the COVID pandemic began to ebb, there was a hiring boom in some sectors, including tech: \"Quite frankly, I think some companies overhired,\" she said.",
      "The uncertain national situation (tariffs, taxes, foreign policy) doesn't help, either. Ullrich said, \"Some other people have used the analogy of, like, driving through fog. If it's foggy, you slow down a bit. But if it's really foggy, you pull over. And unfortunately, some companies have pulled over to sit and wait to see what is gonna happen.\"",

You know, how do I care for this patient, or land this plane, or remodel this building? And it's possible that we could strip out so much of the supporting work, that people never get the expertise. I don't think it's an insurmountable concern. But we shouldn't take for granted that it will solve itself.\"",

    "summary": "A federal appeals court said many of the tariffs imposed by President Trump on dozens of countries earlier this year are not legally permissible, but didn't halt them.",
    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court said Friday that many of the sweeping tariffs imposed by President Trump on dozens of countries earlier this year are not legally permissible.",
      "The ruling will not immediately block the tariffs, but it marks a significant blow to Mr. Trump's signature trade strategy.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a lower court decision that found many of Mr. Trump's tariffs on foreign goods exceeded his power under federal economic emergency laws. However, the appellate judges vacated the lower court's injunction blocking the tariffs altogether, directing the court to reevaluate whether universal relief is appropriate.",
      "The ruling applies to a series of April executive orders that imposed 10% baseline tariffs on virtually every country and higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of trading partners. It also applies to a separate set of tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China to pressure those three countries to crack down on fentanyl trafficking and unauthorized immigration.",
      "The court's\u00a0ruling\u00a0will not take effect until October to give the Trump administration a chance to ask the Supreme Court to take up the case.",
      "Mr. Trump lashed out against the 7-4 ruling in a Truth Social post on Friday, calling the appeals court \"Highly Partisan\" and noting that the tariffs are still in effect.",
      "\"If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,\" he wrote.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi vowed to appeal the ruling, which she said \"undermines the United States on the world stage\" and is \"interfering with the President's vital and constitutionally central role in foreign policy.\"",
      "Friday's ruling came as part of a monthslong legal challenge over the tariffs brought by Democratic states and small businesses. Mr. Trump has legally justified his sweeping import taxes by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA, which gives the president the power to regulate imports during national emergencies. The law does not explicitly mention tariffs.",
      "The appeals court said the provision of IEEPA that mentions regulating imports does not give the president the right to impose unlimited tariffs. It called the right to levy tariffs \"a core Congressional power,\" and noted that past presidents have typically used IEEPA to impose sanctions, not tariffs.",
      "\"It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,\" the court wrote late Friday afternoon. \"The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President's power to impose tariffs.\"",
      "A lower court, the U.S. Court of International Trade, or USCIT, issued a similar ruling that found the tariffs illegal in May and ordered Mr. Trump's import duties to be frozen. That ruling was stayed by the appeals court so it could review the case.",
      "While the appellate court affirmed USCIT's ruling on the merits of the tariffs, it said the lower court needs to take a second look at whether a universal injunction freezing the tariffs across the board is appropriate. It pointed to the Supreme Court's ruling in a birthright citizenship case earlier this year that limited the use of universal injunctions.",
      "Tariffs have been a core part of Mr. Trump's economic strategy since he returned to office. He unveiled massive \"reciprocal\" tariffs against dozens of trading partners on \"Liberation Day\" in early April, before quickly halting most of those duties to give his administration time to negotiate new trade agreements. Earlier this month, he unveiled a new slate of tariffs against more than 60 countries, in some cases striking deals with certain trading partners that lowered their tariff rates \u2014 but still left them with higher duties than before \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "Mr. Trump argues that steeper tariffs are necessary to correct what he views as unfair trade practices and revive American manufacturing. He has also used tariffs to pressure China on fentanyl, Mexico and Canada on immigration, Brazil on its prosecution of a Trump-aligned former president, and India on its trade relationship with Russia.",
      "But critics \u2014 and many economists \u2014 warn that the tariffs could lead to slower economic growth and higher consumer prices. Some of Mr. Trump's early trade moves rattled financial markets, though major stock indices have rebounded since April's \"Liberation Day\" dive.",
      "Critics also argue that the tariffs exceed Mr. Trump's legal authority. Some of the lawsuits against the tariffs rely on legal theories that have long been championed by conservative judges. Those include the \"major questions doctrine,\" which holds that Congress needs to give a federal agency clear authorization to decide issues of major political or economic significance.",

      "LAS VEGAS \u2014 The top tourism official in Las Vegas says the city hasn't priced out regular travelers, even as July visitor counts fell and casinos took in more from gamblers.",
      "Steve Hill, CEO of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA), said monthly figures can bounce around but argued the destination remains competitive at different price points.",
      "\"We're not happy with the downturn but the city's taking steps to address that,\" Hill told reporters Friday.",
      "Las Vegas saw a 12% decline in visitors compared to a year ago, hosting about 3.1 million people, according to LVCVA data.",
      "Convention attendance fell about 10% in June, then rose about 10% in July. Looking over a longer stretch, Hill said the meetings business is roughly flat and the next 16 months of bookings look especially strong.",
      "With social media griping about add-on costs, resorts are leaning into promotions.",
      "Recent examples include: Resorts World waiving resort fees and paid parking through Sept. 10, the Sahara Las Vegas Hotel offering free parking, late check-out and upgrades on select stays, Downtown Grand Hotel bundling dining credits, free slot play, no resort fee and The Strat touting \"Summer of Value\" rooms with taxes and fees included.",
      "The tourism agency is also pushing budget tips and free activities citywide.",
      "\"The idea that generally Las Vegas is not a value, that it is overpriced, I don't think our customers are doing math when they are concerned about a specific issue,\" Hill said. \"They're expressing concern about that specific topic, that tends to then move into a narrative around Las Vegas is expensive or Las Vegas is not a value, but if you actually do the math on that, that's not accurate.\"",
      "International travel remains mixed.",
      "Traffic from Canada is down about 18%, which Hill attributed in part to friction caused by politics and tariffs. By contrast, visits from Mexico, the United Kingdom and Australia are rising, with more flights into Las Vegas.",
      "He also criticized a $250 U.S. visa fee for travelers from non-waiver countries, costs that can top $1,000 for a family of four, and long processing times that he said suppress demand.",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Aug 2025 19:50:55 -0400",
    "summary": "As of Aug. 29, shipments to the U.S. valued at less than $800 are subject to tariffs, potentially resulting in surprise costs for consumers.",
    "story": [
      "The end of the de minimis tax loophole on Friday means that low-cost shipments to the U.S.\u00a0are no longer exempt from import duties, a potential hit to consumers ordering goods from abroad.",
      "Under the prior tax break, parcels containing goods worth less than $800 were not subject to tariffs, making many products from overseas, such as clothing and beauty products, a cheaper alternative to U.S.-made items.",
      "Now, stepped-up duties apply to all online orders entering the U.S. That could lead to higher costs and longer delivery times given that customs agents must now inspect and process the shipments, experts said.",
      "\"This means that, when making e-commerce purchases from your favorite international sites that you didn't have to worry about paying duties on before \u2014 now you have to,\" Rathna Sharad, CEO and co-founder of FlavorCloud, a global logistics platform, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This increases the cost of common consumer goods, and it varies widely by category of product.\"",
      "In her case, Sharad said the cost of the Korean beauty products she likes has already risen about 15%. \"It's a massive change for U.S. consumers, and a big change for brands and retailers because they have to scramble to figure out their pricing strategies and what this means for them.\"",
      "The White House on July 30 announced it would suspend the de minimis treatment, calling it a \"catastrophic loophole\" that provided a pathway for opioids \"as well as other unsafe or below-market products that harm American workers and businesses\" to enter the U.S.",
      "The White house said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch that the loophole was exploited by bad actors.",
      "\"Between 2015 and 2024, shipments that entered the United States under de minimis ballooned by over 900%,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. \"Thanks to President Trump's historic action, the days of criminal exporters and drug traffickers exploiting the de minimis loophole to flood our country with counterfeit goods, lead toys and illicit drugs like fentanyl are over.\"",
      "The International Trade Administration, a federal agency, also cited statements from companies praising the move.",
      "\"The de minimis loophole has long provided an opportunity for some importers & retailers to avoid paying their fair share of U.S. duties,\" Gap said Friday. \"These packages are also typically subject to minimal inspection, raising potential safety concerns for U.S. consumers. Closing this loophole strengthens our nation's supply chain integrity, improves consumer protection, and levels the playing field for all retailers.\"",
      "Peter Navarro, Mr. Trump's senior counselor for trade and manufacturing, said on a call with reporters on Thursday that ending the exemption would generate up to $10 billion a year in tariff revenues, while also creating thousands of jobs.",
      "How much pricier?",
      "According to a recent FlavorCloud\u00a0analysis, a pair of lined slippers made in China and shipped to the U.S. that previously cost $30 when the de minimis exemption was in force will now cost $44.37, an increase of 51%. That figure factors in several U.S.tariffs on imports: a 12.5% levy on slippers; 20% duty on Chinese goods; and a 10% universal tariff on all imports, as well as a $2.62 merchandise processing fee to calculate the new price.",
      "A nutritional supplement from Canada that formerly cost $37 will now run $60.17 with tariffs in effect, FlavorCloud also found. And a stainless steel water bottle from the U.K. that cost $15 when ordered online in the U.S. will see its price rise to $21.81 once tariffs are applied.",
      "Additionally, a chef's knife from Japan that previously sold for $240 online could cost $298.49 after accounting for applicable tariffs, according to the same analysis.",
      "To be sure, some foreign manufacturers could choose to absorb the cost of higher U.S. tariffs \u2014 which are typically paid by importers here at home \u2014 experts said.",
      "\"Because consumers want bargains, many companies may choose to bite the bullet and incur the increased import costs if they could remain competitive,\" said Augustine Lo, a partner at international law firm Dorsey & Whitney, while noting that abolishing the de minimis loophole amounts to a heavy burden on small and midsize businesses.",
      "Indeed, for now tariffs have had relatively little impact on the rate of U.S. inflation, economic data shows, although forecasters note that it can take up to a year for levies to trickle into consumer prices.",
      "Avoiding surprise costs",
      "Shoppers can take certain steps to avoid being hit with surprise costs when ordering goods online from overseas.",
      "First, check a product's country of origin before making a purchase. U.S.-based sellers often ship goods from their warehouses abroad, which could greatly increase the cost of an item now that tariffs are being applied. More specifically, look for tariff surcharges listed as line items on companies' websites, and decide if the extra charges are worth the cost.",
      "For example, if the imports duties on a particular good exceed its value, it may not be worth buying. At minimum, factor in such added costs into your budget while shopping, FlavorCloud recommends.",
      "The bottom line is that the end of the de minimis loophole amounts to a major shift for consumers and businesses alike, according to Sean Henry, CEO and co-founder of Stord, an e-commerce fulfillment platform.",
      "\"It's a large change because over the last decade, de minimis has accounted for such a large portion of online sales,\" Henry told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol processed $65 billion worth of de minimis packages.",
      "\"It was a way to allow international sellers a fast path, with no paperwork or customs duties, into the U.S.,\" Henry said. \"It's like they were in the fast line at the airport and ran right through. Now, all of a sudden, those same packages are being put into general boarding, and it's going to slow everything down.\"",

    "summary": "Spirit Airlines again filed for bankruptcy protection from its debts only months after emerging from Chapter 11.",
    "story": [
      "Budget carrier Spirit Airlines said Friday that it has filed for bankruptcy protection only months after emerging from a Chapter 11 reorganization.",
      "The no-frills airline said it intends to conduct business as normal during the restructuring process, meaning passengers can continue to book trips and use their tickets, credits and loyalty points. The company said its employees and contractors would still be paid.",
      "Spirit CEO Dave Davis said the airline's previous Chapter 11 petition\u00a0focused on reducing debt and raising capital, and since exiting that process in March \"it has become clear that there is much more work to be done and many more tools are available to best position Spirit for the future.\"",
      "In a quarterly report issued earlier this month, Spirit Aviation Holdings, the carrier's parent company, said it had \"substantial doubt\" about its ability to continue as a going concern over the next year \u2014 which is accounting-speak for running out of money. Spirit cited \"adverse market conditions\" the company faced after its most recent restructuring and other efforts to revive its business.",
      "That included weak demand for domestic leisure travel, which Spirit said persisted in the second quarter of its fiscal year, and \"uncertainties in its business operations\" that the Florida company expects to continue \"for at least the remainder of 2025.\"",
      "Troubles since the pandemic",
      "Known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of bright yellow planes, Spirit has struggled to recover and compete since the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising operation costs and mounting debt eventually led the company to seek bankruptcy protection in November. By the time of that Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.",
      "When Spirit emerged from bankruptcy protection in March, the company successfully restructured some of its debt obligations and secured new financing for future operations. Spirit has continued to make other cost-cutting efforts since \u2014 including plans to furlough about 270 pilots and downgrade some 140 captains to first officers in the coming months.",
      "The furloughs and downgrades announced last month go into effect Oct. 1 and Nov. 1 to align with Spirit's \"projected flight volume for 2026,\" the company noted in its quarterly report. They also follow previous furloughs and job cuts before the company's bankruptcy filing last year.",
      "Despite these and other cost-cutting efforts, Spirit has said it needs more cash. As a result, the company said it may also sell certain aircraft and real estate.",
      "And as discount carriers struggle to compete with bigger airlines \u2014 many of which have snagged budget-conscious customers through their own tiered offerings \u2014 Spirit is attempting to tap into the growing market for more upscale travel. It is now offering flight options with tiered prices, the higher-priced tickets coming with more amenities.",
      "Spirit's aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has also made the airline an attractive takeover target. But such buyout attempts from budget rivals like JetBlue and Frontier were unsuccessful both before and during the bankruptcy process.",
      "Spirit operates 5,013 flights to 88 destinations in the U.S., the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America, Panama and Colombia, according to travel search engine Skyscanner.net",

    "story": [
      "Inflation continued to run hot in July, underlining the Federal Reserve's dilemma as it looks to lower prices for American consumers while propping up a job market that is starting to wobble.",
      "Prices across the U.S. rose at an annual rate of 2.6% last month, according to personal consumption expenditures data released on Friday. That's the same figure as in June, a sign inflation remains persistent. Stripping out volatile food and energy prices, inflation in July actually ticked up to 2.9% from a year ago, up from 2.8% in June.",
      "Read on for a breakdown of Friday's PCE report.",
      "How are consumers faring?",
      "The latest PCE data shows that consumer spending rose 0.5% in July, suggesting that Americans are continuing to open their wallets even in the face of economic uncertainty.",
      "But while people continue to spend, many consumers are increasingly having to make trade-offs on what they spend their money on, Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Consumers are trying to push through \u2014 they're doing the best they can, but they're increasingly under pressure, and therefore they're being more cautious with discretionary outlets,\" he said. \"They travel less. They spend less on restaurants, spend more cautiously on transportation.\"",
      "Such caution can augur a deeper slump given that consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of economic activity. The closely watched University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey, released Friday, showed that Americans are increasingly concerned about inflation.",
      "Although inflation has cooled significantly since peaking in 2022, it remains stubbornly above the Fed's 2% annual target. And consumers continue to feel the pain in the form of higher prices for some groceries as well as rising electricity costs. Another key inflation gauge \u2014 the\u00a0Consumer Price Index\u00a0\u2014 shows that the price of coffee was up 14.8% from a year ago, while beef and egg costs were 15.5% and 16.4%, respectively.",
      "Are tariffs impacting inflation?",
      "Not yet. In a positive sign, the price of goods, which are most susceptible to tariffs than services, cooled slightly in July, the PCE data shows, decreasing 0.1% from the month prior. That suggests tariffs have had a minimal impact on prices so far.",
      "\"It's not showing up in a goods prices, in the government statistics at least,\" Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Still, analysts say inflation could bare its teeth more in the coming months as U.S. tariffs start to trickle through the economy.",
      "\"We continue to expect tariffs to take a growing bite out of growth in real income and real consumer spending,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told investors in a report.",
      "A critical question facing the economy is whether any tariff-induced inflation amounts to a one-time boost to prices or results in a more prolonged increase. Fed Chair Jerome Powell laid out the scenarios in a\u00a0speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, earlier this month, noting that even if inflation does end up being a \"one-time\" scenario, it will still \"take time for tariff increases to work their way through supply chains and distribution networks.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-trump-attempt-remove-lisa-cook-federal-governor/",
    "published": "Fri, 29 Aug 2025 13:28:52 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump announced earlier this week that he would be removing Lisa Cook as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Friday heard arguments over a bid by Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to remain in her post despite President Trump's efforts to remove her because of allegations she made false representations on mortgage agreements several years ago.",
      "The two-hour-long hearing before U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb marked the first in-person showdown between Justice Department lawyers and Cook's legal team in the wake of her lawsuit, filed Thursday, challenging Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her from the Fed's Board of Governors.",
      "Cook's lawyers have asked the district court to issue a temporary restraining order finding Mr. Trump's purported termination of her to be unlawful and declaring that she remains a member of the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors.",
      "Cobb, appointed by former President Joe Biden, did not issue a decision from the bench. Instead, she noted that the case raises \"important questions that may be of first impression\" as it relates to the president's firing of a Fed governor. She repeatedly pointed to the \"unique functions\" of the central bank and the importance \"of this being an independent body that it is not supposed to be responsive to any type of political pressure.\"",
      "Cook was appointed to the post by Biden in May 2022 and reappointed to a full 14-year term set to end in January 2038. She alleges in her lawsuit that Mr. Trump's move violates the Federal Reserve Act, which states that the president can only remove a member of the central bank's Board of Governors \"for cause.\"",
      "In his letter informing Cook that he was terminating her from the Fed Board of Governors earlier this week, Mr. Trump wrote that he had \"sufficient cause\" to remove her from the position. The president cited as grounds for her firing a letter Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, sent to Attorney General Pam Bondi alleging that Cook made false statements on mortgage agreements.",
      "Pulte, appointed to the post by Mr. Trump, accused Cook of claiming two different properties in Michigan and Georgia as her principal residence on mortgage documents in 2021 in order to gain more favorable lending terms. Cook has not been charged with any civil or criminal offense.",
      "Cook's lawyers said in court papers that she may have \"erred\" in filling out the form for her private mortgage, but noted that the alleged action took place before she assumed office as a Fed governor.",
      "\"None of the alleged misconduct occurred during the performance of Governor Cook's duties as a Federal Board member,\" they wrote. \"And the President and Director Pulte have not even alleged explicitly that Ms. Cook benefited from any clerical error, or that such an error was intentional.\"",
      "In a statement released through the Fed last week, Cook said, \"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\"",
      "Abbe Lowell, who argued on Cook's behalf before the court, said her firing rests solely on Pulte's assertion that she may have committed wrongdoing. He said Cook did not receive any notice of the allegations against her or a chance to respond to them, which violated her due process rights. Only 30 minutes elapsed between the time Pulte shared on social media the letter to Bondi alleging Cook engaged in mortgage fraud and Mr. Trump, in his own social media post, said she needed to resign, he said.",
      "\"This allegation of fraud has become the weapon of choice\" for the Trump administration in removing officials, Lowell said, adding that \"cause for the president means she won't go along with an interest rate drop.\"",
      "Cook's lawsuit argues that Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her is \"unprecedented and illegal,\" and, if allowed to stand, would be the first removal of a governor by the president in the Fed's 112-year history. Her attorneys said that while the \"for cause\" standard is not defined in the Federal Reserve Act, other laws shielding members of independent agencies from being fired without cause require a finding of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "\"The President's effort to terminate a Senate-confirmed Federal Reserve Board member is a broadside attack on the century-old independence of the Federal Reserve System,\" Cook's lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "They warned that Mr. Trump's theory of \"cause\" would allow him to remove any Fed Board member with whom he disagrees on policy, eroding the central bank's independence and threatening its mission of providing economic stability.",
      "Cobb repeatedly pressed Lowell about incorporating the removal protections included in other laws \u2014 inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office \u2014\u00a0 into the Federal Reserve Act when that law limits the grounds for removal by the president to \"cause.\" She also asked Lowell to provide the \"best authority\" that supports the court articulating a framework for determining that an official's past conduct can constitute cause for termination.",
      "Cook's lawsuit names Mr. Trump, the Board of Governors and Fed Chair Jerome Powell as defendants. In a court filing ahead of the hearing, a lawyer for the central bank said it does not intend to offer arguments about Cook's effort to block her removal and reiterated that it would follow any court orders.",
      "Justice Department lawyers defended Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook, writing in a separate filing that \"making facially contradictory statements in financial documents \u2014 whether a criminal burden of proof could be sustained or not \u2014 is more than sufficient ground for removing a senior financial regulator from office.\"",
      "They argued that federal courts cannot second guess the president's judgment about what constitutes \"cause,\" so Mr. Trump's effort to remove Cook is a matter of his discretion and not subject to judicial review. But the Justice Department added that if some judicial review of Cook's removal is appropriate, it would have to be highly deferential to avoid intruding on the president's constitutional authority over principal officers.",
      "\"Meanwhile, the President has a strong interest in exercising his statutory authority to remove a federal officer for cause, and the public has a strong interest in stable governance at the Federal Reserve \u2014 a stability that would be undercut by the type of pingpong injunctions and stays that have characterized other litigation,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote.",
      "In questions to Yaakov Roth, principal deputy assistant attorney general, Cobb asked whether the president would have broad discretion to determine what constitutes \"cause,\" given the nature of the Fed Board, and said she was \"uncomfortable\" with the idea that a president could explicitly express a desire to appoint a majority of governors and instruct his administration to \"go dig in\" and find reasons to remove sitting members.",
      "\"What if the stated cause is demonstrably false?\" she asked Roth. \"That's still not anything that anyone can do anything about?\"",
      "Roth said he was not aware of any statements Mr. Trump had made about Cook before Pulte raised the accusations against her and said there was no indication that Cook's removal is for any reason other than the allegations about her mortgage applications. He also noted that Cook has yet to offer any explanation for the representations on the documents.",
      "Cobb, though, also said she had a \"strong reaction\" to the suggestion that Pulte's social media post satisfied due-process protections entitling Cook to receive notice of the accusations and an opportunity to respond.",
      "As to the timing of the alleged misconduct \u2014 Cook entered into the mortgage agreements in 2021, before she was appointed to the Fed Board \u2014 Cobb said that if Cook's removal were reviewable, \"it feels weird that an administration could go back and second guess the determinations of prior administrations and Congress in their advice and consent role.\"",
      "Roth said \"cause\" requires a reason beyond mere policy disagreements that bears on a person's ability and fitness to do the job.",
      "Cook is the latest Democratic appointee targeted for removal by the president as Mr. Trump seeks to stretch the bounds of executive authority. Since he returned to the White House in January, Mr. Trump has moved to oust members of various independent agencies tapped by his predecessor, including officials at the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board, Consumer Product Safety Commission and Federal Labor Relations Authority, among others.",
      "Many of his attempted firings have sparked legal battles, and the Supreme Court in some of those cases has allowed the removals to take effect while litigation continues. But in one of those challenges, brought by terminated members of the NLRB and MSPB, the high court suggested that the Fed is different from those other agencies.",
      "The Supreme Court called the central bank a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States,\" the 18th- and 19th-century central bank predecessors of the Fed.",

      "Prices across the U.S. rose at an annual rate of 2.6% last month, the same as in June and in line with economist forecasts. Core inflation, which excludes the more volatile food and energy categories, rose 2.9% from a year ago, up slightly from June's 2.8% and the highest since February, according to the report.",
      "The figures illustrate why many Fed officials\u00a0have been wary\u00a0about cutting their benchmark interest rate. While inflation is much lower than the roughly 7% peak it reached three years ago, it remains above the central bank's 2% target.",
      "Meanwhile, the report showed that consumer spending increased by 0.5% from June to July, the biggest increase since March, indicating that Americans are not pulling back on purchases, despite looming economic uncertainty. Spending jumped sharply for long-lasting goods such as cars, appliances and furniture, many of which are imported.",
      "Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note that the rise in the core inflation measure was due to a rise in core services, which rose 0.3% on a monthly basis. That suggests tariffs are having a \"minimal impact on goods prices,\" he wrote.",
      "Incomes rose 0.4% on a monthly basis, boosted by a healthy gain in wages and salaries, the report showed.",
      "\"We continue to expect core PCE inflation to peak at 3.3% at the turn of the year, before then easing to about 2.5% by the end of 2026,\" Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a report.",
      "Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted in his Jackson Hole address earlier this month\u00a0that policymakers are likely to cut its short-term rate for the first time December of 2024. But policymakers are expected to proceed cautiously, while Powell has emphasized that any future rate cuts will depend on the path of inflation.",
      "\"Today's in-line PCE Price Index will keep the focus on the jobs market,\" said Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, in an email on Friday. \"For now, the odds still favor a September cut.\"",
      "When the Fed reduces its benchmark rate, it often \u2014 though not always \u2014 lowers borrowing costs for things like mortgages, car loans, and business borrowing. On the flip side, that can spark inflation if the economy grows too quickly.",

      "An exemption that allowed low-value parcels shipped to the United States to avoid tariffs ended at 12:01 a.m. Friday, Trump administration officials said.",
      "President Trump signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0suspending what's known as the\u00a0de minimis exemption\u00a0late last month.",
      "At the time, the White House said that would close what it called a \"catastrophic loophole\" that shippers use to \"evade tariffs and funnel deadly synthetic opioids or below-market products\" into the U.S.",
      "The exemption applied to parcels valued at $800 or less and let overseas retailers ship inexpensive goods to consumers in the U.S. tax-free.",
      "Mr. Trump \"is putting an end to the proliferation of shippers worldwide that, among other things, deceptively exploit the de minimis privilege in an effort to evade duties, inspection, and U.S. law,\" the White House said in a fact sheet outlining the new policy.",
      "The president \"ending of the deadly de minimum loophole will save thousands of American lives by restricting the flow of narcotics and other dangerous prohibited items, and add up to $10 billion a year in tariff revenues to our Treasury,\" White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told reporters Thursday, the Reuters news agency reported.",
      "But there will still be a six-month transition period when postal service shippers can choose to pay a flat duty of $80 to $200 per package depending on the country of origin, Reuters said, citing Trump administration officials.",
      "Mr. Trump ended the de minimis loophole for imports from China and Hong Kong in May. It had allowed retailers such as Shein and Temu to ship ultra low-cost apparel and other goods to U.S.-based consumers at bargain-basement prices. Shipments from China and Hong Kong account for most de minimis shipments to the U.S., according to the White House.",
      "The exemption's end now applies to all nations.",
      "The de minimis provision was added to the Tariff Act of 1930 several years after the law passed. It was intended to facilitate trade by eliminating the administrative burden of collecting modest import duties on low-cost goods.",
      "The number of low-value parcels entering the U.S. has surged over the past decade. Between 2015 and 2025, that figure jumped from 134 million shipments per year to nearly 1.4 billion. Customs and Border Patrol was processing more than 4 million de minimis shipments to the U.S. daily, the White House said.",
      "Retailers such as Shein and Temu were forced to scramble when the loophole for imports from China and Hong Kong was suspended China-based Temu halted shipments of Chinese goods to American customers and shifted to only selling products to U.S. shoppers that could be sourced from the company's U.S. warehouses.",

      "A grand jury of D.C. citizens on Tuesday had denied the Justice Department's request to indict Jones, who was accused of a federal crime for allegedly posting an Instagram threat against President Trump.",
      "In the nearly empty, dimly lit courtroom, Judge Moxila Upadhyaya listened to arguments from attorneys for nearly 15 minutes and surveyed the case file before her. She paused, looked up at the federal prosecutor standing 10 feet away and asked what the Justice Department planned to do next in the case.",
      "The prosecutor had no answer but said he'd have a response \"as soon as possible,\" maybe within a few days.",
      "This grand jury's rejection of the Justice Department's request for an indictment was one of at least four such instances in the past week in which a grand jury denied an indictment in the District of Columbia.",
      "\"Not only have I never heard of this happening, I've never heard of a prosecutor who's heard of this happening,\" said former federal prosecutor Brendan Ballou, who served in the U.S. Attorney's Office for in D.C. until January 2025.",
      "\"This is not the fault of career prosecutors, but rather the office's failure\u2014again and again\u2014to secure indictments suggests that the administration has absolutely destroyed its credibility with jurors,\" Ballou told CBS News.",
      "Another former federal prosecutor, Victor Salgado, said, \"It is exceptionally rare for federal grand juries to reject proposed charges, given the low evidentiary bar for indictment and the Justice Department's policy of pursuing cases only when there is sufficient evidence to both secure and sustain a conviction.\"",
      "Jones is accused of posting on Instagram in early August, \"I am willing to sacrificially kill this POTUS by disemboweling him and cutting out his trachea with Liz Cheney and all The Affirmation present.\"",
      "According to the Justice Department, on Aug. 15, the U.S. Secret Service conducted a voluntary interview with Jones, during which she stated the president was a \"terrorist\" and a \"Nazi.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, D.C. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro said, \"A Washington D.C. grand jury refused to indict someone who threatened to kill the President of the United States. Her intent was clear, traveling through five states to do so. She even confirmed the same to the US Secret Service. This is the essence of a politicized jury. The system here is broken on many levels. Instead of the outrage that should be engendered by a specific threat to kill the president, the grand jury in DC refuses to even let the judicial process begin.\"",
      "Jones was briefly held in pretrial detention in the case last month but was released ahead of Tuesday's hearing. She appeared by Zoom at the hearing in Upadhyaya's courtroom and listened as a prosecutor told the judge that the feds have not decided whether to return to the grand jury for a second time to seek an indictment.",
      "Her attorney argued in a court filing this week that Jones possessed no firearms and \"she repeatedly told them she had no intent to harm anyone, including the president, and was in D.C., to attend a peaceful protest.\"",
      "In a separate case, multiple people familiar with the decision said a grand jury refused a Justice Department request to indict Sean Dunn, who was accused of throwing a sandwich at a federal agent in August. Dunn is a former Justice Department employee who was fired after news circulated of his arrest in the sandwich case. The Justice Department has instead filed a new misdemeanor count against Dunn, which does not require a grand jury indictment.",
      "Court records reviewed by CBS News said a D.C. grand jury also rejected a Justice Department request to indict Sydney Reid, who was arrested in July for allegedly attempting to interfere with the transfer of an alleged gang member into immigration custody.",
      "\"As Reid tried to impede the transfer, one of the (officers) pushed her against the wall and told her to stop,\" the Justice Department alleged in a complaint. \"Reid continued to struggle and fight with the officer.\"",
      "The Justice Department acknowledged in a court filing on Aug. 25 in Reid's case that \"[a]n Indictment has not been returned.\"",
      "Last week, a D.C. grand jury also declined to indict Alvin Summers, who was accused of swinging his arms at a U.S. Park Police officer after a foot chase on Aug. 15. Prosecutors alleged Summers \"grabbed\" the officer with force, and charged him with assaulting and resisting an officer.",
      "Shortly after the grand jury rejected the case, a defense attorney for Summers filed a motion in court, which argued, \"Mr. Summers should not be forced to live under the threat of later charges and rearrest. The charges against Mr. Summers were based on an allegation made by one officer who was wearing a body-worn camera. That officer's testimony was rejected by the grand jury, presumably after reviewing the body-worn camera video.\"",
      "The Justice Department filed a motion to dismiss Summers's case on Aug. 29.",
      "The trajectory of Jones' case was less clear after Tuesday's hearing. Upadhyaya scheduled a hearing for Monday, but declined Jones' request to loosen the restrictions governing her release from pretrial detention.",
      "The reasons these D.C. grand juries have not handed up indictments in these cases are not known, but Salgado suggested it might be possible that in each of these cases \"that they disagreed with the Justice Department's theory of prosecution.\"",
      "\"It is not difficult to imagine 12 D.C. jurors concluding that throwing a sandwich at a federal officer \u2014 while clearly objectionable and potentially unlawful \u2014 does not amount to felony assault,\" Salgado said. \"At its core, the federal grand jury functions as a vital constitutional safeguard and a critical check on prosecutorial discretion, as guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment.\"",

      "The U.S. has not indicated it plans to strike Venezuela directly.

      "On Wednesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told \"Fox & Friends\" that Pritzker should be \"welcoming support and outside efforts to come alongside him, just as the mayor of Washington mostly has.\"",

      "Mr. Trump\u00a0also suggested Baltimore could also draw a federal response.",
      "The president has vowed for weeks to intervene in Chicago and Baltimore, arguing the two cities have failed to contain violent crime. Chicago could be the third city to face a crackdown under the Trump administration: Thousands of Guard troops and federal agents have been deployed to the streets of Washington, D.C., since last month as part of an anti-crime initiative, and Guard forces were sent to Los Angeles in June to protect immigration agents.",
      "Mr. Trump said he hopes Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker \u2014 a vociferous Trump critic \u2014 will call him and request that troops be sent to Chicago. But the president said: \"We're going to do it anyway. We have the right to do it because I have an obligation to protect this country.\"",
      "In a press conference Tuesday, Pritzker called Mr. Trump's comments \"unhinged.\"",
      "\"No, I will not call the president asking him to send troops to Chicago,\" he said.",
      "Pritzker said he expects federal agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other agencies to surge in Chicago in the coming days. He said the president could then \"use any excuse\" to deploy military personnel.",

Gavin Newsom's permission by invoking a law that applies to rebellions or situations where the president can't enforce the law with \"regular forces.\"",
      "Newsom sued the Trump administration over the move. An appeals court ruled that Mr. Trump likely had the right to call up the California National Guard, but a lower court judge on Tuesday ruled the deployment violated a 19th century law prohibiting the military from being used for domestic law enforcement.",
      "Trump calls Chicago a \"mess\" \u2014 Pritzker calls his claims \"absurd\"",

      "When Mr. Trump announced the crackdown in the nation's capital, he said the effort \"will go further,\" saying the administration is \"starting very strongly with D.C.\" and suggesting it could then move to other cities. Since then, he has publicly lashed out over Chicago's murder rate.",
      "\"We have other cities also that are bad. Very bad. You look at Chicago, how bad it is. You look at Los Angeles, how bad it is,\" Mr. Trump said last month. \"We're not going to lose our cities over this.\"",

      "A painting of Gen. Robert E. Lee dressed in his Confederate uniform is back on display in the West Point's library, several years after the storied academy removed honors to the Civil War military leader.",
      "There also are plans to restore a bust of Lee that had been removed from a plaza at the U.S. Military Academy, and a quote from Lee about honor that was removed from a separate plaza is now on display beneath the portrait, an Army spokesperson said Tuesday.",
      "The items were removed to comply with a Department of Defense directive in 2022 that ordered the academy to address racial injustice and do away with installations that \"commemorate or memorialize the Confederacy.\"",
      "The Pentagon's decision to re-hang the portrait, which shows a Black man leading Lee's horse in the background, was first reported by The New York Times. It had been hanging in the library since the 1950s before it was placed it in storage.",
      "The actions at West Point come as the Trump administration restores Confederate names and monuments that had been removed in recent years.",
      "\"At West Point, the United States Military Academy is prepared to restore historical names, artifacts, and assets to their original form and place,\" Rebecca Hodson, the Army's communications director, said in a prepared statement. \"Under this administration, we honor our history and learn from it - we don't erase it.\"",
      "President Trump issued an executive order in March titled \"Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History\" that decried efforts to reinterpret American history. The Army then restored the names of bases that originally honored Confederate leaders, finding service members with the same surnames to honor.",
      "A commission created by Congress recommended in 2022 that the name and images of Confederate officers be removed from military academies. Lee graduated second in his West Point class in 1829 and later served as superintendent, and his name and image had prominent places at the academy on the Hudson River.",
      "Congress took that action after repeated complaints by current and former enlistees and officers in nearly every branch of the armed services who described a deep-rooted culture of racism and discrimination that stubbornly festers despite repeated efforts to eradicate it.",
      "Ty Seidule, a retired brigadier general who served as vice chair of the commission, said Lee's image shouldn't be on display because he \"chose treason\" and doesn't represent the values taught to cadets at West Point.",
      "\"It is against the motto of 'Duty, Honor, Country,'\" Seidule said. \"Robert E. Lee is the antithesis of that, because his duty and honor was for a rebellious slave republic.\"",
      "Seidule, now a history professor at Hamilton College, also questioned whether the restoration of these symbols at West Point are legal under the federal law that led to their removal.",
      "An Army statement asserts that the law doesn't bar the restoration of Confederacy-related names, symbols, displays, monuments or paraphernalia on military property.",
      "The naming commission said in 2022 that it wasn't created \"with any intention of 'erasing history.'\"",
      "\"The facts of the past remain and the commissioners are confident the history of the Civil War will continue to be taught at all service academies with all the quality and complex detail our national past deserves,\" the commission said at the time. \"Rather, they make these recommendations to affirm West Point's long tradition of educating future generations of America's military leaders to represent the best of our national ideals.\"",

    "story": [
      "Beijing \u2014\u00a0China flexed its might and muscle on Wednesday at a military parade in Beijing showcasing its latest missiles, advanced weapons systems and drones. In his address, President Xi Jinping said his nation was \"unstoppable.\"",
      "It was China's biggest military parade ever, meant to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II and Japan's formal surrender. But the massive \"Victory Day\" procession down Chang-an Avenue \u2014 the name of which means \"Eternal Peace\" \u2014 carried a much broader message. Standing next to Xi for the parade were Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un.",
      "Security in the sprawling Chinese capital was extra tight. All buildings overlooking the parade route were locked down as the leaders and other dignitaries from 26 countries took in the spectacle, along with some 50,000 spectators.",
      "It was a landmark moment for Xi, China's 72-year-old leader. It was the third and most important military parade he has overseen since coming to power in 2012.",
      "As commander-in-chief of the world's largest standing armed forces, he watched smiling as tens of thousands of troops under his orders goose stepped in perfect unison toward Tiananmen Square in central Beijing with the sound of cannons ringing through the air.",
      "It was a visceral display of China's growing military might and newest hardware, including hypersonic weapons, nuclear capable missiles, a new laser weapon, fighter jets and underwater drones. But it also pointedly showed off Beijing's growing clout as a geopolitical power, with deepening ties to some of the United States' most potent adversaries.",
      "The message from the stage, with Xi, Putin and Kim standing shoulder to shoulder, was undeniable: strength in solidarity, and a challenge to the U.S.-dominated world order that has prevailed for a century.",
      "Together, they have\u00a0been dubbed\u00a0an \"Axis of Upheaval\" by some Western analysts, and Xi's decision to bring together the leaders of some of the most\u00a0heavily sanctioned nations\u00a0in the world was clearly calculated. The parade was the first time that Kim had ever appeared together with both Xi and Putin \u2014 offering him a first multilateral diplomatic event.",
      "Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian and the leader of Myanmar's ruling military junta, President Min Aung Hlaing, were also there, according to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",
      "Xi and Putin have made their ambition to shake up the global status quo clear for several years.",
      "\"We, together with you and with our sympathizers, will move towards a multipolar, just, democratic world order,\" Russia's longtime Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in 2022, ahead of a meeting with his Chinese counterpart.",
      "The gathering in Beijing represented a clear challenge to President Trump's claim to be fostering close working relationships with Xi, Putin and Kim.",
      "Mr. Trump had a go at China on social media, saying American soldiers deserve credit for helping China defeat Japanese forces during WWII. He went on to accuse China, Russia and North Korea of conspiring against the U.S., which a Kremlin spokesperson dismissed as possible irony.",
      "Xi's bond with Putin was on clear and deliberate display in the days leading up to the parade, as well.",
      "China and Russia have declared their \"no limits partnership\" and, while China claims to maintain a neutral stance on Russia's war in Ukraine, Beijing's support of the war effort \u2014 by providing dual-use technology and continuing to purchase Russian oil and gas in defiance of Western sanctions, has proven to be an economic lifeline funding Putin's three-and-a-half-year war.",
      "During talks at Beijing's Great Hall of the People on Tuesday, Putin hailed \"unprecedentedly high relations\" with China and thanked his \"dear friend\" Xi for the warm welcome.",
      "Kim's support for Russia's war has been even more direct. Since October last year, North Korea has sent around 13,000 troops, along with conventional weapons, to support Russia's war effort. South Korea's intelligence services estimate that around 2,000 North Korean troops have been killed fighting alongside Russian forces.",
      "The parade was a show of both China and Russia's implicit support for Kim's nuclear weapons program, which remains the subject of numerous United Nations sanctions.",
      "Xi burnished his credentials as a geopolitical powerbroker at a regional security summit in Tianjin, northern China, that ended on Monday. He hosted more than 20 world leaders there, including Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",
      "\"We should uphold fairness and justice,\" Xi declared at the gathering of the Shanghai Corporation Organization, seemingly trying to claim moral high ground amid the upheaval and strained relationships caused by Mr. Trump's global trade war and isolationist policies. \"We must oppose the Cold War mentality, block confrontation and bullying practices.\"",
      "Without mentioning the U.S. or its president by name, Xi told the assembled leaders of non-Western countries: \"We must continue to take a clear stand against hegemonism and power politics.\"",
      "On Monday Xi, Putin and Modi were shown together smiling and laughing at the summit \u2014 a deliberate public display of warmth and camaraderie. Just last week, the U.S. imposed 50% tariffs on India for buying Russian oil.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a close ally of Mr. Trump, called the summit \"performative\" and accused China and India of being \"bad actors\" for fueling Russia's war.",
      "At the parade this week, Xi was not only asserting China as a reliable and stable partner, but also showing off his country's burgeoning alliances, influence and military power \u2014 and the potential to back up his vision of a new world order. It was a message that many see as being aimed squarely, if not entirely, at China's rival across the Pacific.",

    "summary": "A federal appeals court on Tuesday ruled against President Trump's use of an 18th century wartime law to rapidly deport Venezuelan migrants.",
    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court on Tuesday ruled against President Trump's use of an 18th century wartime law to rapidly deport Venezuelan migrants, finding \"no invasion or predatory incursion.\"",
      "The Trump administration deported hundreds of accused Tren de Aragua gang members earlier this year using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, an obscure law that allows the president to remove citizens of an enemy country during an \"invasion or predatory incursion.\" Some of those migrants were later flown to a supermax prison in El Salvador \u2014 though many of the detainees were sent to Venezuela as part of a prisoner swap in July.",
      "The strategy has drawn a litany of court challenges, many of which argue the U.S. isn't facing an \"invasion\" or migrants aren't receiving enough due process to contest their deportations. A \"60 Minutes\" investigation found many migrants sent to El Salvador didn't have criminal records.",
      "Tuesday's ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit marks the latest court decision to push back on the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act. The ruling \u2014 which was issued by a three-judge panel, with one dissenter \u2014 found the situation with Tren de Aragua does not meet the definition of either an \"invasion\" or a \"predatory incursion.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued Tren de Aragua is engaged in an incursion because its members have perpetrated \"mass illegal migration.\" The appeals court rejected this argument.",
      "\"A country's encouraging its residents and citizens to enter this country illegally is not the modern-day equivalent of sending an armed, organized force to occupy, to disrupt, or to otherwise harm the United States,\" the court said. \"There is no finding that this mass immigration was an armed, organized force or forces.\"",
      "The appellate judges granted a preliminary injunction blocking the use of the Alien Enemies Act to remove migrants who sued in the Northern District of Texas. The court said the government can still remove the migrants under other legal authorities.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "The ruling came in a case that has darted back and forth through the federal judiciary for months, eventually reaching the Supreme Court in the spring.",
      "The case was brought by migrants who were detained in Texas and sued to block their removal under the Alien Enemies Act. The district court did not grant them relief, and the Fifth Circuit said they didn't have jurisdiction to intervene. But the Supreme Court temporarily blocked the migrants' removal in April, and a month later, the high court said the Fifth Circuit was wrong to dismiss the appeal and sent the case back to the appellate court for further review.",
      "The Supreme Court also said the government hadn't given the migrants enough notice of their impending deportations, after they said they were told just 24 hours in advance.",
      "Since then, the government has filed an updated notice that gave migrants seven days' warning of their deportation. The Fifth Circuit said that is likely enough time to satisfy the migrants' right to due process, but sent the issue back to the district court for further review.",
      "The ruling was penned by Judge Leslie Southwick, who was nominated by President George W. Bush. Biden-nominated Judge Irma Carrillo Ramirez concurred with the part of the ruling that said there isn't an \"invasion\" or \"predatory incursion,\" but said seven days' notice isn't enough.",
      "Judge Andrew Oldham, whom Mr. Trump nominated in his first term, dissented.",
      "\"For 227 years, every President of every political party has enjoyed the same broad powers to repel threats to our Nation under the Alien Enemies Act ('AEA'). And from the dawn of our Nation until President Trump took office a second time, courts have never second-guessed the President's invocation of that Act. Not once,\" he wrote, arguing only the president can decide if the law applies. \"For President Trump, however, the rules are different.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Congress returns this week from its August recess staring down a deadline to fund the government and avert a possible shutdown by month's end.",
      "But a handful of other GOP priorities \u2014 from cracking down on crime to fast-tracking President Trump's nominees \u2014 have surfaced in recent weeks, along with lingering tensions and partisan disagreements, promising a chaotic return to Washington, and a lengthy to-do list.",
      "Here's what's on lawmakers' agenda as Congress returns:",
      "Government funding fight",
      "A familiar deadline is fast approaching, as Congress must race to keep the government funded by Sept. 30.",
      "While the House and Senate each passed a small number of funding bills before leaving Washington for the August recess, the two chambers have been on different pages when it comes to funding levels. Getting all 12 individual appropriations bills through both chambers is unlikely, meaning lawmakers will almost certainly have to rely on a short-term measure to keep the government funded.",
      "The dynamic isn't unusual. Congress regularly struggles to approve the new funding before the end of the fiscal year, opting instead to push the deadline down the road by keeping the government funded at current levels on a temporary basis. But this time around, the funding fight itself has taken on new meaning.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer came under intense scrutiny from his own party during the last funding fight in March. After pledging to fight the GOP plan, which increased defense spending while decreasing non-defense spending below 2024 levels, he changed course at the eleventh hour. Ultimately, Schumer opted to deliver one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel the partisan measure to passage and prevent a shutdown, arguing that a shutdown risked more damage.",
      "This time around, Democratic leaders have worked to engage on the funding issue well ahead of the deadline. Early last month, Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called for a \"Big Four\" meeting with their GOP counterparts to discuss funding the government. In a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson, the Democrats said that \"it is clear that the Trump Administration and many within your party are preparing to 'go it alone' and continue to legislate on a solely Republican basis.\"",
      "Still, the letter didn't appear to kickstart a bipartisan effort. And Mr. Trump, asked about meeting with the Democratic leaders last month, said he would do it, while saying it's \"almost a waste of time to meet because they never approve anything.\" The Democrats renewed their call for a meeting between congressional leaders last week, writing that the \"government funding issue must be resolved in a bipartisan way. That is the only viable path forward.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats have bemoaned the White House's efforts to claw back funds already appropriated in what's known as a rescissions package earlier this year, along with a new push by the administration last week to claw back nearly $5 billion in foreign aid funds that Congress already approved. The rarely used maneuver, known as a pocket rescission, is an attempt to rescind funding unilaterally, sparking pushback on Capitol Hill and bipartisan criticism as an \"unlawful\" move.",
      "\"Today's announcement of the Administration's plan to advance an unlawful 'pocket rescission' package is further proof President Trump and Congressional Republicans are hellbent on rejecting bipartisanship and 'going it alone' this fall,\" Schumer said in a statement.",
      "The dynamics put the parties on a collision course heading toward the Sept. 30 deadline.",
      "While Republicans have majorities in the House and Senate, they will need 60 votes in the Senate to keep the government funded, meaning they will need the support of at least seven Democrats.",
      "At the same time, some in the party, including Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, have encouraged Democrats to let the government shut down to protest Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "\"We cannot be the only one playing by the rules with a hand tied behind our backs,\" Martin said. \"That old playbook, the norms that, you know, used to have guardrails on our democracy and protect all of us in this country \u2014 that doesn't exist anymore. We've got to throw that playbook out the window because the Republicans have.\"",
      "Changes to Senate nomination rules",
      "Senators left Washington after a bruising nominations saga in July. Democrats have slow-walked Mr. Trump's nominees in recent months, putting up procedural hurdles to delay confirmations nearly across the board. Senate Democrats were unable to come to an agreement with the White House in an episode that foreshadowed a larger fight to come.",
      "\"Donald Trump tried to bully us, go around us, threaten us, call us names \u2014 but he got nothing. And he walked away with his tail between his legs,\" Schumer told reporters before leaving for the August recess.",
      "Schumer has railed against the White House for walking away from a deal involving the release of already appropriated funds in exchange for cooperation from Democrats to swiftly approve a group of nominees. Meanwhile, the president called the Democrat's demands \"egregious and unprecedented.\"",
      "Without a deal, Senate Republicans are expected to pursue changes to the nominations process that would allow them to more swiftly confirm the president's nominees upon their return.",
      "Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 2 Senate Republican, urged in an op-ed last week that it's \"time to change Senate confirmation rules\" amid what he described as a \"bitter fight\" over even routine nominations. He said that the Senate GOP is \"considering changes to the Senate rules to end the most egregious delay tactics.\"",
      "\"Senate Republicans are determined to confirm Mr. Trump's qualified nominees one way or another,\" Barrasso wrote.",
      "What the changes look like remains to be seen. Both Democrats and Republicans have made pushes to change the confirmation process in recent years, like by cutting down the time requirements for the nominations and reducing the number of votes needed to a simple majority.",
      "Confirming Trump's nominees for BLS chair and Fed governor",
      "The possible changes to the confirmation process come as a handful of new high-profile nominees are expected to come before the Senate, in addition to the dozens already awaiting votes.",
      "Mr. Trump fired the former Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner last month over a weaker-than-expected July jobs report. He soon announced E.J. Antoni as his nominee to lead the agency. Mr. Trump said in his announcement that Antoni, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, \"will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE.\"",
      "But the nominee could face pushback in the Senate, with questions about his experience and comments he's made suggesting the monthly jobs report should be suspended.",
      "The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions is planning to hold a confirmation hearing for Antoni pending completed paperwork, according to a committee spokesperson. The panel includes a handful of Senate Republicans who have pushed back on some of Mr. Trump's most controversial nominees this year: Sen. Bill Cassidy of Tennessee, the committee chairman, along with Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky.",
      "Democrats on the committee demanded that the panel hold a full hearing on Antoni's nomination. And Sen. Patty Murray of Washington called Antoni \"an unqualified right-wing extremist who won't think twice about manipulating BLS data.\"",
      "The Senate is also expected to work to confirm Stephen Miran, the chair of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, to fill a vacated seat on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors. Mr. Trump announced the nomination in August after Adriana Kugler stepped down. The Senate Banking Committee is set to hold a confirmation hearing this week. But Democrats on the committee have called for a delay, seeking instead to hold an oversight hearing on Mr. Trump's moves to fire another member of the Fed board.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump said he had fired another member of the Fed board, Lisa Cook, accusing her of making false statements on mortgage documents. Governors can only be fired \"for cause\" and Cook has refused to resign. She sued the president to block her firing last week.",
      "The push to oust Susan Monarez, the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, could also tee up another Senate confirmation process. The upper chamber confirmed Monarez for the post in late July, though she had been serving as the acting head of the CDC since January. CBS News reported last week that Jim O'Neill, the deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, has been selected to serve as the acting director of the CDC.",
      "Trump seeks crime bill, extension of DC police takeover",
      "Mr. Trump has moved to crack down on crime in the nation's capital by federalizing the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department and deploying the National Guard to the district to assist law enforcement. He signaled in recent weeks that he plans to ask Congress to approve \"long-term extensions\" to maintain control of D.C.'s police, along with other measures to address crime.",
      "In an Aug. 11 executive order, Mr. Trump directed the D.C. mayor to provide the services of D.C. police for federal use \"for the maximum period permitted under section 740 of the Home Rule Act,\" which the president can extend for up to 30 days. Any extension beyond that requires a joint resolution passed by the House and Senate. That could run into trouble in the Senate, where the Republican majority would need the support of at least seven Democrats to move forward.",
      "Mr. Trump also indicated last month that he plans to seek around $2 billion from Congress to renovate the streets of Washington. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said the White House was working on a package \"to improve the safety and quality of life in our nation's capital\" which he and GOP Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama would spearhead.",
      "\"He wants $2.5 billion, I'm going to try to find him the money, to repave the roads, take the graffiti off the building, refurbish the parts and give homeless people some place to go other than a tent on the side of the road,\" Graham said at an event in South Carolina last month.",
      "Mr. Trump has suggested that his crackdown on crime in D.C. could soon extend to other major cities, though he has unique authority in the nation's capital because the district is ultimately controlled by the federal government. Last week, the president wrote in a post on Truth Social about a crime bill, saying he's working with GOP leaders in Congress on the measure, though the details remained unclear.",
      "\"Speaker Mike Johnson, and Leader John Thune, are working with me, and other Republicans, on a Comprehensive Crime Bill,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's what our Country need, and NOW! More to follow.\"",
      "Push for Epstein files",
      "Lawmakers were on recess for weeks, but the calls for access to files in the case of late child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein haven't gone away.",
      "Controversy has swirled around the Epstein files since the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review in July that found no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein had blackmailed prominent figures. Epstein, a well-connected financier who was convicted of sex trafficking, died in federal custody in 2019. But renewed interest in the files has prompted members of both parties to call for more transparency, while dividing Mr. Trump's base.",
      "As House Democrats and some Republicans pushed for a floor vote to force the release of the Epstein files in late July, Johnson opted to send the House home early. But some lawmakers are still pressing ahead.",
      "Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, introduced legislation in July to compel the Justice Department to release the files within 30 days, with plans to force a vote on the measure once lawmakers return from recess. Massie and Khanna are set to host a news conference at the Capitol Wednesday alongside survivors of Epstein's abuse.",
      "The expected moves in Congress come after the administration late last month released transcripts of a two-day interview with Epstein's longtime associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, that was conducted in Florida in July. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice sent some of the files related to Epstein to the House Oversight Committee, which plans to make the records public after redactions have been made.",
      "Aaron  Navarro and \n                                                  \n                                  Nikole  Killion\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "Nine former CDC directors penned an op-ed in The New York Times condemning HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s leadership in the aftermath of the firing of the CDC director last week.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention penned an op-ed Monday condemning Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s leadership in the aftermath of the firing of the CDC director last week, claiming he is \"endangering every American's health.\"",
      "\"What the health and human services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has done to the CDC and to our nation's public health system over the past several months \u2014 culminating in his decision to fire Dr. Susan Monarez as CDC director days ago \u2014 is unlike anything we had ever seen at the agency and unlike anything our country had ever experienced,\" the nine former directors and acting directors wrote in the op-ed in The New York Times.",
      "The Trump administration attempted to oust CDC Director Susan Monarez last week, less than a month after she was confirmed by the Senate, although her lawyers have pushed back on the legality of her firing. Meanwhile, several other top CDC officials have resigned in recent days, pointing to disagreements with the Trump administration over its vaccine policy, among other things. CBS News reported last week that Jim O'Neill, the deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, has been selected to serve as the acting director of the CDC.",
      "In their op-ed, the former CDC directors who served under both Democrat and Republican administrations, pointed to a number of decisions by Kennedy that they say are \"unlike anything we had ever seen at the agency,\" including canceling investments into medical research and the move to replace members on a key vaccine advisory committee, among other things.",
      "\"Firing Dr. Monarez \u2014 which led to the resignations of top CDC officials \u2014 adds considerable fuel to this raging fire,\" the former CDC directors added.",
      "The CDC leaders said they \"applaud Dr. Monarez for standing up for the agency and the health of our communities.\"",
      "\"The loss of Dr. Monarez and other top leaders will make it far more difficult for the CDC to do what it has done for about 80 years: work around the clock to protect Americans from threats to their lives and health,\" they wrote.",
      "Meanwhile, the former CDC directors also called on Congress to exercise its oversight authority over the department of Health and Human Services. The CDC is one of a number of agencies under the HHS umbrella.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, called on HHS last week\u00a0 to \"indefinitely postpone\" its vaccine advisory committee meeting scheduled for Sept. 18 amid the slew of CDC departures. And the Louisiana Republican, who delivered the key vote to advance Kennedy's confirmation as secretary, also said the \"high profile departures will require oversight by the HELP Committee.\"",
      "When Cassidy was asked Tuesday evening if he regretted his vote to confirm Kennedy, he said, \"This is about children's health.\"",
      "\"This is about how we protect the children of the United States of America,\" Cassidy continued. \"And there's allegations that that health is being endangered. I'm not presupposing anybody's right or wrong. We got to get to the bottom of it, and it'll take radical transparency. My colleagues agree with that.\"",
      "In an appearance on Fox News last week after the CDC director firing, Kennedy said he wouldn't comment on personnel, but claimed that \"the CDC has problems,\" citing COVID-19 protocols among them.",
      "\"We need to look at the priorities of the agency, if there's really a deeply, deeply embedded, I would say, malaise at the agency,\" Kennedy said. \"And we need strong leadership that will go in there and that will be able to execute on President Trump's broad ambitions.\"",
      "Kennedy is set to appear before the Senate Finance Committee Thursday to testify on President Trump's health care agenda.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, says the timing of the op-ed \"has everything to do with Dr. Monarez's firing last week,\" but she added that \"the concerns that they outlined are really about politics and ideology taking precedence over public health and science.\"",
      "Citing the firings of federal health workers across HHS, the weakening of public health programs, questions about the effectiveness and safety of vaccines amid a serious measles outbreak in Texas, among other things, Gounder said on \"CBS Mornings Plus\" that \"we really are very concerned about how this is now diminishing trust in the very most basic of public health infrastructure in this country.\"",

      "President Trump announced the strike during an unrelated Tuesday afternoon Oval Office event, saying the military had \"shot out\" the boat \"moments ago.\" He said his team had been briefed on the strike by Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.",
      "The president later\u00a0said on Truth Social that 11 people were killed in the strike, which he said targeted members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuela-based organized crime group that the Trump administration has designated as a foreign terrorist organization. He posted a video that appeared to show a military strike against a small boat.",
      "\"Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!\" the president wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Rubio posted on X that the military carried out a \"lethal strike\" in the southern Caribbean Sea. He said the \"drug vessel\" had departed Venezuela and \"was being operated by a designated narco-terrorist organization.\" Rubio later told reporters he believed the drugs that were allegedly carried on the boat were probably headed toward Trinidad and Tobago or \"some other country in the Caribbean.\" A senior defense official also said the U.S. had conducted a \"precision strike\" against the vessel.",
      "The strike came after the U.S. confirmed last month\u00a0that the Navy would boost its presence near Venezuela, deploying three warships to the waters off the South American country as part of an anti-drug cartel mission. Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro called the ships an \"extravagant, unjustifiable, immoral and absolutely criminal and bloody threat\" and deployed military forces to the country's coastline, vowing to defend against any possible U.S. attack.",
      "The U.S. has not indicated it plans to strike Venezuela's government.",
      "The Trump administration has accused Maduro's government \u2014 a longtime U.S. foe \u2014 of working with drug cartels and groups like Tren de Aragua to traffic narcotics to the United States, and of leading a Venezuela-based drug group called Cartel de los Soles. Maduro was charged with narco-terrorism and drug trafficking in U.S. federal court in 2020. Last month, Attorney General Pam Bondi doubled the reward for Maduro's arrest to $50 million.",
      "Maduro has denied the allegations. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil called Bondi's move \"pathetic\" and a \"crude political propaganda operation.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump has touted himself as a Nobel-worthy peacemaker. Here's what some foreign policy analysts say about the disputes he cites.",
    "story": [
      "In recent weeks, President Trump has repeatedly claimed he deserves credit for ending six or seven wars during his first months in office, arguing that he should receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his work.",
      "\"I stopped seven wars, and they were, they're big ones too,\" Mr. Trump said Friday.",
      "\"I've settled six wars, and a lot of people say seven because there's one that nobody knows about,\" he said in an August 19 interview.",
      "A White House official provided a list of seven conflicts the president is referencing: Israel and Iran, Rwanda and Democratic Republic of the Congo, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Thailand and Cambodia, India and Pakistan, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Serbia and Kosovo.",
      "\"There has been more progress towards peace than ever before because of this President's leadership,\" the official wrote.",
      "The recipient of the 2025 Nobel Peace prize is expected to be announced next month.",
      "Over 100 people have received the award since the 19th-century chemist Alfred Nobel created the prize to honor a \"person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.\"",
      "Four U.S. presidents have been past laureates, most recently Barack Obama who received the prize for supporting nuclear nonproliferation and international diplomacy.",
      "Foreign policy experts say that while Mr. Trump has helped broker ceasefires, including one between Israel and Iran, several of the foreign conflicts cited by the administration were not full-scale wars \u2014 and many remain unresolved. The White House did not respond to a request for clarification on why the president has repeatedly labeled all seven conflicts as settled wars.",
      "Some of these peace efforts involved limited U.S. involvement, and in other instances, it remains unclear whether Mr. Trump's role was decisive.",
      "Here's a look at the conflicts:",
      "Israel and Iran",
      "After Israel attacked Iran's nuclear facilities in June, a 12-day conflict resulted in the deaths of about 28 Israelis and hundreds of Iranians before a ceasefire was reached with U.S. and Qatari involvement. Mr. Trump claimed credit, saying he had ordered U.S. airstrikes on Iran's uranium enrichment sites and pressed Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to hold back from further strikes.",
      "Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at Brookings, said Mr. Trump deserves some credit for this ceasefire. \"He managed to use a combination of a good relationship with Netanyahu, but also a willingness to put a little pressure on Netanyahu that I think contributed to the at least temporary cessation of hostilities,\" O'Hanlon said.",
      "But other foreign policy experts said tensions between the nations are far from resolved, and Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in early July that the Defense Department estimated the U.S. strikes likely delayed Iran's nuclear program by \"one to two years.\"",
      "Larry Haas, a senior fellow at the American Foreign Policy Council said, \"I very strongly disagree with the notion that the president brought peace to Iran and Israel. We may be in a quiet period in terms of direct confrontation, but Iran right now is trying to regroup.\"",
      "Rwanda and Democratic Republic of the Congo",
      "In June, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo announced a\u00a0peace deal after multiple days of talks in Washington mediated by President Trump and Qatar.",
      "The deal aimed to end three decades of fighting over Congo's mineral reserves. Yet the violence has continued, with both sides accusing each other of violating peace terms. Human Rights Watch reported that M23, an armed group that U.S. officials believe is backed by Rwanda, killed over 140 civilians in eastern Congo in July.",
      "\"It's a premature declaration of success, when in fact we are just getting to the starting line,\" O'Hanlon said.",
      "Armenia and Azerbaijan",
      "In August, Mr. Trump helped negotiate an agreement aimed at normalizing relations and\u00a0 reopening transportation routes between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which have spent decades fighting for control of the Karabakh region.",
      "O'Hanlon and Haas agreed the Trump administration pushed the deal forward in part by inviting both leaders to the White House. Leaders of both countries also credited Mr. Trump for the agreement, saying he should receive the Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "But the deal is not a formal peace agreement and requires ratification. One remaining sticking point is that Azerbaijan wants Armenia to remove any mention of territorial claims to Azerbaijan's land from its constitution before officials sign a final deal.\u00a0 Armenia's prime minister has expressed willingness to change the constitution but has not specified a date for a referendum.",
      "Thailand and Cambodia",
      "In late July, Thailand and Cambodia agreed to a ceasefire after an outbreak of fighting killed at least 35 people. President Trump said that he had pressured both sides to come to the table by threatening trade consequences.",
      "The U.S. is a top importer for both counties, and foreign policy experts CBS News spoke to said Mr. Trump's tariff threats played a significant role in securing a ceasefire. \"He helped move things along with economic pressure,\" Haas said.",
      "The border dispute is continuing, though, with Thai officials accusing Cambodia of laying new landmines. Cambodia denied doing so.",
      "India and Pakistan",
      "India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire in May after weeks of cross-border missile and drone strikes. The deal ended the latest flare-up in their long-running dispute over Kashmir, which both nuclear-armed nations claim as their territory.",
      "Pakistan credited the Trump administration's efforts in U.S.-led talks, and nominated him for the Nobel Peace prize. But India insisted its own pressure on Pakistan, not U.S. diplomacy, drove the deal.",
      "Josh Kurlantzick, a senior fellow for Southeast Asia and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, said it's a stretch to call the dispute over Kashmir settled.",
      "\"There is no real ending to this conflict,\" he said, noting that future negotiations could be complicated by Mr. Trump's decision to impose steep tariffs on India, a key partner.",
      "Egypt and Ethiopia",
      "Mr. Trump also claims he brokered peace between Ethiopia and Egypt, which have disagreed about Ethiopia's decision to construct a hydroelectric dam in the Nile.",
      "During his first term, Mr. Trump tried to\u00a0broker a deal between the countries and\u00a0suspended some aid to Ethiopia because of a lack of progress. In June, the president mentioned the dispute on Truth Social, writing, \"There is peace, at least for now, because of my intervention, and it will stay that way!\"",
      "No deals have been announced, however. Ethiopia still plans to officially open its dam in September over Egypt's objections that it will restrict the flow of water to its country. And while Egypt previously threatened to go to war over the dam, this conflict has remained a diplomatic one.",
      "O'Hanlon said of the dispute, \"I would not call the Egypt-Ethiopia interaction a war.\"",
      "Serbia and Kosovo",
      "In 2020, President Trump helped negotiate\u00a0a deal between Serbia and Kosovo to help normalize economic ties, but progress stalled afterward.",
      "Talks have continued with European leaders, but no breakthroughs have emerged. Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia in 2008, which Serbia still does not recognize.",
      "\"His deal-making, to the extent that it existed, actually occurred in his first term, and he really hasn't stopped what's going on,\" Haas said.",

      "In 2018 he had signed an order reestablishing U.S. Space Command, after it had been absorbed in 2002 into U.S. Strategic Command. Its main goal is to find ways to defend U.S. interests in space. In 2023, President Joe Biden had decided\u00a0instead to keep Space Command headquarters in Colorado, where its temporary headquarters was located, overturning Mr. Trump's first-term decision to move it to Alabama.",
      "Biden had been convinced by the head of Space Command at the time that moving its headquarters would jeopardize military readiness. His reversal prompted the House Armed Services Committee, chaired by Republican Mike Rogers of Alabama, to request the Pentagon's watchdog investigate the basing decision.",
      "The Defense Department inspector general said in a report that Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, would be the Air Force's preferred location for the command, but building facilities equal to the ones that were already in Colorado could take three to four years. According to the IG's report, Army Gen. James Dickinson, then the commander of U.S. Space Command, voiced concerns about the timeline's impact on the command's readiness, which contributed to the decision Biden had made to keep the headquarters in Colorado."

    "story": [
      "A new cryptocurrency issued by the Trump family's World Liberty Financial\u00a0and that started trading this week has boosted the family's wealth on paper by roughly $5 billion despite the digital token sinking in its first two days of being listed on the exchange.",
      "The crypto, called WLFI, reached a high of about 40 cents after launching on Monday, according to data from CoinMarketCap. By Tuesday morning, the value of the token had fallen to as low as about 21 cents, down 48% from its peak, before recovering to about 23 cents in the afternoon.",
      "Even with the decline, the Trump family's stake in WLFI is worth about $5 billion based on its holdings of 22.5 billion WLFI tokens. Mr. Trump and his family aren't yet able to sell their holdings as its founders' tokens remained locked, according to World Liberty Financial.",
      "World Liberty Financial didn't immediately return a request for comment. Here's what to know about the company's token.",
      "Trump's support for crypto",
      "Once an avowed skeptic of cryptocurrency, Mr. Trump has championed the digital asset in his second term, vowing to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "World Liberty Financial and the Trump family's other private crypto ventures have raised concerns among some watchdog groups and Democratic lawmakers over potential conflicts of interest.",
      "\"The media's continued attempts to fabricate conflicts of interest are irresponsible and reinforce the public's distrust in what they read,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Neither the president nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest.\"",
      "In July, Mr. Trump\u00a0signed the Genius Act, the first major federal law governing cryptocurrencies, into law. The act established federal regulations for \"stablecoins,\" which are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency because their value is pegged to fixed assets, like the dollar.",
      "The surging value of World Liberty Financial, whose co-founders include Mr. Trump and his sons Eric, Donald Jr. and Barron, underscores the president's growing interest in cryptocurrency, a focus that spans both personal investments and policy moves during his presidency. Those efforts include\u00a0$TRUMP and $Melania meme coins, which are cryptos whose value is linked to internet trends and which began trading in January.",
      "What is WLFI?",
      "WLFI is a token, or a digital asset, that guarantees its holders the right to vote on governance issues for World Liberty Financial, according to the company.",
      "World Liberty Financial cautions token owners that WLFI isn't an investment, with its terms stating: \"You should not acquire $WLFI as an investment on a speculative basis or otherwise, for a financial purpose or with an expectation of resale for a profit or otherwise.\"",
      "The early swing in WLFI's price isn't unusual for tokens making their market debut, said Nic Puckrin, CEO of Coin Bureau, a provider of crypto and blockchain information.",
      "\"The price action from 40 cents to 21 cents is typical for new token launches,\" Puckrin told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Early hype usually drives initial spikes, followed by a wave of selling as early entrants take profits.\"",
      "He added, \"Compared to other major token debuts, WLFI's decline is relatively moderate, and early backers have still seen strong returns from private sales.\"",
      "World Liberty Financial also offers a stablecoin called USD1, which is pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar. Because stablecoins are linked to fixed assets, they are generally seen as less volatile to other cryptos.",
      "\"WLFI is carving out a unique position by offering token holders real governance rights over the direction of USD1, a dollar-backed stablecoin that is growing rapidly,\" Puckrin said.",
      "That's important because WLFI holders, through their governance votes, can help influence the future development and policies of USD1 and World Liberty Financial's policies, he added. That capacity \"sets it apart in a crowded market,\" he said.",
      "What about insider concentration risk?",
      "The Trump family and other insiders own more than 20% of the WLFI tokens, according to World Liberty Financial's site.",
      "But World Liberty Financial's terms note that no single digital wallet can exercise more than 5% of governance power, which should deter outsized insider influence, Puckrin said.",
      "What's happening with Mr. Trump's other crypto ventures?",
      "In May, the $TRUMP meme coin drew scrutiny when the venture offered its top holders the chance to join Mr. Trump for dinner. Investors spent about $140 million to snap up the coins and secure an invite to the event, data showed at the time.",
      "That sparked concerns from government watchdogs and some Democratic lawmakers that the Trump-branded asset was being linked to gain access to the president.",
      "As investors snapped up the meme coin, the asset's value almost doubled to about $15 in May. Since then, the coin has given up most of the gains and was trading at about $8.30 on Tuesday, according to CoinMarketCap.",

    "summary": "GOP Rep. Thomas Massie took the first step in forcing a House vote to compel the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, filed a discharge petition\u00a0on Tuesday to attempt to force a House vote on compelling the release of files related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, resurfacing the saga upon Congress' return.",
      "Massie and Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, introduced\u00a0legislation\u00a0in July that would require the Justice Department to release the Epstein files within 30 days. They planned to force a vote on the bill once lawmakers returned from their lengthy August recess.",
      "Although leadership controls the House's agenda and what legislation receives a vote, individual lawmakers can \"discharge\" legislation that has been sitting in committee. A discharge petition enables 218 members, a majority of the lower chamber, to provide their signatures and effectively bypass leadership to bring a bill before the full House for a vote.",
      "Khanna told NPR News on Tuesday that he's \"very confident\" all 212 Democrats will support the petition, along with more than the six Republicans needed to force a vote in the House.",
      "Before lawmakers left Washington, House Democrats and some Republicans had pushed for a floor vote to force the release of the files, but House Speaker Mike Johnson opted to send the House home early amid the pressure. As lawmakers returned to Washington on Tuesday, House Republican leadership added a bill to the House schedule for the week that would direct the House Oversight Committee to \"continue its ongoing investigation into the possible mismanagement of the Federal government's investigation of Mr. Jeffrey Epstein and Ms. Ghislaine Maxwell,\" Epstein's co-conspirator who is serving a 20-year prison sentence.",
      "Massie criticized the move, calling it a \"meaningless vote to provide political cover for those members who don't support our bipartisan legislation to force the release of the Epstein files.\"",
      "Johnson told reporters in response that he would describe \"virtually everything Thomas Massie says related to this issue as meaningless.\" And the speaker defended how the administration and Congress have approached the documents so far, telling CBS News that \"there's been a lot of things that transpired over the August district work period.\"",
      "\"The Oversight Committee is well underway, the administration is complying. The Department of Justice complied with all the subpoenas they received and are processing 34,000 documents already,\" Johnson said. \"And we're going to move that along as quickly as possible so that all of this is pushed out to the public so the American people can make their own decisions.\"",
      "Epstein was convicted of sex trafficking and died in federal custody in 2019 in what numerous investigations deemed a suicide. But the push to release the Epstein files reached a fever pitch, including among President Trump's base, after the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review in July that found no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein had blackmailed prominent figures. And the development has prompted calls for more transparency from both sides of the aisle.",
      "Members of the House Oversight Committee are meeting with survivors of Epstein's abuse Tuesday. And Massie and Khanna are set to host a news conference at the Capitol on Wednesday alongside survivors.",
      "The developments come after the Trump administration released transcripts of a two-day interview with Maxwell late last month. The Oversight Committee has also said it plans to make public records it received from the Justice Department related to Epstein after redactions have been made.",
      "Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, told Fox News on Sunday that \"we're going to make this information public \u2014 that's what the American people want,\" while noting that \"it's very complicated because there are victims of the Epstein files, and we want to listen to those victims and their families and their attorneys to see how best can we present this information.\"",

      "The Department of Energy's 151-page report, \"A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate,\" was written by five authors who were hand-selected by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former fossil fuel executive. It included a controversial conclusion that \"carbon dioxide-induced warming appears to be less damaging economically than commonly believed,\" and it states that \"aggressive mitigation strategies\" to address greenhouse gas emissions \"could be more harmful than beneficial\" \u2014 a statement that supports the oil and gas industry.",
      "\"Climate change is real, and it deserves attention. But it is not the greatest threat facing humanity,\" Wright said in a statement supporting the report's publication and conclusions.",
      "In August, environmental groups and independent scientists sued the Energy Department over the report, arguing the way it was written and produced violated transparency laws. Tuesday's review is the latest in a series of actions climate experts have taken to tackle the Energy report that they say is an insult to climate and environmental science.",
      "\"Climate science is probably one of the most robust and scrutinized scientific fields in the history of science because of the economic implications,\" said Andrew Dessler, director of the Texas Center for Extreme Weather at Texas A&M University, who felt the report made \"a mockery of science.\"",
      "He immediately expressed his frustration on social media and discovered he wasn't the only one upset by the report.",
      "\"I can't tell you how many people looked at this and agreed with me that this was a mockery and we needed to respond to it,\" Dessler told CBS News.",
      "In less than a month, Dessler helped organize more than 85 international climate experts, mostly from universities, from the United States, Europe, Asia, Australia and Canada, who voluntarily reviewed the DOE report and found that it was \"full of errors,\" \"biased\" and \"not fit to inform policy.\"",
      "They have submitted their response to the DOE, which provided a 30-day window for public comment on the report. As of Sept. 1, there were more than 2,333 comments submitted.",
      "Asked about the criticism, the Department of Energy told CBS News in a statement, \"Unlike previous administrations, the Trump administration is committed to engaging in a more thoughtful and science-based conversation about climate change and energy. Following the public comment period, we look forward to reviewing and engaging on substantive comments.\"",
      "\"We have no idea what they're gonna do with the comments,\" said Dessler, \"They're never going to convince people that carbon dioxide isn't important, but what they want to do is create doubt.\"",
      "Dessler and his colleagues are not the only ones who are concerned about the DOE report and its findings. The American Meteorological Society also published its own response, finding \"five foundational flaws\" that it says \"places the report at odds with scientific principles and practices.\"",
      "The review spends the majority of the 439 pages outlining the list of errors experts found, which Dessler described as, \"selectively\" citing scientific literature, saying, \"How can you provide a respectable view of science when you don't know what the literature says, you're not reading it, you're not citing it ... and you're not giving the right context.\"",
      "But some critics say the report by the DOE is representative of a larger trend in the federal government under the Trump administration to organize selective committees that publish reports, which are politically advantageous to support policy decisions.",
      "\"It's clear that this administration wants to take control, at the political level, of the scientific process of the government,\" said Dr. John Balbus, who was formerly at the Department of Health and Human Services as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Climate Change and Health Equity.",
      "Balbus points to a similar playbook occurring at HHS around vaccines and political appointees relying on questionable opinions and misrepresentations of scientific reports to come to a conclusion that vaccines cause more harm than good, \"Which is a ludicrous and completely unsubstantiated assertion,\" he says.",
      "Although the Trump administration has fired thousands of scientists and experts across several government agencies, many have regrouped in the private sector to launch coordinated responses to counter the misinformation they perceive is being broadcast by the federal government.",
      "Last month, several major health organizations issued their own guidelines on COVID-19 vaccines, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, which runs counter to the recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "In May, after President Trump fired 400 scientists who were working to publish the nation's major quadrennial report on the impacts of climate change in the U.S., two scientific groups announced a plan to publish a special collection focused on the subject to ensure the scientists' work can be accessed.",
      "In addition to these efforts, many federal employees that remain with agencies have taken the risk of signing letters to Congress to express their concerns about changes in policy, including members of Health and Human Services and the Environmental Protection Agency, both of which have faced retaliation for these efforts.",
      "\"When you see nearly a thousand public servants risking their livelihoods to alert the public that senior officials cannot be trusted, that is a clear warning,\" said Balbus, who believes these individuals will continue to sustain their fight against misinformation, as long as they're allowed to.",

      "\"After a tremendous amount of prayer and reflection, I will not be seeking reelection in 2026,\" Ernst said in a video announcement.",
      "Ernst, 55, was elected to the Senate in 2014, becoming the first woman to represent Iowa and the first female combat veteran to serve in the upper chamber. In her announcement Tuesday, Ernst said \"this was no easy decision,\" adding, \"I never imagined this farm girl would have the opportunity to serve as a lieutenant colonel and then a United States senator.\"",
      "CBS News first\u00a0reported\u00a0last week that Ernst was planning to reveal that she wouldn't seek another term.",
      "The decision comes after the Iowa Republican faced criticism in recent months from both sides of the aisle \u2014 from Democrats over comments she made about Medicaid cuts, and from her own party over her initial reluctance to support Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's confirmation earlier this year.",
      "Ernst's decision not to seek reelection opens up a seat in Iowa, where Democrats are hoping to make inroads as the party seeks to take control of the Senate in the midterm elections. But a Democratic candidate would face steep odds in a state Mr. Trump won by more than 13 points in 2024, and Iowa hasn't elected a Democrat to the Senate since 2008. That dynamic hasn't stopped a crowded field of Democrats from emerging, with state Rep. Josh Turek, state Sen. Zach Wahls and Nathan Sage, executive director of the Knoxville Chamber of Commerce, all vying for the nomination.",
      "Among Republicans, speculation has circulated about whether Rep. Ashley Hinson, who's represented the state in the House since 2023, could enter the race, along with Matt Whitaker, the U.S. ambassador to NATO.",
      "Ernst celebrated her work in the Senate in her announcement, touting legislation to prevent violence against women, support farmers and veterans, and cut waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government.",
      "\"While this chapter of elected service will soon close, I will always find ways to best serve my community, state and these great United States of America,\" Ernst said.",

      "Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Justice Department are facing blowback over their effort to block a lawsuit from members of the far-right Proud Boys, who are seeking financial reimbursement for their criminal cases and imprisonment for offenses stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot.",
      "The Proud Boys Jan. 6 rioters, who met in a social media \"X spaces\" gathering last month, are calling for Bondi's resignation, after the Justice Department filed a motion in federal court in Florida last week, asking a judge to dismiss a civil lawsuit filed by Enrique Tarrio, Zachary Rehl, Domenic Pezzola and other Proud Boys. All the men were imprisoned for their roles in the riot before President Trump pardoned them on the day he was inaugurated for his second term.",
      "The Proud Boys' lawsuit seeks more than $100 million in damages and alleges the men suffered \"A parade of horribles: egregious and systemic abuse of the legal system and the United States Constitution to punish and oppress political allies of President Trump, by any and all means necessary, legal, or illegal.\"",
      "\"Through the use of evidence tampering, witness intimidation, violations of attorney-client privilege, and placing spies to report on trial strategy, the government got its fondest wish of imprisoning the J6 Defendants,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "In a filing on Aug. 25, the Justice Department responded that the Jan. 6 defendants had not yet exhausted administrative remedies before they filed suit and also argued the U.S. enjoys sovereign immunity from such claims.",
      "An attorney for Jan. 6 defendants sent a statement to CBS News, saying, \"Motions to dismiss are a common reaction to a civil complaint, and we anticipated that the attorney the government assigned to the case would make such a motion.\u00a0 We are confident that the Court will see that the Federal government's outrageous treatment of my clients justifies allowing the suit to continue. \"",
      "In their publicly posted X spaces meeting video, Jan. 6 defendants and supporters blistered the Justice Department for opposing the Proud Boys' civil challenge.",
      "Isaac Thomas, a pardoned Jan. 6 defendant from Michigan who participated in the meeting, said, \"Unfortunately, Pam Bondi's DOJ seems to be advocating for the same things that the Biden regime was advocating for. A long time ago, I joined the call of Trump supporters saying that Pam Bondi needs to step down.\" Thomas said the Jan. 6 defendants \"have been dumped out.\"",
      "Mark McCloskey, an attorney who said he is seeking financial payments for Capitol riot defendants, said in the video he was \"very disappointed\" in the Justice Department's challenge to the Proud Boys lawsuit. He said if the Justice Department opposes other legal challenges seeking restitution or financial awards for Jan. 6 defendants, \"It's going to make our lives very difficult.\"",
      "He predicted more legal challenges would be coming, as some of the more than 1,500 Jan. 6 defendants pursue financial compensation, and he referenced \"hundreds\" of people who could be impacted.",
      "The Justice Department did not have an immediate comment to the recent Jan. 6 defendants' online meeting.",
      "The civil lawsuit filed by Proud Boys members also alleges malicious prosecution and violation of Fourth Amendment protections, claims that the Justice Department rebutted in its response to the suit.",
      "In their Aug. 25 filing, the Justice Department argued the Proud Boys defendants failed to sufficiently demonstrate the case was \"malicious\" and that their constitutional rights had been violated. The 17-page filing from the department did not address whether the men had been rightfully or wrongfully convicted by a jury.",
      "The Proud Boys also allege harsh conditions in jail in their lawsuit, and it referenced the language used in President Trump's pardon order for Capitol insurrection defendants, which said, \"This proclamation ends a grave national injustice that has been perpetrated upon the American people over the last four years and is a process of national reconciliation.\"",
      "An attorney who filed the suit did not immediately respond to requests for comment from CBS News.",
      "A Justice Department attorney who filed the motion to dismiss the Jan. 6 defendants' lawsuit has been harshly criticized by name on social media.

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer ruled in favor of California Gov. Gavin Newsom in his challenge to President Trump's deployment of troops to Los Angeles.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal court in California ruled Tuesday that the Trump administration violated federal law when it deployed members of the National Guard and active-duty U.S. Marines to Los Angeles earlier this summer in response to protests against immigration enforcement operations.",
      "In a 52-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer found that the president and his administration violated the Posse Comitatus Act, a 1878 law that prohibits the use of the military for domestic law enforcement. Breyer blocked the Trump administration from deploying or using the National Guard currently deployed in California, and any military troops in the state, for civilian law enforcement.",
      "His decision restricts the use of service members to engage in arrests, apprehensions, searches, seizures and traffic and crowd control. The injunction applies only to the Trump administration's use of the National Guard in California, not nationally, and it does not require the Defense Department to withdraw the 300 National Guard troops who remain in Los Angeles. Breyer noted that the administration is not prohibited from using troops consistent with the Posse Comitatus Act, and wrote that they can continue to protect federal property in a manner allowed under the law.",
      "The judge froze his injunction until noon on Sept. 12, likely to allow the Trump administration time to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.",
      "\"Today, the court sided with democracy and the Constitution. No president is a king \u2014 not even Trump \u2014 and no president can trample a state's power to protect its people,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in response to the decision. He said Mr. Trump's use of the military \"as his personal police force is illegal, authoritarian, and must be stopped in every courtroom across this country.\"",
      "Anna Kelly, a White House spokesperson, indicated that the Justice Department will appeal the ruling.",
      "\"Once again, a rogue judge is trying to usurp the authority of the commander-in-chief to protect American cities from violence and destruction. President Trump saved Los Angeles, which was overrun by deranged leftist lunatics sowing mass chaos until he stepped in,\" she said in a statement. \"While far-left courts try to stop President Trump from carrying out his mandate to Make America Safe Again, the president is committed to protecting law-abiding citizens, and this will not be the final say on the issue.\"",
      "Breyer's ruling came after he held a three-day trial in the case brought by Newsom in June. The Democratic governor\u00a0sued in response to Mr. Trump's decision to deploy members of California's National Guard to Los Angeles to quell protests against immigration enforcement operations taking place in the area. The president invoked a law known as Title 10 to send the California National Guard to Los Angeles to protect federal property and personnel.",
      "The judge granted temporary relief to California officials in June that required the Trump administration not to deploy the California National Guard in Los Angeles and return control to Newsom. But a three-judge panel on the 9th Circuit found it likely that Mr. Trump lawfully federalized the California National Guard under a different law, Title 10.",
      "Those earlier proceedings did not involve the Posse Comitatus Act. Breyer, appointed by former President Bill Clinton, held the trial on the merits of Newsom's arguments that the president violated that 147-year-old law last month.",
      "The judge's ruling",
      "The judge wrote in his ruling that the evidence put forth at the trial established that the Trump administration \"systematically used armed soldiers (whose identity was often obscured by protective armor) and military vehicles to set up protective perimeters and traffic blockades, engage in crowd control, and otherwise demonstrate a military presence in and around Los Angeles. In short, Defendants violated the Posse Comitatus Act,\" Breyer wrote.",
      "While the Pentagon withdrew roughly the 700 U.S. Marines who had been sent to Los Angeles, Breyer noted that there are still 300 National Guard members stationed there nearly three months after they were first mobilized.",
      "\"Moreover, President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have stated their intention to call National Guard troops into federal service in other cities across the country \u2014 including Oakland and San Francisco, here in the Northern District of California \u2014 thus creating a national police force with the President as its chief,\" Breyer wrote.",
      "The judge said that the Trump administration intentionally initiated the deployment of the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles to establish a military presence there and enforce federal law. He called that conduct a \"serious violation\" of federal law prohibiting the use of the military for domestic law enforcement.",
      "\"In fact, these violations were part of a top-down, systemic effort by Defendants to use military troops to execute various sectors of federal law (the drug laws and the immigration laws at least) across hundreds of miles and over the course of several months \u2014 and counting,\" Breyer wrote.",
      "Breyer rejected the administration's argument that the president's constitutional powers allow him to override the restrictions in the Posse Comitatus Act.",
      "\"Under this 'constitutional exception,' as Defendants call it, the President has inherent constitutional authority to protect federal property, federal personnel, and federal functions, so any actions that can be construed as such 'protection' are lawful in spite of the Posse Comitatus Act,\" he wrote. \"This assertion is not grounded in the history of the Act, Supreme Court jurisprudence on executive authority, or common sense.\"",
      "The judge said that Congress was clear about what constitutes an exception to the law, precluding the president from exercising all but his express authority under the Constitution. He also accused the Trump administration of attempting to usurp Congress' authority.",
      "\"That Defendants characterize this as an 'exception' to the statute is mere wordplay; it does not change the fact that they seek to override Congress's legitimate exercise of its own authority,\" Breyer wrote.",
      "Attorneys for California had sought an injunction that blocked National Guard forces from participating in and protecting federal agents during immigration enforcement operations, and Breyer agreed to grant their request. The Trump administration had argued that Title 10 is an exception to the Posse Comitatus Act and therefore didn't apply to National Guard troops who were called into federal service.",
      "The judge wrote that while there is \"no question that federal personnel should be able to perform their jobs without fearing for their safety,\" the Trump administration cannot \"use this as a hook to send military troops alongside federal agents wherever they go.\"",
      "Since the 9th Circuit allowed the Trump administration to keep the National Guard in California, the president has moved to deploy troops to Washington, D.C.\u00a0Mr. Trump has also teased sending the National Guard to other major cities throughout the country in what he casts as a looming crackdown against illegal immigration, violent crime and civil unrest.",
      "As of Monday, there are over 2,200 National Guard members in Washington, D.C., with over half of those troops sent by Republican governors throughout the country.",

    "story": [
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is at a crossroads. Last week, CDC Director Susan Monarez was ousted less than a month into her tenure after resisting Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s push to align with his vaccine policy agenda. Within hours, three senior leaders \u2014 including the chief medical officer and the heads of vaccine safety and respiratory infections \u2014 resigned in protest. Their exits capped weeks of mounting tension: biased scientific reviews, the withdrawal of key documents, and a shooting at CDC headquarters tied to COVID misinformation. Hundreds of staff publicly applauded the departing scientists in a rare \"clap-out.\"",
      "Into that vacuum stepped Jim O'Neill, deputy secretary of Health and Human Services, now installed as acting CDC director.",
      "O'Neill's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 breaks sharply with CDC tradition. A Bush-era HHS official turned Silicon Valley investor, he is neither a physician nor a scientist \u2014 an unusual profile for the agency's top post. He is expected to retain his deputy role at HHS while leading the CDC. After his early government service, O'Neill spent nearly two decades in close partnership with billionaire Peter Thiel, managing his funds, directing the Thiel Foundation, and co-founding the Thiel Fellowship. He also led the SENS Research Foundation, a nonprofit focused on anti-aging science. In June, he returned to Washington as deputy secretary; he now holds that position alongside his role as CDC director.",
      "Former colleagues on both sides of the aisle describe him as smart and diligent, with a deep knowledge of HHS mechanics. They also note his libertarian streak, which could align him well with Secretary Kennedy but set him at odds with school vaccination requirements. His most controversial stance, voiced in 2014, was that the FDA should approve drugs once proven safe, leaving effectiveness to be determined in the marketplace \u2014 a proposal widely criticized by public health experts as dangerous.",
      "O'Neill insists he is \"very strongly pro-vaccine,\" but his recent post on social media \u2014 asking if \"omicron is the best vaccine\" and suggesting CDC could \"redefine the word vaccine at will\" \u2014 sparked new concerns about his grasp of vaccine science. Experts counter that infection is not the same as vaccination, which confers protection without the risks of acute illness or long COVID.",
      "He could wear both hats for some time. The White House and Kennedy appear eager to avoid a bruising Senate confirmation fight. Until COVID, the CDC director was not a Senate-confirmed position; Republicans changed that in the pandemic's aftermath. Leaving O'Neill in an \"acting\" role could paralyze major decision-making at the agency for the foreseeable future.",
      "Meanwhile, the CDC's vaccine advisory committee \u2014 made up of all new Kennedy appointees \u2014 is preparing for a pivotal September meeting. On the agenda: the newborn hepatitis B dose, infant RSV protection, COVID vaccination for healthy children and young adults, and the combined measles-mumps-rubella-varicella shot. Revisiting so many long-standing childhood immunizations at once would be unprecedented. If recommendations are weakened, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program and the Vaccines for Children program could restrict coverage, creating new barriers for families.",
      "The stakes for CDC are profound. O'Neill has promised to \"refocus CDC on infectious disease\" and \"restore trust,\" yet staff and state partners say politicized decisions and budget cuts are already eroding core work.",
      "The September vaccine advisory meeting will be the first real test for O'Neill. If he restores scientific processes, including transparent reviews, expert briefings, and evidence being vetted and posted before votes, CDC insiders say he could stabilize morale at the agency and preserve the credibility of its scientifically based recommendations. If not, the resignations of senior scientists may prove the start of a broader exodus, leaving states and families without clear guidance just as flu, RSV and COVID converge this fall.",

Mike Kehoe announcing Friday that he had called for the state's Legislature to convene on Sept. 3 to redraw the state's congressional districts. Missouri has eight representatives in Congress, two of whom are Democrats.",
      "Challenges remain for both Texas and California's new maps. While Texas law only requires the Legislature and the governor's approval to set the congressional maps, civil rights groups have already challenged them in court, accusing the maps of being racially biased. The maps the GOP-controlled Legislature created in 2021 are still being litigated in court.",
      "In California, the state's congressional map must be approved by voters before it takes effect. The Democratic-controlled Assembly and State Senate both approved a measure called Proposition 50 for the Nov. 4 ballot that, if approved, will overhaul the state's congressional maps. California Republicans challenged the maps in court, saying Democrats ignored the 30-day public review period for new legislation, although the state Supreme Court denied the petition on Aug. 27.",
      "Congressional maps are normally redrawn every 10 years after the U.S. Census reveals population shifts. But this rare mid-decade redistricting push was kicked off by President Trump in mid-July as Republicans seek to maintain \u2014 or even expand \u2014 their razor-thin majority in Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Historically speaking, midterm elections are often a rebuke of the party in the White House. Mr. Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson zeroed in on Texas, with the president claiming Republicans could gain an extra five seats given how the state voted in 2024.",
      "Abbott then called a special session of the Legislature with redistricting on the agenda. But two weeks into the 30-day special session, Texas Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum and prevent the legislation from coming to the floor.",
      "The Democrats ultimately returned after two weeks, and the legislation was passed, but they garnered significant national attention. Although California requires congressional maps to be approved by voters, Newsom vowed to redraw the state's districts to garner up to five seats for Democrats to counter Texas.",
      "Amid this push, other states have also started to discuss redistricting efforts, with Indiana Republicans having met with Mr. Trump and members of his administration on Aug. 27 to try to redraw the state's nine congressional districts to try to oust the two Democratic members. Florida's Republican House speaker last month created a special committee to look into the possibility there.",
      "Although both parties are trying to rig their state's congressional districts to be favorable to themselves, the outcome is far from guaranteed.",
      "\"Computers and technology do give us a lot more ability to to make predictive statements about outcomes, but we're doing it \u2014 I think it's fair to say \u2014 in a very volatile environment politically, where things that we have seen as trends are sort of being turned on their heads,\" said Kareem Crayton, vice president of the Washington, D.C.-based the Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "Crayton noted several current issues that could factor heavily into voters' decisions, and called it \"folly to assume that just because people showed up and voted for the current president of the United States, that people want to show up for a member of Congress, particularly \u2026 a new candidate in a district that hasn't been created before.\"",

      "Liberal Austin is further dissolved into neighboring districts under the proposed maps. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who was first elected in 1994 and whose district gave former Vice President Kamala Harris her largest margin of victory in all of Texas, announced in August that he would not seek reelection if the proposed maps are upheld by the courts, avoiding a primary with Rep. Greg Casar, also of Austin.",
      "California currently has 52 representatives in Congress, nine of whom are Republicans and 43 are Democrats. The GOP has made inroads in the Golden State, starting in 2020, when Republicans flipped three Democratic-held seats for the first time since 1994. Republicans have held onto two of them, including Rep. David Valadao's 22nd District in the Central Valley.",
      "Under the proposed map, Valadao's district would go from being 47% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 49% Democratic, making him slightly more vulnerable. And GOP Rep. Darrell Issa's 48th District near San Diego would change from 42% to 52% Democratic.",
      "Other Republican strongholds in Central California have been spread into other districts. Rep. Ken Calvert's 41st District in Riverside would be redrawn further toward Los Angeles, shifting it from a district that was 47% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 57% Democratic under the proposed maps.",
      "In Northern California, Districts 1 and 3 both have dramatic shifts. GOP Rep. Doug LaMalfa's District 1, which includes the most northeastern part of the state, would shift further south toward Marin County and the northern part is absorbed in the 2nd District, home to heavily Democratic Eureka and the northern Pacific coast. Rep. Kevin Kiley's 3rd Congressional District, which snakes along the California-Nevada border through Death Valley, would instead move further toward heavily Democratic Sacramento. Republican Rep. Tom McClintock's 5th District would be shifted to include the southern portions of what was Kiley's district.",
      "Kiley, whose district would go from one that was 48% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 55% Democratic, has been an outspoken critic of redistricting, even introducing legislation in the House to ban mid-decade redistricting.",

      "ED O'KEEFE: I'm Ed O'Keefe in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: With President Trump looking to expand immigration and crime crackdowns in more U.S. cities, we will hear exclusively from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.",
      "Boosted by a drop in crime in the nation's capital following the deployment of federal law enforcement and National Guard troops to clean up D.C., the president sets his sights on another potential target, Chicago.",
      "We visited the Windy City and toured a neighborhood where the crime rate has dropped with the governor of Illinois, Democrat J.B. Pritzker.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER (D-Illinois): What they're saying they're trying to do is fight crime, but, actually, they're just trying to scare people.",
      "(End VT)",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Pritzker tells us Trump and Secretary Noem's mission is un- American.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: It's clear that, in secret, they're planning this \u2013 well, it's an invasion with U.S. troops if they in fact do that.",
      "(End VT)",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Plus: the shakeup at the Centers for Disease Control. After the firing of the newly confirmed director, a group of top experts quit in protest. CBS medical contributor Dr. Celine Gounder will tell us why this matters to public health.",
      "Then, World Food Programme executive director Cindy McCain joins us following a trip to Gaza, where her organization is working to feed hundreds of thousands threatened by famine.",
      "Finally, we will reflect on the passing of a Washington institution, legendary CBS News radio reporter Mark Knoller.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. Margaret is off on this Labor Day weekend. I'm Ed O'Keefe.",
      "We begin today with Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, who's joining us from Florida.",
      "Madam Secretary, thanks for being with us.",
      "KRISTI NOEM (U.S. Homeland Security Secretary): Absolutely, Ed. Thank you for inviting me.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes. Well, we have a lot to discuss.",
      "And we want to start with this, because we've learned that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is planning on expanding operations in the coming days to Chicago. When are those operations expected to start? And you said in recent days that you're using the recent deployments in Los Angeles as a model. What does that mean?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Well, we've already had ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago and throughout Illinois and other states, making sure that we're upholding our laws.",
      "But we do intend to add more resources to those operations. I won't disclose the details because they are law enforcement and investigative folks that are on the ground there, and I want to make sure we keep their security our number one priority.",
      "But we will continue to go after the worst of the worst across the country, like President Trump has told us to do, focusing on those that are perpetuating murder and rape and trafficking of drugs and humans across our country, knowing that every single citizen deserves to be safe.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Part of what distinguished the Los Angeles operations, however, is that National Guard troops were there, in essence, protecting or backing up those federal agents as they conducted operations.",
      "Is that what we should expect to see in Chicago?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: You know, that always is a prerogative of President Trump and his decision. I won't speak to the specifics of the operations that are planned in other cities, but I do know that L.A. wouldn't be standing today if President Trump hadn't taken action.",
      "And that city would have burned down if left to the devices of the mayor and the governor of that state. And so the citizens who live there, the small business owners in downtown L.A., they're thankful that President Trump came in with federal law enforcement officers and helped support keeping those streets open, keep their homes and businesses from burning down, and made sure the law and order was restored.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: I just want to clarify one thing you said there. You said L.A. wouldn't be standing if not for these federal deployments?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: So many of those homes and businesses that were in downtown L.A. and in those areas were dealing with riots and violence. And coming in and bringing those federal law enforcement officers in was incredibly important to keeping peace.",
      "And so we are grateful that President Trump was willing to send resources and people in, in order to enforce the law. And, Ed, since then, we have arrested 5,000 dangerous illegal criminals out of L.A. and removed them from our country and had them face justice for their crimes.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: So, as you know, we spoke with Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker about all this. And I asked him what he'd say to you about these forthcoming plans. Let's play that and let you respond after.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "ED O'KEEFE: If she were to call you, what would you say? What's your message to her?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER (D-Illinois): Well, I tell her that what she's doing is inflaming passions and causing disruption that doesn't need to be caused.",
      "We have people that have lived, yes, in the state of Illinois, in the city of Chicago for decades, working here, paying taxes. They're law-abiding members of our communities, friends, neighbors. And why are we arresting them? Why are we making them disappear?",
      "Indeed, they're even disrupting the lives of people who are attempting to go through a legal process to stay in this country, who've been invited to a hearing, and then they're arresting them in the hallways on their way to that hearing.",
      "So this is dangerous. They shouldn't be doing it. It's anti-American. It's un-American. And I would tell her to maybe check herself for, what does she really believe?",
      "ED O'KEEFE: She's also critical the fact that Chicago is one of the cities that doesn't cooperate with federal immigration operations, and she was quoted as saying that Illinois \u2013 quote \u2013 \"refuses to have our back.\"",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: Well, that's not true. In fact, there were police officers who made sure that there was nobody interfering or attacking or causing problems for the ICE officials that were here.",
      "People have a right to express themselves. People have a right to their First Amendment, you know, freedom to express. And we protect that too in the city of Chicago. So it's not true that the nobody has their backs.",
      "What we won't do, however, is engage in what is a federal effort. That is to say, they have their job, immigration. We have our job, which is to fight violent crime on the streets of our city. And, by the way, we're succeeding at that job. But when they bring people in and don't coordinate with us, they're going to cause enormous problems.",
      "(End VT)",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Madam Secretary, your response?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Well, for 13 consecutive years, Chicago had more murders than any other American city. In fact, just last year, in 2024, they had three times the amount of murders that L.A. did, five times more than New York City.",
      "So he can talk about what a great job he's doing as governor, but he's failing those families who will no longer have their child with them, their mother or their father or their cousin, aunt, and uncle that are gone forever because of the violence that's happening in Chicago.",
      "So I was a governor for many years. So I recognize the responsibilities that you have on your shoulder when you're a governor. And I will tell you, as a governor, when I had to make tough decisions, and when I had disagreements with the Biden administration or challenges my people were facing, I called up the Biden administration.",
      "I went and talked to them. I asked for meetings. I fought for my people. This seems like it's more about Governor Pritzker's ego now, rather than actually protecting his people. If he has one murder in the city of Chicago, he should be calling President Trump and saying, what's your ideas? What can we do?",
      "They don't even honor our detainers in Chicago. They don't go out there and work with us to make sure we're bringing people to justice. And, instead, he goes on TV and he attacks me, when we're doing exactly what those people need, is, they need someone to help them get the dangerous criminals off their streets.",
      "And if he has one, two, five or 10, those victims and their families deserve to walk in freedom on those streets and not have to worry about what's going to happen to them on their way to their jobs.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Sure.",
      "Are you planning, beyond Chicago, to expand these kinds of operations to other cities? There have been reports, for example, that Boston may very well soon be next.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: I think there's a lot of cities that are dealing with crime and violence right now.",
      "And so we haven't taken anything off the table. We've been making sure that we have the resources and the equipment to go in. We've been working to partner with every single agency that we can. We have hundreds and hundreds of agreements with local law enforcement, sheriffs, city administrators that \u2013 and mayors across the country that want to solve problems.",
      "I would encourage every single big city, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, whatever they are, if they want to help make their city safer, more prosperous, allow people the opportunity to walk in freedom, like the people of Washington, D.C. are now, and enjoying going out to eat at night and not having to worry if they're going to be a victim of a carjacking or a robbery, they should call us.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: You mentioned there are a bunch of cities in Democratic- controlled states with Democratic mayors. And there have been a lot of questions asked about that focus.",
      "There are Republican cities with major crime issues as well, and we haven't heard about plans to deploy, say, to Dallas or to Oklahoma City, or to cities in Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi that have considerable crime rates, in some cases higher, percentage-wise, than those other cities you mentioned.",
      "Are there plans to go to red states and Republican-controlled cities in this kind of way?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Absolutely.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: OK.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Every single city is evaluated for what we need to do there to make it safer. So we've got operations that, again, I won't talk about details on, but we absolutely are not looking through the viewpoint at anything we're doing with a political lens.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: One of the most-high profile examples of someone who's been rounded up by ICE in recent months is Kilmar Abrego Garcia, and the fate of his situation is still up in the air.",
      "He's awaiting trial on human smuggling charges set for January in Tennessee, but your department is also working to get him deported to Uganda. If he broke the law in this country, as the administration alleges, shouldn't he be held here and face charges here, instead of being deported?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Well, prosecution decisions are always made by the Department of Justice and \u2013 and Pam Bondi's department. So we will let them do that.",
      "Although this individual does have criminal charges pending, he has charges pending against him civilly as well. And the one thing that we will continue to do is to make sure that he doesn't walk free in the United States of America.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: But I heard you say that we're going to let the Justice Department do that. Does this mean that \u2013 does that mean the push to deport him to Uganda is off?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Oh, we will still continue to pursue all options.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: OK.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: We will make sure that he's not released into this country. So, regardless of that, yes, absolutely.",
      "He's not an American citizen, and he shouldn't be here. And especially because of his dangerous criminal activities, we should ensure that we leave every avenue on the table.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Got it.",
      "So, among other things, you oversee FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as we hit the peak of hurricane season. And we're marking the 20th anniversary of the landfall of Hurricane Katrina this weekend 20 years ago. Is the federal government prepared to respond to a major disaster at this moment?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: We are absolutely more prepared than the last administration and doing a much better job responding to the disasters we've already experienced since President Trump has been in the White House.",
      "We've had over a dozen, close to 20 different disasters throughout the country just since President Trump has been the president of the United States. And we have deployed resources twice as fast as FEMA ever has in the past, gotten people on the ground over 100 percent quicker than any other administration has.",
      "In fact, with the disasters that we saw that were so horrific and devastating in Texas and New Mexico, North Carolina, we've had people on the ground within hours responding to those families that were in crisis.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Right.",
      "I bring this up because part of what you're suggesting there is in dispute from a handful of current and former FEMA employees who wrote to Congress this past week raising concerns about the agency's ability to respond to forthcoming natural disasters.",
      "One of the specific concerns they have is this decision that now has you reviewing any cost of $100,000 or more that FEMA plans to make. Can you give me an example of a charge of $100,000 or more that you've rejected?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Yes, absolutely.",
      "We paid hundreds of thousands of dollars, millions of dollars to a one- woman firm to deliver to us 30 million meals, and she delivered only 50,000 to us. And it was a \u2013 one person that the state \u2013 federal government had contracted with in order to deliver 30 million. And I don't know how they ever expected one person to do that.",
      "We \u2013 we had a person that was being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to book meetings\u2026",
      "ED O'KEEFE: OK.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: \u2026 that \u2013 of less than 10 to 15 people, and with no meetings that we saw that were productive or couldn't be done by sending an e-mail.",
      "Over and over again, we're looking at these contracts and looking at the fact that, are they duplicative, are they just supporting woke ideologies, DEI, or are they actually delivering disaster response, which is what FEMA job is, is to put in place operations to support states and local governments to take care of people.",
      "And so that evaluation has saved us hundreds of millions of dollars within FEMA. And within the Department of Homeland Security, it has saved us $13 billion already. And we're going to consider \u2013 continue to make sure that we're accountable to taxpayers.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: At least 20 of the people who signed this letter were current FEMA employees, and they've been placed on administrative leave.",
      "And I had heard you in previous interviews suggest that those that are making accusations against the agency should put their names on the criticisms of the allegations. So, now they have, and they've been placed on administrative leave.",
      "And I'm curious if it's now the policy of DHS that any time an employee puts their name on something, publicly criticizes you or the president's leadership, that they should anticipate being put on leave or fired.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: This \u2013 this letter was signed by many people anonymously. There was some who had their names on there.",
      "And those who had their names on there were temporary contract employees who had worked for the Department of Homeland Security for less than a year, individuals who are not long-term FEMA employees, who \u2013 who grab ahold of the mission to be there, to go and serve individuals and to \u2013 are deployed across the country, and have for years to make sure they're responsive to families in their time of need.",
      "So, absolutely, every employee will be evaluated as to if they're doing their job and if they're doing it appropriately.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: All right, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem joining us this Sunday from Florida, thank you so much. Lots to discuss. We appreciate it.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Thank you, Ed. Appreciate it.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Face the Nation is back in one minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "ED O'KEEFE: On Friday, we traveled to Chicago and sat down with Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker. He invited us there in advance of the expanded federal presence Secretary Noem was just talking about.",
      "Here's what he told us.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER (D-Illinois): We hope that they don't send any troops along with ICE. And, if they do, they'll be in court pretty quickly, because that is illegal. Posse Comitatus does not allow U.S. troops into U.S. cities to do \u2013 you know, to fight crime, to be involved in law enforcement. That's not their job.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: If they're doing federal immigration work, a judge might say, if they're protecting those federal agents, that's OK. I mean, you'll just fight that in court as long as you can?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: Well, National Guard troops, any kind of troops on the streets of an American city don't belong, unless there is an insurrection, unless there is truly an emergency. There is not.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Have you been briefed by anyone in the administration about these plans?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: No one in the administration, the president, or anybody under him, has called anyone in my administration or \u2013 and me \u2013 have not called the city of Chicago or anyone else.",
      "So it's clear that, in secret, they're planning this \u2013 well, it's an invasion with U.S. troops, if they, in fact, do that. The other thing is, you know, they ought to be coordinating with local law enforcement. They ought to let us know when they're coming, where they're coming, if it's ICE or if it's ATF or whoever it is.",
      "But they don't want to do that either. And I must say, it's disruptive. It's dangerous. It tends to inflame passions on the ground when they don't let us know what their plans are and when we can't coordinate with them.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: The president has had some things to say about the Windy City several times in recent days.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): Next should be Chicago, because, as you all know, Chicago is a killing field right now.",
      "Everybody knows Chicago is a hellhole right now. Everybody knows it.",
      "(End VT)",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: You know, he wakes up in the morning and whatever whim strikes him is what he apparently says.",
      "And recently, I guess I have been living rent-free in his head. Chicago apparently is living rent-free in his head, even though, on other days he'll talk about Baltimore, he'll talk about New York. Notice he never talks about where the most violent crime is occurring, which is in red states.",
      "Illinois is not even in the bottom half of states in terms of violent crime. But do you hear him talking about Florida, where he is now from? No, you don't hear him talking about that, or Texas. Their violent crime rates are much worse in other places. And we're very proud of the work that we've done. And we want more help.",
      "You know what kind of help we want? Civilian law enforcement help. We would like ATF agents to help us take more guns off the streets. We would like FBI, again, to coordinate with our local law enforcement to help catch perpetrators of crimes. If they would do that, we would welcome that.",
      "But that's not what they're planning to do.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: So, bottom line, would more federal agents in Chicago, assisting local law enforcement help deter crime right now?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: Of course. You want to help us catch bad guys? Help \u2013 bring the FBI. Bring the ATF. We already coordinate with them, by the way. We do a lot of work with them.",
      "We do some \u2013 we do drug interdiction, we do fighting gangs, and we do, you know, interdiction of guns at the borders.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Part of the reason I ask about the potential for federal deployments to help right now is that, according to a CBS News data analysis of what's gone on in Washington just in the last few weeks, well, crime there as well was down, and in most cases down double digits.",
      "It's down nearly 50 percent in the three weeks since the National Guard moved in, assaults down 41 percent, homicides down 69 percent, robbery down 63 percent, and the mayor concedes carjacking, which had become a bigger problem, down 83 percent since the federal agents showed up.",
      "So this kind of deployment he's set up in Washington that he says he wants to do in other cities, at least in Washington, is showing potential success. And what I hear you saying is, well, sure, if they show up, it might help us too?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: I'm saying we don't want troops on the streets of American cities.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Right.",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: That's un-American. And, frankly, the president of the United States ought to know better. This one doesn't seem to. He hasn't read any books. He doesn't seem to understand the Constitution or the laws.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: But if he just sends the FBI, the ATF, DEA\u2026",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: They're \u2013 yes, they're here already.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: \u2026 and sends more of them?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: We have some working with us now. Would love more help.",
      "You know what else he's doing? He's cutting funds that help us to fight violent crime from the federal government.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Give me an example of how those cuts have affected the ability to fight crime in Chicago.",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: So, let me just tell you what happened in Illinois when we had a Republican governor and he cut funding for programs that helped prevent crime.",
      "What happened was we, saw a significant increase in crime. Donald Trump is now doing the same thing. He's taking away federal funding for those programs which are so important to us. We've increased funding at the state level, but we need that federal funding. It's on top of that.",
      "One more thing. The business community in the city of Chicago got together and put $100 million forward to help us, back in 2022, to help us to fight crime through these prevention programs. It's working. Crime is down.",
      "I mean, murders are down 50 percent in the city of Chicago. And you can go through every statistic. Almost everything is much better as a result of that work. Donald Trump is trying to take that money away. And he isn't listening to the business community here. He isn't listening to the clergy here. He isn't listening to people on the ground, Republicans here who understand that putting troops on the city of Chicago's streets is going to cause more problems than he understands.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: What do you think it's going to do to the country if that happens? Deploying in Washington, where he has federal control, is one thing, but if he sends military forces into a major American city in a state that didn't ask for it, beyond Los Angeles, what do Americans make of that?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: Well, they should understand that he has other aims other than fighting crime. That's the first thing they should understand.",
      "The second is, it's an attack on the American people by the president of the United States. Now, he may disagree with a state that didn't vote for him, but should he be sending troops in? No.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: You said he has other aims. What are the other aims?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: The other aims are that he'd like to stop the elections in 2026 or, frankly, take control of those elections.",
      "He'll just claim that there's some problem with an election, and then he's got troops on the ground that can take control, if, in fact, he's allowed to do this.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: I hear you talking about invasion. I hear you \u2013 him about \u2013 I hear you talking about him suspending elections. Is it your belief he's an authoritarian?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: Look, I can tell you this.",
      "I built a Holocaust museum. I know what the history was of a constitutional republic being overturned after an election in 53 days. And I'm very, very concerned. We could talk about lots of authoritarian regimes in the world, but that just happens to be the one that I know.",

      "ED O'KEEFE: Is there any chance Illinois redraws its congressional lines before next year's midterm elections?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: That's not something that I want to do. It's not something that any of us want to do.",
      "But I have to say, if Donald Trump is going to force his will on the American people by going to his MAGA allies in various states and have them \u2013 having them redraw in the middle of a decade, when you're supposed to be doing it right after a census, with a year ending in 1, not a year ending in 5, if he's going to do that all over the country, I think all of us have to think about what it is that we can do to counter that.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: What much \u2013 what much more could you do, though, as an Illinois Democrat? I mean, your map already gets an F from most good government groups for being gerrymandered. Would you wipe out all the Republican districts?",
      "GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: Yes, it is possible to have more Democratic districts in the state of Illinois, and we \u2013 we could do it. Like I said, it's not something that I want to do.",

      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "ED O'KEEFE: We're joined now by Dr. Celine Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and the editor at large for public health at KFF Health News.",
      "Doctor, so great to see you. Thanks for coming to Washington for this important conversation because it's been a pretty chaotic week at the CDC, to say the least. We've seen the ouster of the head of the agency, who'd only been confirmed by the Senate this summer. She's now mounting a legal challenge to that. Other top officials also departed. They're still reeling from a shooting at the headquarters in Atlanta a few weeks ago.",
      "What are these departures so important to take note of, and how do they affect you, me and everybody else in terms of health and \u2013 and medicine?",
      "CELINE GOUNDER: I think it's really important to understand that this is not just palace intrigue. This really does affect all of us. So, not just the director, but the people in charge of respiratory infections, vaccine safety, the chief medical officer, the person who is in charge of public health data also resigned earlier this week. So, these are really key positions, not to mention that a lot of the directors of the different centers, because it's centers, plural, have also been forced out over the last several months. So, you're really dealing with a leadership vacuum at the CDC. So, this is not business as usual.",
      "And so, specifically, how does this affect you and me, folks watching at home? So, first of all, vaccine policy. Vaccine policy is now being made by political fiat and communicated through social media, rather than a transparent, open, scientific review process. And so, we're seeing the reversal of previous recommendations, which will also confuse whether insurance will cover certain vaccines for certain people. And it's already sowing tremendous confusion at pharmacies, as well as doctors' offices.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: So, there is a series of meetings coming up regarding the future of vaccines, and how they're going to be available, who gets them. Tell us about that and \u2013 and the concerns that some of these now former CDC officials had about what might happen at those meetings.",
      "CELINE GOUNDER: Yes, so what \u2013 these meetings are scheduled for mid- September. Some of the things on the agenda include the newborn Hepatitis B dose. We typically give it to newborns because that's to prevent transmission from the mother to the baby, so it's one of the most common ways that Hepatitis B is transmitted.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: One of the first shots a baby gets.",
      "CELINE GOUNDER: One of the first shots it gets, for good reason. Also protection for infants from RSV, one of the most common causes of hospitalization among infants. Number three, the Covid shot. And we expect to see a tightening of availability, eligibility of Covid shots, especially for healthy kids and adults.",
      "And then finally, the combined measles, mumps, rubella, varicella vaccine, and revisiting long-standing childhood vaccine recommendations would really be unprecedented here.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: So, it's basically every shot you get, from like zero to 18, is now up for debate. And then the Covid shot, of course, which is an important one for many people, on a regular rolling basis?",
      "CELINE GOUNDER: Yes, some really basic things that we have counted on for a very long time. Some of the core concerns with the process involves cherry picking of data, scientific reviews being altered or pulled, and unvetted studies being rushed into the process, into policymaking. And this is really an inversion of radical transparency.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes. There was a \u2013 there's an example in recent days because there is \u2013 we're starting \u2013 you know, fall's coming, Covid picks up. We've already seen one example of a school in Kansas City that was forced to shut down temporarily due to Covid. And there have been spikes in Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, especially. What do people at home need to know as the fall approaches and Covid starts to spike?",
      "CELINE GOUNDER: Well, I think, first of all, vaccinations are for many different purposes. So, it's to prevent severe disease, hospitalization and death. But for a lot of people, you may not be able to call in sick from work very easily. Like for us, it's really hard to take time off, even if you really are sick. You might want to keep your kids in school. And so the best way to keep yourself at work or your kids in school is for them to get vaccinated so you and they are not getting sick.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Let's \u2013 and we should point out, by the way, that school closed. Set to open again on Tuesday. But the fact that they had to close at all, right, as the school year's begins, is a sign potentially of things to come if people don't get their shots.",
      "Let's bottom line this. I'm a 42-year-old guy with asthma. Am I going to have issues getting my Covid shot?",
      "CELINE GOUNDER: You will not because even though you're under 65 \u2013 so, the recommendations or the FDA approval is for people 65 and older, they are all good. They can get their Covid shot.",
      "Under 65, if you have at least one risk factor for severe Covid, you can also get your Covid shot. So, you can absolutely \u2013 that's not an issue for you, Ed.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: But it's, you know, kids under 18, they're perfectly healthy, spouse, aging parents, it's up in the air.",
      "CELINE GOUNDER: Yes, so aging parents over 65, they \u2013 they're eligible. But say you're between six months and 64 years of age, and you do not have a risk factor for severe Covid, that is the group where we really have a lot of uncertainty. Now, I should point out, pregnancy is a risk factor for severe Covid. So, your healthy wife, let's say she were pregnant, which I don't think she is.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Nope.",
      "CELINE GOUNDER: But if she were, she would be eligible for a Covid shot.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: All right. Dr. Celine Gounder, we love having you to help us understand all this. We appreciate you coming down. Good to see you.",
      "And we will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "ED O'KEEFE: We are joined now by a panel of political journalists who \u2013 who know what they're talking about. Let's put it that way. CBS News senior White House reporter Jennifer Jacobs, \"Politico's\" Capitol bureau chief Rachael Bade, and \"Washington Post\" newly minted chief political correspondent Karen Tumulty.",
      "Great to see all of you.",
      "We were just talking to Dr. Gounder about the ouster of the CDC director. We've seen the ouster of a handful of other officials at the Federal Reserve.",
      "Jennifer, I understand you have some new information on where the president may be seeking to oust people next.",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: Well, it's not like they're going agency to agency and picking an agency that they're trying to clean out. It's a little more random than that.",
      "But I can tell you that they're really serious about trying to weed out people who they think are working at \u2013 at cross purposes to their agenda. I asked around if there are more firings coming, and I was told, yes, definitively.",
      "And I'll tell you a quick anecdote and that kind of illustrate this.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Sure.",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: So, there was a surprise birthday party a few days ago for one of the president's top advisers, Stephen Miller. And he was entertaining this crowd, which included a bunch of cabinet secretaries and House Speaker Mike Johnson and other VIPs. And he was explaining about how, back in the day, when he and Mike Johnson were just, you know, essentially nobodies, he would run his ideas by Mike Johnson and he \u2013 even though Stephen thought they were crazy even himself, Mike Johnson said that they were good ideas. And Stephen said, some of the stuff we're trying now is untested.",
      "But it just really illustrated how this president and his closest advisors are willing to do whatever it takes to try to push out people that they think are at cross purposes to their agenda, and that includes people at these quasi-independent agencies, whether it's the bureaucracy that they inherited or whether it's people that the president personally interviewed and selected, like the CDC director.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes.",
      "RACHAEL BADE (Capitol Bureau Chief And Senior Washington Correspondent, \"Politico\": You know, when Donald Trump talked on the campaign trail about draining the swamp, I mean he's been talking about this for 10 years, I don't think a lot of people, you know, thought he was talking about health officials, about scientist, about people who work in national security. But, obviously, he is taking it, his sort of, you know, mantra to that point right now.",
      "And I mean we have to \u2013 we have to acknowledge that a lot of people have said, Donald Trump doesn't have this authority when it came to DOGE and getting rid of a lot of federal workers, folks said, look, they have a lot of protections. You can't do that.",
      "Well, the courts, a lot of them, have sided with him. And so, he's taking it to the next step here. And, you know, there's a lot of questions about whether he can do it. But obviously, he's going to try. And he's succeeded a lot in the courts, where a lot of people thought he would not.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: But with Congress coming back, what are they going to do about it?",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Well \u2013",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: Nothing.",
      "BADE: Yes. Good \u2013 pretty \u2013",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: Basically nothing. And this is not only \u2013 it's \u2013 it's not only a war on expertise, but the \u2013 in the early phases it was all about going after the so-called deep state government employees, the bureaucracy. Now they've begun to oust their own people, their own appointees.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: And as you write today, most of the conservative movement kind of hangs back, stays quiet about it, and lets it happen.",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: Exactly.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Not just stays quiet about it, they're encouraging it.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Right.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: I mean, look at Laura Loomer and what she has \u2013 has been doing in terms of pushing for firings. And she's been very successful.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: You heard Secretary Noem talk about crime. You saw Illinois Governor Pritzker's response to that, Rachael.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Uh-huh.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Republicans, obviously, see this as a winning issue for them. How is Congress going to pick this up? Because a lot of this has transpired since their summer break began.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Yes.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: They're going to get asked all sorts of questions this week as they come back about whether there's something they need to do to step in.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Look, I think you're going to see Republicans lean into it. I mean, obviously, this is an initiative that Donald Trump himself has been pushing. I don't think if you ask lawmakers, specifically Republican lawmakers in July if they were going to be focused on a big crime bill in September, I don't think anyone would have told you that that would be the case.",
      "But Donald Trump has been very successful in terms of changing the narrative. I mean when you think about lawmakers leaving town at the end of July, everyone was focused on Epstein and how the president couldn't shake the narrative. Now they're coming back and the full focus of Washington is on crime. And this is an issue, as I have written in my column, that very much benefits Republicans. I mean there are polls that show a lot of the nation doesn't like what he's doing with the National Guard.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Right.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: But when it comes to people's approval rating of Trump and crime, he's at something like 54 percent according to a recent AP poll.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes. So, he's found a new \u2013 a new issue to help boost him.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Yes, of course.",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: The word he used this week was \"trap.\" That Democrats are walking into a trap. And, in fact, crime is an issue that has always been problematic for Democrats \u2013",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Yes.",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: Because they are sort of caught between not wanting to look soft on public safety, but also protecting civil rights, which are one of their core values.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Which is what I thought made the governor's answer interesting, where he said, yes, you're right, I'm not helping the federal government with immigration because we're worried about crime and public safety at the state and local level, and they'll do the immigration. And his ability to split those two, I felt, was a little cleaner than many other Democratic governors and mayors have been when they realize they're dealing with this hot potato.",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: The other thing that struck me in that, too, was him saying, we would welcome some federal help.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Right.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Yes.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Yes.",

      "KAREN TUMULTY: The FBI have been helping us catch bad guys.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes.",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: And I think that I was also, when I was doing reporting this week, it turns out a lot of police chiefs across the country are watching this with great curiosity because they want to see, you know, what's working here and what's not in D.C.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Yes, I thought his \u2013 his response about bringing in ATF \u2013 ATF officials and FBI officials helping with crime there, that showed me that Democrats are starting to maybe read the political tea leaves here and come up with smarter answers, because when Trump first started talking about this, the response was, we don't need the National Guard. Crime is down. Look at the stats. But the reality is, people don't feel it.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Right.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Eighty percent of Americans think crime is just as bad as it was recently, or getting worse. Only 20 percent think it's actually getting better.",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: On the politics of it, Trump people don't just want to win issues, they want to systematically work their opposition into a corner and crack their coalition. And if you were to design an issue that could start to nibble away at the Democratic stranglehold on \u2013 on large metropolitan cities in the United States, this is it.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes. You are \u2013 I like to call you \"scoop,\" at least around these parts. And you had another big one this week regarding the future of Iowa's Republican Senator Joni Ernst. She's announcing, in the coming days, that she's not running for re-election. It had been talked about, thought it might happen. She had also made a two-term vow, and so we're nearing that. Why'd she do it? And is it indicative of a problem for the party in Iowa or for congressional Republicans writ large that someone like her would walk away?",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: I think we're going to have to wait from her on \u2013 on why she did it. It will be very interesting when she makes her \u2013 her statement this week if it does indeed come.",
      "But Iowa, Ed, is really turning into a hot, hot battleground. You have not had an open U.S. Senate race and an open gubernatorial race at the same time, with no incumbents, in nearly 60 years. So, my sources say that Iowa native Matt Whitaker is talking with President Trump about a potential run for U.S. Senate in 2026. He has told people he's going to decide by the end of this year. He's currently the U.S. ambassador to NATO.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes.",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: And he's been in the news lately for that Ukraine-NATO arms initiative.",
      "You've also got Republican Congresswoman Ashley Hinson, who Iowa Republicans tell me are \u2013 they're fully expecting her to jump into the race in the next few days. And activist, Republicans in Iowa, really like her. They say she's very personable. She's obviously good on \u2013 in front of a camera.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes.",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: She came from the world of TV.",
      "Then you've got, on the Democratic side, this guy named Josh Turek, who is a Paralympic gold medalist. The Democrats are pinning a lot of their hopes on him.",
      "So, you could potentially have an open congressional race. Two other congressional races that are really tight, the open Senate race, the open gubernatorial race. Iowa's going to be a hot battleground.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Which is exactly what the Democrats want, because you've now forced the Republicans to spend money in a state they thought they had.",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: Yes.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: When they're also recruiting big names in other states. So, this is a problem for them.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: Yes, it's a \u2013 it's definitely a challenge. I mean if Ernst were to run for re-election she would be a shoe in. Same thing with Thom Tillis. I mean he retired in North Carolina.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: In North Carolina, yes.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: And \u2013 and what this shows us is that there's very little room for discontent or for pushback in, you know, Trump's second term. I mean, Ernst ended up voting for Pete Hegseth, yes, but there was a time where she was potentially not going to \u2013 she got pummeled. I mean I'm talking death threats. I mean it was ugly. And my understanding is that she has told people that that really soured her on politics.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes.",
      "RACHAEL BADE: That's the same thing that happened with Tillis. And now, you know, Republicans have to worry about defending that state as well.",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: But if it turns out that Iowa is truly in play, as red as it has been, I mean, that does suggest the potential for a true wave election next year.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: I will say, we were at the Iowa State Fair a few weeks ago, and I was struck how many people stopped me to say, I'm not happy with what he's doing, the president, or I've got issues with the governor, or I've got issues with Senator Ernst. I had not been approached that way by \u2013 by Iowans in recent years, and this suggests something could be there.",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: Right.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: The fact, though, that they have gone \u2013 sort of retreading, to get Sherrod Brown to run, and other names that Chuck Schumer is eyeing, former members of Congress, former senators. Roy Cooper, the governor of North Carolina.",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: Roy Cooper.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: I mean, is that \u2013",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: He's 70 something. Yes.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Right. At a time when the Democratic Party is looking to get younger, it sure seems like Schumer is leaning on older officials to do this. Is that the key to their success?",
      "KAREN TUMULTY: Well, I do think that both Sherrod Brown and Roy Cooper are incredibly strong candidates. But elsewhere, I \u2013 I think they ought to let the primaries play out and let some of these younger, fresher faces emerge.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: All right. Karen Tumulty, Rachael Bade, Jennifer Jacobs, thank you all for being here. Great to see you all.",

      "CINDY MCCAIN (Executive Director, World Food Programme): Well, first of all, thank you for covering this.",
      "I did go into Gaza. I entered through the Kisufim gate. Went to Deir el- Balah (ph), then on to Khan Yunis and out through the Karem Salem \u2013 Karem Salem gate.",
      "I saw a lot of devastation. I saw a lot of hunger. I saw people waiting in long lines for water. You know, the \u2013 what you would expect to see in a situation like that. And there's \u2013 there's clear desperation in the \u2013 on \u2013 in the hearts and minds of the people there because there just is not enough food.",
      "I met with a family that \u2013 of 11 people that had come from north. They had got \u2013 walked all the way down. And what I saw, they had pictures that they brought with their \u2013 with their belongings. And I saw the \u2013 kind of the before and after pictures. And they're \u2013 I didn't even recognize these people. The had the weight loss, the malnutrition, the stress and everything that it \u2013 the toll that it's taken on their family.",
      "It's a \u2013 it's truly, truly a devastating situation and something that we need to demand a ceasefire about right now and make sure that we can get in there and feed.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: And yet Israel has declared Gaza City a combat zone and is ending humanitarian pauses and ramping up airstrikes around the city. Gaza, of course, is one of the areas where a global monitor has confirmed famine. You talk about the hunger you saw in and around that region. What will a more aggressive military offensive in that area mean for Gaza City?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Well, it's \u2013 it's going to limit the amount of food that they have access to. Of course, the danger alone is a whole other part of that, as you know. And it does not make it easy for humanitarian aid workers to get in there as well to make sure that we can do our job.",
      "The one thing that I've been saying all along about situations like Gaza City and others is that humanitarian aid workers are not targets. They're not targets. And this has to end. So, I'm \u2013 I'm hoping that perhaps it won't be as bad as we think it's going to be, but I have a feeling \u2013 I have a feeling we're going to see some \u2013 some more serious devastation.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: In fact, you bring up the issue of safety for humanitarian workers. Last year among the deadliest on record, nearly 400 killed in the line of duty. There was a World Food Programme convoy that came under fire in Gaza last month. I mean, absent a ceasefire, what more needs to be done by warring parties to protect humanitarians as they try to carry out this work?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Well, these people are desperate. You know, the \u2013 for \u2013 in terms of the ones that are on the ground rushing the trucks, et cetera. What we need is full, unfettered access at scale to be able to get in and feed, and feed in a way where the panic subsides. They're \u2013 they're \u2013 and for \u2013 and, secondly, of course, we don't do anything that involves guns or \u2013 or military in any way, shape or form. And that's on purpose. That's who we are. That's our mandate. And so, we \u2013 obviously, a ceasefire, as I said before, being able to get in at scale, unfettered, and in a safe manner, and continuously get in, and get in to the furthest sites where \u2013 where we can't get food into \u2013 into the most vulnerable people that are \u2013 that are at risk right now.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: As part of your trip to the region, you also met with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. You describe it as a productive meeting and said you discussed what you need in order to be able to get access. But you've also said it was clear there isn't enough food getting into Gaza.",
      "And I want to read you something that the prime minister's office posted on social media. They said, in part, \"it's regrettable that Mrs. McCain has since issued statements contradicting what she told us in Jerusalem. That is a misrepresentation. Israel is enabling a steady flow of aid in sufficient quantities.\"",
      "What's your response to the prime minister?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Well, I stand by what I said, there's not enough food getting in. And \u2013 and without a full ceasefire and the ability to get in, as I said, at scale, unfettered, making sure that we're safe doing it as well, that's the only way we're going to be able to feed people.",
      "We have, in recent weeks, been able to get a little more food in. So, that's an accurate statement. But it's not enough. It simply isn't enough to be able to do \u2013 to do the job and stop malnutrition, starvation and all the things that have occurred as a result of it.",
      "Let me add \u2013 let me add one thing to that.",
      "Malnutrition and starvation and famine of any kind, it's not just about food. It's about water. It's about medicine. It's about the ability to \u2013 to \u2013 to treat the entire body of a person who's \u2013 who is undernourished or malnourished in that way. So, it involves more than just the food trucks, although that's very important, but it also involves things \u2013 special feeding for children, as well as medicine and water that need to all get in.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Well, executive director of the World Food Programme, Ambassador Cindy McCain, thank you so much for bringing that important perspective to us this morning. We'll see you soon.",

      "MARK KNOLLER: You could say that I'm kind of the CBS News numbers man at the White House. Now it's not always groundbreaking information, but it does add context and perspective to the activities that the president engages in. For example, how many speeches, remarks and statements do you think President Obama gave during the year just ended, in 2010? Well, by my count, it was 491.",

    "summary": "Dr. Debra Houry, the CDC's Chief Science and Medical Officer, and Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who led the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, stepped down hours after the firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez.",
    "story": [
      "Four senior officials with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced their resignations in recent days, citing what they described as growing political interference in the agency's scientific work, particularly regarding vaccines.",
      "Two of those \u2014 Dr. Debra Houry, the CDC's Chief Science and Medical Officer, and Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who led the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases \u2014 stepped down on Wednesday, hours after the White House announced the firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez.",
      "Monarez, confirmed by the Senate in late July, was removed less than a month into her tenure. White House spokesman Kush Desai said Monarez \"was not aligned with the President's agenda of Making America Healthy Again.\" Monarez's attorneys argue the dismissal is unlawful, asserting that only the president can remove a Senate-confirmed director.",
      "On Thursday, deputy secretary of Health and Human Services Jim O'Neill was chosen to serve as acting CDC director, several White House officials confirmed to CBS News. And in an internal email sent to CDC staff Thursday evening, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. confirmed O'Neill as the acting CDC director, but did not address Monarez's departure.",
      "\"I am committed to working with you to restore trust, transparency, and credibility to the CDC,\" Kennedy told CDC employees, later writing that \"President Trump and I are aligned on the commonsense vision for the CDC: Strengthen the public health infrastructure by returning to its core mission of protecting Americans from communicable diseases by investing in innovation to prevent, detect and respond to future threats.\"",
      "Houry and Daskalakis said they had become increasingly uneasy about how vaccine policy was being handled. Both pointed to preparations for the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting, which recommends vaccine schedules.",
      "Houry said they feared \"some decisions had been made before there was even the data or the science to support those. We are scientists, and that was concerning to us.\"",
      "Daskalakis added that he was \"very concerned that there's going to be an attempt to re-litigate vaccines that have already had clear recommendations with science that has been vetted,\" which he warned could undermine public trust. \"If you can't attack access, then why not attack trust? And that's what I think the playbook is,\" he said.",
      "Both officials cited instances in which evidence reviews were altered or withdrawn. A CDC analysis of thimerosal, a vaccine preservative, was briefly posted before being taken down at HHS's direction. \"If there's something that doesn't line up with the recommendations, then that information will be taken down, and it's not there for the public to see for openness and transparency,\" Houry said.",
      "The two also criticized what they described as a lack of direct communication between CDC scientists and HHS leadership. Daskalakis said his team was never invited to brief Kennedy on topics ranging from measles to COVID.",
      "When asked about Kennedy's calls for \"radical transparency,\" Houry and Daskalakis described learning about changes to the COVID vaccine schedule for children not through internal channels but via social media.",
      "\"The radical transparency manifested itself by a Twitter post, which is how Dr. Houry and I learned that the secretary had mandated the change in the children's vaccine schedule for COVID,\" Daskalakis recalled. \"What is the background that led to that decision? And we were denied access to that information. So, I don't think that that's radically transparent,\" Daskalakis said.",
      "CBS News reached out to HHS for comment on some of the allegations made by Houry and Daskalakis, but did not immediately hear back.",
      "Both officials said they had no jobs lined up when they resigned. Houry described the decision as an effort to raise the alarm about the direction of the agency.",
      "\"For us, this was really sending out a bat signal,\" Houry said. \"We were the very senior scientists and career leaders at CDC. We thought this was the time to stand together and try to do what we could to raise the alarm around public health in our country.\"",
      "Daskalakis said remaining at CDC under current conditions would have made them complicit in what he called the \"weaponization\" of public health.",
      "\"The safety has already been compromised\u2026We are flying blind in the U.S. already. If we continued\u2026we would be complicit and would be facilitating the ability to go from flying blind to actively harming people,\" he said.",
      "Houry emphasized the severity of the moment by noting that she left without a backup plan.",
      "\"My leaving without a job was really just showing how dire the circumstances had become,\" Houry said.",
      "Daskalakis said his decision was also shaped by his medical oath.",
      "\"As a physician, I take the Hippocratic oath: first, do no harm. I am seeing ideology permeating science in a way that is going to harm children and adults\u2026I think we are seeing things that are happening that are making our country less prepared to be able to respond to the everyday pathogens \u2026but also \u2026 to the next big thing.\"",
      "Both also expressed concerns for their personal safety in the current climate.",
      "\"The environment we live in\u2026 stoked by misinformation, especially from people considered by some to be health authorities, makes me worried for all of us in public health,\" Daskalakis said. \"I am concerned, but that's part of our job\u2026to be brave and continue to speak the truth even when we are outside of the CDC.\"",
      "The resignations came weeks after a shooting outside the CDC's Atlanta headquarters, which law enforcement linked to COVID misinformation.",
      "Houry said the White House response to the shooting was muted. Kennedy toured the site but later gave an interview expressing distrust of experts. \"That was after the attack. It was based on COVID misinformation. So this is when we were trying to build trust,\" she said.",
      "Daskalakis added that while Kennedy later described mass shootings as a public health crisis, he believed the secretary should address misinformation as a root cause. \"The misinformation about the COVID vaccine that has been documented by the Georgia bureau of investigation as the reason for the shooter at CDC. I would really recommend that the secretary actually do take his own advice and actually address the core problem that led to that shooting as well,\" he said. He also noted that CDC's own gun violence prevention programs had been sharply reduced. \"We talk about violence as a public health problem. It is, and there's things we can do to prevent it. Unfortunately, the majority of that program, the staff are terminated.\"",
      "The firings and resignations have sparked calls for oversight. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont called for a bipartisan investigation, Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington urged Kennedy's removal, and Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana \u2014 who voted to confirm Kennedy's appointment as HHS secretary \u2014 said the developments would \"require oversight.\"",
      "The events come as the Food and Drug Administration narrowed eligibility for updated COVID-19 vaccines to older adults and people with risk factors for severe COVID.",

    "story": [
      "A dinosaur dubbed one of the \"strangest\" ever found boasted an elaborate armory of long bony spikes and a tail weapon, according to findings published in the science journal Nature.",
      "Spicomellus, which roamed the Earth 165 million years ago, is the world's oldest ankylosaur, a herbivorous group of dinosaurs known for their tank-like bodies.",
      "Palaeontologists' image of Spicomellus was based on a single rib bone found in Morocco in 2019.",
      "But newly discovered remains have helped scientists form a clearer picture of the unusual dinosaur.",
      "The fossils showed it had bony spikes fused onto all of its ribs \u2014 something never seen before in any other vertebrate species living or extinct, according to the research published Wednesday.",
      "Richard Butler, a professor at the University of Birmingham and the project co-lead, told CBS News partner BBC News that it was the \"punk rocker\" of its time.",
      "Butler called the fossils an \"incredibly significant discovery,\" adding that \"Spicomellus is one of the strangest dinosaurs that we've ever discovered.\"",
      "Butler's project co-leader, Susannah Maidment of the Natural History Museum in London, added that it was surprising that the spikes were fused directly onto the bone, the BBC reported.",
      "\"We don't see that in any other animal, living or extinct,\" she said. \"It's absolutely covered in really weird spikes and protrusions all over the back of the animal, including a bony collar that wraps around its neck and some sort of weapon on the end of its tail, so a most unusual dinosaur.\"",
      "The discovery is so unusual that Butler and Maidment are considering whether the theories on how ankylosaurs evolved should be re-assessed.",
      "These dinosaurs survived late into the time dinosaurs were on Earth, in a period known as the Cretaceous, the BBC reported. The end of this period saw the emergence of large carnivorous predators, such as T. Rex, so it had been thought that ankylosaurs started off with simple, small armored plates on their back, which then became larger and more extensive to protect themselves from these big beasts, according to Butler.",
      "\"If you had asked me what I would have expected the oldest known ankylosaur to look like I would have said something with quite simple armor,\" Butler told BBC News. \"Instead, we have an animal bristling with spikes like a hedgehog, the most bizarre armor that we've ever found in any animal, far outside the range of armor seen in later ankylosaurs.\"",

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence is replacing entry-level workers whose jobs can be performed by generative AI tools like ChatGPT, a rigorous new study finds.",
      "Early-career employees in fields that are most exposed to AI have experienced a 13% drop in employment since 2022, compared to more experienced workers in the same fields and when measured against people in sectors less buffeted by the fast-emerging technology, according to a recent\u00a0working paper from Stanford economists Erik Brynjolfsson, Bharat Chandar and Ruyu Chen.",
      "The study adds to the growing body of research suggesting that the spread of generative AI in the workplace is likely to disrupt the job market, especially for younger workers, the report's authors said.",
      "\"These large language models are trained on books, articles and written material found on the internet and elsewhere,\" Brynjolfsson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's the kind of book learning that a lot of people get at universities before they enter the job market, so there is a lot of overlap with between these LLMs and the knowledge young people have.\"",
      "The research highlights two fields in particular where AI already appears to be supplanting a significant number of young workers: software engineering and customer service. Between late 2022 and July 2025, entry-level employment in those areas declined by roughly 20%, according to the report, while employment for older workers in the same jobs grew.",
      "Overall, employment for workers aged 22 to 25 in the most AI-exposed sectors dropped 6% during the study period. By comparison, employment in those areas rose between 6% and 9% for older workers, according to the researchers.",
      "The analysis reveals a similar pattern playing out in the following fields:",

      "Older employees, who generally have navigated the workplace for a longer period of time, are more likely to have picked up the kinds of communication and other \"soft\" skills that are harder to teach and that employers may be reluctant to replace with AI, the data suggests.",
      "\"Older workers have a lot of tacit knowledge because they learn tricks of trade from experience that may never be written down anywhere,\" Brynjolfsson explained. \"They have knowledge that's not in the LLMs, so they're not being replaced as much by them.\"",
      "The study is unusually robust given that generative AI technologies are only a few years old, while experts are just starting to systematically dig into the impact on the labor market. The Stanford researchers used data from ADP, which provides payroll processing services to employers with a combined 25 million workers, to track employment changes for full-time workers in occupations that are or more or less exposed to AI. The data included detailed information on workers, including their ages, and precise job titles.",
      "AI doesn't just threaten to take jobs away from workers. As with past cycles of innovation, it will render some jobs extinct while creating others, Brynjolfsson said.",
      "\"Tech has always been destroying jobs and creating jobs. There has always been this turnover,\" he said. \"There is a transition over time, and that's what we are seeing now.\"",
      "Augmented or automated?",
      "For example, in fields like nursing AI is more likely to augment human workers by taking over rote tasks, freeing health care practitioners to spend more time focusing on patients, according to proponents of the technology.",
      "While entry-level employment has fallen in professions that are most exposed to AI, no such such decline has occurred in jobs where employers are looking to use these tools to support and expand what employees do.",
      "\"Workers who are using these tools to augment their work are benefiting,\" Brynjolfsson said. \"So there's a rearrangement of the kind of employment in the economy.\"",
      "Advice for young workers",
      "As of late last year, 23% of employees were using generative AI in their jobs at least once per week, according to a\u00a0report from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Workers who can learn to use AI to to help them do their jobs better will be best positioned for success in today's labor market, according to Brynolfsson.",
      "A recent report from AI staffing firm Burtch Works found that starting salaries for entry-level AI workers rose by 12% from 2024 to 2025.",
      "\"Young workers who learn how to use AI effectively can be much more productive. But if you are just doing things that AI can already do for you, you won't have as much value-add,\" Brynjolfsson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"This is the first time we're getting clearer evidence of these kinds of employment effects, but it's probably not the last time,\" he added. \"It's something we need to pay increasing attention to as it evolves and companies learn to take advantage of things that are out there.\"",

    "story": [
      "Survivors of Maine's deadliest mass shooting and relatives of victims are suing the federal government, alleging that the U.S. Army could and should have stopped one of its reservists from carrying out what they call \"one of the most preventable mass tragedies in American history.\"",
      "Eighteen people were killed in October 2023 when Robert Card opened fire at a bowling alley and a bar and grill. An independent commission appointed by Maine's governor later concluded that there were numerous opportunities for intervention by both Army officials and civilian law enforcement as Card's mental health deteriorated. He was found dead by suicide two days after the shootings.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in federal court on behalf of more than 100 survivors and victims' family members, accuses the U.S. government of negligence, saying its conduct \"directly and proximately caused the mass shooting.\" It alleges that Army officials and others \"failed to act reasonably, broke the promises they made to Card's family and their community, violated mandatory polices, procedures and disregarded directives and orders.\"",
      "CBS News obtained a copy of the 119-page lawsuit, which alleges there were numerous signs and documented examples over the years of Card's worsening mental illness, in addition to tangible incidents that should have flagged him to the Army as an individual potentially capable of harming others.",
      "\"By March 2023, the United States and its personnel knew Card was paranoid, delusional, violent, and lacked impulse control. The Army knew he had access to firearms. The Army promised to remove his guns but did not fulfill that promise,\" the lawsuit states. \"Worse, through its acts and omissions, the Army withheld information and actively misled local law enforcement, thereby preventing others from intervening and separating Card from his weapons.\"",
      "Attorneys plan to provide more details Wednesday at a news conference in Lewiston, not far from where the shootings took place.",
      "Spokespeople for the Department of Defense and the Army said they would not comment on pending litigation. A request for comment was emailed to the Keller Army Community Hospital.",
      "The attorneys began the process of suing the government a little less than a year ago when they filed notices of claim, saying the Army did not act despite being aware of Card's mental health decline. Card's mental health spiral led to his hospitalization and left him paranoid, delusional and expressing homicidal ideations, the claim said. Before his discharge, the Army's medical providers determined that Card \"posed a significant risk of violence\" and conditioned his release from the hospital \"on the removal of his personal weapons from his home,\" according to the lawsuit, which also says the medical personnel \"recommended restricting his access to military weapons and ammunition.\"",
      "Attorneys have said that Card even produced a \"hit list\" of those he wanted to attack as his health deteriorated.",
      "\"The Army knew that while in the hospital, Card admitted to homicidal ideation and to preparing a 'hit list' of people he intended to kill,\" the lawsuit says. \"Card stated that his targets were those he perceived had wronged him, including those he had bowled and played cornhole with at the bowling alley and bar he later attacked on October 25, 2023.\"",
      "Family members and fellow reservists said Card had exhibited delusional and paranoid behavior months before the shootings. He was hospitalized by the Army during training in July 2023 in New York, where his unit was training West Point cadets, but Army Reserve officials have acknowledged that no one made sure Card was taking his medication or complying with his follow-up care at home in Bowdoin, Maine.",
      "The starkest warning came in a September 2023 text from a fellow reservist: \"I believe he's going to snap and do a mass shooting.\" At the time, just one month before the Lewiston massacre, Card had threatened to \"shoot up\" the Army Reserve center, located in Saco, Maine, according to the lawsuit, which claims Army Captain Jeremy Reamer \"dismissed these warnings\" and, rather than taking swift action, called the reservist who sent the text \"not the most credible of our Soldiers.\"",
      "\"From the start, the Army disregarded its mandatory policies and procedures, and regulations when dealing with Card,\" the lawsuit states. \"Despite the serious issues Card presented at the company or battalion level, they were not reported up the chain of command to senior military officials with the knowledge, experience, and resources to address them. Instead, low-ranking, part-time personnel mis-managed the risks, resulting in disastrous consequences.\"",
      "Army officials conducted their own investigation after the shootings that Lt. Gen. Jody Daniels, then the chief of the Army Reserve, said found \"a series of failures by unit leadership.\" Three Army Reserve leaders were disciplined for dereliction of duty, according to the report. When the governor's commission released its final report last August, the Army issued a statement saying it was \"committed to reviewing the findings and implementing sound changes to prevent tragedies like this from recurring.\"",
      "The Lewiston shootings led to new guns laws in Maine, a state with a long tradition of hunting and gun ownership. The laws prompted legal action on the part of gun rights advocates in the state and remain a contentious topic nearly two years after the shootings.",

      "Cass told CBS News the suspect was \"waiting in the shadows in his own side yard behind a fence\" after the boy and his cousin knocked on his door Saturday night and ran away.",
      "The boy, identified by police as Julian Guzman, was attending a family gathering about a block away in the east Houston neighborhood, and after getting bored, decided to go with his 10-year-old cousin and play ding-dong ditch, in which pranksters ring the doorbell or knock on the door of a home and then run away. Police said the two cousins had knocked three times on the suspect's door within a span of about 15 minutes.",
      "On the third knock, the cousins ran as fast as they could, but the homeowner was waiting behind the fence in his yard. Guzman was recording the incident on his phone, police said, showing himself knocking and running. Shots are heard on the video, police said, and there is audio of the boy gasping.",
      "Guzman's cousin told police he didn't know what to do, only what he had seen in movies, so he tried to pick him up.",
      "The boys appeared as children, \"not threatening in any way,\" Cass said.",
      "Guzman was wounded when police arrived at the scene and taken to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead on Sunday, police said.",
      "Gonzalo Leon Jr., 42, has been charged with murder and booked into the Harris County jail, according to online records. A judge set Leon's bond at $1 million Wednesday \"due to the ongoing investigation and potential upgrade of the charges.\"",
      "Police said Leon is a former Army veteran who was deployed and spent time in the reserves. He was disabled in combat and honorably discharged, his defense attorney said at his court appearance Wednesday.",
      "A handgun, 20 other guns and tactical and smoke grenades were found during a search of his home, police said.",
      "\"Looked like he may have been a collector of firearms,\" Cass said.",
      "Police said they found Leon at a hotel in La Porte, Texas, with a packed car. The hotel room was booked for three days, Cass said.",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Sep 2025 11:04:07 -0400",
    "summary": "Wasted energy is a hidden drain on household electricity but small steps can contribute significantly to lowering costs and emissions.",
    "story": [
      "The lights are off, the house is quiet and nothing seems to be running. But electricity is silently flowing through the plugs in your home. This hidden drain is known as phantom energy.",
      "Also called vampire energy, the wasted electricity comes from leaving devices plugged in when they're not in use. That could range from household items such as phone chargers and microwaves to TVs and gaming consoles.",
      "This wasted electricity accounts for about 5% to 10% of home energy use, depending on factors like the age of the equipment, according to Alexis Abramson, dean of the Columbia Climate School.",
      "\"Phantom energy depends on ... what kind of systems you have and how much they've improved over time,\" said Abramson.",
      "For example, televisions that are connected to the internet and have smart wake features that allow them to interact with phones and other devices can consume up to 40 watts of energy during the hours of the day that the TV would normally be off, according to Matt Malinowski, director of the buildings program at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. That's almost 40 times as much as a regular television.",
      "\"The good news is there have been new, renewed efforts to tackle this,\" said Malinowski.",
      "He said advocates and manufacturers have come up with a voluntary agreement seeking to reduce the amount of energy smart televisions use when they're in standby mode.",
      "Phantom energy contributes to climate change because power drawn by unused devices can increase demand for electricity from sources that release planet-warming emissions. Aidan Charron, associate director of Global Earth Day, said that while the amount may seem small when a person looks at their individual utility bill, the environmental toll of phantom energy is significant when multiplied over homes across the country.",
      "\"Just take a little step of unplugging the things that you're not using,\" said Charron. \"It will save you money and it'll save emissions in the long run.\"",
      "Some of the main culprits when it comes to draining energy are appliances that are constantly connected to electricity, such as those with a clock.",
      "\"Do you really need your microwave to tell you the time, or can you unplug your microwave when you're not using it?\" said Charron.",
      "While unplugging devices may seem burdensome, it significantly contributes to reducing emissions.",
      "Charron recommends starting with small steps like unplugging chargers for phones and other devices once the battery is fully charged. The next step is moving to other appliances such as unplugging an unused lamp.",
      "If unplugging sounds too hard, regularly checking your settings and disabling any extra feature you're not using that could be draining energy help, too. For example, smart televisions often have optional features that can be turned off so the television isn't listening for signals from other devices while in standby mode.",
      "\"If you're not using it, then you're getting no benefit, yet you're paying the price and increased the energy use,\" said Malinowski.",
      "Individuals also tend to take more sustainable actions, such as unplugging devices, once they learn what they can do to decrease their household emissions efficiently. Those actions could contribute to reducing U.S. emissions by about 20% per year, which equals about 450 tons (408 metric tons) of carbon dioxide, according to Jonathan Gilligan, a professor of earth and environmental science at Vanderbilt University.",
      "The choices individuals take in their daily lives all add up, Gilligan said, mainly because of how much the U.S. population contributes to direct greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "\"The question becomes, what can we do to try to address this?\" said Gilligan. \"Phantom power is one part of this.\"",
      "The more individuals decrease their footprint, the more likely it is that others will follow, too, and eventually, those actions may turn to societal norms, according to Gilligan, because individuals don't want to feel like they're being irresponsible.",
      "\"This is a place where psychologists find that this effect is real. If people see that other people are doing actions to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, they want to do that\" said Giligan.",
      "When it comes to daily choices, individuals may think what they're doing isn't really making a big difference. But what they tend to overlook is how they influence others around them by choosing to live a more sustainable life.",
      "The impact may be much stronger than a lot of people realize, Gilligan said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 What was happening in the criminal case of Nathalie Rose Jones, who was facing charges in Washington, D.C., federal court this summer, wasn't typical.",
      "A grand jury of D.C. citizens on Tuesday had denied the Justice Department's request to indict Jones, who was accused of a federal crime for allegedly posting an Instagram threat against President Trump.",
      "In the nearly empty, dimly lit courtroom, Judge Moxila Upadhyaya listened to arguments from attorneys for nearly 15 minutes and surveyed the case file before her. She paused, looked up at the federal prosecutor standing 10 feet away and asked what the Justice Department planned to do next in the case.",
      "The prosecutor had no answer but said he'd have a response \"as soon as possible,\" maybe within a few days.",
      "This grand jury's rejection of the Justice Department's request for an indictment was one of at least four such instances in the past week in which a grand jury denied an indictment in the District of Columbia.",
      "\"Not only have I never heard of this happening, I've never heard of a prosecutor who's heard of this happening,\" said former federal prosecutor Brendan Ballou, who served in the U.S. Attorney's Office for in D.C. until January 2025.",
      "\"This is not the fault of career prosecutors, but rather the office's failure\u2014again and again\u2014to secure indictments suggests that the administration has absolutely destroyed its credibility with jurors,\" Ballou told CBS News.",
      "Another former federal prosecutor, Victor Salgado, said, \"It is exceptionally rare for federal grand juries to reject proposed charges, given the low evidentiary bar for indictment and the Justice Department's policy of pursuing cases only when there is sufficient evidence to both secure and sustain a conviction.\"",
      "Jones is accused of posting on Instagram in early August, \"I am willing to sacrificially kill this POTUS by disemboweling him and cutting out his trachea with Liz Cheney and all The Affirmation present.\"",
      "According to the Justice Department, on Aug. 15, the U.S. Secret Service conducted a voluntary interview with Jones, during which she stated the president was a \"terrorist\" and a \"Nazi.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, D.C. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro said, \"A Washington D.C. grand jury refused to indict someone who threatened to kill the President of the United States. Her intent was clear, traveling through five states to do so. She even confirmed the same to the US Secret Service. This is the essence of a politicized jury. The system here is broken on many levels. Instead of the outrage that should be engendered by a specific threat to kill the president, the grand jury in DC refuses to even let the judicial process begin.\"",
      "Jones was briefly held in pretrial detention in the case last month but was released ahead of Tuesday's hearing. She appeared by Zoom at the hearing in Upadhyaya's courtroom and listened as a prosecutor told the judge that the feds have not decided whether to return to the grand jury for a second time to seek an indictment.",
      "Her attorney argued in a court filing this week that Jones possessed no firearms and \"she repeatedly told them she had no intent to harm anyone, including the president, and was in D.C., to attend a peaceful protest.\"",
      "In a separate case, multiple people familiar with the decision said a grand jury refused a Justice Department request to indict Sean Dunn, who was accused of throwing a sandwich at a federal agent in August. Dunn is a former Justice Department employee who was fired after news circulated of his arrest in the sandwich case. The Justice Department has instead filed a new misdemeanor count against Dunn, which does not require a grand jury indictment.",
      "Court records reviewed by CBS News said a D.C. grand jury also rejected a Justice Department request to indict Sydney Reid, who was arrested in July for allegedly attempting to interfere with the transfer of an alleged gang member into immigration custody.",
      "\"As Reid tried to impede the transfer, one of the (officers) pushed her against the wall and told her to stop,\" the Justice Department alleged in a complaint. \"Reid continued to struggle and fight with the officer.\"",
      "The Justice Department acknowledged in a court filing on Aug. 25 in Reid's case that \"[a]n Indictment has not been returned.\"",
      "Last week, a D.C. grand jury also declined to indict Alvin Summers, who was accused of swinging his arms at a U.S. Park Police officer after a foot chase on Aug. 15. Prosecutors alleged Summers \"grabbed\" the officer with force, and charged him with assaulting and resisting an officer.",
      "Shortly after the grand jury rejected the case, a defense attorney for Summers filed a motion in court, which argued, \"Mr. Summers should not be forced to live under the threat of later charges and rearrest. The charges against Mr. Summers were based on an allegation made by one officer who was wearing a body-worn camera. That officer's testimony was rejected by the grand jury, presumably after reviewing the body-worn camera video.\"",
      "The Justice Department filed a motion to dismiss Summers's case on Aug. 29.",
      "The trajectory of Jones' case was less clear after Tuesday's hearing. Upadhyaya scheduled a hearing for Monday, but declined Jones' request to loosen the restrictions governing her release from pretrial detention.",
      "The reasons these D.C. grand juries have not handed up indictments in these cases are not known, but Salgado suggested it might be possible that in each of these cases \"that they disagreed with the Justice Department's theory of prosecution.\"",
      "\"It is not difficult to imagine 12 D.C. jurors concluding that throwing a sandwich at a federal officer \u2014 while clearly objectionable and potentially unlawful \u2014 does not amount to felony assault,\" Salgado said. \"At its core, the federal grand jury functions as a vital constitutional safeguard and a critical check on prosecutorial discretion, as guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment.\"",

      "The United States will keep assets positioned in the Caribbean and strike anyone \"trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco terrorist,\" Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said Wednesday morning, a day after President Donald Trump said the U.S. military had attacked and destroyed a drug-carrying vessel in the region.",
      "Mr. Trump said Tuesday that the U.S. had struck the boat\u00a0in international waters after it had departed from Venezuela. The president later\u00a0said on Truth Social\u00a0that 11 people were killed in the strike. He said the attack targeted members of\u00a0Tren de Aragua, a Venezuela-based organized crime group that has been\u00a0designated\u00a0as a foreign terrorist organization by the Trump administration.",
      "Mr. Trump also posted a video that appeared to show a military strike obliterating a small boat in the open sea.",

He said the video was \"definitely not artificial intelligence,\" as Venezuela's Communications Minister Freddy \u00d1\u00e1\u00f1ez claimed in a post on social media. Hegseth said that he could not elaborate on how the operation had been carried out, but said it was a \"precision\" attack.",

      "Hawaii's\u00a0Kilauea volcano erupted again this week, spewing lava 500 feet into the air from the crater at its summit, the\u00a0U.S. Geological Survey said. The eruption ended around 8 p.m. local time on Tuesday night, after producing approximately 337 million cubic feet of molten rock over a 13-hour period.",
      "This marked the 32nd episode\u00a0in an ongoing eruption event at Kilauea, one of the most active volcanoes in the world, which began in December.",
      "Lava from the eruption has been contained inside the summit of the crater at Hawaii Volcanoes National State Park, a massive protected and uninhabited area located on the Big Island of Hawaii.",
      "The first overflow of lava on Tuesday came from the north vent in Kilauea's Halemaumau Crater, the\u00a0U.S. Geological Survey said. At 6:30 a.m., the vent started to dispel fountains of lava, and similar eruptions broke out from a vent on the south side of the crater, and a third vent in between, within a few hours. Several lava fountains shot up hundreds of feet into the sky, which has happened before since its initial burst of activity late last year.",
      "The volcano produced an enormous volume of lava during Tuesday's activity, with the U.S. Geological Survey reporting that fountains put out an average of 6,750 cubic feet of lava per second \u2014 enough to fill almost five Olympic-sized swimming pools every minute \u2014 over the course of the latest eruption. By the end of it, lava flows had covered between 40 and 50% of the floor of the crater, and officials warned that they may continue to move slowly for the next several days as they cool.",

That smog can cause respiratory problems and other health issues when high concentrations remain in the atmosphere.",
      "The U.S. Geological Survey warned of other hazards closer to the site of the eruption, including strands of volcanic glass that can be found more than 10 miles from the vent as well as other volcanic fragments, which in previous eruptions have ended up falling onto one of the island's main highways.",

    "story": [
      "A former correctional officer, a former inmate at a South Carolina prison and the ex-inmate's brother have been arrested and charged with running a widespread operation to smuggle drugs into over a dozen state prisons.",
      "The trio allegedly used packages \"presented as containing books\" to smuggle hundreds of strips containing synthetic cannabinoids and Suboxone into 14 prisons in the state, according to arrest warrants. The packages were dropped off at the Woodruff Post Office and mailed to the various prisons between March and June 2025, officials said.",
      "The former correctional officer was identified by the South Carolina Department of Corrections as Shataysha Quneeka Lewis, 36. Lewis left her job at South Carolina's Evans Correctional Institution in 2019, the department said. She was charged with possession of suboxone with intent to distribute, possession of synthetic marijuana with intent to distribute, providing contraband to prisoners and criminal conspiracy.",
      "The former inmate was identified as Devin Jamaal Kershaw, 41. Kershaaw is a former inmate who spent about 20 years in prison for charges including kidnapping before his release in 2022, the South Carolina Department of Corrections said. He has been charged with possession of suboxone, possession of a firearm by a felon, furnishing contraband to a prisoner and criminal conspiracy.",
      "Kershaw's brother, Coure Romaine Terry, 36, was charged with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, the department said.",
      "Court documents allege that Lewis conspired with Kershaw and Terry to smuggle the drugs and orchestrated the delivery of the packages. Video surveillance footage showed her sending the suspicious packages, according to court documents. At least 20 inmates received the packages, the corrections department said.",
      "The court documents did not detail the investigation into the operation, but said that multiple inmates gave statements about their involvement in the smuggling effort. Officials also obtained messages and recorded calls from the prison phone system and contraband cell phones recovered from inmates, according to the court documents. The U.S. Postal Investigation Unit, the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office and the Woodruff Police Department contributed to the investigation, the South Carolina Department of Corrections said.",
      "\"We fight daily schemes from criminals trying to bring contraband into our prisons, and I will not tolerate it,\" South Carolina Department of Corrections Director Joel Anderson said in the news release. \"These drugs are poisoning our inmates and are a danger to our staff. I am thankful we are holding these people accountable for the harmful situations they create.\"",

In March 2025, a New York woman pleaded guilty to charges of manufacturing synthetic cannabinoids and sending drug-soaked documents to inmates in multiple correctional facilities. A\u00a0Chicago correctional officer was accused\u00a0of trying to bring such materials into the Cook County Jail in August 2024. In 2022, a South African woman was\u00a0sentenced to one year\u00a0in prison for\u00a0orchestrating a scheme to smuggle\u00a0dozens of packages containing drug-soaked papers into Ohio prisons.",

Kennedy Jr.'s leadership in the aftermath of the firing of the CDC director last week, claiming he is \"endangering every American's health.\"",
      "\"What the health and human services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has done to the CDC and to our nation's public health system over the past several months \u2014 culminating in his decision to fire Dr. Susan Monarez as CDC director days ago \u2014 is unlike anything we had ever seen at the agency and unlike anything our country had ever experienced,\" the nine former directors and acting directors wrote in the op-ed in The New York Times.",
      "The Trump administration attempted to oust CDC Director Susan Monarez last week, less than a month after she was confirmed by the Senate, although her lawyers have pushed back on the legality of her firing. Meanwhile, several other top CDC officials have resigned in recent days, pointing to disagreements with the Trump administration over its vaccine policy, among other things. CBS News reported last week that Jim O'Neill, the deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, has been selected to serve as the acting director of the CDC.",
      "In their op-ed, the former CDC directors who served under both Democrat and Republican administrations, pointed to a number of decisions by Kennedy that they say are \"unlike anything we had ever seen at the agency,\" including canceling investments into medical research and the move to replace members on a key vaccine advisory committee, among other things.",
      "\"Firing Dr. Monarez \u2014 which led to the resignations of top CDC officials \u2014 adds considerable fuel to this raging fire,\" the former CDC directors added.",

      "\"The loss of Dr. Monarez and other top leaders will make it far more difficult for the CDC to do what it has done for about 80 years: work around the clock to protect Americans from threats to their lives and health,\" they wrote.",
      "Meanwhile, the former CDC directors also called on Congress to exercise its oversight authority over the department of Health and Human Services. The CDC is one of a number of agencies under the HHS umbrella.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, called on HHS last week\u00a0 to \"indefinitely postpone\" its vaccine advisory committee meeting scheduled for Sept. 18 amid the slew of CDC departures. And the Louisiana Republican, who delivered the key vote to advance Kennedy's confirmation as secretary, also said the \"high profile departures will require oversight by the HELP Committee.\"",
      "When Cassidy was asked Tuesday evening if he regretted his vote to confirm Kennedy, he said, \"This is about children's health.\"",
      "\"This is about how we protect the children of the United States of America,\" Cassidy continued. \"And there's allegations that that health is being endangered. I'm not presupposing anybody's right or wrong. We got to get to the bottom of it, and it'll take radical transparency. My colleagues agree with that.\"",
      "In an appearance on Fox News last week after the CDC director firing, Kennedy said he wouldn't comment on personnel, but claimed that \"the CDC has problems,\" citing COVID-19 protocols among them.",
      "\"We need to look at the priorities of the agency, if there's really a deeply, deeply embedded, I would say, malaise at the agency,\" Kennedy said. \"And we need strong leadership that will go in there and that will be able to execute on President Trump's broad ambitions.\"",

      "Citing the firings of federal health workers across HHS, the weakening of public health programs, questions about the effectiveness and safety of vaccines amid a serious measles outbreak in Texas, among other things, Gounder said on \"CBS Mornings Plus\" that \"we really are very concerned about how this is now diminishing trust in the very most basic of public health infrastructure in this country.\"",

    "summary": "The judge rejected the Justice Department's effort to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, concluding the request was a bridge too far.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a shake-up of Google's search engine in a crackdown aimed at curbing the corrosive power of an illegal monopoly while rebuffing the U.S. government's attempt to break up the company and impose other restraints.",
      "The 226-page decision made by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington, D.C., will likely ripple across the technological landscape at a time when the industry is being reshaped by breakthroughs in artificial intelligence \u2014 including conversational \"answer engines\" as companies like ChatGPT and Perplexity try to upend Google's long-held position as the internet's main gateway.",
      "The innovations and competition being unleashed by generative artificial intelligence, or \"GenAI,\" have reshaped the judge's approach to remedies in the nearly five-year-old antitrust case.",
      "\"Unlike the typical case where the court's job is to resolve a dispute based on historic facts, here the court is asked to gaze into a crystal ball and look to the future. Not exactly a judge's forte,\" Mehta wrote.",
      "Investors seemed to interpret the ruling as a relatively light slap on the wrist for Google, as the stock price of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., surged nearly 3% in extended trading.",
      "The judge is trying to rein in Google by prohibiting some of the tactics the company deployed to drive traffic to its search engine and other services.",
      "But Mehta stopped short of banning the multi-billion dollar deals that Google has been making for years to lock in its search engine as the default on smartphones, personal computers and other devices. Those deals, involving payments of more than $26 billion annually, were one of the main issues that prompted the judge to conclude Google's search engine was an illegal monopoly, but he decided banning them in the future would do more harm than good.",
      "Partially because he is allowing the default deals to continue, Mehta is ordering Google to give its current and would-be rivals access to some of its search engine's secret sauce \u2014 the data stockpiled from trillions of queries that it used to help improve the quality of its search results.",
      "The judge also rejected the U.S. Justice Department's effort to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, concluding it was an unwarranted step that \"would be incredibly messy and highly risky.\"",
      "\"Now the Court has imposed limits on how we distribute Google services, and will require us to share Search data with rivals,\" Google said in a statement provided to CBS News following the ruling. \"We have concerns about how these requirements will impact our users and their privacy, and we're reviewing the decision closely. The Court did recognize that divesting Chrome and Android would have gone beyond the case's focus on search distribution, and would have harmed consumers and our partners.\"",
      "\"We proved in court that competition had been frozen in place for two decades in internet search,\" Abigail Slater, assistant attorney general of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, wrote in a social media post. \"Google's tactics have excluded competition, harming consumers and slowing innovation. Today's remedy order agreed with the need to restore competition to the long-monopolized search market, and we are now weighing our options and thinking through whether the ordered relief goes far enough in serving that goal.\"",
      "Allowing the default search deals to continue is more than just a victory for Google. It's also something that Apple, which receives more than $20 billion annually from Google, and the beneficiaries of the payments urged Mehta to maintain.",
      "In hearings earlier this year, Apple warned the judge that banning the contracts would deprive the company of money that it funnels into its own innovative research. The Cupertino, California, company also cautioned that the ban could have the unintended consequence of making Google even more powerful by pocketing the money it had been spending on deals while most consumers will still end up flocking to Google's search engine anyway.",
      "Others, such as the owners of the Firefox search engine, asserted that losing the Google contracts would threaten their future survival by depriving them of essential revenue.",

On top of that, many states levy their own income tax on winnings, which can range from a few percent to more than 10%, while a handful of states don't tax lottery prizes at all.",

    "summary": "Health officials say Israel's growing offensive has killed at least 287 Gazans since international scholars, including Holocaust experts, called the war genocidal.",
    "story": [
      "Israel's expanding military offensive has killed at least 287 people in Gaza in the three days since a group of world-leading genocide scholars declared that Israel is committing genocide in the besieged Palestinian enclave, according to health officials in the Hamas-run territory.",
      "The International Association of Genocide Scholars \u2014 which includes Holocaust experts \u2014 declared in an Aug. 31 resolution that Israel's actions in Gaza since the 22-month war began constitute genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.",
      "As evidence, the group pointed to the killing or maiming of 50,000 children; Israeli leaders characterizing Palestinians in Gaza as \"human animals\" and threatening to \"flatten\" the territory and turn it into hell; and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu endorsing President Trump's plan for the U.S. to\u00a0\"take over\" the strip\u00a0and have all of its inhabitants \"resettled\" elsewhere.",
      "The territory was home to approximately 2.3 million people before the war, which Israel launched in retaliation for the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack orchestrated by Gaza's Hamas rulers. Some 1,200 Israelis were killed in that attack, and 251 others were taken as hostages into Gaza. Israel's leader has said 20 of those captives are still believed to be alive.",
      "Israel's Foreign Ministry dismissed the latest allegation of genocide, saying it was \"entirely based on Hamas' campaign of lies and the laundering of those lies by others.\" Its statement went on to say that it was the Israeli people who were actually subjected to genocide by Hamas with the Oct. 7 terrorist attack.",
      "Numerous leading human rights bodies, including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the Israeli organization B'Tselem and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories, had all previously concluded that Israel's military operation in Gaza amounted to genocide. Israel has rejected all of the accusations, saying they are based on a false Hamas narrative.",
      "Since the scholars group declared a genocide on Aug. 31, the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health has reported at least 287 people killed by Israeli operations, bringing the total death toll to at least 63,746, as well as 161,245 wounded, since Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Israel has not allowed international journalists to enter Gaza and operate freely since the war began, despite repeated requests from CBS News and other organizations, so it is impossible to verify the health ministry's figures, which do not differentiate between civilian and combatant casualties. The U.N. considers the death toll reported by the ministry the most accurate information available, and Israel, while consistently denying the figures, has not provided its own reports on Palestinians killed during the war.",
      "The U.N. Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities said Wednesday, meanwhile, that at least 21,000 Gazan children had been rendered disabled by Israeli assaults since the war began.",
      "Fear grows along with Israel's offensive in Gaza City",
      "Israel recently declared Gaza City, the biggest population center in the Palestinian territory, a \"dangerous combat zone,\" and its forces have pushed forward with a controversial plan to seize the metropolis, which Israel's leader says is necessary to defeat Hamas.",
      "Parts of the city are already considered \"red zones,\" where Palestinians have been ordered to evacuate ahead of expected heavy fighting.",
      "That has left residents on edge, including many who returned after fleeing the city in the initial stages of the war. With Israeli bulldozers razing the ground in occupied neighborhoods and some Israeli politicians openly supporting the mass relocation of Palestinians from Gaza, many of the city's residents fear that departing now could mean leaving for good.",
      "Moving costs thousands of dollars and finding space in the overcrowded south to pitch a tent feels impossible. But staying behind, many say, could be deadly.",
      "\"The Israeli forces, when they mark any area by red color and they request the people to leave, they really will destroy it,\" Mohammed Alkurdi, who is sheltering in Gaza City along with hundreds of thousands of other Palestinians, told The Associated Press. \"So it's like you decide whether to live or die. It's very simple like that.\"",
      "Since Israel declared the area a combat zone on Friday, a small fraction \u2014 some 14,840 Palestinians of the nearly 1 million that the U.N. estimates are still in Gaza City \u2014 had left their homes as of Monday, most to flee to the south, according to the Site Management Cluster, a joint humanitarian body that coordinates assistance for people in displacement sites.",
      "A fraction of them, about 2,200, have moved to new places within Gaza City after being displaced by Israeli attacks.",
      "Alkurdi, a project manager and consultant, told the AP he could hear Israeli forces from the apartment where he's sheltering as they \"erase the area completely.\"",
      "Zeitoun was once Gaza City's largest neighborhood, filled with markets, schools and clinics. Over the last month, large swaths of it and the neighboring area of Sabra have been flattened, according to satellite photos reviewed by the AP from early August and early September. The photos show entire blocks have been pummeled or bulldozed into empty, sandy lots.",
      "\"It's not something partial like before. It's 100%,\" Alkurdi said. \"The house, I'm telling my friends, it keeps dancing all the day. It keeps dancing, going right and left like an earthquake.\"",
      "Many of the people in the city moved back to the north during a ceasefire in January, hoping to find their homes intact. Alkurdi's home was completely destroyed, so he's now living alone in a western area of the city. His children and wife were able to leave Gaza last year. He said he would flee south if his home fell under an evacuation order.",
      "Netanyahu defended the Gaza City offensive before it began, insisting the Israeli military had \"no choice but to finish the job and complete the defeat of Hamas.\" He has said repeatedly that the objective of the war is to demilitarize the enclave, maintain the Israeli military's \"overriding security control\" over it, and put a non-Israeli civilian administration in charge. He also says it is aimed at freeing the remaining hostages, though many of the captives' families have voiced concern that expanding the offensive into densely packed Gaza City will put them at greater risk.",
      "For Gaza's residents, the operation is already bringing more violence, and the prospect of more upheaval.",
      "Amal Seyam is the general director of the Women's Affairs Center in Gaza. Originally from the Tuffah neighborhood in eastern Gaza City, her home was destroyed by bombardment. For nearly four months, she has been sheltering in the Nasr neighborhood in the city's west, where she stays alongside her colleagues inside the women's center.",
      "Seyam has been displaced five times since the war began \u2014 three times within the city and twice to the south, in Rafah and Khan Younis. Each time, she fled with nothing.",
      "When asked if she would consider leaving Gaza City as Israeli forces advance, Seyam said: \"I will only leave when everyone who needs me here leaves. As long as there's a woman who needs me, I am staying. All of Gaza feels like it's in the red zone now anyway. The bombing is happening meters from us, not kilometers.\"",
      "She paused, her voice breaking into tears.",
      "\"Many people have started packing. Many have already left. Do you know what displacement means? It means moving once again, building your life once again, buying new things, blankets, tents, all over again.\"",

      "Mr. Trump said Tuesday that the U.S. had struck the boat\u00a0in international waters after it had departed from Venezuela. The president later\u00a0said on Truth Social\u00a0that 11 people were killed in the strike. He said the attack targeted members of\u00a0Tren de Aragua, a Venezuela-based organized crime group that has been\u00a0designated\u00a0as a foreign terrorist organization by the Trump administration.",
      "Mr. Trump also posted a video that appeared to show a military strike obliterating a small boat in the open sea.",
      "Hegseth told \"Fox & Friends\" on Wednesday morning that he watched the strike live. He said the video was \"definitely not artificial intelligence,\" as Venezuela's Communications Minister Freddy \u00d1\u00e1\u00f1ez claimed in a post on social media. Hegseth said that he could not elaborate on how the operation had been carried out, but said it was a \"precision\" attack.",
      "\"We knew exactly who was in that boat, we knew exactly what they were doing, and we knew exactly who they represented, and that was Tren de Aragua ... trying to poison our country with illicit drugs,\" Hegseth said.",
      "Hegseth did not say how the government identified the boat or those aboard it. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Tuesday that he believed the drugs were headed toward Trinidad and Tobago or another country in the Caribbean. Kamla Persad-Bissessar, the prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago, praised the strike in a statement issued late Tuesday, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Hegseth said Wednesday that the strike shows that \"President Trump is willing to go on offense in ways that others have not been\" when dealing with drug smugglers.",
      "\"You want to try to traffic drugs, it's a new day,\" the defense secretary said. \"It's a different day, and so those 11 drug traffickers are no longer with us, sending a very clear signal that this is an activity the United States is not going to tolerate in our hemisphere.\"",
      "Hegseth said that assets will remain in the region, and that further strikes may be forthcoming.",
      "\"This is a deadly, serious mission for us and it won't stop with just this strike,\" he said. \"Anyone else trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco-terrorist will face the same fate.\"",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0directed the military\u00a0to target drug cartels in Latin America last month. In August, the U.S. said the Navy would increase its presence near Venezuela and deploy multiple warships as part of an anti-drug cartel mission. Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u00a0called the move\u00a0an \"extravagant, unjustifiable, immoral and absolutely criminal and bloody threat.\" Maduro responded by deploying\u00a0warships and drones to Venezuela's coastline.",
      "The U.S. has not indicated it plans to strike Venezuela directly. When Hegseth was asked Wednesday by Fox News about the possibility of a regime change in the country, he said it was a \"presidential decision.\" The Trump administration has\u00a0accused Maduro's government\u00a0of working with drug cartels and groups like Tren de Aragua to bring illicit substances into the United States.",
      "A U.S. federal court charged Maduro\u00a0with narco-terrorism and drug trafficking\u00a0in 2020, allegations that Maduro has denied. The U.S. is offering a $50 million\u00a0reward for Maduro's arrest.",
      "\"What we have, there in the Caribbean, is clear demonstration of military might,\" Hegseth said in the \"Fox & Friends\" interview. \"President Trump has shown whether it is southwest border, Houthis, (Operation) Midnight Hammer in Iran, precise power could impact and reshape dynamics around the world and in the region. Nicolas Maduro, as he considers whether to be a narco-trafficker, has decisions to make.\"",

      "Here's a look at some of the weapons that were on display, including some the world had not seen previously:",
      "Drones, AI and lasers",
      "China's LY-1 laser weapon was displayed during the parade for the first time, mounted on top of armored trucks. Defense analyst Alexander Neill told the BBC that the powerful device is believed to have the ability to disable electronics or blind pilots.",
      "There were a number of conventional drones on display, as well as some AI-powered ones.",
      "One that drew particular attention was the AJX002 giant submarine drone, which measures approximately 65 feet long.",
      "Also known as an extra-large uncrewed underwater vehicle, it could carry out reconnaissance or surveillance missions.",
      "China also showed off stealth attack drones in the parade, including the GJ-11, which is capable of flying alongside manned fighter jets and aiding them in their missions.",
      "\"Robotic wolves\" were also on display. Experts say the four-legged, walking robots could be used for numerous operations, such as sweeping for mines, reconnaissance missions or hunting down enemy troops.",
      "New nuclear-capable, long-range missiles",
      "A new version of China's Dongfeng-5 nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile, the DF-5C, was unveiled for the parade. It is said to have a longer range than previous variants, Neill told the BBC. He said the missile can also carry up to 12 warheads on a single mission.",
      "The new missile is silo-based, launched from underground facilities, and is meant to be a strategic deterrent, Neill said.",
      "According to The Associated Press, the DF-5C has an estimated range of about 12,400 miles, which makes it easily capable of reaching any part of the United States from mainland China.",
      "A number of other nuclear-capable missiles were rolled down central Beijing's Chang-an (\"Eternal Peace\") Avenue, including the DF-61. Like the DF-5C, it is an intercontinental ballistic missile, but the DF-61 can be fired from a mobile launcher. Little is known about the new weapon, but the previous model has a range of more than 7,500 miles, and it can also carry multiple warheads.",
      "The AP said China's parade also featured the JL-1 and JL-3 nuclear-capable long-range missiles, the first of which is launched from aircraft and the second from vessels at sea.",
      "China wants to \"replace traditional structures\"",
      "\"China not only wants to augment, but replace traditional structures,\" defense analyst Michael Raska told CBS News partner network BBC News, adding that it seems to have taken lessons from Russia's war in Ukraine, where a strategy has been to \"throw drones at the enemy\" to wear down their defenses.",
      "While some countries are concerned about incorporating artificial intelligence into their military systems, China appears to be plowing ahead and \"believe they can control AI,\" Raska told the BBC. \"They are going all the way to integrate it into their systems.\"",
      "The parade showed that China has the resources to build up a significant arsenal, but Raska said the U.S. still maintains the edge operationally.",
      "The U.S. is more agile in battle because it has a \"bottom-up\" culture, where decisions can be made and adapted on the ground in response to evolving situations, Raska said.

    "summary": "Egypt's government has removed security barriers around the U.K. Embassy in Cairo amid a dispute over protest action directed at Egyptian diplomatic facilities in Europe.",
    "story": [
      "Cairo \u2014\u00a0The British Embassy in Cairo said Sunday that it had temporarily closed its main building after Egyptian authorities removed concrete security barriers from around the compound's exterior perimeter. The barriers had been there for decades as a security measure.",
      "\"The main Embassy building is temporarily closed while we review the impact of works undertaken by the Egyptian authorities in the vicinity,\" a U.K. Foreign Office spokesperson told CBS News in a statement on Monday, noting that the embassy remained in operation and only the primary building was closed.",
      "There was no official comment from the Egyptian government about the removal of the barriers outside the U.K. embassy, but the move came amid escalating diplomatic tension between Egypt and several countries over protests targeting Egyptian missions abroad, including in the Netherlands, Austria, France, Turkey, the U.K., Canada, the U.S, and in Israel.",
      "In recent months, pro-Palestinian demonstrators have chained the doors of Egyptian embassies and consulates closed from the outside and spray-painted slogans on their walls, mostly demanding the opening of the Rafah crossing between northeast Egypt and the war-torn Gaza Strip.",
      "Egyptian officials have said their side of the Rafah crossing has remained open since the Gaza war erupted almost two years ago, while the Israeli military controls the Palestinian side and how much aid is allowed in, and how many people are allowed out.",
      "The Egyptian authorities have argued that the protests are not random nor peaceful, but rather organized attacks against the country, and they have accused European host governments of failing to protect their staff and diplomatic premises from vandalism.",
      "Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty was heard in a video circulated online suggesting Egypt could take reciprocal action, saying: \"If their governments won't provide adequate security for our missions, then we should reconsider our own deployments.\"",
      "In a few cases, activists who back the Egyptian government have taken matters into their own hands and gathered outside embassies in European capitals, declaring that they were there to protect the facilities.",
      "Most of these activists have identified themselves as members of the so-called \"Union of Egyptian Youth Abroad.\"",
      "The self-described leader of that group, Ahmed Abdel Qader, was detained in London last week by British police. According to Egypt's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty raised the case in an Aug. 26 phone call with U.K. National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell.",
      "In a\u00a0statement published online that day by the Egyptian government, the foreign ministry said it was following his detention \"with great concern\" and had requested urgent clarification of the circumstances surrounding the arrest, stressing Egypt expected his \"prompt release.\"",
      "Social media videos show the activist was released after being detained, and there were no charges announced. A spokesperson for London's Metropolitan Police confirmed the arrest of a 36-year-old man in a statement sent to CBS News on Wednesday.",
      "The police said officers were called at 10 p.m. local time on Aug. 25 \"to reports of a man with a knife in a caf\u00e9\" in London's Westminster area. The spokesperson said he \"was arrested at the scene on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon, threats to kill and affray,\" and confirmed that he was later released on bail.",
      "Amid the dispute, a relatively new political party in Egypt, the National Front Party, issued a lengthy statement declaring solidarity with the foreign ministry and condemning the activist's detention in London.",
      "\"We will not protect those who do not protect us,\" the party, which was founded in December, declared in its Aug. 26 statement. It condemned the detention of \"one of Egypt's loyal sons\" as a \"blatant violation of justice, human rights, and the rules of diplomatic relations.\"",
      "The party called on the government to reconsider the privileges granted to British diplomatic missions in Cairo. It specifically pointed to the U.K. Embassy in the affluent, heavily fortified Garden City neighborhood where the U.S. and other embassies are also located.",
      "The party argued that the British facility's concrete barriers and other security measures had turned the area into \"a closed-off zone\" and disrupted residents' lives, and it demanded that the barriers be removed.",

    "summary": "China's Xi Jinping was joined by Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un for a display of power and the rising tide of anti-U.S. sentiment.",
    "story": [
      "Beijing \u2014\u00a0China flexed its might and muscle on Wednesday at a military parade in Beijing showcasing its latest missiles, advanced weapons systems and drones. In his address, President Xi Jinping said his nation was \"unstoppable.\"",
      "It was China's biggest military parade ever, meant to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II and Japan's formal surrender. But the massive \"Victory Day\" procession down Chang-an Avenue \u2014 the name of which means \"Eternal Peace\" \u2014 carried a much broader message. Standing next to Xi for the parade were Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un.",
      "Security in the sprawling Chinese capital was extra tight. All buildings overlooking the parade route were locked down as the leaders and other dignitaries from 26 countries took in the spectacle, along with some 50,000 spectators.",
      "It was a landmark moment for Xi, China's 72-year-old leader. It was the third and most important military parade he has overseen since coming to power in 2012.",
      "As commander-in-chief of the world's largest standing armed forces, he watched smiling as tens of thousands of troops under his orders goose stepped in perfect unison toward Tiananmen Square in central Beijing with the sound of cannons ringing through the air.",
      "It was a visceral display of China's growing military might and newest hardware, including hypersonic weapons, nuclear capable missiles, a new laser weapon, fighter jets and underwater drones. But it also pointedly showed off Beijing's growing clout as a geopolitical power, with deepening ties to some of the United States' most potent adversaries.",
      "The message from the stage, with Xi, Putin and Kim standing shoulder to shoulder, was undeniable: strength in solidarity, and a challenge to the U.S.-dominated world order that has prevailed for a century.",
      "Together, they have\u00a0been dubbed\u00a0an \"Axis of Upheaval\" by some Western analysts, and Xi's decision to bring together the leaders of some of the most\u00a0heavily sanctioned nations\u00a0in the world was clearly calculated. The parade was the first time that Kim had ever appeared together with both Xi and Putin \u2014 offering him a first multilateral diplomatic event.",
      "Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian and the leader of Myanmar's ruling military junta, President Min Aung Hlaing, were also there, according to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",
      "Xi and Putin have made their ambition to shake up the global status quo clear for several years.",
      "\"We, together with you and with our sympathizers, will move towards a multipolar, just, democratic world order,\" Russia's longtime Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in 2022, ahead of a meeting with his Chinese counterpart.",
      "The gathering in Beijing represented a clear challenge to President Trump's claim to be fostering close working relationships with Xi, Putin and Kim.",
      "Mr. Trump had a go at China on social media, saying American soldiers deserve credit for helping China defeat Japanese forces during WWII. He went on to accuse China, Russia and North Korea of conspiring against the U.S., which a Kremlin spokesperson dismissed as possible irony.",
      "Xi's bond with Putin was on clear and deliberate display in the days leading up to the parade, as well.",
      "China and Russia have declared their \"no limits partnership\" and, while China claims to maintain a neutral stance on Russia's war in Ukraine, Beijing's support of the war effort \u2014 by providing dual-use technology and continuing to purchase Russian oil and gas in defiance of Western sanctions, has proven to be an economic lifeline funding Putin's three-and-a-half-year war.",
      "During talks at Beijing's Great Hall of the People on Tuesday, Putin hailed \"unprecedentedly high relations\" with China and thanked his \"dear friend\" Xi for the warm welcome.",
      "Kim's support for Russia's war has been even more direct. Since October last year, North Korea has sent around 13,000 troops, along with conventional weapons, to support Russia's war effort. South Korea's intelligence services estimate that around 2,000 North Korean troops have been killed fighting alongside Russian forces.",
      "The parade was a show of both China and Russia's implicit support for Kim's nuclear weapons program, which remains the subject of numerous United Nations sanctions.",
      "Xi burnished his credentials as a geopolitical powerbroker at a regional security summit in Tianjin, northern China, that ended on Monday. He hosted more than 20 world leaders there, including Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",
      "\"We should uphold fairness and justice,\" Xi declared at the gathering of the Shanghai Corporation Organization, seemingly trying to claim moral high ground amid the upheaval and strained relationships caused by Mr. Trump's global trade war and isolationist policies. \"We must oppose the Cold War mentality, block confrontation and bullying practices.\"",
      "Without mentioning the U.S. or its president by name, Xi told the assembled leaders of non-Western countries: \"We must continue to take a clear stand against hegemonism and power politics.\"",
      "On Monday Xi, Putin and Modi were shown together smiling and laughing at the summit \u2014 a deliberate public display of warmth and camaraderie. Just last week, the U.S. imposed 50% tariffs on India for buying Russian oil.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a close ally of Mr. Trump, called the summit \"performative\" and accused China and India of being \"bad actors\" for fueling Russia's war.",
      "At the parade this week, Xi was not only asserting China as a reliable and stable partner, but also showing off his country's burgeoning alliances, influence and military power \u2014 and the potential to back up his vision of a new world order. It was a message that many see as being aimed squarely, if not entirely, at China's rival across the Pacific.",

      "President Trump announced the strike during an unrelated Tuesday afternoon Oval Office event, saying the military had \"shot out\" the boat \"moments ago.\" He said his team had been briefed on the strike by Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.",
      "The president later\u00a0said on Truth Social that 11 people were killed in the strike, which he said targeted members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuela-based organized crime group that the Trump administration has designated as a foreign terrorist organization. He posted a video that appeared to show a military strike against a small boat.",
      "\"Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!\" the president wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Rubio posted on X that the military carried out a \"lethal strike\" in the southern Caribbean Sea. He said the \"drug vessel\" had departed Venezuela and \"was being operated by a designated narco-terrorist organization.\" Rubio later told reporters he believed the drugs that were allegedly carried on the boat were probably headed toward Trinidad and Tobago or \"some other country in the Caribbean.\" A senior defense official also said the U.S. had conducted a \"precision strike\" against the vessel.",
      "The strike came after the U.S. confirmed last month\u00a0that the Navy would boost its presence near Venezuela, deploying three warships to the waters off the South American country as part of an anti-drug cartel mission. Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro called the ships an \"extravagant, unjustifiable, immoral and absolutely criminal and bloody threat\" and deployed military forces to the country's coastline, vowing to defend against any possible U.S. attack.",

    "story": [
      "In recent weeks, President Trump has repeatedly claimed he deserves credit for ending six or seven wars during his first months in office, arguing that he should receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his work.",
      "\"I stopped seven wars, and they were, they're big ones too,\" Mr. Trump said Friday.",
      "\"I've settled six wars, and a lot of people say seven because there's one that nobody knows about,\" he said in an August 19 interview.",
      "A White House official provided a list of seven conflicts the president is referencing: Israel and Iran, Rwanda and Democratic Republic of the Congo, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Thailand and Cambodia, India and Pakistan, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Serbia and Kosovo.",
      "\"There has been more progress towards peace than ever before because of this President's leadership,\" the official wrote.",
      "The recipient of the 2025 Nobel Peace prize is expected to be announced next month.",
      "Over 100 people have received the award since the 19th-century chemist Alfred Nobel created the prize to honor a \"person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.\"",
      "Four U.S. presidents have been past laureates, most recently Barack Obama who received the prize for supporting nuclear nonproliferation and international diplomacy.",
      "Foreign policy experts say that while Mr. Trump has helped broker ceasefires, including one between Israel and Iran, several of the foreign conflicts cited by the administration were not full-scale wars \u2014 and many remain unresolved. The White House did not respond to a request for clarification on why the president has repeatedly labeled all seven conflicts as settled wars.",
      "Some of these peace efforts involved limited U.S. involvement, and in other instances, it remains unclear whether Mr. Trump's role was decisive.",
      "Here's a look at the conflicts:",
      "Israel and Iran",
      "After Israel attacked Iran's nuclear facilities in June, a 12-day conflict resulted in the deaths of about 28 Israelis and hundreds of Iranians before a ceasefire was reached with U.S. and Qatari involvement. Mr. Trump claimed credit, saying he had ordered U.S. airstrikes on Iran's uranium enrichment sites and pressed Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to hold back from further strikes.",
      "Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at Brookings, said Mr. Trump deserves some credit for this ceasefire. \"He managed to use a combination of a good relationship with Netanyahu, but also a willingness to put a little pressure on Netanyahu that I think contributed to the at least temporary cessation of hostilities,\" O'Hanlon said.",
      "But other foreign policy experts said tensions between the nations are far from resolved, and Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in early July that the Defense Department estimated the U.S. strikes likely delayed Iran's nuclear program by \"one to two years.\"",
      "Larry Haas, a senior fellow at the American Foreign Policy Council said, \"I very strongly disagree with the notion that the president brought peace to Iran and Israel. We may be in a quiet period in terms of direct confrontation, but Iran right now is trying to regroup.\"",
      "Rwanda and Democratic Republic of the Congo",
      "In June, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo announced a\u00a0peace deal after multiple days of talks in Washington mediated by President Trump and Qatar.",
      "The deal aimed to end three decades of fighting over Congo's mineral reserves. Yet the violence has continued, with both sides accusing each other of violating peace terms. Human Rights Watch reported that M23, an armed group that U.S. officials believe is backed by Rwanda, killed over 140 civilians in eastern Congo in July.",
      "\"It's a premature declaration of success, when in fact we are just getting to the starting line,\" O'Hanlon said.",
      "Armenia and Azerbaijan",
      "In August, Mr. Trump helped negotiate an agreement aimed at normalizing relations and\u00a0 reopening transportation routes between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which have spent decades fighting for control of the Karabakh region.",
      "O'Hanlon and Haas agreed the Trump administration pushed the deal forward in part by inviting both leaders to the White House. Leaders of both countries also credited Mr. Trump for the agreement, saying he should receive the Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "But the deal is not a formal peace agreement and requires ratification. One remaining sticking point is that Azerbaijan wants Armenia to remove any mention of territorial claims to Azerbaijan's land from its constitution before officials sign a final deal.\u00a0 Armenia's prime minister has expressed willingness to change the constitution but has not specified a date for a referendum.",
      "Thailand and Cambodia",
      "In late July, Thailand and Cambodia agreed to a ceasefire after an outbreak of fighting killed at least 35 people. President Trump said that he had pressured both sides to come to the table by threatening trade consequences.",
      "The U.S. is a top importer for both counties, and foreign policy experts CBS News spoke to said Mr. Trump's tariff threats played a significant role in securing a ceasefire. \"He helped move things along with economic pressure,\" Haas said.",
      "The border dispute is continuing, though, with Thai officials accusing Cambodia of laying new landmines. Cambodia denied doing so.",
      "India and Pakistan",
      "India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire in May after weeks of cross-border missile and drone strikes. The deal ended the latest flare-up in their long-running dispute over Kashmir, which both nuclear-armed nations claim as their territory.",
      "Pakistan credited the Trump administration's efforts in U.S.-led talks, and nominated him for the Nobel Peace prize. But India insisted its own pressure on Pakistan, not U.S. diplomacy, drove the deal.",
      "Josh Kurlantzick, a senior fellow for Southeast Asia and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, said it's a stretch to call the dispute over Kashmir settled.",
      "\"There is no real ending to this conflict,\" he said, noting that future negotiations could be complicated by Mr. Trump's decision to impose steep tariffs on India, a key partner.",
      "Egypt and Ethiopia",
      "Mr. Trump also claims he brokered peace between Ethiopia and Egypt, which have disagreed about Ethiopia's decision to construct a hydroelectric dam in the Nile.",
      "During his first term, Mr. Trump tried to\u00a0broker a deal between the countries and\u00a0suspended some aid to Ethiopia because of a lack of progress. In June, the president mentioned the dispute on Truth Social, writing, \"There is peace, at least for now, because of my intervention, and it will stay that way!\"",
      "No deals have been announced, however. Ethiopia still plans to officially open its dam in September over Egypt's objections that it will restrict the flow of water to its country. And while Egypt previously threatened to go to war over the dam, this conflict has remained a diplomatic one.",
      "O'Hanlon said of the dispute, \"I would not call the Egypt-Ethiopia interaction a war.\"",
      "Serbia and Kosovo",
      "In 2020, President Trump helped negotiate\u00a0a deal between Serbia and Kosovo to help normalize economic ties, but progress stalled afterward.",
      "Talks have continued with European leaders, but no breakthroughs have emerged. Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia in 2008, which Serbia still does not recognize.",
      "\"His deal-making, to the extent that it existed, actually occurred in his first term, and he really hasn't stopped what's going on,\" Haas said.",

      "Argentine police are investigating a deceased Nazi's daughter and son-in-law after a 17th-century painting stolen from a Dutch Jewish art collector was recently spotted in a property ad before promptly disappearing.",
      "The painting, believed to be \"Portrait of a Lady\" by Italian baroque artist Giuseppe Ghislandi (1655-1743), was recognized by the Dutch newspaper AD in a photo of a house for sale in the Argentine seaside resort of Mar del Plata.",
      "The authenticity of the artwork cannot be confirmed until it is recovered, but it is believed to have been stolen from Amsterdam art dealer Jacques Goudstikker during World War II. Goudstikker died while fleeing the Netherlands in 1940 when the country was invaded by Nazi Germany.",
      "The for-sale notice revealed what is believed to be the Ghislandi painting in the house of Friedrich Kadgien, a financial adviser to Adolf Hitler's right-hand man and an art aficionado who plundered paintings taken from Jewish-owned galleries in Nazi-occupied Europe, according to The Associated Press. Kadgien  later fled to Argentina, along with other Nazi war criminals. He died in 1978.",
      "Interpol and the Argentine federal police are involved in the search for the artwork.",

When Argentine police entered the house last week, they found a tapestry of a horse hanging in the spot the painting had been in the pictures, AP reported.

      "A French doctor goes on trial next week accused of intentionally poisoning 30 child and adult patients, 12 of whom died, in an alleged attempt to show off his resuscitation skills and discredit co-workers.",
      "Frederic Pechier, 53, worked as an anesthetist at two clinics in the eastern city of Besancon, when patients went into cardiac arrest in suspicious circumstances between 2008 to 2017. Twelve could not be resuscitated.",
      "Pechier's youngest alleged victim, 4-year-old Teddy, survived two cardiac arrests during a routine tonsil surgery in 2016. The doctor's oldest alleged victim was 89.",
      "The trial, which begins in Besancon on Sept. 8 and will last until December, caps a seven-year investigation that stunned the medical community.",
      "The proceedings come after a court in May sentenced retired doctor Joel Le Scouarnec to 20 years in prison after he confessed to sexually abusing or raping 298 patients, most of them children, between 1989 and 2014.",
      "Pechier, a father of three who has been banned from practicing medicine, faces life imprisonment if convicted. He has denied the charges.",
      "Controversially, Pechier is not currently behind bars and is under judicial supervision, an alternative to pre-trial detention.",
      "\"I've been waiting for this for 17 years,\" said Amandine Iehlen, whose 53-year-old father died of cardiac arrest during kidney surgery in 2008.",
      "An autopsy revealed an overdose of lidocaine, a local anaesthetic.",
      "Prosecutor Etienne Manteaux has said the case was \"unprecedented in French legal history.\"",
      "Manteaux previously said that Pechier had been \"the common denominator\" in each fatal incident, the BBC reported.",
      "\"He was most often found close to the operating theatre\" when the cases occurred, said Manteaux, and had made quick diagnosis on which action to take, \"even when nothing allowed anyone to suspect an overdose of potassium or local anesthesia.\"",
      "Doctor described as a \"star anesthetist\"",
      "An investigation was launched in 2017 after suspicious cardiac arrests during operations on patients otherwise considered low risk.",
      "Pechier is suspected of tampering with paracetamol bags or anaesthesia pouches of his colleagues in order to create operating room emergencies where he could intervene to show off his supposed resuscitating talents.",
      "\"What he is accused of is poisoning healthy patients in order to harm colleagues with whom he was in conflict,\" Manteaux said.",
      "\"Frederic Pechier was the first responder when cardiac arrest occurred,\" he added. \"He always had a solution.\"",
      "Pechier has argued that the majority of poisonings were the result of \"medical errors\" made by his colleagues.",
      "\"I am being accused of heinous crimes that I did not commit,\" he said in 2017.",
      "\"Whatever the outcome of all this, my career is over,\" Pechier told reporters at a press conference in 2019, BBC News reported. \"You cannot trust a doctor who, at one point, has been labelled a poisoner. ... My family is broken and I am afraid for my children.\"",
      "Some colleagues described the doctor as a \"star anesthetist,\" while others said he came across as arrogant and manipulative.",
      "One co-worker claimed Pechier was \"certain he was the best\" and liked to \"think of himself as Zorro.\"",
      "Over the course of the seven-year probe, investigators examined more than 70 reports of \"serious adverse events,\" medical jargon for unexpected complications or deaths among patients.",
      "The cases of 30 patients who suffered cardiac arrest during surgery at the Saint-Vincent Clinic and the Franche-Comte Polyclinic made it to trial.",
      "The investigation was launched in January 2017, after a 36-year-old woman suffered a suspicious cardiac arrest during an operation.",
      "Suspicion quickly fell on Pechier, who was detained and charged two months later.",
      "Pechier \"has every intention of proving his innocence in this case,\" his defense team told AFP.",
      "Last month,\u00a0Le Monde reported\u00a0that one of Pechier's lawyers withdrew from the case, citing insufficient compensation.",
      "\"Dizzying case\"",
      "A criminal psychology evaluation of the accused, carried out in 2019 and roundly criticized by his defense lawyers, pointed to a \"controlling personality\" and \"perverse traits.\"",
      "Other psychological and psychiatric assessments have not identified any particular pathology or personality disorder, describing Pechier as an intelligent man.",
      "He is also believed to suffer from depression.",
      "In 2014, he attempted suicide, and in 2021, he fell from the window at his parents' house in a drunken state.",
      "More than 150 civil parties, including a trade union for anaesthetists, will be represented at the trial.",
      "It is a \"dizzying case\" due to its \"scale, duration and technical complexity,\" said Frederic Berna, one of 55 lawyers representing the victims.",
      "Berna said he doubted the court would hear any \"sincere and honest explanations from Pechier.\"",
      "\"He is really someone who does not take no for an answer and constantly tries to impose his opinion by force,\" Berna said.",
      "Ahead of the trial Pechier said he was \"not particularly anxious.\"",

At least 3,124 people were injured and 5,412 houses were destroyed, Mujahid said.",

Roads are blocked, making it nearly impossible to move supplies or evacuate the wounded,\" Dr. Abudl Majeed Ahmadzai, Director of the Kabul Asia Hospital, who travelled to the affected region, told CBS News.",
      "In the hard-hit Kunar and Nangarhar provinces, the earthquake trapped people under rubble when homes, which are largely made of wood and mud in the region, collapsed onto them as they slept.",
      "Ahmadzai said the injured were being carried on foot for hours, sometimes on makeshift stretchers, just to reach basic help.",
      "\"The situation is desperate. Food is scarce, medical help is insufficient, and the only effective way to deliver assistance is by helicopter. Without air support, reaching these communities is nearly impossible,\" Ahamdzai told CBS News.",

      "The magnitude 6 earthquake, which struck at about 11:40 p.m. on Sunday, was the third major earthquake to strike Afghanistan since the Taliban seized control of the country in 2021. Their takeover prompted deep cuts in international aid funding as many donors, including the United States, were concerned that financial support could help fund the Taliban government.",
      "Since retaking power, the Taliban have brought back many restrictive policies, especially targeting women and girls, including excluding them from secondary education and most career choices.",
      "The policies have marginalized women and made it much more difficult for them to access basic services, including health care. With women now prevented from working in many health care roles, there's concern that some earthquake victims may be reluctant to seek medical assistance.",

      "5) Install strong antivirus software",
      "While Macs have built-in security features like Gatekeeper and XProtect, older systems may not receive the latest threat definitions. Installing third-party antivirus software can help fill in the gaps.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "159-YEAR-OLD COMPANY EMBRACES DRIVERLESS TRUCKS",
      "PlusAI reports that its driverless trucks could be ready to hit the road within the next two years. (PlusAI)",
      "Why PlusAI's 2025 results matter for autonomous trucks",
      "Even if you never step into a truck, these results affect your daily life. Every product you buy travels by truck at some point, whether it's groceries, clothing or furniture. The way those trucks operate influences cost, availability and safety on the road.",
      "The trucking industry faces three major challenges. There are not enough long-haul drivers to meet demand. Costs continue to rise due to labor shortages, tariffs and fuel prices. And safety is a concern because human drivers can get tired or distracted.",
      "Autonomous trucks could help address each of these issues. PlusAI's vehicles are already hauling freight on Texas highways today, and they are also undergoing road testing in Sweden. The company has already logged more than five million autonomous miles across the United States, Europe and Asia. That real-world experience fuels the AI system with the data it needs to improve.",
      "LUCID JOINS TESLA AND GM WITH HANDS-FREE HIGHWAY DRIVING",
      "The PlusAI Safety Case Framework. Data shows that self-driving trucks will roll out by 2027. (PlusAI)",
      "How PlusAI plans to launch autonomous trucks by 2027",
      "PlusAI has created a roadmap that sets it apart. Instead of retrofitting trucks with autonomous systems, it is working with major manufacturers like TRATON GROUP, Hyundai and IVECO to integrate the technology at the factory. This approach makes scaling production faster and ensures consistency.",
      "The initial launch is planned for the Texas Triangle, a major freight corridor connecting Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin. From there, PlusAI plans to expand into other U.S. routes and eventually Europe.",
      "The company has also committed to publishing regular performance updates as it transitions to a public company. By sharing measurable results, PlusAI builds trust with regulators, the public, and businesses that may one day rely on its trucks to move goods.",
      "\"We have a clear roadmap to the commercial launch of SuperDrive,\" said David Liu, CEO and co-founder of PlusAI. \"By publicly sharing these performance metrics, we are showing our commitment to safety and scalability while bringing partners, customers, and regulators along on this journey.\"",
      "What's next for PlusAI and driverless freight trucks?",
      "PlusAI still has milestones to meet. Safety readiness must rise from 86 percent to 100 percent. Remote Assistance Free Trips must surpass 90 percent. These are ambitious goals, but the progress so far suggests the company can achieve them.",
      "Fleet trials are scheduled to begin later this year, and PlusAI continues testing in both the United States and internationally. Each step adds to the case that driverless trucks will be ready for commercial launch in 2027.",

      "What this means for you",
      "As a shopper, autonomous trucks could mean faster and more affordable deliveries. As a driver, you may soon share highways with self-driving freight haulers. As a business owner, this technology could reduce logistics costs and ease the impact of driver shortages.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Forget roaring lawnmowers and fuel-guzzling tractors. Today's solar companies are turning to flocks of sheep to trim grass and control weeds under solar panels. These eco-friendly grazers easily navigate narrow panel rows, cutting maintenance costs and carbon emissions at the same time. In fact, using sheep instead of gas-powered mowing crews can reduce upkeep expenses by up to 20 percent.",

      "WHY AI IS CAUSING SUMMER ELECTRICITY BILLS TO SOAR",
      "Why solar grazing with sheep cuts costs and emissions",
      "Sheep fit neatly between solar arrays, reaching into nooks that mechanical gear can't. They chew rain or shine. And since sheep run on grass, not gas, their grazing helps reduce carbon emissions. Using these natural lawnmowers better aligns with solar's green mission goals. Developers like SB Energy in Texas now rely on herds of around 3,000 sheep to cover thousands of acres, benefiting both their bottom line and the planet.",
      "WHY YOU SHOULD THINK TWICE BEFORE JOINING A POWER SAVER PROGRAM",
      "Sheep graze near solar panels in Haskell, Texas, Dec. 2, 2024.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Annie Rice)",
      "How agrivoltaics turns sheep and solar panels into profits",
      "This isn't your average landscaping story. There's even a fancy word for it: agrivolatics, or the practice of combining solar energy production with agriculture.\u2028Farmers who jump on board aren't just maintaining the lawn; they're opening up multiple revenue streams. First, ranchers can lease land to solar companies, sign grazing contracts, while still earning from traditional farm products like wool and lamb.",
      "Chad Raines is a rancher from Texas. He decided to trade in cotton farming for sheep grazing on solar land. That move has paid off. Last year, he brought in around $300,000. If he had stuck with cotton, he estimates he would've lost about $200,000 instead. That's a huge swing, and it's a real-world example of how solar grazing is helping revive a sheep industry that had been stuck in neutral for decades.",
      "How sheep improve soil health and boost biodiversity at solar farms",
      "Letting sheep do the mowing isn't just about saving time or money. It actually helps the land. As they move through the fields, sheep naturally break down plant material, aerate the soil and leave behind fertilizing manure. This leads to healthier dirt and better carbon capture.",
      "Companies like Lightsource BP are already seeing those benefits. They manage over 14,000 sheep across solar farms that produce more than 3 gigawatts of power. These sites aren't just power generators, they're also habitats. Flowers that support bees and butterflies are planted among the panels, creating ideal conditions for pollinators. Some farms have even started producing honey thanks to the thriving bee population.",

      "Major solar farms scale up sheep grazing across thousands of acres",
      "This isn't just happening on a small scale. Enel North America recently signed one of the biggest solar grazing deals in the country. They're deploying over 6,000 sheep across eight large solar farms, covering more than 10,000 acres.",
      "At some of those sites, the amount of organic matter in the soil has more than doubled. For solar operators, this approach just makes sense. It cuts operations and maintenance costs, strengthens environmental credibility and builds better relationships with nearby communities.",
      "Investors are paying attention, too. In just two years, the number of solar grazing projects has skyrocketed, especially in places backed by heavy hitters like DE Shaw and Berkshire Hathaway.",
      "Chad Raines opens the gate to a solar panel zone in Haskell, Texas, Dec. 2, 2024. This solar farm has six different solar panel zones on 1,800 acres of land.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Annie Rice)",
      "What solar grazing means for you",
      "If you care about clean energy, sustainable farming or smart land use, solar grazing is worth watching. It shows how innovation doesn't always require high-tech gadgets; sometimes, it just takes some sheep. For farmers and ranchers, this model opens the door to new income by partnering with solar companies. If you own land or work in agriculture, grazing contracts could provide a steady stream of revenue without giving up traditional operations.",
      "For everyone else, this trend offers hope that renewable energy can coexist with rural livelihoods, boost biodiversity and fight climate change, all at once. As solar farms expand across the country, expect to see more flocks doing the work of machines, quietly transforming how we power the planet.",

      "This might sound obvious, but don't trust any unknown caller, especially if they demand money. Legitimate authorities will never ask for payment over the phone, especially not through gift cards, wire transfers, or cryptocurrency. If someone threatens you with arrest or legal action unless you pay immediately, it's almost certainly a scam. Hang up and call your local court or police department using an official number.",
      "If you receive a suspicious call, take a breath and fact-check. Court summonses are always delivered by mail, not over the phone. Even if the caller has personal information like your name or address, that doesn't make them credible. Scammers often use leaked or publicly available data to appear convincing.",
      "Be extra cautious, even if the scam comes through text messages or email. Do not click on any suspicious links, as they can install malware on your device and steal your personal data.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "The truth is, your data is already out there, from old social media profiles to past breaches. That's often how scammers get enough personal details to sound legitimate. Investing in a data removal service can help reduce your digital footprint by scrubbing your information from people-search sites and data brokers.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Older adults are frequent targets. Sit down with your parents, grandparents, or neighbors to explain how these scams work and what to watch for. A simple heads-up could stop a costly mistake.",
      "What this means for you",
      "Scammers are getting bolder and more convincing, but you can stay a step ahead. Knowing the signs of a jury duty phone scam, using smart tools like antivirus and call blockers and limiting your digital footprint can dramatically reduce your risk. Empower yourself and your loved ones with this knowledge.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Instead of relying on faceless phishing emails, scammers are now using hyper-personalized and emotionally charged phone calls. By impersonating local authorities and referencing civic duties like jury duty, they exploit both fear and a sense of responsibility. What makes this especially dangerous is how plausible it sounds, drawing on real processes that many people don't fully understand.",

On Test Flight 757's approach to Topeka, a Honeywell crew member parked a smaller Gulfstream aircraft at the end of the runway, triggering the SURF-A alert system.

As the FedEx plane got closer, the pilots noticed a Southwest Airlines B737 lined up on the runway below them.

If those attachments shift to chatbots, kids may learn to trust machines more than people.

That responsiveness can be powerful. It can encourage curiosity, vocabulary growth, and even creativity. But it can also crowd out human interactions, those subtle facial expressions, pauses, and \"nos\" that children need to experience to learn empathy and resilience. Another risk is that AI companions are trained to be overly charming and agreeable. Instead of challenging a child's thinking, these\u00a0\"sycophantic\" toys may simply tell kids what they want to hear. Over time, that could nudge children toward believing comforting lies instead of asking hard questions, a toxic pattern for developing critical thinking.",

      "Now, credit reporting firm TransUnion has confirmed its own major incident, with more than 4.4 million U.S. consumers affected.\u00a0Attackers exploited weaknesses in third-party integrations, not Salesforce itself.

      "Hackers stole 13 million records, exposing data of 4.4 million Americans in the latest TransUnion cyberattack. (Christopher Dilts/Bloomberg)",
      "What you need to know about the TransUnion data breach",
      "TransUnion has disclosed a major data breach that impacted 4,461,511 individuals in the United States, according to a filing with the Maine Attorney General's Office. The incident occurred on July 28, 2025, and was discovered two days later on July 30.",
      "The breach resulted from unauthorized access to a third-party application used in TransUnion's U.S. consumer support operations. The company stressed that its core credit database and credit reports were not compromised.",
      "Although TransUnion characterized the exposed information as \"limited,\" the stolen data is highly sensitive. It includes names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, billing addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, reasons for customer transactions (such as requests for a free credit report), and customer support tickets and messages.",
      "Hackers claim they stole more than 13 million records in total, with about 4.4 million tied to U.S. consumers.",
      "In response, TransUnion is providing all affected individuals with 24 months of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services.",

      "The breach at TransUnion follows several similar cyberattacks against tech companies, including Google and Cisco, and retail brands, such as Chanel and Adidas.\u00a0 (Mike Kemp/In Pictures)",
      "Hackers target companies through Salesforce apps",
      "The breach appears to be part of a broader wave of Salesforce-related attacks that is hitting organizations across sectors, from tech and finance to retail and aviation. Alongside Google, Farmers Insurance, Allianz Life, Workday, Pandora, Cisco, Chanel and Qantas, brands like Adidas, Louis Vuitton, Dior, Tiffany & Co., Cartier and Air France-KLM have also reported incidents tied to weaknesses in Salesforce-linked applications.",
      "In most cases, attackers exploited malicious third-party integrations or OAuth-connected apps disguised as legitimate Salesforce tools to siphon sensitive records. This technique bypassed traditional login protections and gave intruders long-lasting access to customer relationship management data. The stolen information ranges from basic contact details and business notes to highly sensitive identifiers such as Social Security numbers, dates of birth and driver's license information.",
      "Researchers say these intrusions align with activity from the extortion group ShinyHunters, with some overlap in tactics and infrastructure linked to other threat actors like Scattered Spider. Campaigns tracked under names such as UNC6395 and UNC6040 point to a larger \"extortion-as-a-service\" model, where criminal crews collaborate and share stolen data across underground forums.",
      "TransUnion's response",
      "CyberGuy reached out to TransUnion for a comment and received the following response:",
      "\"TransUnion recently experienced a cyber incident that affected a third-party application serving our U.S. consumer support operations. Upon discovery, we quickly contained the issue, which did not involve our core credit database or include credit reports.",
      "The incident involved unauthorized access to limited personal information for a very small percentage of U.S. consumers. We are working with law enforcement and have engaged third-party cybersecurity experts for an independent forensics review. Additionally, we will notify affected consumers and provide credit monitoring services.\"",
      "As for the gap between when the breach occurred (July 28, 2025) and when it was officially recorded as \"discovered\" (July 30, 2025), a TransUnion spokesperson clarified that the company\u00a0\"identified and contained this event within hours\" of it happening, but that it is common industry practice to designate a later \"date of discovery\" to reflect a more complete assessment following the initial response.",

      "Go through old online accounts, shopping profiles or cloud storage that may still hold sensitive data. Deleting what you no longer use reduces the amount of information that could be stolen in future breaches or sold on dark web forums. You can also get help from a data removal service.",

      "Data stolen in breaches often ends up fueling phishing campaigns. Attackers may use your name, email or phone number to make messages look more convincing. If you get an email or text claiming to be from TransUnion, your bank or any service asking you to \"verify\" details, don't click on the link. Instead, log in through the official website or call customer service directly.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If your login details were exposed, reusing the same password across sites puts multiple accounts at risk. Use a password manager to create and store strong, unique passwords for every service. Even if hackers get hold of one, they won't be able to use it elsewhere. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "Next, see if your passwords have been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "HACKERS FOUND A WAY TO TURN OFF WINDOWS DEFENDER REMOTELY",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA)\u00a0adds a critical extra step beyond just a password. If someone tries to break into your email, banking app or social media account, they'll also need the one-time code from your authenticator app or text message. This makes stolen credentials much less useful.",
      "Hackers often rely on outdated software to spread malware or steal information. Installing the latest updates for your phone, computer and apps ensures security patches are in place, blocking known vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit.",
      "One of the biggest risks after a breach is criminals opening new loans or credit cards in your name. A credit freeze with all three major bureaus, TransUnion, Equifax and Experian, prevents anyone from accessing your credit file without your approval. It's free and can be temporarily lifted if you need to apply for credit.",
      "Watch your bank and credit card statements for unfamiliar charges, no matter how small. Set up transaction alerts where available. You should also pull your free annual credit report to check for unauthorized accounts or inquiries, which could be signs of fraud.",
      "If your Social Security number, driver's license or other sensitive identifiers were exposed, you may want to sign up for an identity theft protection service. These services monitor credit reports, dark web forums and financial activity for signs of misuse. Some also include insurance or recovery assistance if your identity is stolen, giving you added peace of mind beyond basic credit monitoring. If you're one of the affected TransUnion users, make use of the 24 months of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services. If not, you might get one yourself for the future.",

      "Scammers spoof Apple, Netflix, and other brands to push fake subscription charges posing as DocuSign. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The emails often use well-known brands such as Apple, Netflix, Expedia, or even lawn service companies to make them seem credible. Some also include a \"DocuSign\" link with a security code, creating the illusion that you need to access a file to confirm the transaction.",
      "In reality, neither Apple nor these other companies sends billing receipts through DocuSign. That detail alone is a red flag. Another telltale sign is the sender's address. It may contain odd characters, such as a Cyrillic \"B\" replacing the \"B\" in \"Billing,\" which helps scammers bypass spam filters.",
      "AMAZON ALERTS CUSTOMERS ABOUT IMPERSONATION SCAMS",
      "How the DocuSign scam works",
      "The scam aims to catch you off guard and pressure you into acting fast. The email claims your Apple Pay account has been charged for a subscription or purchase. It includes an order ID, a charge amount, and a DocuSign link that supposedly holds a receipt or confirmation file. To make it look even more convincing, some versions add a security code to \"unlock\" the document.",
      "The message also lists a phone number and urges you to call if the charge was not authorized. That number is the core of the scam. Instead of reaching Apple, Netflix or whichever company the email pretends to represent, you end up speaking with a scammer posing as a support agent.",
      "Once you're on the call, the scammer tries to convince you that your account has been compromised or that the payment must be reversed right away. From there, the tactics vary. They might ask for your Apple ID, banking details, or card numbers. They may pressure you to download remote access software so they can \"fix\" the issue on your device. In some cases, they demand payment for fake account protection or reversal fees.",

      "Instead of trusting the email, confirm whether a charge actually exists. Apple users can review purchases directly from the Settings app under their Apple ID. If nothing shows up, the receipt is fake. Other services have similar ways to check history.",
      "The less information scammers can find about you online, the harder it is for them to craft convincing attacks. Consider removing old accounts you no longer use, limit the personal details you share publicly on social media, and use data removal services when possible. This reduces the risk of your name, email, or phone number being targeted in scams like this.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

It means AI is already capable of handling parts of your daily tasks \u2014 and that can be an opportunity if you learn to use it. Those who embrace AI tools now can work faster, free up time for creative thinking, and make themselves even more valuable.",

While physical and hands-on jobs have less overlap with AI today, future technologies beyond language models, like robotics or AI-driven machinery, could change that picture. Staying adaptable, learning basic AI skills, and keeping up with tech trends will help you stay ahead no matter your industry.",

Many officers and support staff got sick. There was a high rate of people being out sick. There was a decrease in people in the squads, in detective squads to investigate crimes. So that really affected everything.\"",
      "In March of that year, she said, the situation spiraled even further out of control after George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police, driving an anti-police sentiment that halted recruiting and caused officers to retire early, among other consequences.",

      "\"There was a lot of protests going on,\" Leto said. \"To deal with the protests, they took a lot of the investigators, the detectives out of the squads, out of, like investigating terrorism, investigating homicides and rapes and murders to deal with the unrest in the streets throughout the United States.\"",
      "DC VIOLENCE HAS GROWN FAR MORE DEADLY, DESPITE DEMS CLAIMING 30-YEAR LOW",
      "According to Leto, that led to a dramatic decline in arrests.",
      "\"There was an issue of recruiting in most of the police departments,\" she said. \"Because of the George Floyd \u2026 backlash, people didn't want to join the police department. So people didn't want to join the police department, and then you had less people coming in and less people going into a detective unit.\"",
      "Consequently, existing detectives began working more overtime. In what Leto described as an \"overtime bubble,\" some detectives worked so much that they were forced to retire, further depleting detective units.",
      "A George Floyd mural in Minneapolis, Minnesota. (AP)",
      "\"So you had a recruitment issue, you had retention issue. So now, like, if you're looking at New York City, which I know about, you have a lot of detective squads that are really low in manpower,\" she said. \"So they doubled their caseload.\"",

      "\"They made it easier for people to get out of jail without posting bail, because a lot of people didn't afford bail,\" Leto said. \"And they deemed certain crimes as nonviolent. So, for example, [third-degree robbery], which is forcibly taking property from a person, which is violent, that's deemed as a nonviolent crime.\"",
      "When violent offenders are let out on bail, they go right back to committing crimes, possibly even escalating their levels of violence.",
      "\"So, that all added to the fact that less cases are being handled, and less cases are being cleared,\" Leto said.",

      "FIRST ON FOX: A new study disputes claims that\u00a0Israel committed genocide in Gaza following Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 massacre, arguing that allegations of starvation, indiscriminate bombing and deliberate civilian killings lack verifiable evidence.",
      "The report by researchers from the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan University, \"Debunking the Genocide Allegations: A Reexamination of the Israel-Hamas War\" (2023-2025), contends that the genocide narrative has been driven by faulty data, uncritical sourcing and a humanitarian system vulnerable to manipulation.",
      "A key element of the genocide accusations is the claim that Israel deliberately starved Gaza\u2019s population. The study argues that \"claims of starvation prior to March 2, 2025, were based on erroneous data, circular citations, and a failure to critically review sources.\" While U.N. officials and rights groups maintained that 500 trucks a day were needed to prevent famine, prewar U.N. figures show Gaza averaged 292 daily in 2022 \u2014 only 73 of them carrying food.",

      "The genocide allegation also rests on claims that Israel intentionally targeted civilians, but the study acknowledges civilian deaths while finding no evidence of a systematic policy of massacre.",
      "Orbach cited BBC data showing that between May 2024 and January 2025, 550 people were killed in designated safe zones\u2014just 2.1% to 3.5% of total casualties, even though half of Gaza\u2019s population was concentrated there for much of the period.",

      "According to the IPC, 132,000 children under age 5 are projected to suffer acute malnutrition through 2026, including more than 41,000 severe cases. It said over 55,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women also\u00a0require urgent nutrition support.",

      "The report blamed almost two years of war, the displacement of 1.9 million people, the collapse of local food production and severe restrictions on aid. It noted that even when food enters Gaza, much of it fails to reach civilians.",
      "Israel flatly rejected the findings, with the Foreign Ministry Director General Eden Bar Tal telling reporters the IPC had committed \"gross forgeries\" and manipulated its own evidence to declare famine.",
      "Bar Tal said the IPC fabricated 182 deaths to reach the famine threshold of 188. He accused the group of breaking its own rules by using a malnutrition measure barred in Gaza, relying on clinic-based samples that are prohibited and cherry-picking surveys. He claimed that of 15,749 children surveyed, the IPC used only 7,519, enough to push results above famine levels.",
      "\"The IPC report is forged for political purposes. No doubt the IPC manipulated and ignored data, broke its own rules and hid contradictory evidence,\" Bar Tal said, saying the report was fabricated for the purpose of \"supporting Hamas\u2019s starvation campaign.\"",

      "As the couple tore through the first two seasons, sometimes in between chores or work, Noah admits that he got \u201cinto it too\u201d \u2014 sometimes peeking his head in to pay attention and catch up on what was happening while he was doing something else. When the new season premiered in July, he was excited to see how the story would play out and if Belly would end up with his preferred character, medical student Conrad.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re 100% Team Conrad. We hope if we ever have a son, he\u2019s like Conrad,\u201d Gabriella said.",
      "Over the last few weeks, Noah and Gabriella have settled into a new Wednesday routine to keep up with the episode releases. Gabriella, who has been home with their newborn daughter, watches it first thing in the morning as Noah begins work. Sometimes, Noah can come out and peek around the corner to see what is going on, but the pair always watch it later in the evening.",
      "\u201cBy like 9:15, we have a bagel in hand, bacon in hand, coffee, and we\u2019re starting it,\u201d Gabriella said, adding that during the second watch in the evenings with Noah, she knows when to record his reactions to big moments. Those reactions have garnered thousands of views on TikTok.",
      "Like the Morellos, the Brockways have taken to TikTok to document their joint interest in the show \u2014 and have strong feelings about the show, as it heads into uncharted territory and diverges from the trilogy. Episode eight ended with Belly spontaneously buying a ticket to Paris following her and Jeremiah\u2019s dramatic ending on their wedding day, after her feelings for Conrad \u2014 and his feelings back \u2014 are revealed.",
      "A trailer released last week for the show\u2019s final three episodes showed Belly in Paris and dancing with new characters while Ellie Goulding\u2019s \u201cAnything Could Happen\u201d plays in the background. In the final scene, Belly sees that Conrad has sent her a letter, and Briney can be heard saying, \u201cDear Belly.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf she ended up with Jeremiah, we would be ticked off,\u201d Laney Morello, 30, said about her and Justin\u2019s feelings around the show\u2019s ending. \u201cJustin still wants her to go to Paris and meet someone there.\u201d",
      "But while both couples are firm in their \u201cTeam Conrad\u201d beliefs, have strong feelings about the other characters, and enjoy the family aspect of the show, it\u2019s the fact that the show is an activity they can share that makes it worth the hype.",
      "\u201cWe might have to start nap time early,\u201d Justin joked when asked how they plan to watch Wednesday\u2019s new episode. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll wake up early. We\u2019ll definitely try to get it done by, like, midday.\u201d",
      "Laney added: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to get any spoilers!\u201d"

      "\"We know that alcohol can cause depression, and we know we make bad, impulsive decisions. Now I think, Do I really need that? I feel differently now about assuming you can bring a six-pack of beer to someone's house\u2014I think you should ask. I also think this cultural norm that we need alcohol to relax and have a good conversation is just weird,\" she writes."

      "While Malle looks to continue to make her mark in fashion, her parents did just that in entertainment, showcasing their talents on the big and small screens. Read on to learn more about them.",

The Rensselaer County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a statement the singer \"displayed signs of intoxication and erratic behavior, which ultimately required him to be removed from the stage.\"",
      "\u201cDeputies and event staff attempted to assist Mr. Martin offstage, but due to his impaired state, he became resistant and had to be forcibly escorted out,\" read the statement, which was shared to Facebook Aug. 30.",

      "Martin said he recognizes that being a musician won\u2019t get any easier. He also added that he misses his children and family when he is on the road.",
      "Speaking about his behavior during his latest concert, he shared, \u201cLately I\u2019ve learned I let my fragile mind override my heart at times and tonight it got the best of me\u2026 I apologize for the bad days\u2026 but I\u2019m grateful for the countless good nights we\u2019ve shared this year.\u201d",

      "The fact that the storage facility belonged to a Ukrainian logistics company that was shipping humanitarian aid and Starlink satellite internet dishes to Ukraine did not initially raise any alarms.",

      "The investigation and the prosecution that followed would shed light on what Western officials have warned is a dangerous Russian tactic: hiring local criminals to carry out acts of sabotage across Europe.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a relatively new thing to see criminal proxies used on behalf of foreign states,\u201d Cmdr. Dominic Murphy, the head of the counter-terrorism unit at London\u2019s Metropolitan Police, told British broadcaster Sky News, NBC News\u2019 international partner, in July. \u201cWe have seen this trend developing over the last year or two, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll continue to see it develop over the next year or so.\u201d",
      "Over the last year, NATO governments have accused Russian intelligence agencies of remotely recruiting criminals and using them to sow chaos.",
      "The exact number of attacks is difficult to quantify. The allegations range from Britain to Estonia to the Czech Republic to Poland \u2014 where, authorities say, Russia paid a group to burn down the country\u2019s biggest shopping mall in May 2024.",
      "Moscow denies all allegations of sabotage, including in the case in London. \u201cRussia has never engaged in sabotage activities against the United Kingdom and has no intention of doing so,\u201d the Russian Embassy in the United Kingdom said in a statement.",
      "Calvin Bailey, a British member of Parliament who sits on the Defense Select Committee, said the London attack fit a pattern in which Russian operatives used encrypted apps and cryptocurrency to hire criminals as they tried to mask their own involvement.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re incentivized by money but the use of Telegram and bitcoin creates plausible deniability and allows the Russians to keep their distance,\u201d Bailey said in a recent interview. \u201cIt hides the trail, be that a money trail or any of the connections.\u201d",
      "According to British prosecutors the trail that led to the warehouse burning in east London began in March 2024, when a 21-year-old British drug dealer named Dylan Earl initiated communications with an anonymous account on Telegram with the usernames \u201cPrivet Bot\u201d and \u201cLucky Strike.\u201d",
      "The account was run by an operative with the Wagner Group, the Russian mercenary group that fought in Syria and Ukraine before it launched a short-lived mutiny against Russian President Vladimir Putin in June 2023 but has now been brought to heel by the Kremlin.",
      "Earl expressed interest in joining Wagner as a gun-for-hire, saying, \u201cI need a fresh start\u201d after his life of small-time crime in the U.K, according to documents released by prosecutors.",
      "But the Russian handler said Wagner had a different use for him: carrying out operations in Europe.",
      "Over the course of hundreds of messages, the Russian handler offered the young British criminal both money and ideological encouragement to burn down the warehouse, which could net him roughly $8,000.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll make you rich. And grant you things no one else can. Citizenships. Passports. Everything,\u201d the Russian handler said in a message posted on the Privet Bot account.  In another, the handler said, \u201cYou are our dagger in Europe.\u201d",
      "Earl was also encouraged to embrace a clandestine lifestyle by watching the FX show \u201cThe Americans\u201d about KGB spies operating undercover in the United States.",
      "\u201cLook how they describe Russia. But you see U.K. and USA,\u201d the handler wrote.  \u201cHomeless everywhere. Drugs etc. It is fearmongering bro. They want people scared.\u201d",
      "Earl knew he was dealing with a Wagner operative but did not back down.",
      "Within weeks of their initial messages, Earl had recruited a group of young accomplices to carry out the warehouse attack. According to prosecutors, only one of them \u2014 Jake Reeves, 23 \u2014 understood that they were starting the fire on Russian orders.",
      "Neither Earl nor Reeves was present when the fire was started by Nii Kojo Mensah, 23, Jakeem Rose, 21, and Ugnius Asmena, 23, all of whom were convicted of aggravated arson. Instead, they watched a livestream of the blaze on FaceTime provided by Asmena.",
      "The men who actually started the fire believed it was merely a criminal act \u2014 Earl never told them they were acting on Russian orders.",
      "British detectives stepped up the hunt after they realized they were most likely dealing with a Russian state-sponsored operation targeting the Ukrainian business. They arrested Earl in early April and after they accessed his phone, quickly established his connection to the Wagner group.",
      "Earl and Reeves both pleaded guilty to aggravated arson and offenses under British national security laws.",
      "There is no suggestion that they were linked to other attacks across Europe or the groups carrying them out.",
      "\u201cThis case is a clear example of an organization linked to the Russian state using 'proxies' \u2014 in this case British men \u2014 to carry out very serious criminal activity in this country on their behalf,\u201d Murphy, the Met counterterrorism head, said in a statement after the verdict.",
      "The suspected Russian-backed criminal attacks across Europe are usually unsophisticated intelligence operations. Many of the plots, like the one in London, involve arson.",
      "In June, a Colombian man was imprisoned for eight years in the Czech Republic after he was convicted of setting fire to buses in Prague. Like Earl, he was also given orders by a Russian handler over the Telegram messaging app and told to record himself setting the fire, according to Czech authorities.",
      "That type of attack is relatively low-risk for Russia, compared with sending its own professional agents into an increasingly hostile Europe.",
      "But there is some evidence that the Russian operative handling Earl had higher ambitions for his group of British gangsters-for-hire.",
      "British police said that at the time of their arrest they had already begun surveillance operations for their next plot: kidnapping a Russian dissident named Yevgeny Chichvarkin and setting fire to his Michelin-starred Hide restaurant in one of London\u2019s most expensive neighborhoods."

      "\u201cThe Bitcoin community embraced my father, unlike anything I had ever seen before,\u201d Trump said at the Bitcoin Asia conference here.",
      "\u201cAnd I hope that\u2019s paid off in spades, because we love this community,\u201d he said, sitting in front of a screen with a live ticker showing the cryptocurrency\u2019s price at nearly $110,000, up from about $70,000 on the day his father, Donald Trump, was voted back into office in November.",
      "Eric Trump has attracted an almost cult-like following in the crypto industry, which was apparent in Hong Kong as hundreds of attendees \u2014 some dressed up in outfits ranging from sparkly robes to white suits covered in Bitcoin symbols \u2014 cheered as Trump took the stage, bashed his father\u2019s predecessor, Joe Biden, and said, \u201cThis is the time to buy.\u201d",
      "The cryptocurrency industry has become big business for the Trump family, whose patriarch has become one of its biggest champions since it helped return him to office.",
      "Feeling unfairly targeted by the Biden administration, the industry was a political force in the 2024 election season, directing an estimated $135 million in donations toward Trump and other crypto-friendly candidates.",
      "Since then, the Trump family has only become further enmeshed in the industry \u2014 no one more so than Eric Trump, who said Friday that \u201c90% of my time in life is in this community.\u201d",

Launched in March with his older brother, Donald Trump Jr., and the Nasdaq-listed Hut 8, a crypto energy infrastructure company, American Bitcoin aims to be the \u201cworld\u2019s largest, most efficient pure-play Bitcoin miner while building a robust strategic Bitcoin reserve,\u201d according to a news release.",
      "Eric Trump said Friday that the company will be going public \u201cvery soon\u201d as it merges with a pre-existing Nasdaq-listed company called Gryphon Digital Mining.",
      "\u201cWe are one of the biggest Bitcoin mining companies on Earth,\u201d he said. \u201cWe mine about 3% of the world\u2019s Bitcoin every single day.\u201d",
      "He insists that the family\u2019s business is separate from national politics and has dismissed concerns about conflicts of interest.",
      "\u201cMy father\u2019s totally shielded off from our company. There\u2019s total separation of church and state,\u201d he told CNBC in December. \u201cWe have great ethics advisers. We take it incredibly seriously.\u201d",
      "But Donald Trump was a major topic of discussion at his son\u2019s Q&A in Hong Kong, which began with a round of applause for the president, who has vowed to make the United States the \u201ccrypto capital of the world.\u201d",
      "Since returning to office in January, Trump has pushed to ease regulation of the industry, shut down the Justice Department\u2019s national cryptocurrency enforcement team, appointed a \u201ccrypto czar\u201d and held a White House summit for industry leaders. He also said the U.S. would create a national strategic crypto reserve.",
      "This month he signed an executive order allowing cryptocurrency and real estate investments to be included in 401(k) retirement accounts, which critics say could put Americans\u2019 retirement savings at risk.",
      "Trump has also sought legislative backing for a form of cryptocurrency known as stablecoins, some of which is already in place. One of the three bills that received support on Capitol Hill last month was the GENIUS Act, which allows stablecoins to be issued by private companies.",
      "The passage of the bills was slammed by Americans for Financial Reform, a left-leaning watchdog group, which said in a statement last month that Trump and his allies would \u201cpersonally benefit from limitless legalized corruption while the rest of us stand in harm\u2019s way of the next crypto implosion.\u201d",
      "Trump, who said in 2021 that Bitcoin \u201cseems like a scam,\u201d has since embraced it as a moneymaking opportunity, sometimes at great cost to investors. According to the watchdog group State Democracy Defenders Fund, as of mid-March his crypto assets were valued at $2.9 billion, or about 37% of his total wealth.",
      "Much of that money, which Trump earned in about six months, came from ventures such as the $TRUMP coin that he launched ahead of his inauguration, which was trading at nearly $8 on Friday, down from its peak of $73 in January. A meme coin was also launched for first lady Melania Trump.",
      "Industry professionals call these meme coins, meaning they have little practical use and are mostly symbolic, making their value subject to extreme volatility. About 764,000 wallets of mostly small holders lost money on $TRUMP while 58 wallets made more than $10 million each, CNBC reported in May, citing data from the blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.",
      "In May, Trump briefly appeared at a dinner outside Washington for the 220 largest buyers of $TRUMP, who spent an average of $1 million on the token.",

      "World Liberty\u2019s flagship project is its $WLFI stablecoin, which holders voted last month to make more widely tradable. The family also stands to gain from an agreement by a technology company backed by the government of the United Arab Emirates to invest $2 billion in one of World Liberty\u2019s stablecoin products.",

      "A plane carrying the continent\u2019s top official lost its GPS navigation while midair over the continent\u2019s wary east over the weekend and was forced to land using paper maps. This was the most high-profile case yet, officials and experts said Tuesday, of a Russian strategy that is not only disrupting travel but imperiling lives.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s flight landed safely in Bulgaria, just a short distance from Russian territory. But it has given a jolt to European fears over Moscow\u2019s suspected interference with Western signals.",
      "Once a background nuisance, the issue has surged into a mounting security concern \u2014 escalating in step with Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine \u2014 and has the continent scrambling to adapt.",
      "NATO 'working day and night'",

      "He framed the signal interference as part of a much broader campaign spanning the cutting of undersea cables in the Baltic Sea and a cyberattack on Britain\u2019s National Health Service.",
      "The threat from Russia was \u201cincreasing every day,\u201d he said.",
      "The disruption of von der Leyen\u2019s plane has thrust the issue into the spotlight at a time when Europe is already on edge over the war in Ukraine and its spillover effects.",
      "While pilots and ship captains expected occasional outages near Russia\u2019s borders or conflict zones, incidents have surged in recent years.",
      "The Bulgarian Air Traffic Services Authority said there had been a \u201cnoticeable increase\u201d in GPS incidents, including jamming, since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "In June, 13 European Union member states raised the alarm over jamming and spoofing threats disrupting air and sea travel.",
      "According to an E.U. document, Poland logged 2,732 cases of interference in January 2025, up from 1,908 in late 2023. Lithuania recorded 1,185 cases in the same month, more than double the figure from March 2024.",

      "Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Sweden and Germany have formally declared such interference a form of Russian hybrid warfare.",
      "A 'happy propaganda coup'?",
      "Open-source research tracing the origins of interference repeatedly points to two hot spots: Russia\u2019s Kaliningrad exclave, wedged between Poland and Lithuania, and the St. Petersburg area in western Russia. Both regions host a heavy concentration of Russian military units specializing in electronic warfare.",
      "In March 2024, a Royal Air Force plane carrying the U.K.\u2019s then\u2013defense secretary, Grant Shapps, also reported a spoofing incident, where false location data was fed to the aircraft\u2019s navigation systems.",
      "The plane, which had been flying near Kaliningrad, was able to continue its journey safely, but such tactics have in the past caused planes to veer off course.",
      "The incident with von der Leyen\u2019s plane occurred while she was on a four-day tour of E.U. member states that border Russia, Belarus or the Black Sea.",
      "While \u201cincredibly irresponsible,\u201d jamming von der Leyen\u2019s plane wasn\u2019t necessarily a \u201cmalicious action\u201d directed against her specifically, said Thomas Withington, an electronic warfare and air defense expert at the Royal United Services Institute, a think tank in London.",
      "\u201cI think on this occasion, Ms. von der Leyen\u2019s aircraft was just unlucky,\u201d he told NBC News, adding that Russia generally transmits jamming signals with the intention of disrupting satellite-guided weapons or drones.",
      "\u201cI think the fact that her aircraft was jammed is probably a sort of happy propaganda coup for Mr. Putin and his government,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cNATO is using a lot of GPS tooling and equipment to fly, to guide the bombs,\u201d he said, adding that such interference can also affect mobile devices and services such as Google Maps.",
      "\u201cIn Poland or the Baltics or in Sweden, relying on GPS in your car, in your navigation system, it\u2019s not always the smartest thing to do,\u201d he said.",

      "The legacy of World War II is still a sensitive subject between Japan and China, which is estimated to have suffered between 20 million and 35 million military and civilian deaths during a 14-year Japanese invasion and occupation that China calls the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression.",
      "The parade is aimed just as much at the Chinese public as it is at foreign adversaries, said Thompson, the former director for China, Taiwan and Mongolia at the U.S. Department of Defense.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fanning anti-Japanese sentiments to increase the party\u2019s legitimacy in the eyes of its own people,\u201d he said, particularly at a time when the Chinese public is concerned about a slowing economy.",
      "Japan, a key U.S. ally, has reportedly urged other countries not to attend, leading China to lodge a diplomatic complaint.",
      "According to the Chinese government, much of the equipment included in the 70-minute parade is being revealed for the first time.",
      "In addition to the troops, the parade will involve more than 100 aircraft and hundreds of ground armaments, all of them domestically made and battle-ready, officials said at an Aug. 20 news conference in Beijing.",
      "The \u201cnew-generation\u201d equipment on display \u201creflects a high degree of informatization and intelligence, underscoring our military\u2019s ability to adapt to technological advances and evolving warfare patterns, and to win future conflicts,\u201d said Maj. Gen. Wu Zeke, deputy director of the parade.",
      "Air and missile defense systems that could make an appearance include the HQ-19 and the more advanced HQ-26 and HQ-29, all of which are designed to intercept ballistic missiles and are believed to have capabilities similar to equivalent U.S. systems.",
      "Military observers are also watching for any new intercontinental ballistic missiles as well as new supersonic and hypersonic missiles.",
      "Such missiles \u201cpose a big threat for U.S. naval ships\u201d that would be central to any U.S. military intervention in the Asia-Pacific, said Shinji Yamaguchi, a senior research fellow in the China Studies Division at the Japanese government\u2019s National Institute for Defense Studies.",
      "China is also expected to display autonomous drones, which especially since the war in Ukraine have \u201creally changed the way of warfare,\u201d Yamaguchi said, as well as unmanned underwater vehicles, also known as sea drones.",
      "In a conflict, China could deploy sea drones in the Taiwan Strait and elsewhere \u201cto strengthen intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities,\u201d Yamaguchi said.",
      "Jet fighters will also be in focus after Pakistan said it used Chinese-built J-10Cs to shoot down Indian aircraft during a four-day conflict in May.",
      "But while China has become more open about displaying weaponry as its confidence grows, it is difficult to know what is going on behind the scenes.",
      "The \u201cdramatic\u201d removal of officials \u201chas raised questions about Xi Jinping\u2019s trust in military leaders, or about whether systemic problems of corruption can be resolved,\u201d Kania said.",
      "There has also been little recent real-world demonstration of the actual capabilities of the Chinese military, whose last experience in a large-scale conflict was against Vietnam in 1979.",
      "\u201cNone of this has been tested. Nobody knows,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cAnd this may be one of the reasons that China relies on this very conventional form of deterrence and signaling in the form of a parade.\u201d",
      "Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong, and Janis Mackey Frayer from Beijing."

      "TIANJIN, China \u2014 A private car ride with Vladimir Putin may not be as special as President Donald Trump thought.",
      "With a backseat bromance of their own, as well as hand-holding and hugs, the Russian leader, his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, and their host, Chinese leader Xi Jinping, put on a display Monday that seemed designed to turn heads in Washington.",
      "The three leaders staked out long-held positions in comments at this key regional summit in the Chinese port city of Tianjin, but the tenor and the timing of the trio's embrace was impossible to ignore.",
      "India, long courted by the West as a crucial Asian partner and counterweight to China, has been rattled by Trump\u2019s tariffs; the Kremlin has publicly brushed aside Washington's peace push in Ukraine; and Beijing continues to spar with the U.S. over trade, Taiwan and global influence.",
      "Amid this thicket of tensions, the cozy optics at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) gathering appeared a clear signal in the face of U.S. pressure.",
      "Weeks after Trump and Putin made headlines with a protocol-busting ride in \u201cThe Beast\u201d at their Alaska summit, Modi joined the Russian leader for a drive in the back of Putin's own armored limo \u2014 a not-so-subtle statement of defiance just days after the U.S. doubled tariffs on India to 50% as punishment for buying Russian oil.",
      "Russian state media reporter Pavel Zarubin said the pair spent nearly an hour in the car before proceeding to bilateral talks.",
      "\u201cI always feel that meeting you has been a memorable experience,\u201d Modi said to Putin later during the talks.",
      "The Russian leader called Modi his \"dear friend,\" espousing Russia and India's \"friendly and trusting\" relations.",
      "In a speech to delegates, Putin did say that \u201cunderstandings\u201d reached at his summit with Trump could form the basis for peace in Ukraine, but he gave little indication of a shift in his position and issued his customary rebuke blaming the West\u2019s \u201cconstant attempts to drag Ukraine into NATO\u201d for causing the war.",
      "'A totally one sided disaster!'",
      "Perhaps watching from Washington, Trump said Monday that the relationship between India and the U.S. had been \u201ca totally one sided disaster!\u201d and chided New Delhi for buying \u201cmost of its oil and military products from Russia,\u201d and \u201cvery little from the U.S.\u201d",
      "He said that India had now offered to cut their tariffs on U.S. goods to zero. \"But it's getting late,\" Trump added.",
      "Whether the theatrics in Tianjin were spontaneous or carefully planned, \u201cthe message remains the same,\u201d Keir Giles, a senior fellow at London-based think tank Chatham House, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThe close relationship that Trump sought with Putin is now on display between Putin and others,\u201d he said, adding that the U.S. had \"given India a real cause to look for friendship and partnership elsewhere.\"",
      "That friction had also given India a reason to \u201cmend fences\u201d with China, said Alyssa Ayres, a senior fellow for India, Pakistan, and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "India has \"lots of problems,\" with China, she said, \"but it is right on their border, and it\u2019s their largest trading partner in goods.\"",
      "Xi, for his part, criticized the \u201cbullying behavior\u201d from unnamed countries, a veiled reference to the U.S.",
      "He outlined his longstanding ambition to challenge the U.S.-led global economic and security order. \u201cWe must continue to take a clear stand against hegemonism and power politics, and practice true multilateralism,\u201d he said, while laying out a new \u201cGlobal Governance Initiative\u201d that was short on concrete policies.",
      "Talking in Tianjin",
      "Much of this northeastern port city was on lockdown ahead of the summit, the biggest since the SCO\u2019s founding in 2001.",
      "China welcomed dozens of leaders from Eurasian member states and other partner and observer countries for talks on trade, energy cooperation and regional stability. Their motorcades brought car and pedestrian traffic to a halt, with the area around the sprawling event venue on lockdown and security stepped up at the city\u2019s train station.",
      "Security barriers and police-manned checkpoints were present throughout Tianjin, with authorities' usual caution exacerbated by a spectacular military parade set to take place Wednesday in nearby Beijing.",
      "Focus on the growing summit, part of China\u2019s long-running effort to challenge U.S. dominance, has only been amplified this year by global upheaval from Trump-era policies and other foreign policy shifts.",
      "India and China have long sparred over their Himalayan border, trade tensions and Beijing\u2019s support for India\u2019s rival, Pakistan.",
      "But shared grievances \u2014 including Trump\u2019s tariffs, which in China\u2019s case have reached as high as 145% \u2014 have helped carve out common ground.",
      "Against that backdrop, Modi\u2019s first visit to China in seven years and his apparent camaraderie with Xi and Putin appeared especially striking.",
      "While Modi joyously clasped Trump\u2019s hand during a massive rally in Texas in 2019, Indian media on Monday seized on his friendship with Putin as a message of defiance against the U.S.",
      "Indian television channel Republic World called it a \u201cbig diplomatic win\u201d for India, while a headline on news channel Aaj Tak ran \u201cTrump\u2019s dictator vs. Modi-Putin\u2019s friendship.\u201d",
      "In the wake of the Tianjin summit, the U.S. embassy in India highlighted that the partnership between the two nations \u201ccontinues to reach new heights,\u201d spanning \u201cinnovation and entrepreneurship, defense, and broader bilateral ties.\u201d",
      "But the message, from Modi as well as Xi and Putin, seemed clear: They may have differences, but they are ready to stand \u2014 or sit \u2014 together.",
      "Janis Mackey Frayer reported from Tianjin, and Freddie Clayton from London.",

      "PESHAWAR, Pakistan \u2014 At least 800 people have been killed and more than 1,300 others injured in Afghanistan after a 6.0-magnitude earthquake hit the country, Taliban officials said Monday.",
      "The earthquake struck 17 miles from the eastern city of Jalalabad, near the border with Pakistan, at around midnight local time (3:30 p.m. ET Sunday), according to the U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "Because the earthquake hit a remote mountainous area, \u201cit will take time to get the exact information about human losses and damage to the infrastructure,\u201d said Sharafat Zaman, a spokesperson for the Afghan Public Health Ministry.",
      "\u201cWe have launched a massive rescue operation and mobilized hundreds of people to help people in the affected areas,\u201d Zaman said.",
      "He called for international aid to tackle the devastation, which left rescue teams battling to reach remote areas and loved ones searching desperately through the rubble of homes.",
      "Construction quality is poor in rural Afghanistan, where buildings are often made of mud bricks and wood. Videos showed collapsed homes and rescuers combing for survivors. Injured people from these remote areas were seen being lifted on gurneys onto helicopters.",
      "Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said the death toll had risen to 800 people. Earlier, Interior Ministry spokesperson Mufti Abdul Matin Qani had said 622 people had been confirmed dead and more than 1,300 injured in the eastern provinces of Nangarhar, which includes Jalalabad and Kunar.",
      "The ministry said that 1,000 injured people had been evacuated and admitted to hospitals.",
      "A United Nations team was mobilized, Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said in a post on X. Several U.N. organizations, including the Children's Fund, the World Health Organization, Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the International Organization for Migration, said on X that they were providing emergency assistance.",
      "'I was half-buried'",
      "Victims watched as their homes collapsed before their eyes at night. One survivor, Sadiqullah, said, \"I was half-buried and unable to get out.\"",
      "Sadiqullah, who like other Afghans uses only one name, was awakened by what he described as a loud boom sound and rushed to grab his family, who were sleeping.",
      "He was able to rescue three of his children but before he could rescue the rest of his family, the roof fell on top of him.",
      "\"My wife and two sons are dead and my father is injured and in hospital with me,\" he told The Associated Press. \"We were trapped for three to four hours until people from other areas arrived and pulled me out.\u201d",
      "Since the initial quake, at least five aftershocks ranging from 4.5 to 5.2 magnitude have hit the area throughout Monday, according to the U.S. Geological Service.",
      "Aftershocks can continue for days and can sometimes be worse than the first quake.",
      "Afghanistan is especially vulnerable to earthquakes as it sits on top of several fault lines where the Indian and Eurasian plates meet. The mountainous terrain of eastern Afghanistan is also prone to landslides, making it harder for emergency services to carry out rescues.",
      "This quake was especially devastating as it hit at a shallow depth of 5 miles, making it far more destructive even at moderate magnitude.",
      "In 2022, around 1,000 people were killed and thousands more were injured when a 5.9-magnitude earthquake hit eastern Afghanistan.",
      "That, too, was a shallow quake.",
      "The following year, three 6.3-magnitude quakes hit the western Afghanistan province of Herat. The Taliban said around 4,000 people were killed, though the United Nations put the death tally at 1,500.",
      "Monday's quake comes at a challenging time for Afghanistan, one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, which is suffering from four consecutive years of drought and the influx of over 2.3 million Afghans who have returned from Iran and Pakistan this year.",
      "\u201cBelow-average first and second season crop production and reduced livestock income limit their ability to stock food for the winter,\u201d the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, which was established by the United States Agency for International Development, said in a report last week.",

      "Until last year, the U.S. provided nearly half of all humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. But under President Donald Trump, the U.S. has cancelled an estimated $1.7 billion of that support, according to a report filed to Congress in April by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction.",
      "The administration has also refused to restore its emergency food aid for Afghanistan, while restoring it for some other countries.",

      "On Sunday, Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in Tianjin, where China is hosting a summit of the 10-member Shanghai Cooperation Organization.",
      "Xi told Modi that the world\u2019s two most populous countries should be \u201cpartners rather than rivals\u201d and that the \u201cdragon\u201d and the \u201celephant\u201d should come together.",
      "Modi told Xi that they were \u201ccommitted to progressing our relations based on mutual respect, trust and sensitivities.\u201d",
      "Their meeting comes days after the Trump administration doubled tariffs on Indian imports to 50% as punishment for buying Russian oil. The stinging levy, one of the highest on any U.S. trading partner, has raised concerns that it could push India closer to China despite years of tensions.",
      "\u201cUntil about three, four months ago, relations between China and India were not bad, they were very bad. They were not talking to each other,\u201d said Kishore Mahbubani, a Singaporean diplomat and former president of the United Nations Security Council.",
      "\u201cI have to give credit where it\u2019s due: President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to impose a 50% tariff on India is one of the biggest shocks that India has ever got in recent times,\u201d Mahbubani said Wednesday at an event in Hong Kong organized by the University of Hong Kong\u2019s Center on Contemporary China and the World.",

New Delhi says such criticism is \u201cunjustified and unreasonable,\u201d and that the U.S. previously encouraged it to buy the oil to keep global prices from soaring as Western countries suspended their purchases.",
      "While India and China share a common grievance over Trump\u2019s tariffs, which in China\u2019s case have reached as high as 145%, analysts say their relationship still faces major challenges and that Modi\u2019s China visit is mainly a symbolic display of resilience.",
      "\u201cXi wants Modi and India to show that they are working with him and with China to the extent that they are not following the Trump or U.S. lead in containing China,\u201d said Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at the SOAS University of London.",
      "Last month, the Chinese ambassador to New Delhi delivered a rare public defense of India against the tariff increase, calling the U.S. a \u201cbully.\u201d",
      "It was a major step up from the deep freeze that began in 2020 with a border clash in India\u2019s Himalayan region of Ladakh that killed at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers and plunged relations to the point that the two countries suspended direct flights.",

      "But tensions soon arose, with Trump complaining that Apple was producing iPhones in India instead of the U.S. India also rejected Trump\u2019s claim that he brokered a ceasefire in its four-day conflict with neighboring Pakistan.",
      "New Delhi was further incensed weeks later when Trump hosted Pakistan\u2019s powerful army chief at the White House in an unprecedented meeting.",
      "\u201cThe Indians saw this as a slap in the face for them,\u201d Mahbubani said. \u201cSo there is now, even as we are speaking, a tremendous amount of re-evaluation going on in Delhi about where India\u2019s place in the world is.\u201d",
      "At the same time, China and India have been moving cautiously to restore their relationship, reaching a deal to resolve their 2020 border standoff and announcing the resumption of direct flights.",
      "But not everybody is convinced about China extending a friendly hand, and the two countries still have major differences.",
      "One of the biggest is China\u2019s ties with Pakistan, India\u2019s archrival and a fellow nuclear power. During their conflict in May, Pakistan said it had used Chinese-made J-10C fighter jets to shoot down Indian military aircraft.",
      "\u201cThere was a huge step up in the kind of assistance that the Chinese were providing Pakistan, not merely in terms of selling them equipment and platforms, but on intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance,\u201d Gautam Bambawale, a former Indian ambassador to Beijing, said in an interview. \u201cSo we will go by actions on those things.\u201d",

      "Though India and China are strong trading partners, that has not been enough to smooth over other diplomatic issues.",
      "Earlier this month, after a meeting in New Delhi between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his Indian counterpart, S. Jaishankar, Beijing released a readout suggesting Jaishankar had acknowledged that Taiwan, a self-governing island democracy, \u201cis a part of China.\u201d",
      "When asked if Jaishankar made that statement, an Indian government official who was familiar with the discussions between the diplomats but not authorized to speak to the media, told NBC News that there was no change in India\u2019s position on Taiwan.",
      "\u201cWe stressed that like the rest of the world, India has a relationship with Taiwan that focuses on economic, technology and cultural ties,\u201d the official said.",
      "The clarification, which was also reported by Indian news organizations, prompted Beijing to double down, saying it was a \u201csurprise\u201d and \u201cinconsistent with the facts.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt would seem that some people in India have tried to undermine China\u2019s sovereignty on the Taiwan question and impede the improvement of China-India relations,\u201d Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said.",
      "The two countries also have other border disputes, as well as a manufacturing rivalry that may only worsen as companies try to shift production from China.

      "The Aug. 24 strike came three days after the Houthis launched a ballistic missile toward Israel that its military described as the first cluster bomb the rebels had launched at it since 2023.",
      "The prime minister hailed from the southern province of Abyan, and was an ally to former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh. He allied himself with the Houthis when the rebels overran Sanaa, and much of the north and center of the country in 2014, initiating the country\u2019s long-running civil war. He was appointed as prime minister in August 2024.",
      "Al-Rahawi is the most senior Houthi official to be killed since the United States and Israel began their air and naval campaign in response to the rebels\u2019 missile and drone attacks on Israel and on ships in the Red Sea. The U.S. and Israeli strikes killed dozens of people. One U.S. strike in April hit a prison holding African migrants in the northern Sadaa province, killing at least 68 people and wounding 47 others."

      "It is a symbolic state that offers virtual citizenship and an economy based on cryptocurrencies, but it has not been recognized by any official country, and Croatian authorities have blocked physical access to it.",

      "\u201cI saw all the flags going up around the country and thought, \u2018How lovely is that?\u2019 But I went for a little drive round Stevenage and didn\u2019t see any,\u201d Turvey, a former demolition worker with auburn curls, a hipster mustache, a low-buttoned shirt and a single earring, told NBC News over coffee at a nearby Starbucks. \u201cI kept thinking: Who\u2019s going to do it\u201d around here? \u201cWell, you know what? I\u2019m going to do it.\u201d",

      "However, he soon experienced just how charged this debate has become when, just as his group was packing up, someone threw two Molotov cocktails at them, the second cutting Turvey\u2019s head and covering his face with blood. \u201cI thought I was going to die,\u201d he said, visibly shaken by an incident he says has put a pause on his flag-hoisting activities for the time being at least.",
      "Critics see darker forces undergirding the broader flag campaign.",

Indeed, Musk himself has used his X audience of 223 million to voice support for Robinson, as well as other far-right figures in Britain and across Europe.",
      "NBC News messaged the three administrators of the Operation Raise the Colours Facebook page, asking for comment and interviews with these founders, but did not receive a response.",

      "\u201cThe St. George\u2019s Cross has become a symbol of nationalism, which has become confused with patriotism \u2014 the two are very different,\u201d she told the BBC.",
      "All this comes as immigration is now the top issue for voters in England, having just overtaken the cost-of-living crisis throttling millions, polls show. The most popular political party is Reform U.K., led by Trump ally and friend Nigel Farage, who recently said he would carry out a mass deportation of 600,000 people if he wins the next election in 2029.",
      "National identity in Britain is doubly complicated because the United Kingdom includes the nations of England, Wales and Scotland, and the province of Northern Ireland. During the soccer World Cup and on some public holidays, England\u2019s banner is widely used by people of all political and demographic stripes, but outside of those events it has been co-opted by nationalists, the far right and even fascists.",
      "All the data shows that most people in Britain are becoming more tolerant and less racist, said Sunder Katwala, the director of British Future, a think tank focused on identity. But the small minority who do hold extreme and racist views have been given a megaphone and a meeting place by poorly regulated social media platforms, he said.",

      "Stevenage was dreamed up in 1946 as an example of \u201cnew town\u201d modernism, an integrated residential-commercial space in which to house families scattered by war. Today \u2014 despite a much needed \u00a31 billion ($1.35 billion) regeneration scheme on the way \u2014 its faded pebbledash and dated glass shopfronts feel like a cipher for modern Britain.",
      "As is the case across the West, many Britons are increasingly concerned and angry about rising prices, decrepit public services, a lack of housing \u2014 and the perception that immigration has been mismanaged.",
      "All this leaves \u201cthe U.K. sitting on a tinderbox of disconnection and division,\u201d according to a lengthy report last month by British Future. Compounded by the cost-of-living crisis and supercharged by social media, this is \u201cturning the chronic crisis of social disconnection into an acute threat of social division.\u201d",
      "Turvey hanging flags in his community then being struck by a Molotov cocktail saw those divisions flare into life. He was bandaged up, received stitches and gave a statement to the police, though he did not see his attackers and has not heard from officers since, he said.",
      "At first, he thought the blood running down his face was acid (acid attacks are on the rise in the U.K.), and he said the incident has only added to the chronic anxiety stemming from a homophobic attack in 2018.",
      "Though he decries any form of racism or negativity associated with the flag movement, he says that part of his motivation stemmed from the perception that the current Labour government \u201cis not siding with English people\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s probably why people are so upset at the moment.\u201d",
      "Indeed, polls show Labour at its lowest support since 2019, sinking to just 20% in a poll by YouGov this week. Farage\u2019s Reform party, meanwhile, has soared to 28%, according to the same top pollster, the highest of any party but not enough to govern without a coalition were a national vote held today. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has taken an increasingly hard rhetorical line on immigration.",
      "He is under pressure to deal with the \u201csmall boats\u201d crisis, in which more than 50,000 people have arrived in small, unsafe vessels across the English Channel from France since he won a landslide election last year. Meanwhile, the government won a Supreme Court battle Friday so that asylum-seekers could continue being housed at a hotel in Epping, northeast of London, a site that has sparked numerous protests and counterprotests.",
      "Rumbling underneath all of this is the so-called grooming gangs scandal: the sexual exploitation of young women and girls by men in British towns and cities. A review in June that found that although most alleged perpetrators were white, in some areas there were higher rates of men of Asian and Pakistani heritage than their equivalent share of the population. At the same time, the review warned that many of those claiming outrage were merely trying \u201cto spread division and hate across communities.\u201d",
      "And so, amid all this, up goes the English flag.",
      "\u201cThere are probably one or two locations where it\u2019s organic and it started from below,\u201d Katwala, the director of British Future, said. \u201cThen there\u2019s another group \u2014 again, it\u2019s quite a small group \u2014 which is very politically radicalized, knows what it\u2019s doing and why it\u2019s doing it.\u201d"
