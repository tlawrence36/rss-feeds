      "Tonia Haddix, 56, was also ordered Thursday to serve three years of supervised release after her 46-month prison sentence ends.",
      "Haddix, who ran a primate facility the St. Louis suburb of Festus, pleaded guilty in March to two counts of perjury and one of obstructing justice.",
      "It all started nearly a decade ago, when the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals sued, saying she was keeping several chimps in \u201cconfined in cramped, virtually barren enclosures\u201d at the now-defunct Missouri Primate Foundation facility.",
      "Among the chimps was Tonka, who appeared in the 1997 movies \u201cBuddy\u201d and \u201cGeorge of the Jungle.\u201d Actor Alan Cumming, the British-born actor who starred in the movie \u201cBuddy\u201d alongside Tonka, also begged for the primate to be moved.",

      "In Starz's \u201cOutlander,\u201d Caitriona Balfe's Claire Fraser is bold and brave. She can also think on her feet in high-pressure moments. Her husband Jamie Fraser, played by Sam Heughan, is protective and empathetic. In a new prequel series out Friday, called \u201cOutlander: Blood of My Blood,\u201d we see how they each got that way.",
      "\u201cBlood of My Blood\u201d tells the love story of Jamie's parents, Ellen and Brian, and Claire's parents, Julia and Henry. The characters are inspired by the stories of Diana Gabaldon but there are no novels for showrunner Matthew B. Roberts to follow. He also is the showrunner of the original series, which debuts its final season early next year.",
      "With no source material \u201cthere\u2019s a lot more room to play in,\" explained Roberts. In \u201cOutlander,\u201d \"there are all these tentpole moments that we have to write to because that\u2019s what our audience wants from the books.\u201d",
      "In the books, Gabaldon mentions Jamie's parents in \u201cbreadcrumbs\u201d said Roberts. \u201cWe stick to those, but the freedom is what can we do after that to get to essentially where 'Outlander' begins.\u201d",
      "The big obstacle facing Jamie\u2019s parents, Ellen and Brian, who meet in 18th century Scotland \u2014 is that they come from families that \u201cdon\u2019t get on,\u201d said Harriet Slater, who plays Ellen. \u201cThey don\u2019t mix. It\u2019s completely forbidden. My father\u2019s worst enemy was Brian\u2019s father so I\u2019m sure he\u2019d have had some strong words to say about the whole thing.\u201d",
      "Jamie Roy, who plays Brian, enjoys the duality of his character. There's the \u201ctough, stoic, Highland warrior\u201d who he says \u201crides around on horses and swings swords and stuff.\u201d Then there's this \u201clovely, gentle, poetic, romantic guy who wants nothing more than to take care of other people.\u201d",
      "A few months ago Roy went back and rewatched episodes from season one of \u201cOutlander,\u201d because he wanted to watch Heughan as his TV son.",

      "Claire's parents Julia and Henry are mentioned even less in the books. They died in a car accident when Claire was young. We see them meet in \u201cBlood of My Blood\u201d during World War I. Henry was a soldier and Julia worked in postal censorship.",
      "\u201cWhen we meet him, he\u2019s pretty much given up,\" said Jeremy Irvine, who plays Henry. \u201cI think he\u2019s accepted death really and doesn\u2019t have anything to live for and sends this one last lifeline out in the form of an open letter back to England.\u201d Julia finds his letter at work and feels compelled to respond. The two end up falling in love while writing back-and-forth.",

      "Palmieri dabbled in tropical music as a pianist during the 1950s with the Eddie Forrester Orchestra. He later joined Johnny Segu\u00ed\u2019s band and Tito Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s before forming his own band in 1961, La Perfecta, alongside trombonist Barry Rogers and singer Ismael Quintana.",

      "NEW YORK (RNS) \u2014 On Sunday mornings in Brooklyn, nicknamed the borough of churches, the muffled sounds of choir singers, hand\u2011claps and Hammond organs can be heard from the sidewalks. The borough still has a church on nearly every block, but over the years, the number of people in the pews has thinned.",
      "Many church choirs in the heart of Brooklyn, however, have kept singing \u2014 despite boasting fewer singers than in years past as neighborhoods face gentrification and organized religious affiliation decreases.",
      "Standing in front of the gospel choir at Concord Baptist Church of Christ in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, Jessica Howard, 25, led the gospel standard \u201cGod Is\u201d on a Sunday in July. Dressed in a powder-pink floral dress, she called out lines naming God as \u201cjoy in sorrow\u201d and \u201cstrength for tomorrow.\u201d Some choir members wiped away tears as the song stoked emotions from around the room.'",
      "As a Black Christian person, as a descendant of slaves, I think when I sing, I feel really connected to my ancestors,\u201d said Howard, who grew up in Virginia and now sings as a soloist at Concord, where she\u2019s been a congregant for six years. \u201cI really feel sometimes like it\u2019s not just me singing, it\u2019s my lineage singing.\u201d",

At the time, a nearby neighborhood known as Weeksville, now considered part of central Brooklyn, was the second-largest free Black community in the United States before the Civil War, said Amanda Henderson, collections historian at the Weeksville Heritage Center.",
      "Louise Nelson, a Brooklyn native and church historian of the Berean Baptist Church in Crown Heights, said music was the foundation of the early church, and that remains true for churches in the borough today.",
      "\"The songs that uplifted us and kept us going through the midst of our misery \u2014 music is who we are,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can have a church today without the music because it brings unity in that idea that we can all do it together.\u201d",
      "According to Pew Research Center data, between 2019 and 2023, Black Protestant monthly church attendance fell from 61% to 46% \u2014 the largest decline among major U.S. religious groups. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this trend, and its impact is visible in the thinning choir stands.",
      "Glenn McMillan, Concord\u2019s director of music ministry and a musicology teacher at the City University of New York, who has worked in New York City church choirs since 1994, recalls a time when historically Black churches in Brooklyn regularly had multiple choirs at each parish.",
      "\u201cIn the last 20 years, the members of church choirs started getting older because this generation does not see church as important as it was back in the day,\u201d McMillan said. The choir at Concord has shrunk from about 50 voices before the pandemic to 30 today, McMillan said. Back in 2006, the choir featured 100 voices.",
      "According to research published by covidreligionresearch.org in June, Black Protestants attended church on Zoom more than other denominations during the pandemic, and they have been the slowest to return to in\u2011person worship.",
      "\u201cThe internet has taken over and streaming has taken over,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t goin to the building as much as they are streaming it.\u201d",

      "A professional soloist who has been singing at different churches across Brooklyn throughout her adult life, Davis said she believes one reason for choirs thinning out is the decline of music education in New York City Public Schools.",
      "\u201cWhen I was in high school, I had music every day,\u201d said Davis, who attended high school in the 1970s in central Brooklyn. \u201cI don\u2019t think the children are learning notes and sharps and clefs. I mean, that was like general knowledge for us at the time.\u201d",
      "During the 1970s fiscal crisis, the city of New York eliminated thousands of teaching positions, including art and music teachers, and converted music rooms into other classrooms, narrowing arts access in schools in low-income and majority-Black neighborhoods.",
      "\u201cFor me, singing is not just singing, it\u2019s ministry,\u201d Davis said. \u201cSome of these old hymns were composed years and years ago, and those old hymns have sustained a people \u2014 many people.\u201d",
      "Gentrification is another force reshaping Brooklyn. Between 2010 and 2020, Crown Heights lost nearly 19,000 Black residents while gaining about 15,000 whites, according to 2020 Census data. More than 75% of Bedford-Stuyvesant residents in 2000 were Black, while in 2020, around 41% were Black.",
      "Those demographic shifts have hit historically Black Catholic parishes hard. St. Teresa of Avilain Crown Heights, which was the first church in the nation to hold Mass in Creole, will close by the end of the year. The anticipated closure demonstrates a wider pattern of Catholic churches that serve people of color closing, often attributed to declining attendance.",
      "For Mike Delouis, 38, St. Teresa\u2019s longtime cantor and a son of Haitian immigrants who was baptized at the church, the loss is personal.",
      "\u201cSinging for me is not about performance but about participation,\u201d said Delouis, who juggles three services most Sundays between St. Teresa and the Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph in Prospect Heights. \u201cSt. Augustine said singing is praying twice.\u201d",
      "Delouis is part of a group fighting to keep the parish open, hoping to preserve a piece of their history in a rapidly changing Brooklyn. \u201cEven through the process of gentrification, there are people that hear the music and they come in,\u201d he said.",
      "In June, from his place in the choir loft, Delouis heard the priest announce the church\u2019s closure. The words hit hard. \u201cIt was actually kind of hard to finish,\u201d he said. \u201cWe only had the closing hymn to do, and I thought, \u2018Oh my gosh, no \u2014 we can\u2019t let this happen.\u2019\u201d",
      "Jesteena Walters, 55, has been part of Bedford Central Presbyterian Church in Crown Heights since she was an infant. She began singing at age 6 in the junior choir, and when she turned 18, she transitioned to its Gratitude choir, which her older siblings also joined. \u201cIt was the young hip gospel choir of the church,\u201d Walters said.",
      "Today, Gratitude no longer exists in the same way. Its members are older and often reunite only for special occasions, such as singing at funerals. Over the decades, Walters has also watched the congregation itself shift demographics.",

      "Ryan Speedo Green has taken on the challenging role of Wotan in Wagner\u2019s \u201cDie Walk\u00fcre\u201d at the Santa Fe Opera House",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- The Jemez and Sangre de Cristo mountains had vanished into the night sky by the time Ryan Speedo Green sang his first words as Wotan in Wagner\u2019s \u201cDie Walk\u00fcre.\u201d",
      "Still, their invisible presence around the Santa Fe Opera House was a fitting backdrop, since Wagner set the scene on a high mountain ridge.",
      "And indeed the part of Wotan, one of the most demanding roles in opera for a dramatic bass-baritone, seems to inspire mountain imagery. To conductor James Gaffigan, its length and difficulty make it \u201cthe Mount Everest for this particular voice type.\u201d To Green, \u201cIt feels almost as if this is the pinnacle, the height of roles that you could portray.\u201d",
      "Now, at age 39, Green stands proudly at that pinnacle, if sometimes still shaking his head in disbelief at how far he\u2019s come.",
      "Having survived a troubled childhood that included time in juvenile detention, he found a voice teacher who believed in his gift, honed his skills through years of study and an apprenticeship at the Vienna State Opera, then sang a series of increasingly prominent roles at the Metropolitan Opera to emerge as a full-fledged star.",
      "\u201cI never thought it would happen, that my career would blow up the way it has,\u201d Green said in an interview between performances, which continue through Aug. 21.",
      "The Santa Fe performances are his first time singing \u201cDie Walk\u00fcre,\u201d the second of the four operas in Wagner\u2019s tetralogy and the one with the biggest and most daunting role for the head of the gods.",
      "It calls for a wide dramatic range \u2014 from exuberance, to despair, from fury to compassion. And the vocal challenges include a 24-minute monologue in which Wotan recapitulates the previous events in his life, and a scene at the end of a long evening for which he has to keep his voice fresh as he bids a tender farewell to his disobedient daughter Br\u00fcnnhilde, sung here by soprano Tamara Wilson.",
      "\u201cMy Wotan is still in its infancy and I can see it grow with every performance as I get it more into my blood and into my feet,\u201d Green said. \u201cI\u2019m lucky that I\u2019m getting my first whack at it at 39.\u201d",
      "Even in this first outing, his performance drew bravos from the audience and critics.",
      "\u201cGreen \u2026 portrayed the troubled god as if he had been doing it for years,\u201d wrote Harvey Steiman on Seen and Heard International. \u201cSensitive to every singer around him, he delivered one great moment after another in his rich baritone, as silky as it is powerful.\u201d",
      "Green actually made his debut as Wotan last year in a semi-staged production of \u201cDas Rheingold,\u201d the opening \u201cRing\u201d installment at the Los Angeles Philharmonic under conductor Gustavo Dudamel.",
      "\u201cFrom the moment he walked onstage, everyone sensed his God-like presence,\u201d Dudamel said in an email to the AP. \u201cWhen he sings, the colors and richness of his voice wash over you, and the sound completely surrounds you.\u201d",

      "Among his colleagues, Green is known for his relentless work ethic and perfectionism.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s extremely hard on himself,\u201d said Gaffigan, who is conducting the Santa Fe performances and recalled the first time he heard from Green after he was cast.",
      "\u201cHe called me to start discussing the role before he even got to Santa Fe,\u201d Gaffigan said, \u201cAnd from the first words on the telephone, he said, \u2018I want an hour for Act 2 and an hour for Act 3, can you give me that?\u2019 \u2026 I knew this guy was really serious and he wouldn\u2019t give up on getting this time.",

      "Before Kristin Scott Thomas turned 12, she lost her father and stepfather. Both were Royal Navy pilots who died in crashes. The first happened when she was 5. The second at age 11. Thomas uses these facts, a kind of origin story, as the basis for her directorial debut, \u201cMy Mother\u2019s Wedding,\u201d a comedic drama about family, trauma and getting on with it that opens in theaters Friday.",
      "Knowing that the story comes from a real place is important for the experience. It gives \u201cMy Mother\u2019s Wedding,\u201d a perfectly average film that doesn\u2019t quite land the way it should, an emotional depth that it\u2019s otherwise lacking. This is a strange shortcoming considering the caliber of the cast, including Thomas as the bride to be, and Sienna Miller, Emily Beecham and Scarlett Johansson as her daughters. But it\u2019s a cruel reminder that a good hook, talented actors, one killer monologue and a picturesque setting (in this case, the English countryside) aren\u2019t guarantees that a movie will work.",
      "In the film, the deaths may be in the distant past, but they continue to haunt Diana\u2019s (Thomas) adult daughters as she prepares to marry another. Diana\u2019s new man is not a dashing pilot, forever preserved in handsome youth. Geoffrey (James Fleet) is very gray. He likes to talk about birds, ospreys in particular, has never had children and comes with a very silly last name (Loveglove) that she plans to take. Her girls are not exactly impressed, though they\u2019ve all got their own stuff to deal with.",
      "It should be said that Johansson is indeed playing a British woman in this film, and while I don't feel qualified to comment on the nuances of her accent, all I can say is that there is a consistently strange disconnect to hear it coming out of her mouth. Johansson is a great actor who I\u2019ve believed in many wilder roles, from Marvel movies right on down to her Ellen Greene riff during \u201cSaturday Night Live\u2019s\u201d 50th anniversary show. But, somehow, she\u2019s hard to buy as Katherine Frost: A British, lesbian Royal Navy officer in a longtime relationship with a woman named Jack (played by fellow beauty Freida Pinto).",
      "Miller\u2019s character is Victoria, a Hollywood actor known for franchise dreck (no one can remember whether the latest \u201cDame Of Darkness\u201d is the fourth or fifth in the series) and short-lived relationships. And Beecham is the youngest Georgina, a nurse who suspects that her husband is having an affair. To find out, the girls hire a private detective to surveil her house and show them the footage after the wedding.",
      "It's a very busy, fraught weekend for everyone. There\u2019s lots of fretting over why Katherine won\u2019t marry Jack, and why Victoria is dancing around a relationship with a wealthy, older French man when her childhood crush still pines for her. There\u2019s lingering anxiety about their mom marrying this man who seems so unlike the two heroes that came before and much discussion about the importance of last names, marriage and making sure kids feel like they belong to someone. Some things get resolved, but it's hard to shake the feeling that everyone might need a new therapist by the end.",

Now comes Friday, when he follows it up with a sophomore offering, \u201cDifferent Night Same Rodeo.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don't know what I'm doing,\u201d Zimmerman, 25, tells The Associated Press through a smile. \u201cI randomly got into music in 2020, 2021, and I\u2019d never sang before. I\u2019d never wrote songs before.\u201d",

      "Zach Cregger says he had to stop writing jokes while creating his latest horror film, \u201cWeapons,\" and instead let the hyper realistic aftermath of tragedy drive the movie's humor",
      "LOS ANGELES -- If there\u2019s one thing Zach Cregger learned while writing and directing his upcoming horror movie \u201cWeapons,\u201d it\u2019s that the best laughs won\u2019t come from the jokes he writes.",
      "The film follows Cregger\u2019s 2022 solo directorial debut \u201cBarbarians,\u201d the widely celebrated genre-bending horror. This time, the young director bends even more, spinning a town into chaos when all children but one from the same classroom mysteriously vanish, leaving a trail of questions in their place.",
      "The Warner Bros. release hits theaters Friday and is as creepy as it is hilarious \u2014 a delicate balance that required Cregger to strip any intentionality behind his humor, he told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIf the humor is coming from an authentic reaction that a character\u2019s having, then it works,\u201d Cregger said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of jokes that didn\u2019t make it into the movie that I thought were going to be so funny. And then we did a test screening, and nobody laughed and I\u2019m like, OK, it\u2019s gotta go.\u201d",
      "Paranoia runs deep in the film. The town's heartbroken parents are represented by Josh Brolin\u2019s character, Archer, whose son was among the missing. The students\u2019 teacher, played by Julia Garner, is determined to solve the mystery, despite parents blaming her for the disappearances.",
      "The humor here comes naturally, Cregger said, as characters navigate the absurd events happening around them.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not playing for the laugh, otherwise you lose the laugh,\u201d said Brolin, whose character stumbles through his grief, a state ripe for what he called genuine and \u201cembarrassingly funny\u201d moments.",
      "If 17 kids up and ran out of their homes at 2:17 a.m. one morning with no trace, what would a community do? That question drove \u201cWeapons,\u201d painting a picture of a town left reeling by the mystery.",
      "The film setting \u2014 the fictional small town of Maybrook, Illinois \u2014 is just as integral to the plot as any of its main characters. The town feels hyper realistic, a core tenet to the movie\u2019s ability to blend humor and horror, two genres that Garner said are \u201copposite side of the same coin.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funny because this isn\u2019t even like a proper horror film,\u201d Garner said. \u201cIt has comedic elements and has horror elements, but it\u2019s kind of its own genre, in a way.\u201d",
      "The town\u2019s reactions to tragedy and shock was intentionally meant to feel oddly realistic, Cregger said. Parents are outraged, storming into town halls and angrily demanding answers from the police, the school and, most pointedly, the students\u2019 teacher. Yet, when Garner\u2019s character is attacked in broad daylight, bystanders and store owners hardly bat an eye, a level of indifference that Cregger said is just as realistic as the parental outrage.",

      "Brolin \u2014 who's found wide-reaching success across Hollywood, from the 1985 classic, \u201cThe Goonies,\u201d to the Marvel universe \u2014 initially hesitated when approached for the film.

      "But \u201cWeapons\u201d lends the characters a layer of depth that allowed horror, a genre he said is typically treated as cosmetic, to suddenly have \u201cdepth, and humor and absurdity,\u201d which, coupled with his own adult daughter\u2019s love of \u201cBarbarian,\u201d was enough to convince him to sign on.",
      "The movie subtly mocks suburban life, as goriness and horror occur under the sights of nosy neighbors, corrupt police departments and struggling relationships.",
      "Each character that drives the plot forward is just as flawed as they are victims of tragedy. Gandy, the schoolteacher, is harassed by parents for her missing students, but is secretly battling alcoholism. Archer, the heartbroken father, is failing in his job and his marriage as he navigates his son\u2019s absence. Paul Morgan, played by Alden Ehrenreich, is a local beat police officer with secrets of his own.",
      "\u201cEvery character is perceived in a certain way and then every character breaks,\u201d Brolin said. \u201cIt all comes down to this very base thing: What if you lost the thing that you value the most? How do you deal?\u201d",
      "For Ehrenreich, who\u2019s found success in dramas, notably as a young Han Solo, \u201cWeapons\u201d offered a different pace, but its horror wasn\u2019t what drew him in. Rather, he was captivated by the film\u2019s depth and weirdness.",
      "\u201cThe weird resonance, the weird opening voice-over, the way it was written and the kind of emotional brokenness of these characters and the depth that I felt was in the writing, that was as deep as any drama I\u2019ve read in years,\u201d Ehrenreich said.",

      "The body-swappers are back",
      "It\u2019s a tale as old as time \u2014 or at least, a tale Hollywood loves to tell again and again: Body-swapping. It\u2019s magical. It\u2019s comical. It carries heartwarming messages about walking in another\u2019s shoes, and learning about oneself along the way.",
      "So it\u2019s hardly surprising that \u201cFreaky Friday,\u201d the 2003 version of the 1972 Mary Rodgers novel starring Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis, was a hit. Lohan was endearing and charismatic as an appealing, mildly turbulent teenager, and Curtis was a comic hoot as her control-freak therapist mom.",
      "And while there were a few misfires \u2014 the stereotypical Asian representation has aged badly \u2014 the film was powered by an easy chemistry between the two stars. So why not revisit the story in 2025? Sequels are often made for far less compelling reasons.",
      "The chief weakness of \u201cFreakier Friday\u201d \u2014 which brings Curtis and Lohan back for an amiable, often joyful and certainly chaotic reunion \u2014 is that while it hews overly closely to the structure, storyline and even dialogue of the original, it tries too hard to up the ante. The comedy is thus a bit more manic, and the plot machinations more overwrought (or sometimes distractingly silly).",
      "Then there's the double body-swapping. Because one major swap isn't enough, here we have two sets of swappers \u2014 a quixotic quartet of lives disrupted during the lead-up to, yes, another wedding! The problem is that sometimes, it\u2019s actually hard to keep track of who\u2019s inhabiting whom, and therefore why they're doing what.",
      "Not to say that \u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d directed with gusto by Nisha Ganatra, doesn't have moments of comic glee. I\u2019ll admit to laughing out loud \u2014 with everyone else older than 30 near me \u2014 when two teens were trying to locate an adult contact and one of them pulled up Facebook, explaining: \u201cIt\u2019s like a database of old people!\u201d Touch\u00e9, guys.",
      "These \u201cyoungsters\u201d are actually Lohan and Curtis, playing ninth-graders trapped in adult bodies. Before we get to that, though: We begin 22 years after we last saw Lohan\u2019s Anna, playing electric guitar at her mom's wedding. Now a single mom herself with a job managing a young pop star, she's trying to get her daughter up for school. Harper (the excellent Julia Butters) is \u2014 surprise! \u2014 an appealing, mildly turbulent teenager. And just like Anna two decades ago, she keeps people out of her bedroom. \u201cPrepare to be triggered!\u201d Anna yells before barging in. (The dialogue has been duly updated to the present time.)",
      "Driving to school drop-off, Anna is joined by her mom, Tess (Curtis), who has stylish gray hair now and is still a practicing therapist, podcaster and author whose latest topic is \u201cRebelling with Respect.\u201d Dropping Harper off, Anna calls out \u201cMake good choices!\u201d \u2014 just what mom Tess used to say, natch.",
      "At school, Harper butts heads with transfer student Lily (Sophia Hammons), a budding fashion designer who hails from Britain and is very snooty. Anna is called to see the principal. There, she meets Lily\u2019s dishy chef dad Eric (Manny Jacinto), and the two flirt so intensely, the principal herself makes them a dinner reservation.",
      "All it takes is one cute dating montage, and poof, Anna and Eric are engaged. But things are still bad between Harper and Lily, whose animosity triggers a weirdly violent, all-school food fight on bake sale day. But they all have a bachelorette party to attend. There, a wacky fortune-teller and barista and business-card maker \u2014 Vanessa Bayer, in a cameo that perhaps, no definitely goes on too long \u2014 reads their palms. And then the earth starts shaking.",
      "\u201cFreaky\u201d fans know what happens next. The four awaken the next morning, each inhabiting someone else. Anna is Harper. Tess is Lily. Harper is Anna. Lily is Tess. We\u2019ll be testing you on this later!",

      "CHICAGO -- One called abortion a \u201cbarbaric practice.\u201d Another referred to himself as a \u201czealot\u201d for the anti-abortion movement. Several have played prominent roles in defending their state's abortion restrictions in court and in cases that have had national impact, including on access to medication abortion.",
      "As President Donald Trump pushes the Senate to confirm his federal judicial nominees, a review by The Associated Press shows that roughly half of them have revealed anti-abortion views, been associated with anti-abortion groups or defended abortion restrictions.",
      "Trump has offered shifting positions on the issue while indicating he wants to leave questions of abortion access to the states. But his court nominees will have lifetime appointments and be in position to roll back abortion access long after the Republican president leaves the White House.",
      "Bernadette Meyler, a professor of constitutional law at Stanford University, said judicial nominations \u201care a way of federally shaping the abortion question without going through Congress or making a big, explicit statement.\u201d",
      "\"It\u2019s a way to cover up a little bit what is happening in the abortion sphere compared to legislation or executive orders that may be more visible, dramatic and spark more backlash,\u201d she said.",
      "Of the 17 judicial nominees so far in Trump's second term, at least eight have argued in favor of abortion restrictions or against expanded abortion access. No such records could be found for the other nine, nor did the AP review find evidence that any of Trump's judicial nominees support increased access to abortion.",
      "\"Every nominee of the President represents his promises to the American people and aligns with the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s landmark ruling,\" a White House spokesman, Harrison Fields, said in a statement that referenced the 2022 decision overturning the constitutional right to abortion established in Roe v. Wade. \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 extreme position on abortion was rejected in November in favor of President Trump\u2019s commonsense approach, which allows states to decide, supports the sanctity of human life, and prevents taxpayer funding of abortion.\u201d",

      "In his second term, all but five of his 17 nominees are from states that went for Trump in 2024 and where Republicans have pushed severe abortion restrictions. Among them, four nominees are from Missouri and five are from Florida.",

      "\u2014 Whitney Hermandorfer, who has been confirmed to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, has built much of her relatively short career as a lawyer around challenging former President Joe Biden\u2019s policies related to abortion and transgender rights. She challenged a federal law requiring employers to provide workers with reasonable accommodations to get abortion care, as well as Title X regulations that required providers who receive funding through the program to give information about abortions to patients if asked.",
      "Hermandorfer defended Tennessee\u2019s abortion ban, one of the strictest in the country, in court and tried to dismiss a lawsuit from doctors seeking clarification on exemptions to the ban. She said abortion deserves special scrutiny because \u201cthis is the only medical procedure that terminates a life.\u201d",
      "\u2014 Maria Lanahan, a district court nominee in Missouri, helped write the state's complaint in a lawsuit that had sweeping national implications for access to medication abortion. The case challenged the FDA approval of the abortion pill mifepristone despite decades of evidence showing the drug is safe and effective.",
      "The lawyer supported Missouri's effort to strip Planned Parenthood of state Medicaid funding and defended the state's abortion ban after a group of clergy sued, arguing it violated the state constitution\u2019s protections for religious freedom.",
      "\u2014 Jordan Pratt, a nominee for the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, called abortion a \u201cbarbaric practice\u201d and \u201cone of the most severe invasions of personal rights imaginable\u201d in an amicus brief supporting Florida's 15-week abortion ban. The state now bans the procedure at six weeks.",
      "In 2025, Pratt struck down a Florida law that created a judicial waiver program for minors seeking to have abortions without parental consent.

      "CHICAGO -- A review by The Associated Press shows that several of President Donald Trump's nominees to the federal courts have revealed anti-abortion views, been associated with anti-abortion groups or defended abortion restrictions.",
      "Several have helped defend their state's abortion restrictions in court and some have been involved in cases with national impact, including on access to medication abortion.",
      "While Trump has said issues related to abortion should be left to the states, the nominees, with lifetime appointments, would be in position to roll back abortion rights long after Trump leaves the White House.",
      "Trump has repeatedly shifted his messaging on abortion, often giving contradictory or vague answers.",
      "In the years before his most recent presidential campaign, Trump had voiced support for a federal ban on abortion on or after 20 weeks in pregnancy and said he might support a national ban around 15 weeks. He later settled on messaging that decisions about abortion access should be left to the states.",
      "Throughout his campaign, Trump has alternated between taking credit for appointing the Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade and striking a more neutral tone. That's been an effort to navigate the political divide between his base of anti-abortion supporters and the broader public, which largely supports access to abortion.",
      "One Trump nominee called abortion a \u201cbarbaric practice\" while another referred to himself as a \u201czealot\u201d for the anti-abortion movement. A nominee from Tennessee said abortion deserves special scrutiny because \u201cthis is the only medical procedure that terminates a life.\u201d",

On the ground, Kosuzu Harada\u2019s grandfather survived both attacks.",

      "Decades later, that shared goal has brought their grandchildren together. Ari Beser and Harada are telling their grandfathers\u2019 linked stories, and working to seek reconciliation and understanding about an attack that continues to divide people in Japan and the United States.",
      "During this week's commemoration of the 80th anniversaries of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki attacks, the grandchildren visited a station in Hiroshima where Yamaguchi, badly injured, boarded a train back to his hometown of Nagasaki a day after the bombing on Aug. 6, 1945.",
      "The two grandchildren then went to the Hiroshima peace park where they spoke with The Associated Press about what their grandfathers experienced during two of the 20th century's most momentous events and their consequences.",
      "Yamaguchi was 29 when he was burned severely in the Hiroshima bombing. He was in the city on a temporary assignment as a shipbuilding engineer. After Yamaguchi arrived in Nagasaki, and was telling colleagues about the attack he had witnessed in Hiroshima, the second bomb exploded.",
      "Harada first learned about her grandfather\u2019s experience of both bombs when she interviewed him for an assignment in elementary school.",
      "Yamaguchi didn\u2019t talk about his experience in public until he was 90 because of worries about discrimination. He then became a vocal activist for peace until he died in 2010.",
      "In 2013, Harada learned that the grandson of an American who was on the planes that bombed both Hiroshima and Nagasaki wanted to hear about Yamaguchi's story.",
      "\u201cI had mixed feelings as a family member of the survivors,\u201d Harada said, recalling Ari Beser\u2019s first visit.",
      "Ari Beser quietly listened as Harada\u2019s mother talked about Yamaguchi.",
      "Harada and her mother were surprised when they learned that the senior Beser was exposed to radiation during his missions.",
      "\u201cWe used to see ourselves only from the victims\u2019 perspective,\" she said. \"We learned that war affects and ruins everyone\u2019s lives.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel it is my role to keep telling about the horror ... so that the same mistake will never be repeated,\" Harada said.",
      "She visits places across Japan to talk about her grandfather's story and to push for a nuclear-free world.",
      "Yamaguchi used to say that he could never forgive the U.S. government for dropping the bombs, but he had no hatred for Americans. Even as his health deteriorated, Yamaguchi still spoke of his past, holding an interview from his hospital bed.",
      "Beser, a visual journalist and producer, has since regularly visited Nagasaki, and he and Harada have become friends.",
      "Harada believes the U.S. government should formally apologize for the bombings.",

      "When he was asked about the attacks during his first visit to Hiroshima 40 years ago, Jacob Beser didn't apologize, but said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it was our proudest moment.\u201d He said the world needed to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.",
      "At 8:15 a.m. on Aug. 6, 1945, Jacob Beser was on the bomber Enola Gay approaching Hiroshima after a seven-hour flight from the Mariana Islands. The B-29 quickly descended from 32,000 feet (nearly 10,000 meters) to 1,820 feet (about 550 meters) and then dropped the bomb.",

      "The mRNA technology is used in approved COVID-19 and RSV shots, but has not yet been approved for a flu shot. Moderna, which was studying a combination COVID-19 and flu mRNA shot, had said it believed mRNA could speed up production of flu shots compared with traditional vaccines.",

      "\u201cFind your purpose.\u201d",
      "It has become such common advice that few question it. But rather than inspirational, it can feel like a burden. How do I go about finding this and what if I never do?",
      "This is \u201cpurpose anxiety\u201d \u2014 the gnawing sense that one\u2019s life should have an overarching purpose, but it\u2019s unclear how to discover it.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of commands to find purpose, but not a lot of support to find purpose,\u201d said Michael Steger, a professor at Colorado State University and director of its Center for Meaning and Purpose.",
      "The definition of purpose can be elastic. Can you have only one purpose or can you have many? Does it have to involve service to others or can it be something that consistently gives only you great pleasure and meaning?",
      "Think of purpose not as something that governs behavior but as a compass you can choose to follow, helping direct your energies toward a central life aim, says Todd Kashdan, a professor at George Mason University and founder of its Well-Being Laboratory. A sense of purpose can help \u201cclose that gap between who you are and what you ideally want to become,\u201d he said.",
      "People can lead content, meaningful lives without ever articulating a sense of purpose, he emphasized.",
      "There are many legitimate reasons for the advice given by parents, teachers, mentors and an array of online gurus that finding purpose is key to a good life. Research has shown that people who more strongly feel a sense of purpose tend to be physically and mentally healthier.",
      "But the word has become so weighty that finding a purpose has, for many, become a source of angst.",
      "The term \u201cpurpose anxiety\u201d appears to have been coined in 2014 by a University of Pennsylvania graduate student, Larissa Rainey, and caught on. Author Elizabeth Gilbert, for example, best known for her memoir \u201cEat, Pray, Love,\u201d has spoken frequently about an unhealthy obsession over a \u201cpurposeful life.\u201d It is, she said in one interview, \u201cthe formula we\u2019ve all been fed.\u201d",
      "People have always searched for life\u2019s meaning and purpose.",
      "\u201cPart of what it is to have a human consciousness is to think about our place in the universe,\u201d said Jody Day, a psychotherapist and author of \u201cLiving the Life Unexpected: How to Find Hope, Meaning and a Fulfilling Future without Children.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut a lot of the places that we\u2019ve naturally found meaning in our culture in, say, the last hundred years are falling away.\u201d",
      "Religion, for instance, often offered purpose and meaning to believers. But those who identify as religious has dropped significantly over the years (although that appears to be leveling off recently according to a 2025 survey by the Pew Research Center).",
      "Other people traditionally found purpose in ensuring that their children had a better life than they did. Many don\u2019t have confidence that will be the case anymore, Day said.",
      "As Steger said, \u201cnow we\u2019re stuck trying to do the harder thing, which is, one by one, figure out everything in the universe and how we fit.\"",

      "You might begin, Steger said, by realizing that you don\u2019t have to pin down a purpose immediately; searching for purpose in itself helps generate meaning in life.",
      "It entails \u201cunderstanding who you are and what you have to work with, understanding what you care about, what you\u2019d like to see be better, either in yourself or in the world\u201d and then figuring out if you can make an impact, he added.",

      "For Jordan Grumet, author of \u201cThe Purpose Code,\u201d there is big \u201cP\u201d Purpose and little \u201cp\u201d purpose, and too many people stress about finding the first and ignore the second.",
      "\u201cBig \u2018P\u2019 Purpose is goal-oriented \u2014 it\u2019s usually big and audacious, and often unattainable,\u201d he said. Social media, he said, \u201cis full of people trying to voice that version of purpose on you so that they can make money.\u201d",
      "Better, he said, to focus on little \u201cp\u201d purpose and pursuits that some might simply call hobbies \u2014 gardening, singing, collecting baseball cards. Or it can be found in a job, or volunteering.",
      "\u201cWhat could I do that would light me up and fill me up and be a good use of my time?\u201d Grumet said.",
      "It\u2019s not just for self-improvement, he said. When people do something they love, they attract people to them, which can help create communities.",
      "Not all agree that hobbies and passions are the same as purpose. Reading books, Kashdan said, isn\u2019t a purpose in itself but can be a tool to discovering it. \u201cThey\u2019re just like fledgling seeds of, hey, something might be there that you might want to pursue with more depth and more gravity in your life.\u201d",
      "Sometimes a traumatic event can change or create one\u2019s purpose in life. For example, Day, the psychotherapist and author, assumed that her purpose would be to raise a family, but by her early 40s she knew she would not be able to have children",

      "Black looked around the room as the execution started, lifting his head off the gurney multiple times, and could be heard sighing and breathing heavily. All seven media witnesses to the execution agreed he appeared to be in discomfort. Throughout the execution, a spiritual adviser prayed and sang over Black, at one point touching his face.",
      "\u201cOh, it's hurting so bad,\" Black said, as he lay with his hands and chest restrained to the gurney, a sheet covering up past his lower half, and an IV line in his arm.",
      "\u201cI'm so sorry. Just listen to my voice,\u201d the adviser responded.",
      "Black was executed after a back-and-forth in court over whether officials would need to turn off his implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, or ICD. Black, 69, was in a wheelchair, suffering from dementia, brain damage, kidney failure, congestive heart failure and other conditions, his attorneys have said.",

      "Research shows mRNA vaccines saved millions of lives during the COVID-19 pandemic",
      "WASHINGTON -- So-called mRNA vaccines saved millions of lives during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 and now scientists are using that Nobel Prize-winning technology to try to develop vaccines and treatments against a long list of diseases including cancer and cystic fibrosis.",
      "But this week, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic, canceled $500 million in government-funded research projects to create new mRNA vaccines against respiratory illnesses that might trigger another health emergency.",
      "That dismays infectious disease experts who note that mRNA allows faster production of shots than older vaccine-production methods, buying precious time if another pandemic were to emerge.",
      "Using older technology to target a pandemic flu strain would take 18 months to \u201cmake enough vaccine to vaccinate only about one-fourth of the world,\" said Michael Osterholm of the University of Minnesota, an expert on pandemic preparation. But using mRNA technology \u201ccould change that dramatically, such that by the end of the first year, we could vaccinate the world.\u201d",
      "Traditionally, making vaccines required growing viruses or pieces of viruses called proteins \u2014 often in giant vats of cells or, like most flu shots, in chicken eggs \u2014 and then purifying them. Injecting a small dose as a vaccine trains the body how to recognize when a real infection hits so it's ready to fight back.",
      "But that technology takes a long time. Using mRNA is a faster process.",
      "The \u201cm\u201d stands for messenger, meaning mRNA carries instructions for our bodies to make proteins. Scientists figured out how to harness that natural process by making mRNA in a lab.",
      "They take a snippet of that genetic code that carries instructions for making the protein they want the vaccine to target. Injecting that snippet instructs the body to become its own mini-vaccine factory, making enough copies of the protein for the immune system to recognize and react.",
      "Years of research show protection from COVID-19 vaccines \u2014 both the types made with mRNA and a type made with traditional technology \u2014 does wane over time. The vaccinations provide the strongest protection against severe infection and death, even if people still become infected.",

      "Osterholm counts about 15 infectious disease vaccines that could benefit from mRNA technology, but that's not the only potential.

      "The World Health Organization has closed in on its bold goal of eradicating polio several times, but the paralytic virus is entrenched in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan",
      "KARACHI, Pakistan -- For the past decade, Sughra Ayaz has traveled door to door in southeastern Pakistan, pleading with parents to allow children to be vaccinated against polio as part of a global campaign to wipe out the paralytic disease. She hears their demands and fears. Some are practical \u2013 families need basics like food and water more than vaccines. Others are simply unfounded \u2013 the oral doses are meant to sterilize their kids.",
      "Amid rampant misinformation and immense pressure for the campaign to succeed, Ayaz said, some managers have instructed workers to falsely mark children as immunized. And the vaccines, which must be kept cold, aren\u2019t always stored correctly, she added.",
      "\u201cIn many places, our work is not done with honesty,\u201d Ayaz said.",
      "The World Health Organization and partners embarked on their polio campaign in 1988 with the bold goal of eradication \u2014 a feat seen only once for human diseases, with smallpox in 1980. They came close several times, including in 2021, when just five cases of the natural virus were reported in Pakistanand Afghanistan. But since then, cases rebounded, hitting 99 last year, and officials have missed at least six self-imposed eradication deadlines.",
      "Afghanistan and Pakistan remain the only countries where transmission of polio \u2014 which is highly infectious, affects mainly children under 5, and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours -- has never been interrupted. The worldwide campaign has focused most of its attention and funding there for the past decade.",
      "But in its quest to eliminate the disease, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative has been derailed by mismanagement and what insiders describe as blind allegiance to an outdated strategy and a problematic oral vaccine, according to workers, polio experts and internal materials obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "Officials have falsified vaccination records, selected unqualified people to dole out drops, failed to send out teams during mass campaigns, and dismissed concerns about the oral vaccinesparking outbreaks, according to documents shared with AP by staffers from GPEI \u2013 one of the largest and most expensive public health campaigns in history, with over $20 billion spent and nearly every country in the world involved.",
      "In Afghanistan and Pakistan \u2013 which share a border, harbor widespread mistrust of vaccines, and have weakened healthcare systems and infrastructure \u2013 local staffers like Ayaz have for years flagged problems to senior managers. But those issues, along with concerns by staffers and outside health officials, have long gone unaddressed, insiders say.",
      "Officials tout the successes \u2013 3 billion children vaccinated, an estimated 20 million people who would have been paralyzed spared \u2013 while acknowledging challenges in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Remote villages are hard to reach, some cultural and religious authorities instruct against vaccination, and hundreds of polio workers and security staff have been killed because of their alignment with a Western-led initiative.",
      "Dr. Jamal Ahmed, WHO\u2019s polio director, defended progress in those two countries, citing workers\u2019 tailored response in resistant pockets.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so many children being protected today because of the work that was done over the past 40 years,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s not overdramatize the challenges, because that leads to children getting paralyzed.\u201d",
      "Ahmed said he believes authorities will end the spread of polio in the next 12 to 18 months. Its latest goal for eradication is 2029. The campaign says about 45 million children in Pakistan and 11 million in Afghanistan must be vaccinated this year. Children typically need four doses of two drops each to be considered fully immunized.",
      "Dr. Zulfiqar Bhutta, who has served on advisory groups for WHO, the Gates Foundation and others, said campaign officials should listen to the criticism of its tactics.",
      "\u201cContinuing blindly with the same strategies that we have relied on since eradication began is unlikely to lead to a different result,\u201d he said.",
      "Internal WHO reports reviewing vaccination drives in Afghanistan and Pakistan over the past decade \u2013 given to AP by current and former staffers \u2013 show that as early as 2017, local workers were alerting significant problems to senior managers.",
      "The documents flagged multiple cases of falsified vaccination records, health workers being replaced by untrained relatives and workers improperly administering vaccines.",
      "On numerous occasions, WHO officials noted, \u201cvaccinators did not know about vaccine management,\u201d citing failure to keep doses properly cold. They also found sloppy or falsified reporting, with workers noting \u201cmore used vaccine vials than were actually supplied.\u201d",
      "According to an August 2017 report from Kandahar, Afghanistan, local government authorities and others interfered in choosing vaccinators, \u201cresulting in the selection of underage and illiterate volunteers.\u201d",
      "Vaccination teams worked \u201cin a hurried manner,\u201d reports said, with \u201cno plan for monitoring or supervision.\u201d A team in Nawzad, Afghanistan, covered just half of the intended area in 2017, with 250 households missed entirely. Village elders said no one visited for at least two years.",
      "Vaccine workers and health officials in Afghanistan and Pakistan confirmed the issues in the documents and told AP it\u2019s hard for campaign leadership to grasp the difficulties in the field. Door-to-door efforts are stymied by cultural barriers, unfounded stories about vaccines, and the region\u2019s poverty and transience.",
      "\u201cMost of the time when we go to vaccinate and knock on the door, the head of the house or the man is not at home,\u201d said one worker, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to talk to the press. \u201cMany people find it offensive that a stranger knocks on the door and talks to a woman.\u201d",
      "Some workers find families have moved. Occasionally, they say, the encounter abuse.",
      "\u201cWe have shared these problems with our senior officials,\u201d the worker told AP. \u201cThey know about it.\u201d",
      "In an email response to AP\u2019s questions about officials\u2019 knowledge of the issues, WHO polio director Ahmed noted \u201coperational challenges\u201d in Afghanistan and Pakistan and said the program has \u201crobust monitoring and evaluation processes.\u201d",

      "\u201cThere is so much pressure,\u201d Ayaz said.",
      "Before the first polio vaccine was developed in 1955, the disease \u2014 spread mostly from person to person, through contaminated water and via fecal particles \u2014 was among the world\u2019s most feared, paralyzing hundreds of thousands of children annually. People avoided crowded places during epidemics, and hospital wards filled with children encased in iron lungs after the virus immobilized their breathing muscles.",
      "Polio is mainly spread when people are exposed to water infected with the virus. In countries with poor sanitation, children often become infected when they come into contact with contaminated waste.",

      "But public health leaders and former WHO staffers say campaign efforts are far from perfect, and many question the oral vaccine.",
      "The oral vaccine \u2013 proven to be safe and effective \u2014 has been given to more than 3 billion children. But there are some extremely rare side effects: Scientists estimate that for every 2.7 million first doses given, one child will be paralyzed by the live polio virus in the vaccine.",
      "In even rarer instances, the live virus can mutate into a form capable of starting new outbreaks among unimmunized people where vaccination rates are low.",
      "Worldwide, several hundred vaccine-derived cases have been reported annually since at least 2021, with at least 98 this year.",
      "Most public health experts agree the oral vaccine should be pulled as soon as possible. But they acknowledge there simply isn\u2019t enough injectable vaccine \u2014 which uses no live virus and doesn\u2019t come with the risks of the oral vaccine \u2014 to wipe out polio alone. The injectable vaccine also is more expensive and requires more training to administer.",
      "More than two dozen current and former senior polio officials told AP the agencies involved haven\u2019t been willing to even consider revising their strategy to account for some of the campaign\u2019s problems.",
      "Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who sits on an independent board reviewing polio eradication, said it would be impossible to eliminate polio without the oral vaccine. But he\u2019s urged authorities to find ways to adapt, such as adopting new methods to identify polio cases more quickly. Since 2011, he and colleagues have issued regular reports about overall program failures.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no management,\u201d he said, citing a lack of accountability.",
      "Last year, former WHO scientist Dr. T. Jacob John twice emailed WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus calling for a \u201cmajor course correction.\u201d John shared the emails with AP and said he\u2019s received no response.",
      "\u201cWHO is persisting with polio control and creating polio with one hand and attempting to control it by the other,\u201d John wrote.",
      "In his response to AP, WHO polio director Ahmed said the oral vaccine is a \u201ccore pillar\u201d of eradication strategy and that \u201calmost every country that is polio-free today used (it) to achieve that milestone.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need to step back and really care for the people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way we can do that in large parts of the world is with oral polio vaccine.\u201d",
      "Ahmed also pointed to the success WHO and partners had eliminating polio from India, once considered a nearly impossible task. In the four years before polio was wiped out there, health workers delivered about 1 billion doses of the oral vaccine to more than 170 million children.",
      "Today, nearly all of the world\u2019s polio cases -- mostly in Africa and the Middle East -- are mutated viruses from the oral vaccine, except for Afghanistan and Pakistan.",
      "Scott Barrett, a Columbia University professor, called for an inquiry into how things went so wrong \u2013 particularly with a failed effort in 2016, when authorities removed a strain from the oral vaccine. They miscalculated, leading to outbreaks in more than 40 countries that paralyzed more than 3,000 children, according to an expert report commissioned by WHO. Last year, a mutated virus traced to that effort paralyzed a baby in Gaza.",
      "\u201cUnless you have a public inquiry where all the evidence comes out and WHO makes serious changes, it will be very hard to trust them,\u201d he said.",
      "With an annual budget of about $1 billion, the polio initiative is among the most expensive in all of public health. This year, the U.S. withdrew from WHO, and President Donald Trump has cut foreign aid. WHO officials have privately admitted that sustaining funding would be difficult without success.",
      "Some say the money would be better spent on other health needs.",
      "\u201cWe have spent more than $1 billion (in external polio funding) in the last five years in Pakistan alone, and it didn\u2019t buy us any progress,\u201d said Roland Sutter, who formerly led polio research at WHO. \u201cIf this was a private company, we would demand results.\u201d",
      "Villagers, too, have protested the cost, staging hundreds of boycotts of immunization campaigns since 2023. Instead of polio vaccines, they ask for medicine, food and electricity.",
      "In Karachi, locals told AP they didn\u2019t understand the government\u2019s fixation on polio and complained of other issues \u2014 dirty water, heroin addiction. Workers are accompanied by armed guards; Pakistani authorities say more than 200 workers and police assigned to protect them have been killed since the 1990s, mostly by militants.",
      "The campaign also is up against a wave of misinformation, including that the vaccine is made from pig urine or will make children reach puberty early. Some blame an anti-vaccine sentiment growing in the U.S. and other countries that have largely funded eradication efforts and say it\u2019s reaching even remote areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan.",
      "In suburban southwest Pakistan, Saleem Khan, 58, said two grandchildren under 5 were vaccinated over his family\u2019s objections.",
      "\u201cIt results in disability,\u201d said Khan, without citing evidence for his belief. \u201cThey are vaccinated because officials reported our refusal to authorities and the police.\u201d",
      "Svea Closser, professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University, said Pakistan and Afghanistan were less resistant to immunization decades ago. Now, people are angry about the focus on polio and lack of help for diseases like measles or tuberculosis, she said, spurring conspiracy theories.",
      "\u201cPolio eradication has created a monster,\u201d Closser said. It doesn\u2019t help, she added, that in this region, public trust in vaccine campaigns was undermined when the CIA organized a fake hepatitis drive in 2011 in an attempt to get DNA and confirm the presence of Osama bin Laden or his family.",
      "Workers see that continued mistrust every day.",
      "In a mountainous region of southeastern Afghanistan where most people survive by growing wheat and raising cows and chickens, a mother of five said she'd prefer that her children be vaccinated against polio, but her husband and other male relatives have instructed their families to reject it. They believe the false rumors that it will compromise their children\u2019s fertility.",
      "\u201cIf I allow it,\u201d the woman said, declining to be named over fears of family retribution, \u201cI will be beaten and thrown out.\u201d",

      "Three new studies highlight the severe health impacts of recent wildfires on Maui and in Los Angeles",
      "NEW YORK -- The toll of wildfires is usually counted in acres burnt, property destroyed and lives lost to smoke and flames. But three studies published Wednesday suggest the cost to human health from the Maui and Los Angeles wildfires was substantially higher.",
      "Two of the papers explore what happened after the Hawaii fire in August 2023 \u2014 one of the deadliest U.S. wildfires in a century. A third looks at the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year.",
      "The Maui fire was directly blamed for more than 100 deaths. But it also left 1 in 5 with lung damage and as many as half with symptoms of depression, the new research found. The month of the fire saw 13 suicide and overdose deaths, translating to nearly double the normal suicide and overdose death rates.",
      "The study of the Los Angeles fires concluded that in addition to at least 30 deaths attributed to the fire, more than 400 other deaths could be blamed on the event, due to interruptions in health care and other factors.",
      "The studies, published in two American Medical Association journals, add \"a really important piece to the understanding of the true health risks from these extreme climatic events,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Patz, a University of Wisconsin environmental public health researcher who was not involved in the papers.",
      "The results conform with existing understanding of the effects of extreme weather events, some experts said.",
      "How to track the indirect impacts of disastrous events has been a continuing subject of academic research and even legislative proposals. There have been estimates of deaths caused by extreme heat, as well as research into the large-scale toll of wildfires driven by climate change.",
      "\u201cBut this hones in, especially on (specific) fires,\u201d Patz said.",
      "One of the studies, co-led by Ruben Juarez of the University of Hawaii, looked at more than 1,100 adults six to 14 months after the Maui fire. It found lower lung function in people in areas close to the fire compared with those in lower-exposure areas. Overall, about 22% had below-normal lung function.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a stark reminder that wildfires can leave an invisible but lasting scar on respiratory health, long after the flames are gone,\u201d Juarez said, in an email, noting that this Friday marks the two-year anniversary of the fire.",
      "Patz called the finding \u201can important new contribution.\u201d",
      "Kristie Ebi of the University of Washington echoed that, noting that there is a growing understanding that wildfire smoke can be more toxic than standard air pollution.",

      "Of course, the researchers don't know exactly how much smoke each person was exposed to, and other studies would need to be done to explore cause-and-effect, she added.",
      "The study also found 40% saying their health had declined since the fires, with close to half talking about increased fatigue and weakness, eye irritation and lung-related symptoms.",
      "Jonathan Purtle of New York University was the lead author of another study, which calculated rates of suicide and overdose deaths in Maui and Hawaii's four other counties. That research team found a 97% increase in suicides and overdose death rates on Maui during the month of the wildfires. The total number of suicide and overdose deaths was 13 that month \u2014 most of them suicides. That's a significant increase, Ebi said.",
      "They also found a 46% increase in such deaths in all five counties, which may have been influenced by displaced Maui residents migrating to other islands, the authors said.",
      "The increases did not last: Rates fells in the following months, the researchers found.",
      "The third study was led by researchers in Finland. They used mathematical modeling to estimate that there were 440 more deaths in Los Angeles County from Jan. 5 to Feb. 1 than what would normally have been expected, and said those are related to the fires.",

      "Defibrillators are surgically placed in the upper chest, where they monitor irregular heartbeats and use electrical shocks to jolt the heart back to normal.",
      "As of July 24, Boston Scientific has reported 386 serious injuries and 16 deaths associated with this issue, the agency said.",
      "Ten of the deaths were judged to be due to the device failing to function properly, the company said in an email. Four were linked to attempts to surgically remove the devices from patients and two others were deemed unrelated to the implants.",
      "Boston Scientific's wires were distributed between 2002 and 2021 and are no longer available, the company noted in its letter to doctors. Some patients will need to have the devices replaced, though physicians should weigh the risks of the removal procedure.",
      "In a separate notice, the FDA said Boston Scientific recently updated instructions for implanting its Watchman device, which closes a portion of the heart's left atrium to reduce the risk of stroke.",
      "In a letter to physicians, the company noted that there is an increased risk of blockages in the bloodstream depending on the level of anesthesia for patients undergoing the initial implantation procedure.

      "BELEM, Brazil -- When U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 50% on Brazilian exports in July, acai producer Ailson Ferreira Moreira felt immediately concerned.",
      "After all, who was going to eat all of that Amazon berry, globally famous as a delicious, refreshing and nutritious superfood, if American consumers suddenly could no longer afford it?",
      "As the main importer of the Brazilian berry, prices of acai smoothies and bowls look certain to go up in the United States.",
      "\u201cThe acai that\u2019s all produced here ... If only people here eat it, it\u2019s going to be a lot of acai, right?\u201d Moreira told The Associated Press outside of Belem, an Amazon city of 1.4 million residents that will host this year's U.N. climate summit COP30 climate summit in November. \u201cIf there\u2019s too much acai here, people won\u2019t be able to eat it all and the price will drop.\u201d",
      "A single full crate of acai sells for around $50 at local markets in Brazil, a price that is now expected to plummet. The U.S. is by far the largest acai importer of a total Brazilian output currently estimated at about 70,000 tons per year.",
      "The most vulnerable acai producers in the northern state of Para say they have already been hit by tariffs imposed by the U.S. government, as a surplus of the berry without a clear destination starts to mount only days after the new economic scenario unfolded.",
      "More powerful exporters, such as Sao Paulo-state based company Acai Tropicalia Mix, are also feeling the impact.",
      "One of its owners, Rog\u00e9rio de Carvalho, told the AP that last year he exported to the U.S. about 270 tons of acai cream \u2014 an industrialized version of the berry \u2014 ready for consumption. As tariffs started to loom, he said, American importers steered away and clients suspended negotiations. Until the end of July, de Carvalho estimates that his company sold 27 tons to the U.S.",
      "\u201cThat's 1.5 million Brazilian reais ($280,000) that we lost,\u201d the businessman said. \u201cWe are confident there will be a deal between the two countries to allow not only our clients to return, but also getting some new ones.\u201d",

      "The harvesting of acai is a physically demanding job that requires workers to climb tall trees with minimal safety equipment, and then sliding down branches full of berries to fill baskets and then place them carefully in crates. Analysts say its producers also help protect the rainforest from illegal loggers, miners and cattle ranchers.",
      "The night markets of Belem, such as the Ver-o-Peso acai market, are a hub of activity where the freshly harvested berries are brought in by boat and prepared for sale.",
      "The Brazilian Association of Fruit and Derivative Producers and Exporters estimates there was an explosive growth of acai exports from Para state, from less than one ton in 1999 to more than 61,000 tons in 2023. Another explosive rise was expected for this year, before the tariffs.",

      "At a speech during a bankers' conference in Colorado on Saturday, Bowman said that \u201cthe latest labor market data reinforce my view\u201d that the Fed should cut interest rates three times this year. The Fed has only three meetings left on the schedule in 2025.",
      "The jobs report that arrived last week, only a couple of days after the Fed voted on interest rates, showed that employers hired far fewer workers last month than economists expected. It also said that hiring in prior months was much lower than initially thought.",
      "On inflation, meanwhile, Bowman said she is getting more confident that Trump's tariffs \u201cwill not present a persistent shock to inflation\u201d and sees it moving closer to the Fed's 2% target.

      "NEW YORK -- Debra Taylor has had a busy year or so: She's going through a divorce while in the process of retiring \u2014 and she's moving to Portugal from Southern California with one of her daughters.",
      "After deciding her next home would be outside the U.S., she narrowed down her choices based on tax burdens (Spain was out with its wealth taxes), climate (no Costa Rica, too hot) and ease of travel within Europe, one of her favorite parts of the world. She then toured Portugal with a relocation company, Expatsi, and found her new home, Aveiro. It's a striking city on the country's west coast with lovely canals that earned it the nickname the Venice of Portugal.",
      "It's all logistics from there. Taylor signed a year lease on an apartment (a requirement for moving forward), hired the company Viv Europe to navigate bureaucracies and paperwork, signed up for the necessary FBI background check and has an appointment in late September to move ahead with visas.",
      "Her youngest child gave her the idea to leave the country.",
      "\u201cAfter our current president was elected, my 18-year-old transgender daughter came to me and said, \u2018I want to get out of this country ASAP,\u2019\u201d Taylor recalled. \u201cThat was just fine with me.\u201d",
      "Her oldest daughter, who's 20, will stay in the U.S. to complete college.",
      "\u201cNone of this means I have to live there forever,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI\u2019ll use this as my jumping-off point to do more deeper dives, explore the rest of the region. I want to buy a place, but I\u2019m not going to do that until I\u2019m living there and spend more time in different communities.\u201d",
      "According to aging and relocation experts, Taylor has made the right decisions.",
      "The number of people who relocate upon retirement fluctuates, based on such factors as politics, home affordability and cost-of-living rates. While older adults are less likely to move than younger populations, more than 3 million people age 65 and older relocated within the U.S. in the five years before the coronavirus pandemic, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "As for moving abroad, U.S. politics is now the No. 1 reason cited by people who use Expatsi, the company's co-founder Jen Barnett said.",
      "\u201cThe one downside is that a lot of countries retirees are interested in don\u2019t want retirees, and that is to say wealthy, English-speaking countries, because they want laborers,\u201d Barnett said.",
      "While most U.S. retirees stay put in existing homes and locales, those who want to age in place face mounting challenges, said AARP Vice President Rodney Harrell, who focuses on housing and livable communities.",
      "Challenges include rising rents or mortgages, costs for home modifications, and a lack of community support services like adequate health care, reliable utilities and safe environments.",
      "\u201cOne of the biggest challenges that we have is making sure that we take the future us into account, and not just look at our needs today,\" Harrell said. \u201cAre we driving today? Is our income where it is? Is our spouse and myself healthy right now? How able are we to walk around and use steps, etc.? Things can change.\u201d",
      "All of the above is crucial as the U.S. heads into a gray bubble.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have more people over 65 than under 18 by 2034. For the first time in U.S. history, we have more older adults than children,\u201d Harrell said.",

      "If being close to children and grandchildren is high on the list, set clear expectations about how involved you want to be in such things as child care, said retirement transition planner Elizabeth Zelinka Parsons.

How long is the drive to the grandkids? That exercise surfaces climate preferences, social networks, volunteer hobbies and healthcare priorities long before we argue over property tax millage rates.\u201d",

      "HONOLULU -- Commercial fishing that recently resumed in a vast protected area of the Pacific Ocean must halt once again, after a judge in Hawaii sided this week with environmentalists challenging a Trump administration rollback of federal ocean protections.",
      "The remote Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument is home to turtles, marine mammals and seabirds, which environmental groups say will get snagged by longline fishing, an industrial method involving baited hooks from lines 60 miles (about 100 kilometers) or longer.",
      "President Donald Trump's executive order to allow this and other types of commercial fishing in part of the monument changed regulations without providing a process for public comment and rulemaking and stripped core protections from the monument, the groups argued in a lawsuit.",
      "U.S. District Judge Micah W. J. Smith granted a motion by the environmentalists on Friday. The ruling means boats catching fish for sale will need to immediately cease fishing in waters between 50 and 200 nautical miles (93 kilometers to 370 kilometers) around Johnston Atoll, Jarvis Island and Wake Island, said Earthjustice, an environmental law organization representing the plaintiffs.",
      "U.S. Justice Department attorneys representing the government did not immediately return an email message seeking comment on Saturday.",
      "Trump has said the U.S. should be \u201cthe world\u2019s dominant seafood leader,\u201d and on the same day of his April executive order, he issued another one seeking to boost commercial fishing by peeling back regulations and opening up harvesting in previously protected areas.",
      "President George W. Bush created the marine monument in 2009. It consists of about 500,000 square miles (1.3 million square kilometers) in the remote central Pacific Ocean southwest of Hawaii. President Barack Obama expanded it in 2014.",

      "Government attorneys say the fisheries service\u2019s letter merely notified commercial fishers of a change that had already taken place through Trump\u2019s authority to remove the prohibition on commercial fishing in certain areas.",
      "Earthjustice challenged that letter, and by granting the motion in their favor, the federal judge found the government had chosen not to defend its letter on the merits and forfeited that argument. Smith also ruled against the government's other defenses, that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the letter and that the court lacked jurisdiction over the matter.",
      "David Henkin, an Earthjustice attorney, said Smith's ruling requires the government to go through a process to determine what kind of fishing, and under what conditions, can happen in monument waters in a way that wouldn't destroy the area.",
      "Members of Hawaii\u2019s longline fishing industry say they have made numerous gear adjustments and changes over the years, such as circle hooks, to avoid that.",
      "The lawsuit says allowing commercial fishing in the monument expansion would also harm the \u201ccultural, spiritual, religious, subsistence, educational, recreational, and aesthetic interests\u201d of a group of Native Hawaiian plaintiffs who are connected genealogically to the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific.",

      "Global financial markets have taken President Donald Trump's tariff adjustments in stride, with Asian and European shares and U.S. futures mostly higher",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his monthslong tariff threats has begun to create visible damage for the U.S. economy.",
      "Just after midnight, goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union became subject to tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the EU, Japan and South Korea are taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh are taxed at 20%. Trump also expects the EU, Japan and South Korea to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S.",
      "\u201cI think the growth is going to be unprecedented,\u201d Trump said Wednesday afternoon. He added that the U.S. was \u201ctaking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs,\u201d but he couldn't provide a specific figure for revenues because \u201cwe don\u2019t even know what the final number is\u201d regarding tariff rates.",
      "Despite the uncertainty, the Trump White House is confident that the onset of his broad tariffs will provide clarity about the path of the world's largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the Republican administration believes they can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power.",
      "But so far, there are signs of self-inflicted wounds to America as companies and consumers alike brace for the impact of new taxes. What the data has shown is a U.S. economy that changed in April with Trump\u2019s initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday.",
      "Economic reports show that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline after April, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy.",
      "\u201cA less productive economy requires fewer workers,\u201d Silvia said in an analysis note. \u201cBut there is more, the higher tariff prices lower workers' real wages. The economy has become less productive, and firms cannot pay the same real wages as before. Actions have consequences.\u201d",
      "Even then, the ultimate transformations of the tariffs are unknown and could play out over months, if not years. Many economists say the risk is that the American economy is steadily eroded rather than collapsing instantly.",
      "\u201cWe all want it to be made for television where it\u2019s this explosion \u2014 it\u2019s not like that,\u201d said Brad Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine sand in the gears and slow things down.\u201d",
      "Trump has promoted the tariffs as a way to reduce the persistent trade deficit. But importers sought to avoid the taxes by importing more goods before the taxes went into effect. As a result, the $582.7 billion trade imbalance for the first half of the year was 38% higher than in 2024. Total construction spending has dropped 2.9% over the past year.",
      "The economic pain isn't confined to the U.S. Germany, which sends 10% of its exports to the U.S. market, saw industrial production sag 1.9% in June as Trump's earlier rounds of tariff hikes took hold. \u201cThe new tariffs will clearly weigh on economic growth,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, global chief of macro for ING bank.",
      "The lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Trump's tariffs, which have been variously rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and frantically renegotiated. The process has been so muddled that officials for key trade partners were unclear at the start of the week whether the tariffs would begin Thursday or Friday. The language of the July 31 order to delay the start of tariffs from Aug. 1 only said the higher tax rates would start in seven days.",
      "Trump on Wednesday announced additional 25% tariffs to be imposed on India for its buying of Russian oil, bringing its total import taxes to 50%.",
      "A top body of Indian exporters said Thursday the latest U.S. tariffs will impact nearly 55% of the country\u2019s outbound shipments to America and force exporters to lose their long-standing clients.",

      "Import taxes are still coming on pharmaceutical drugs, and Trump announced 100% tariffs on computer chips. That could leave the U.S. economy in a place of suspended animation as it awaits the impact.",
      "The president's use of a 1977 law to declare an economic emergency to impose the tariffs is also under challenge. The impending ruling from last week's hearing before a U.S. appeals court could cause Trump to find other legal justifications if judges say he exceeded his authority.",
      "Even people who worked with Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no sort of rationale for this other than the president wanting to raise tariffs based upon his whims, his opinions,\u201d Ryan told CNBC on Wednesday. \u201cI think choppy waters are ahead because I think they\u2019re going to have some legal challenges.\u201d",
      "Still, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S&P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months.",
      "Global financial markets took Thursday\u2019s tariff adjustments in stride, with Asian and European shares and U.S. futures mostly higher.",

      "The world\u2019s top automaker also makes vehicles in Mexico and Canada. Toyota\u2019s profit in the last quarter totaled 841 billion yen, or $5.7 billion, down from 1.33 trillion yen in the same period the year before. Its quarterly sales rose 3%.",
      "The status of those exports is unclear since Mexico and Canada are beneficiaries of the U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement, renegotiated from a 1990s pact during Trump's first term in office, that eliminated most tariffs and trade barriers between the three countries.",
      "Toyota Motor Corp.\u2019s April-June profit totaled 841 billion yen ($5.7 billion), down from 1.33 trillion yen in the same period of 2024. Quarterly sales rose 3% to 12 trillion yen ($82 billion).",
      "Toyota said the tariffs cost its quarterly operating profit 450 billion yen ($3 billion). Cost reduction efforts and the negative impact of an unfavorable exchange rate also hurt its bottom line.",
      "The company, which makes the Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models, forecast a 2.66 trillion yen ($18 billion) profit for the full fiscal year ending in March 2026, down from an earlier forecast for a 3.1 trillion yen ($21 billion) profit. Toyota earned nearly 4.8 trillion yen in the previous fiscal year.",
      "\u201cDespite a challenging external environment, we have continued to make comprehensive investments, as well as improvements such as increased unit sales, cost reductions and expanded value chain profits,\u201d Toyota said in a statement that outlined its efforts to minimize the impact of the tariffs.",

      "Health Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is vowing to \u201cfix\u201d the federal program for compensating Americans injured by vaccines, opening the door to sweeping changes for a system long targeted by anti-vaccine activists.",
      "Health experts and lawyers say updates are needed to help clear a backlog of cases in the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, created by Congress in 1986 as a no-fault payment system for presumed vaccine injuries.",
      "But they also worry Kennedy\u2019s changes will reflect his history as a leader in the anti-vaccine movement, which has alternately called for abolishing the program or expanding it to cover unproven injuries and illnesses that aren't connected to vaccines.",
      "Kennedy and other critics believe the program is \u201ctoo miserly in what it considers to be a vaccine injury,\u201d said Jason Schwartz, a public health expert at Yale University. \u201cThat\u2019s created great concern that he could expand what\u2019s included.\u201d",
      "Anti-vaccine groups have long suggested a link between vaccines and autism, despite scientific consensus that childhood vaccines don\u2019t cause the condition. Adding autism to the list of injuries covered by the plan \u201cwould dramatically increase the number of compensable cases, potentially bankrupting it,\" Schwartz said.",
      "Signed into law under President Ronald Reagan, the compensation program is designed to provide quick, efficient compensation to Americans who report known injuries associated with vaccines, such as rare allergic reactions. At the time of its creation, a number of vaccine-makers were exiting the business due to risks of class action lawsuits.",
      "In a recent social media post, Kennedy called the program \u201cbroken\u201d and accused federal lawyers and adjudicators who run it of \u201cinefficiency, favoritism and outright corruption.\u201d",
      "Kennedy didn\u2019t specify the changes he's seeking. But some of the people he\u2019s enlisted to help have a history of bringing vaccine injury cases.",
      "In June, the Department of Health and Human Services awarded a $150,000 contract to an Arizona law firm for \u201cexpertise\u201d in the program. The firm\u2019s Andrew Downing, an attorney specializing in vaccine injury cases, was listed in the HHS staff directory for a time.",
      "\u201cWe just brought a guy in this week who is going to be revolutionizing the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program,\u201d Kennedy told Tucker Carlson shortly after the award.",
      "Revamping the program would be the latest in a string of decisions that have upended U.S. vaccine policy, including this week's cancellation of research funding for vaccines using mRNA technology.",
      "Downing has had a leading role in lawsuits against Merck alleging injuries from its HPV vaccine, Gardasil, including a rare movement disorder.",
      "In a podcast last year for people with the condition, Downing lamented that the injury compensation program \u201chas taken a hard line\u201d against such cases, leading lawyers to file injury lawsuits in civil court. Approximately 70% of the Gardasil cases against Merck started as claims filed by Downing in the federal injury program, according to court records.",
      "A judge dismissed more than 120 of those cases, citing \u201ca paucity of evidence\" that Gardasil caused patients' problems.",
      "A spokesman for Kennedy declined to comment on Downing\u2019s hiring.",
      "Kennedy himself has been involved in the Gardasil litigation, as both an attorney and consultant.",
      "Before joining the government, Kennedy received payments for referring potential Gardasil clients to Wisner Baum, one of the law firms suing Merck. Following questions about the agreement during his confirmation hearings, Kennedy agreed to give up his stake in the deal and transfer any future fees to \u201ca nondependent, adult son,\" according to his financial disclosures.",
      "One of Kennedy's sons is an attorney at Wisner Baum.",

      "The cap on compensation remains $250,000 for injury or death, the same as in 1986. Similarly, the program still has eight adjudicators, known as special masters, to review all cases before the government. On average, the process takes two to three years.",
      "The fund has paid out $5.4 billion, compensating about 40% of all people who filed claims.",
      "The U.S. has an \u201cethical obligation\u201d to promptly pay those harmed by government-recommended vaccines, says Dorit Reiss, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law.",
      "\u201cPlus, I think it increases trust in the vaccination program if you have quick, generous compensation,\u201d Reiss said.",
      "As health secretary, Kennedy has broad powers to reshape the program.",
      "One approach could be adding new diseases and illnesses to the government table of payable injuries.",
      "In the early 2000s, the program ruled against more than 5,000 claims from families who said vaccines led to their children\u2019s autism, citing hundreds of scientific studies discrediting the link.",
      "Critics of Kennedy say he could claim that he has new evidence of harm \u2014 perhaps from a large autism study he's commissioned \u2014 and add the condition to the program.",
      "In response, the federal government might have to increase taxes on vaccines to replenish the compensation fund, which would make the shots more expensive and less accessible.",
      "\u201cThen you will start to watch the vaccine program infrastructure in this country disintegrate until someone steps in,\u201d Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine researcher at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia who has clashed with Kennedy for years.",
      "A recent Senate hearing titled \u201cVoice of the Vaccine Injured\u201d appeared to make the case for expanding the program. Witnesses included two representatives from Children\u2019s Health Defense, the nonprofit group that Kennedy previously chaired and has repeatedly sued the government over vaccines.",
      "The group\u2019s chief science officer, Brian Hooker, told lawmakers he tried unsuccessfully for 16 years trying to get compensation for his son\u2019s autism, which he attributes to the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine.",
      "Another approach would involve removing certain vaccines from the program, making it easier to bring lawsuits against vaccine-makers. Under current law, people claiming injuries from vaccines covered by the program must first pursue a compensation claim before they can sue.",
      "In cases where the science doesn\u2019t support a connection to vaccines, lawyers might be more successful before a jury.",
      "\u201cJury trials take advantage of the fact that most jurors don\u2019t know anything about science or medicine,\u201d Offit said. \u201cThey are not going to be as easily moved by the data.\u201d",
      "Still, attorneys who bring cases before the compensation program say the process has become more burdensome and adversarial over the years.",
      "Even small changes could improve things. For instance, the statute of limitations for claims could be extended beyond the current three years, which lawyers say cuts off many potential clients.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hoping there will be changes put in place that make the program easier for petitioners to navigate\u201d said Leah Durant, a vaccine injury attorney.",

      "An increase in the tax on university endowments is creating financial challenges for the wealthiest U.S. colleges",
      "A big increase in the tax on university endowments is adding to financial uncertainty for the wealthiest colleges in the U.S., leading several already to lay off staff or implement hiring freezes.",
      "Spending more endowment money on taxes could also lead colleges to reduce financial aid, cutting off access to elite institutions for lower-income students, colleges and industry experts have warned. President Donald Trump signed the tax increase into law last month as part of his signature spending bill.",
      "The new tax rates take effect in 2026, but colleges such as Harvard, Yale and Stanford already are citing the tax as one of many reasons for making cuts across their universities. Each will be on the hook to pay hundreds of millions more in taxes, while also navigating reductions in research grants and other threats to funding by the Trump administration.",
      "A tax on college endowments was introduced during Trump's first administration, collecting 1.4% of wealthy universities' investment earnings. The law signed by Trump last month creates a new tiered system that taxes the richest schools at the highest rates.",
      "The new tax will charge an 8% rate at schools with $2 million or more in assets for each enrolled student. Schools with $750,000 to $2 million will be charged 4%, and schools with $500,000 to $750,000 will continue to be charged the 1.4% rate.",
      "The tax applies only to private colleges and universities with at least 3,000 students, up from the previous cutoff of 500 students.",
      "\u201cThe tax now will really solely apply to private research universities,\u201d said Steven Bloom, assistant vice president of government relations for the American Council on Education. \u201cIt\u2019s going to mean that these schools are going to have to spend more money under the tax, taking it away from what they primarily use their endowment assets for \u2014 financial aid.\u201d",
      "The law will increase the endowment tax for about a dozen universities, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the National Association of College and University Business Officers.",
      "Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Princeton and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are expected to pay the 8% rate next year. The schools facing the 4% rate include Notre Dame, Dartmouth College, Rice University, University of Pennsylvania, Washington University in St. Louis and Vanderbilt University.",
      "Some universities are on the edge of the law's parameters. Both Duke and Emory, for instance, were shy of the $750,000-per-student endowment threshold based on last fiscal year.",
      "Endowments are made up of donations to the college, which are invested to maintain the money over time. Colleges often spend about 5% of their investment earnings every year to put toward their budgets. Much of it goes toward scholarships for students, along with costs such as research or endowed faculty positions.",
      "Despite the colleges' wealth, the tax will drastically impact their budgets, said Phillip Levine, an economist and professor at Wellesley College.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re looking for savings wherever possible,\u201d Levine said, which could impact financial aid. \u201cOne of the most important things they do with their endowment is lower the cost of education for lower- and middle-income students. The institutions paying the highest tax are also the ones charging these students the least amount of money to attend.\u201d",

In early July, he began notifying countries that their exports would be subject to higher tariffs on Aug. 1 unless they reached trade deals. A week ago, he pushed the start date to Thursday.",

      "President Donald Trump's new tariff rates on U.S. imports from dozens of countries have taken effect, the latest chapter in his effort to reshape global trade",
      "BANGKOK -- President Donald Trump\u2019s new tariff rates on U.S. imports from dozens of countries took effect Thursday, the latest chapter in the saga of Trump\u2019s reshaping of global trade. But many questions remain.",
      "Trump has threatened tariffs of up to 200% on imports of pharmaceuticals and has ordered a 100% import tax on computer chips. Most U.S. imports of copper, steel and aluminum are subject to a 50% tariff.",
      "There\u2019s still no agreement on what tariffs might apply to products shipped from China. India has no deal yet and faces a potential 50% tariff as Trump pressures it to stop buying oil from Russia.",
      "Recent data shows uncertainty is clouding the outlook for exporters around the world as a rush to beat the tariffs during a pause for negotiation tapers off. Companies are reporting billions of dollars in higher costs or losses due to the higher import duties.",
      "Global financial markets took Thursday's tariff adjustments in stride, with Asian shares and U.S. futures mostly higher.",
      "Here's where things stand in what has proven to be a fast-changing policy landscape.",
      "The tariffs announced on Aug. 1 apply to 66 countries, Taiwan and the Falkland Islands. They are a revised version of what Trump called \" reciprocal tariffs,\" announced on April 2: import taxes of up to 50% on goods from countries that have a trade surplus with the United States, along with 10% \u201cbaseline\u2019\u2019 taxes on almost everyone else. That move triggered sell-offs in financial markets and Trump backtracked to allow time for trade talks.",
      "The president has bypassed Congress, which has authority over taxes, by invoking a 1977 law to declare the trade deficit a national emergency. That's being challenged in court, but the revised tariffs still took effect.",
      "To keep their access to the huge American market, major trading partners have struck deals with Trump. The United Kingdom agreed to 10% tariffs and the European Union, South Korea and Japan accepted U.S. tariffs of 15%. Those are much higher than the low single-digit rates they paid last year, but down from the 30% Trump had ordered for the EU and the 25% he ordered for Japan.",
      "Countries in Africa and Asia are mostly facing lower rates than the ones Trump decreed in April. Thailand, Pakistan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines cut deals with Trump, settling for rates of around 20%.",
      "Indonesia views its 19% tariff deal as a leg up against exporters in other countries that will have to pay slightly more, said Fithra Faisal Hastiadi, a spokesperson in the Indonesian president's office.",
      "\u201cWe were competing against Vietnam, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and China ... and they are all subject to higher reciprocal tariffs,\u201d Hastiadi said. \u201cWe believe we will stay competitive.\u201d",
      "Trump has yet to announce whether he will extend an Aug. 12 deadline for reaching a trade agreement with China that would forestall earlier threats of tariffs of up to 245%.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the president is deciding about another 90-day delay to allow time to work out details of an agreement setting tariffs on most products at 50%, including extra import duties related to illicit trade in fentanyl.",
      "Higher import taxes on small parcels from China have hurt smaller factories and layoffs have accelerated, leaving some 200 million workers reliant on \u201cflexible work\u201d \u2014 the gig economy \u2014 for their livelihoods, the government estimates.",
      "India also has no broad trade agreement with Trump. On Wednesday, Trump he signed an executive order placing an extra 25% tariff for its purchases of Russian oil, bringing combined U.S. tariffs to 50%. India has stood firm, saying it began importing oil from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict.",

      "Similar surveys show a deterioration in manufacturing conditions worldwide, as a boost from \u201cfront loading\u201d export orders to beat higher tariffs faded, S&P Global said. Similar measures for service industries have remained stronger, reflecting more domestic business activity. In Asia, that includes a rebound in tourism across the region.",
      "Corporate bottom lines are also taking a hit. Honda Motor said Wednesday that it estimates the cost from higher tariffs at about $3 billion. Toyota said its quarterly profit plunged 37% and the hit from tariffs was $3 billion.",

      "The Boar's Head deli meat plant at the heart of last year's deadly food poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months, company officials said.",
      "But recent inspections at Boar\u2019s Head sites in three states documented sanitation problems similar to those that led to the listeria contamination that killed 10 people and sickened dozens.",
      "The Jarratt, Virginia, plant was shut down in September when U.S. Agriculture Department officials suspended operations and withdrew the federal marks of inspection required to operate, saying the company \u201cfailed to maintain sanitary conditions.\u201d Boar\u2019s Head permanently stopped making liverwurst and recalled more than 7 million pounds of deli products.",
      "USDA officials this week said they had \u201cthoroughly reviewed\u201d the plant and lifted the forced suspension on July 18.",
      "\u201cThe facility is in full compliance of the guidelines and protocols set for the safe handling and production of food and the serious issues that led to suspension have been fully rectified,\u201d officials with the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in an email Wednesday.",
      "And yet, documents obtained by The Associated Press through a freedom of information request show that Boar\u2019s Head plants in Arkansas, Indiana and elsewhere in Virginia were flagged for the same kinds of sanitation problems that led to the outbreak, with the most recent report in June.",
      "In the past seven months, government inspectors reported problems that include instances of meat and fat residue left on equipment and walls, drains blocked with meat products, beaded condensation on ceilings and floors, overflowing trash cans, and staff who didn\u2019t wear protective hairnets and plastic aprons \u2014 or wash their hands.",
      "The records, which included USDA noncompliance reports logged by inspectors from Jan. 1 through July 23, raise new questions about the company's promises to address systemic problems and about federal oversight of listeria contamination in plants that make ready-to-eat foods.",
      "\u201cIf there is evidence that food safety problems are continuing, the government needs to make sure the company fixes them,\u201d said Sandra Eskin, a former USDA official who now heads STOP Foodborne Illness, a consumer group focused on food safety.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins last month announced plans to bolster efforts that combat foodborne germs, including listeria.",
      "Officials at Boar's Head, the 120-year-old company based in Sarasota, Florida, have posted job openings for two dozen positions, including a food safety quality analyst, at the Jarratt site.",
      "The company convened a panel of expert advisers last fall and hired a chief food safety officer in May. The advisers include Frank Yiannas, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration official, and Mindy Brashears, President Donald Trump's nominee for USDA's undersecretary for food safety.",
      "Boar's Head last year said they \u201cregret and deeply apologize\" for the contamination and that \u201ccomprehensive measures are being implemented to prevent such an incident from ever happening again.\u201d",
      "But company officials refused to discuss the problems found this year. They canceled a scheduled AP interview with Natalie Dyenson, the new food safety officer. And they declined to allow Yiannas to detail the investigation he led into the contamination's cause.",
      "Brashears, who now directs a food safety center at Texas Tech University, did not respond to requests for comment about the Boar's Head problems. An automatic email reply said the USDA nominee was traveling out of the country until Aug. 25. She remains on the company's food safety board.",
      "\u201cBoar\u2019s Head has an unwavering commitment to food safety and quality. That commitment is reflected in recent enhancements to our practices and protocols\" described on the company's website, Boar's Head said in an emailed statement.",

    "story": [
      "The Environmental Protection Agency has terminated $7 billion in funding for solar programs approved under the Biden administration, including projects for nearly 1 million households in low-income communities",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday terminated a $7 billion grant program that was intended to help pay for residential solar projects for more than 900,000 lower-income U.S. households.",
      "It's the latest Trump administration move hindering the nation\u2019s shift to cleaner energy.",
      "The funding, part of Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s Solar for All program, was awarded to 60 recipients including states, tribes and regions for investments such as rooftop solar and community solar gardens.",
      "Solar, a renewable energy, is widely regarded as a way to introduce cleaner power onto the electrical grid and lower energy bills for American consumers.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement on social media that authority for the program was eliminated under the tax-and-spending bill signed last month by Republican President Donald Trump. The law eliminated the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund that was approved under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The fund set aside $20 billion in \u201cgreen bank\u201d money for community development projects to boost renewable energy, and an additional $7 billion for the solar program.",
      "\u201cThe bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,\u2033 Zeldin said. \u201cToday, the Trump EPA is announcing that we are ending Solar for All for good, saving US taxpayers ANOTHER $7 BILLION!\u201d",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, who introduced the Solar for All program to slash electric bills for working families, called Zeldin\u2019s action illegal.",
      "\u201cSolar for All means lower utility bills, many thousands of good-paying jobs and real action to address the existential threat of climate change,\u2033 Sanders said in a statement. \u201dAt a time when working families are getting crushed by skyrocketing energy costs and the planet is literally burning, sabotaging this program isn\u2019t just wrong \u2014 it\u2019s absolutely insane. We will fight back to preserve this enormously important program.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has already targeted the \u201cgreen bank\u201d funds, first freezing the grants, then terminating the agreements altogether. Zeldin called them \u201ca clear cut case of waste and abuse\u201d and a \u201cgold bar\u201d scheme earlier this year.",
      "The EPA has argued that the tax and policy bill law repealed the green bank and allows the agency to rescind the money it has already obligated. The recipients of that money disagree. They say the bulk of the money had already been disbursed and isn\u2019t affected by the law.",
      "Grant recipients have filed lawsuits challenging the administration\u2019s actions, and a judge ruled in April the EPA cannot freeze the contracts.",

      "U.S. imports from China are subject to tariffs of at least 30%, with some products facing much higher import duties. Trump earlier had ordered still higher rates of up to 245%, and Beijing responded in kind, but the two sides agreed to pause those to allow time for trade talks. It's unclear if the truce will be extended beyond an Aug. 12 deadline following the latest round of negotiations last week in Sweden.",
      "The Trump administration has also raised tariffs on imports from countries other than China that it suspects of being \u201ctransshipped\" via other countries. For example, the import duty on Vietnam's exports to the U.S. now stands at 20%. For transshipped goods, it's 40%.",

      "NEW YORK -- Millions of Americans saving for retirement through 401(k) accounts could have the option of putting their money in higher-risk private equity and cryptocurrency investments, according to an executive order signed Thursday by President Donald Trump that could give those financial players long-sought access to a pool of funds worth trillions.",
      "There is no immediate change in how people invest part of their work earnings. Federal agencies would need to rewrite rules and regulations to allow the expanded choices, and that would take months or more to complete.

      "Although the top players on both teams didn't play, the game was still a milestone to the 51-year-old Schottenheimer, a well-traveled career assistant with stops including USC, the San Diego Chargers and two stints with the St. Louis Rams. He spent the past two years as Dallas\u2019 offensive coordinator before becoming Jerry Jones\u2019 surprising choice to replace Mike McCarthy last January.",

      "Browns coach Kevin Stefanski hasn't decided if Shedeur Sanders will work with the first-team offense after his impressive NFL debut",
      "CLEVELAND -- Less than 24 hours after Shedeur Sanders' impressive NFL debut, Browns coach Kevin Stefanski still wasn't ready to answer the question most on the mind of Cleveland fans.",
      "Will Sanders start working with the first-team offense leading into next Saturday's second preseason game at Philadelphia?",
      "\u201cWe need to get through the next couple of days from an injury standpoint and see where everybody is,\u201d Stefanski said Saturday. \u201cI\u2019m really focused on all of our quarterbacks\u2019 development and every single one of these reps last night, how important they are. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m focused on more than anything.\"",
      "Sanders played nearly three quarters and had 45 snaps in Friday night's 30-10 victory over the Carolina Panthers. He directed three touchdown drives in 10 series (including a kneel down at the end of the first half) and completed 14 of 23 passes for 138 yards and two TD passes.",
      "The stat that pleased everyone the most though is that the Browns didn't have a turnover.",
      "Sanders is listed as the fourth-string QB and has not seen any snaps with the first string during the first three weeks of practices. He got the start and received extended playing time in the preseason opener because of Kenny Pickett and Dillon Gabriel sidelined with hamstring injuries. Joe Flacco got most of the work during last Wednesday's joint workouts.",
      "However, Sanders made a strong case in showing he should get opportunities to see how he fares against starters.",
      "The Browns\u2019 next practice is Monday at their team facility. They travel to Philadelphia on Tuesday before joint workouts with the Eagles on Wednesday and Thursday.",
      "For his part, Sanders continues to stay patient with the process the Browns have set out for his development. It is the same mentality he has had since dropping to the fifth round and the 144th overall selection in April's draft.",
      "\u201cI just don\u2019t think that deep into everything because there\u2019s nothing you\u2019re going to be able to control.,\u201d Sanders said when asked if he is being given a fair chance in the Browns four-way quarterback competition. \u201cThe most you can do is when you get your opportunity, when your number is called, perform, at least do the bare minimum and win the game. That\u2019s what I feel like we did today and definitely things I\u2019m able to grow off of.\u201d",
      "In addition to seeing how he would fare in the red zone and a variety of third down scenarios, the coaching staff also got to see how Sanders would fare on a couple of series where the Browns started inside their 10 yard line.",

We kind of did it all last night, including a jet sweep to Gage (Larvadain) for the touchdown,\" Stefanski said. \"We want to win because they\u2019re keeping score but you also want to vary your run types, vary your pass types so you\u2019re learning more about each one of your players.\u201d",
      "According to the NFL's Next Gen stats, Sanders was pressured on 12 of his 27 drop-backs. He was 5 of 9 for 81 yards, including a 12-yard touchdown to Kaden Davis to put the Browns up 14-7 in the second quarter.",

      "GLENDALE, Ariz. -- Quarterback Patrick Mahomes spent some time before Saturday's preseason game running up and down the Kansas City Chiefs sideline, yelling, jumping and psyching himself up for his first game action since last season's Super Bowl.",
      "He was ready \u2014 for all 48 seconds of it.",
      "Mahomes, a three-time Super Bowl champ entering his ninth season, took advantage of a short field after the Arizona Cardinals fumbled the opening kickoff, hitting Jason Brownlee for a 1-yard touchdown and an early 7-0 lead less than one minute into the game.",
      "Arizona rallied for a 20-17 win over Kansas City in the preseason opener for both teams.",
      "Mahomes said coach Andy Reid told him before the game that he'd play just one series, but it was an even shorter night than he imagined.",
      "\u201cOne series turned into one throw,\u201d Mahomes said, grinning.",
      "The TD pass was Mahomes' only completion of the game, ending a brief, effective outing. Backup Gardner Minshew took over on the next series and ran for a 2-yard touchdown in the second quarter. Harrison Butker made a 58-yard field goal.",
      "Mahomes' final line: 1-for-1 passing for 1 yard and one touchdown. The three-time defending AFC champions were playing for the first time since losing last season's Super Bowl 40-22 to the Philadelphia Eagles.",
      "\u201cThere were some good things,\u201d Reid said. \u201cI thought the (starters) played well when they were in, they were sharp. After that, we were too sloppy. Too many penalties, going backward.\u201d",
      "While Kansas City got off to a good start, Arizona did not.",
      "The Cardinals fumbled their first two kickoff returns, though they recovered the second one. Kyler Murray \u2014 playing in his first preseason game since 2021 \u2014 was intercepted on the offense's opening drive on a pass intended for second-year receiver Marvin Harrison Jr.",
      "Murray's second drive was hindered when tight end Tip Reiman was called for a 15-yard penalty for unnecessary roughness. The miscue was part of the reason the Cardinals had to settle for a 33-yard field goal by Chad Ryland.",
      "Murray chose to remain positive about the outing, saying that even with the mistakes, it was good to get on the field and play at game speed.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t replicate it in practice, moving around with the speed that you\u2019re moving, going left to right, lateral, bodies moving. I had fun. I had a lot of fun out there,\u201d Murray said.",

      "Tommy Fleetwood takes a one-shot lead into the final round of the FedEx St. Jude Championship as he goes for his first PGA Tour title",
      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Tommy Fleetwood had a three-shot swing go against him early and a two-shot swing cost him on the final hole Saturday in the FedEx St. Jude Championship. He did enough right in between for a 1-under 69 and a one-shot lead over Justin Rose as he goes for his first PGA Tour title.",
      "If that wasn't enough, Scottie Scheffler had a huge presence only two shots back.",
      "Still, those two holes were a reminder to Fleetwood that 18 holes can feel a long way off at the TPC Southwind. There figures to be plenty of pressure at the top and scattered among the rest of the field trying to advance in the FedEx Cup playoffs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just another opportunity for me to go out and try and have the best round of golf I can, enjoy being in that position,\u201d Fleetwood said. \u201cThe more I put myself there, the more chance there is of it happening, and just go out and keep learning from every experience. But tomorrow might be my day, it might not, but being there is the most important thing, and I\u2019ll continue to try and do that.\u201d",
      "Fleetwood, who has won plenty on big stages around the world but not on the PGA Tour, started the third round with a three-shot lead over Rose, who had to finish his storm-delayed second round in the morning.",
      "On the par-5 third, Fleetwood's second shot came up short and into the water. He took his penalty drop, and then hit wedge over the green into a bunker. Fleetwood said he noticed his golf ball move ever so slightly on his swing with the wedge.",
      "Rules officials studied the video and determined that if it moved \u2014 they couldn't determine if it did because it was so slight \u2014 Fleetwood didn't cause it and no penalty was issued. He made double bogey, and Rose ran off three straight birdies to take the lead.",
      "\u201cThe third was just such a kerfuffle and such a mess,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was not that bad of a second shot, but it\u2019s obviously a terrible shot if it\u2019s in the water. From there, drop, sort of felt like the ball had moved when I hit it, thinned it over the back, just made a double for nothing really.\u201d",
      "Fleetwood rebounded to not only regain the lead but build it back to three shots. But on the 18th hole, he drove into the rough, couldn't reach the green and made bogey to finish 54 holes at 14-under 196.",
      "Rose hit out of the rough to 5 feet from the front pin for his first birdie since the seventh hole. That gave him a 67 and put him in the final group with his Ryder Cup teammate.",
      "Scheffler, meanwhile, put together six birdies in his round of 65 and was two shots behind. He made his lone bogey on No. 10, and Scheffler avoided another when his bunker shot on No. 12 hit a sprinkler that kept it from going on the green. He holed a 25-foot putt from the fringe.",

      "For Fleetwood, it's about winning.",
      "He is No. 15 in the world. He has starred in two Ryder Cups for Europe and won against strong fields. But the lack of a PGA Tour title is becoming a burden. He had a one-shot lead on the final hole at the Travelers Championship in June until taking three putts from just off the green and losing to Keegan Bradley's birdie.",
      "His hope in June was to get another chance sooner rather than later, and his next one is Sunday at the TPC Southwind.",

      "But when his Jacksonville Jaguars teammates started screaming and scrambling, Little knew the outcome: a 70-yard field goal that he initially thought set an NFL record.",

Little leaned forward a little and then raised an arm when \u201cLogan's eyes got really big\u201d and it was obviously official.",
      "Cooke pushed Little to start the party, and then rookie sensation Travis Hunter greeted Little on the field with a midair body-bump.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re necessarily going to be kicking 70-yarders in the first quarter or anything like that,\u201d Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence said. \u201cBut unbelievable to see him make that. That\u2019s huge, especially in those two-minute drills. If you can get him near the 50, you got a really good shot. Having a guy like that is a weapon.\u201d",
      "Baltimore\u2019s Justin Tucker holds the NFL mark, having made a 66-yarder at Detroit in 2021. Eight kickers have attempted 70-yarders in the regular season, and all of them failed.",

      "A law enforcement official tells The Associated Press that a Georgia man who opened fire Friday on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta had blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal",
      "ATLANTA -- A Georgia man who opened fire on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters, shooting dozens of rounds into the sprawling complex and killing a police officer, had blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press on Saturday.",
      "The 30-year-old shooter also tried to get into the CDC\u2019s headquarters in Atlanta but was stopped by guards before driving to a pharmacy across the street and opening fire late Friday afternoon, the official said. He was armed with five guns, including at least one long gun, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the investigation.",
      "DeKalb County Police Officer David Rose was mortally wounded while responding.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., whose skepticism of vaccines has been a cornerstone of his career, voiced support for CDC employees Saturday. But some laid-off CDC employees said Kennedy shares responsibility for the violence and should resign.",
      "The Georgia Bureau of Investigation named Patrick Joseph White as the shooter, but authorities haven't said whether he was killed by police or killed himself.",
      "The suspect\u2019s father contacted police and identified his son as the possible shooter, the law enforcement official told AP. The father said his son had been upset over the death of the son\u2019s dog, and he had also become fixated on the COVID-19 vaccine, according to the official. The family lives in Kennesaw, Georgia, an Atlanta suburb about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of CDC headquarters.",
      "A voicemail left at a phone number listed publicly for White\u2019s family wasn\u2019t returned Saturday.",
      "The shooting left gaping bullet holes in windows across the CDC campus, where thousands work on critical disease research. Employees huddled under lockdown for hours while investigators gathered evidence. Staff was encouraged to work from home Monday or take leave.",
      "At least four CDC buildings were hit, Director Susan Monarez said on X.",
      "Sam Atkins, who lives in Stone Mountain, said outside the CVS pharmacy on Saturday that gun violence feels like \u201ca fact of life\u201d now. \u201cThis is an everyday thing that happens here in Georgia.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are deeply saddened by the tragic shooting at CDC\u2019s Atlanta campus that took the life of officer David Rose,\u201d Kennedy said Saturday. \u201cWe know how shaken our public health colleagues feel today. No one should face violence while working to protect the health of others.\u201d",
      "Some rejected the expressions of solidarity Kennedy made in a \u201cDear colleagues\u201d email, and called for his resignation.",
      "\u201cKennedy is directly responsible for the villainization of CDC\u2019s workforce through his continuous lies about science and vaccine safety, which have fueled a climate of hostility and mistrust,\u201d said Fired But Fighting, a group of laid-off employees opposing changes to the CDC by President Donald Trump's administration.",
      "Under Kennedy, CDC has laid off nearly 2,000 employees. Trump proposes cutting the agency\u2019s budget in half next year, moving some CDC functions into a new Administration for a Healthy America. Kennedy has a history as a leader in the anti-vaccine movement, but he reached new prominence by spreading distrust of COVID-19 vaccines. For example, he called it \u201ccriminal medical malpractice\u201d to give COVID-19 vaccines to children.",
      "Kennedy parlayed that attention into a presidential bid and endorsement of Trump, leading to Trump naming him secretary. Kennedy continues to undercut the scientific consensus for vaccines, ordering $500 million cut from vaccine development funding on Tuesday.",
      "Fired But Fighting also called for the resignation of Russell Vought, noting a video recorded before Trump appointed him Office of Management and Budget director with orders to dismantle much of the federal government.",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Amid rising electric bills, states are under pressure to insulate regular household and business ratepayers from the costs of feeding Big Tech's energy-hungry data centers.",
      "It's not clear that any state has a solution and the actual effect of data centers on electricity bills is difficult to pin down. Some critics question whether states have the spine to take a hard line against tech behemoths like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta.",
      "But more than a dozen states have begun taking steps as data centers drive a rapid build-out of power plants and transmission lines.",
      "That has meant pressuring the nation's biggest power grid operator to clamp down on price increases, studying the effect of data centers on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay a larger share of local transmission costs.",
      "Rising power bills are \u201csomething legislators have been hearing a lot about. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve been hearing a lot about. More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I\u2019ve ever seen before,\u201d said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens\u2019 Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. \u201cThere\u2019s a massive outcry.\u201d",
      "Some data centers could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans, and make huge factories look tiny by comparison. That's pushing policymakers to rethink a system that, historically, has spread transmission costs among classes of consumers that are proportional to electricity use.",
      "\u201cA lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,\u201d said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. \u201cI think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.\u201d",
      "A fix, Peskoe said, is a \u201ccan of worms\" that pits ratepayer classes against one another.",
      "Some officials downplay the role of data centers in pushing up electric bills.",
      "Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia\u2019s Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather.",
      "The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share.",
      "But growing evidence suggests that the electricity bills of some Americans are rising to subsidize the massive energy needs of Big Tech as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.",
      "Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren\u2019t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant.",
      "In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes \u2014 residential, commercial and industrial \u2014 are likely paying for data center power needs.",
      "Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% \u2014 or $9.3 billion \u2014 of last year's increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand.",
      "Last year, five governors led by Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro began pushing back against power prices set by the mid-Atlantic grid operator, PJM Interconnection, after that amount spiked nearly sevenfold. They warned of customers \u201cpaying billions more than is necessary.\u201d",

      "More than 70 million Americans have experienced the muggiest start to summer on record, with climate change increasing humidity in the Eastern U.S. An Associated Press analysis shows that parts of 20 states and Washington, D",
      "More than 70 million Americans sweated through the muggiest first two months of summer on record as climate change has noticeably dialed up the Eastern United States' humidity in recent decades, an Associated Press data analysis shows.",
      "And that meant uncomfortably warm and potentially dangerous nights in many cities the last several weeks, the National Weather Service said.",
      "Parts of 27 states and Washington, D.C., had a record amount of days that meteorologists call uncomfortable \u2014 with average daily dew points of 65 degrees Fahrenheit or higher \u2014 in June and July, according to data derived from the Copernicus Climate Service.",
      "And that's just the daily average. In much of the East, the mugginess kept rising to near tropical levels for a few humid hours. Philadelphia had 29 days, Washington had 27 days and Baltimore had 24 days where the highest dew point simmered to at least 75 degrees, which even the the weather service office in Tampa calls oppressive, according to weather service data.",
      "Dew point is a measure of moisture in the air expressed in degrees that many meteorologists call the most accurate way to describe humidity. The summer of 2025 so far has had dew points that average at least 6 degrees higher than the 1951-2020 normals in Washington, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Richmond, Columbus and St. Louis, the AP calculations show. The average June and July humidity for the entire country east of the Rockies rose to more than 66 degrees, higher than any year since measurements started in 1950.",
      "\u201cThis has been a very muggy summer. The humid heat has been way up,\u201d said Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at Climate Central.",
      "Twice this summer climate scientist and humidity expert Cameron Lee of Kent State University measured dew points of about 82 degrees at his home weather station in Ohio. That's off the various charts that the weather service uses to describe what dew points feel like.",
      "\u201cThere are parts of the United States that are experiencing not only greater average humidity, especially in the spring and summer, but also more extreme humid days,\u201d Lee said. He said super sticky days are now stretching out over more days and more land.",
      "High humidity doesn't allow the air to cool at night as much as it usually does, and the stickiness contributed to multiple nighttime temperature records from the Ohio Valley through the Mid-Atlantic and up and down coastal states, said Zack Taylor, forecast operations chief at the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center. Raleigh, Charlotte, Nashville, Virginia Beach, Va., and Wilmington, N.C., all reached records for the hottest overnight lows. New York City, Columbus, Atlanta, Richmond, Knoxville, Tennessee and Concord, New Hampshire came close, he said.",
      "\u201cWhat really impacts the body is that nighttime temperature,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cSo if there\u2019s no cooling at night or if there\u2019s a lack of cooling it doesn\u2019t allow your body to cool off and recover from what was probably a really hot afternoon. And so when you start seeing that over several days, that can really wear out the body, especially of course if you don\u2019t have access to cooling centers or air conditioning.\u201d",
      "An extra hot and rainy summer weather pattern is combining with climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, Woods Placky said.",
      "The area east of the Rockies has on average gained about 2.5 degrees in summer dew point since 1950, the AP analysis of Copernicus data shows. In the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and part of the 1990s, the eastern half of the country had an average dew point in the low 60s, what the weather service calls noticeable but OK. In four of the last six years that number has been near and even over the uncomfortable line of 65.",

      "These producers \"probably aren\u2019t large enough to get on the map for an exemption and quite probably wouldn\u2019t have the kind of excess capital and margins to be able to add investment at a large scale into the United States,\u201d Chorzempa said.",
      "The announcement came more than three months after Trump temporarily exempted most electronics from his administration\u2019s most onerous tariffs.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, a shortage of computer chips increased the price of autos and contributed to higher inflation. Chorzempa said chip tariffs could again raise prices by hundreds of dollars per vehicle if the semiconductors inside a car are not exempt.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a chip that allows you to open and close the window,\" Chorzempa said. \"There\u2019s a chip that is running the entertainment system. There is a chip that\u2019s kind of running all the electronics. There are chips, especially in EVs, that are doing power management, all that kind of stuff.\u201d",
      "Much of the investment into building U.S. chip factories began with the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act that President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022, providing more than $50 billion to support new computer chip plants, fund research and train workers for the industry.",
      "Trump has vocally opposed those financial incentives and taken a different approach, betting that the threat of dramatically higher chip costs would force most companies to open factories domestically, despite the risk that tariffs could squeeze corporate profits and push up prices for electronics.",

      "Hundreds of Harvard researchers have fallen victim to the freeze on funding by the Trump administration",
      "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Harvard University professor Alberto Ascherio's research is literally frozen.",
      "Collected from millions of U.S. soldiers over two decades using millions of dollars from taxpayers, the epidemiology and nutrition scientist has blood samples stored in liquid nitrogen freezers within the university\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.",
      "The samples are key to his award-winning research, which seeks a cure to multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases. But for months, Ascherio has been unable to work with the samples because he lost $7 million in federal research funding, a casualty of Harvard's fight with the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cIt's like we have been creating a state-of-the-art telescope to explore the universe, and now we don\u2019t have money to launch it,\u201d said Ascherio. \u201cWe built everything and now we are ready to use it to make a new discovery that could impact millions of people in the world and then, 'Poof. You're being cut off.'\u201d",
      "The loss of an estimated $2.6 billion in federal funding at Harvard has meant that some of the world's most prominent researchers are laying off young researchers. They are shelving years or even decades of research, into everything from opioid addiction to cancer.",
      "And despite Harvard's lawsuits against the administration, and settlement talks between the warring parties, researchers are confronting the fact that some of their work may never resume.",
      "The funding cuts are part of a monthslong battle that the Trump administration has waged against some the country's top universities including Columbia, Brown and Northwestern. The administration has taken a particularly aggressive stance against Harvard, freezing funding after the country's oldest university rejected a series of government demands issued by a federal antisemitism task force.",
      "The government had demanded sweeping changes at Harvard related to campus protests, academics and admissions \u2014 meant to address government accusations that the university had become a hotbed of liberalism and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment.",
      "Harvard responded by filing a federal lawsuit, accusing the Trump administration of waging a retaliation campaign against the university. In the lawsuit, it laid out reforms it had taken to address antisemitism but also vowed not to \u201csurrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.\u201d",
      "\u201cMake no mistake: Harvard rejects antisemitism and discrimination in all of its forms and is actively making structural reforms to eradicate antisemitism on campus,\" the university said in its legal complaint. \u201cBut rather than engage with Harvard regarding those ongoing efforts, the Government announced a sweeping freeze of funding for medical, scientific, technological, and other research that has nothing at all to do with antisemitism.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the demands were sent in April. It argues the government has wide discretion to cancel federal contracts for policy reasons.",
      "The funding cuts have left Harvard's research community in a state of shock, feeling as if they are being unfairly targeted in a fight has nothing to do with them. Some have been forced to shutter labs or scramble to find non-government funding to replace lost money.",
      "In May, Harvard announced that it would put up at least $250 million of its own money to continue research efforts, but university President Alan Garber warned of \u201cdifficult decisions and sacrifices\u201d ahead.",
      "Ascherio said the university was able to pull together funding to pay his researchers\u2019 salaries until next June. But he\u2019s still been left without resources needed to fund critical research tasks, like lab work. Even a year's delay can put his research back five years, he said.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s really devastating,\u201d agreed Rita Hamad, the director of the Social Policies for Health Equity Research Center at Harvard, who had three multiyear grants totaling $10 million canceled by the Trump administration. The grants funded research into the impact of school segregation on heart health, how pandemic-era policies in over 250 counties affected mental health, and the role of neighborhood factors in dementia.",
      "At the School of Public Health, where Hamad is based, 190 grants have been terminated, affecting roughly 130 scientists.",
      "\u201cJust thinking about all the knowledge that\u2019s not going to be gained or that is going to be actively lost,\" Hamad said. She expects significant layoffs on her team if the funding freeze continues for a few more months. \"It\u2019s all just a mixture of frustration and anger and sadness all the time, every day.\"",
      "John Quackenbush, a professor of computational biology and bioinformatics at the School of Public Health, has spent the past few months enduring cuts on multiple fronts.",
      "In April, a multimillion dollar grant was not renewed, jeopardizing a study into the role sex plays in disease. In May, he lost about $1.2 million in federal funding for in the coming year due to the Harvard freeze. Four departmental grants worth $24 million that funded training of doctoral students also were cancelled as part of the fight with the Trump administration, Quackenbush said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m in a position where I have to really think about, \u2018Can I revive this research?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cCan I restart these programs even if Harvard and the Trump administration reached some kind of settlement? If they do reach a settlement, how quickly can the funding be turned back on? Can it be turned back on?\u201d",
      "The researchers all agreed that the funding cuts have little or nothing to do with the university's fight against antisemitism. Some, however, argue changes at Harvard were long overdue and pressure from the Trump administration was necessary.",
      "Bertha Madras, a Harvard psychobiologist who lost funding to create a free, parent-focused training to prevent teen opioid overdose and drug use, said she\u2019s happy to see the culling of what she called \u201cpolitically motivated social science studies.\u201d",
      "Madras said pressure from the White House has catalyzed much-needed reform at the university, where several programs of study have \u201creally gone off the wall in terms of being shaped by orthodoxy that is not representative of the country as a whole.\u201d",
      "But Madras, who served on the President\u2019s Commission on Opioids during Trump\u2019s first term, said holding scientists\u2019 research funding hostage as a bargaining chip doesn\u2019t make sense.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if reform would have happened without the president of the United States pointing the bony finger at Harvard,\" she said. \u201cBut sacrificing science is problematic, and it\u2019s very worrisome because it is one of the major pillars of strength of the country.\u201d",
      "Quackenbush and other Harvard researchers argue the cuts are part of a larger attack on science by the Trump administration that puts the country's reputation as the global research leader at risk. Support for students and post-doctoral fellows has been slashed, visas for foreign scholars threatened, and new guidelines and funding cuts at the NIH will make it much more difficult to get federal funding in the future, they said. It also will be difficult to replace federal funding with money from the private sector.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all sort of moving toward this future in which this 80-year partnership between the government and the universities is going to be jeopardized,\u201d Quackenbush said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to face real challenges in continuing to lead the world in scientific excellence.\u201d",

In Florida's Polk County Schools, a district of more than 100,000 students, the school safety program received nearly 500 Gaggle alerts over four years, officers said in public Board of Education meetings. This led to 72 involuntary hospitalization cases under the Baker Act, a state law that allows authorities to require mental health evaluations for people against their will if they pose a risk to themselves or others.",

      "Roblox, the online gaming platform wildly popular with children and teenagers, is rolling out an open-source version of an artificial intelligence system it says can help preemptively detect predatory language in game chats.",
      "The move comes as the company faces lawsuits and criticism accusing it of not doing enough to protect children from predators. For instance, a lawsuit filed last month in Iowa alleges that a 13-year-old girl was introduced to an adult predator on Roblox, then kidnapped and trafficked across multiple states and raped. The suit, filed in Iowa District Court in Polk County, claims that Roblox's design features make children who use it \u201ceasy prey for pedophiles.\u201d",
      "Roblox says it strives to make its systems as safe as possible by default but notes that \u201cno system is perfect, and one of the biggest challenges in the industry is to detect critical harms like potential child endangerment.\u201d",
      "The AI system, called Sentinel, helps detect early signs of possible child endangerment, such as sexually exploitative language. Roblox says the system has led the company to submit 1,200 reports of potential attempts at child exploitation to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in the first half of 2025. The company is now in the process of open-sourcing it so other platforms can use it too.",
      "Preemptively detecting possible dangers to kids can be tricky for AI systems \u2014 and humans, too \u2014 because conversations can seem innocuous at first. Questions like \u201chow old are you?\u201d or \u201cwhere are you from?\u201d wouldn't necessarily raise red flags on their own, but when put in context over the course of a longer conversation, they can take on a different meaning.",
      "Roblox, which has more than 111 million monthly users, doesn't allow users to share videos or images in chats and tries to block any personal information such as phone numbers, though \u2014 as with most moderation rules \u2014 people constantly find ways to get around such safeguards.",
      "It also doesn't allow kids under 13 to chat with other users outside of games unless they have explicit parental permission \u2014 and unlike many other platforms, it does not encrypt private chat conversations, so it can monitor and moderate them.",

      "Sentinel captures one-minute snapshots of chats across Roblox \u2014 about 6 billion messages per day \u2014 and analyzes them for potential harms. To do this, Roblox says it developed two indexes \u2014 one made up of benign messages and, the other, chats that were determined to contain child endangerment violations. Roblox says this lets the system recognize harmful patterns that go beyond simply flagging certain words or phrases, taking the entire conversation into context.",
      "\u201cThat index gets better as we detect more bad actors, we just continuously update that index. Then we have another sample of what does a normal, regular user do?\" said Naren Koneru, vice president of engineering for trust and safety at Roblox.",

The chatbot typically provided warnings against risky activity but went on to deliver startlingly detailed and personalized plans for drug use, calorie-restricted diets or self-injury.",
      "The researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate also repeated their inquiries on a large scale, classifying more than half of ChatGPT\u2019s 1,200 responses as dangerous.",

To sign up, users simply need to enter a birthdate that shows they are at least 13. Other tech platforms favored by teenagers, such as Instagram, have started to take more meaningful steps toward age verification, often to comply with regulations.

      "HERMOSILLO, Mexico -- The United States\u2019 suspension of live cattle imports from Mexico hit at the worst possible time for rancher Mart\u00edn Ibarra Vargas, who after two years of severe drought had hoped to put his family on better footing selling his calves across the northern border.",
      "Like his father and grandfather before him, Ibarra Vargas has raised cattle on the parched soil of Sonora, the state in northwestern Mexico that shares a long border with the United States, particularly Arizona. His family has faced punishing droughts before but has never before had to contend with the economic hit of a new scourge: the New World Screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite.",
      "U.S. agriculture officials halted live cattle crossing the border in July \u2013 the third suspension of the past eight months \u2014 due to concerns about the flesh-eating maggot which has been found in southern Mexico and is creeping north.",
      "The screwworm is a larva of the Cochliomyia hominivorax fly that can invade the tissues of any warm-blooded animal, including humans. The parasite enters animals\u2019 skin, causing severe damage and lesions that can be fatal. Infected animals are a serious threat to herds.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture calls it a \"devastating pest\" and said in June that it poses a threat to \u201cour livestock industry, our economy, and our food supply chain.\u201d It has embarked on other steps to keep it out of the United States, which eradicated it decades ago.",
      "As part of its strategy the U.S. is preparing to breed billions of sterile flies and release them in Mexico and southern Texas. The aim is for the sterile males to mate with females in the wild who then produce no offspring.",
      "The U.S. ban on live cattle also applies to horses and bison imports. It hit a ranching sector already weakened by drought and specifically a cattle export business that generated $1.2 billion for Mexico last year. This year, Mexican ranchers have exported fewer than 200,000 head of cattle, which is less than half what they historically send in the same period.",
      "For Ibarra Vargas, considered a comparatively small rancher by Sonora\u2019s beef-centric standards, the inability to send his calves across the border has made him rethink everything.",
      "The repeated bans on Mexican cows by U.S. authorities has pushed his family to branch into beekeeping, raising sheep and selling cow's milk. What he earns is just a fraction of what he earned by exporting live cattle, but he is trying to hold on through the lean times.",

Worst hit was a species called the sunflower sea star, which lost around 90% of its population in the outbreak\u2019s first five years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really quite gruesome,\u201d said marine disease ecologist Alyssa Gehman at the Hakai Institute in British Columbia, Canada, who helped pinpoint the cause.",
      "Healthy sea stars have \u201cpuffy arms sticking straight out,\u201d she said. But the wasting disease causes them to grow lesions and \u201cthen their arms actually fall off.\u201d",

      "Now that scientists know the cause, they have a better shot at intervening to help sea stars.",
      "Prentice said that scientists could potentially now test which of the remaining sea stars are still healthy \u2014 and consider whether to relocate them, or breed them in captivity to later transplant them to areas that have lost almost all their sunflower sea stars.",
      "Scientists may also test if some populations have natural immunity, and if treatments like probiotics may help boost immunity to the disease.",
      "Such recovery work is not only important for sea stars, but for entire Pacific ecosystems because healthy starfish gobble up excess sea urchins, researchers say.",
      "Sunflower sea stars \u201clook sort of innocent when you see them, but they eat almost everything that lives on the bottom of the ocean,\u201d said Gehman. \u201cThey\u2019re voracious eaters.\u201d",
      "With many fewer sea stars, the sea urchins that they usually munch on exploded in population \u2013 and in turn gobbled up around 95% of the kelp forest s in Northern California within a decade. These kelp forests provide food and habitat for a wide variety of animals including fish, sea otters and seals.",

      "The death of a New York City police officer in last week\u2019s midtown office tower shooting is highlighting the growth of Bangladeshi immigrants in the nation\u2019s largest police force",
      "NEW YORK -- Outside the Bronx mosque where a New York City police officer was eulogized last week, a group of officers in their formal navy blue uniforms solemnly hung a banner bearing the young officer\u2019s photograph and the name of his fraternity, the Bangladeshi American Police Association.",
      "Didarul Islam \u2014 one of four people killed in the July 28 shooting at the Manhattan office tower housing the NFL\u2019s headquarters \u2014 was the NYPD's first Bangladeshi American officer killed in the line of duty.",
      "His funeral underscored the fertile recruiting ground the department has found in the city\u2019s thriving Bangladeshi community. More than 1,000 of the NYPD\u2019s roughly 33,000 uniformed members are Bangladeshi Americans, according to the association. Another 1,500 people of Bangladeshi heritage are among the department\u2019s 19,000 civilian employees.",
      "Those numbers are up from just a handful of officers a few decades ago, a phenomenon some Bangladeshi officers attribute partly to their own patriotic response to anti-Muslim sentiment after the 9/11 attacks, as well as active recruitment and word-of-mouth in the community.",
      "Among the sea of NYPD officers who lined the street to honor Islam, 36, were some who opted for traditional South Asian attire, their police badges worn around their necks. Many joined the throngs of mourners who knelt in the street in prayer.",
      "\u201cHe actually uplifted our community in a way that was not imaginable before,\u201d said Shamsul Haque, one of the co-founders of the NYPD\u2019s Bangladeshi officers\u2019 group. \u201cHis legacy will endure not only as a hero who gave his life protecting others, but also as a symbol of hope, integrity and the American dream.\u201d",
      "When Haque joined the NYPD in 2004, he was one of just a few Bangladeshi immigrants. Many of those who joined around then wanted to dispel the notion that all Muslims were terrorist sympathizers, he said.",
      "Haque, who immigrated to the U.S. in 1991, had recently graduated college with a business administration degree when the twin towers fell. But rather than follow his peers into a financial field, he enrolled in the police academy, a decision he acknowledged was initially met with skepticism from his parents.",
      "In the aftermath of 9/11, the NYPD built up a domestic surveillance program that for years systematically spied on Muslim communities and monitored local businesses, mosques and student groups in a hunt for terror cells.",
      "Haque, 52, who retired earlier this year after becoming the first South Asian and first Muslim to attain the rank of lieutenant commander in the NYPD, said the perception of Muslims among rank-and-file members has improved.",
      "Early in his career, he recalled feeling singled out when a counterterrorism expert warned officers during a training session about the possibility of al-Qaida operatives infiltrating the force.",
      "\u201cOver the years, people started to realize that we work hard, we are ethical,\u201d Haque said. \u201cAlthough we are immigrants, we are patriotic.\u201d",
      "To grow their numbers, Haque and others went out into the community proselytizing a sensible path for recently arrived immigrants.",
      "Aspiring Bangladeshi officers were encouraged to take civilian jobs in the department, such as traffic enforcement officers and school safety agents, that don\u2019t require U.S. citizenship. After gaining citizenship, usually in about five years, they could then apply for the police academy to become a uniformed officer.",
      "Some 60% of all officers of Bangladeshi heritage in the NYPD followed this pipeline, Haque estimated. Islam, the officer killed last week, began his career as a school safety officer after immigrating to the U.S. about 16 years ago.",
      "The visible growth of Bangladeshis in the NYPD has helped many aspire to leadership roles in the department, just as generations of Irish, Italian and Latino immigrants did before them.",

The department's uniformed ranks are roughly 38% white, 33% Hispanic, 17% Black and nearly 12% Asian, according to NYPD data.",
      "\u201cI never dreamt that I would go this far, but I always had an ambition to go somewhere where I can be challenged,\u201d said Siddique, now a member of Mayor Eric Adams' security detail. \u201cI always say, \u2018Listen, give me a chance, see if I can do better than anybody else,\u2019 you know? Give me a chance.\u201d",
      "Ishmam Chowdhury, a 26-year-old officer who graduated from the academy in May, said Islam\u2019s death just a few months into his own career has left a lasting impression.",
      "Like Islam\u2019s wife, who is expecting their third child, Chowdhury's wife is due to give birth to their first soon.",
      "\u201cIt just hit us a little different because like that made us think, what if it happens to me today? It can,\u201d he said. \u201cSo yeah, I guess that\u2019s a wake-up call for us that even though this is a noble job, we are definitely at grave risk.\u201d",
      "Chowdhury said he dreamed of joining law enforcement even before he immigrated to the U.S. in 2019. As a teenager in Bangladesh, he and other family members were robbed multiple times. The feeling of helplessness and humiliation stuck with him, he said.",
      "Chowdhury started as an unarmed volunteer member of the NYPD auxiliary before joining the civilian ranks as a 911 operator in 2021.",
      "He also served about a year in the police force in Washington, D.C., after it opened applications to green card holders in 2023, but he and his wife felt isolated from friends and family. So after receiving his citizenship last year, the couple moved back to Queens and he enrolled in the police academy.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what makes this city, this country, great. It doesn\u2019t matter where somebody comes from,\u201d Chowdhury said. \u201cIf somebody really works hard and truly wants to do something, they can do it.\u201d",

      "Louisiana officials have agreed to pay $9 million to a man who was partially paralyzed after a state trooper shot him in the back during a 2018 traffic stop in Baton Rouge",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Louisiana authorities have agreed to pay $9 million to a man who was partially paralyzed from the waist down after a trooper shot him in the back during a 2018 traffic stop in Baton Rouge and then falsely reported it as a Taser discharge.",
      "The settlement reached last month is among the largest of its kind in state history and resolves a federal lawsuit by Clifton \u201cScotty\u201d Dilley, whose injuries confined him to a wheelchair when he was 19. The terms of the settlement, which were not made public, were provided to The Associated Press by a person with direct knowledge who was not authorized to disclose them and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "The shooting was mentioned in a U.S. Justice Department report this year that found Louisiana State Police used excessive force during arrests and vehicle pursuits.",
      "State police fired Trooper Kasha Domingue after determining she shot Dilley \u201cwithout any reliable justification,\u201d failed to activate her body-worn camera and gave inconsistent accounts that were contradicted by surveillance video.",
      "The agency also found that her misreporting the incident as a tasing \u201cdelayed the appropriate responses to the shooting,\u201d according to records reviewed by AP.",
      "Domingue's explanation for opening fire evolved over the years. Court records show that she alternatively claimed she mistook her firearm for a Taser, pulled the trigger by accident or said the shooting was justified because she feared for her life.",
      "Dilley was a passenger in the vehicle that was pulled over. He said the trooper never ordered him to stop fleeing before shooting. Moments after he was struck, he told Domingue he had lost feeling below his waist.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018What\u2019s wrong with my legs?\u2019\u201d Dilley said in a deposition. \u201cShe says, \u2018It\u2019s a Taser aftereffect. It will wear off.\u2019\u201d",
      "In fact, a bullet struck Dilley's spine.",
      "Domingue's initial account fell apart quickly. She told investigators Dilley ran around the stopped vehicle and reached inside it before charging toward her. That claim was contradicted by surveillance video from a nearby store that clearly showed the unarmed man running away from the trooper.",
      "\u201cIf that camera wasn\u2019t there I don\u2019t know how this would\u2019ve turned out,\u201d Dilley said in the deposition.",

Dilley said he hopes the \u201ccase will effect change within the state police that will keep this from ever happening again.\u201d",
      "An attorney for Domingue, Louis Oubre, declined to comment, as did the state Attorney General's Office.",
      "The $9 million settlement is among the largest ever paid in Louisiana in a case involving police violence. Baton Rouge agreed in 2021 to pay $4.5 million to the children of Alton Sterling, a Black man whose fatal shooting by police was captured on video and sparked widespread anger and protests.",
      "More than two years after the shooting, prosecutors charged Domingue with aggravated second-degree battery and illegal use of a weapon. She pleaded guilty in 2022 to obstruction of justice, a misdemeanor, avoiding jail but agreeing never again to serve in law enforcement. Her conviction has since been expunged.",
      "The civil proceedings raised questions about whether Domingue ever should have become a state trooper, underscoring the liability the state could have faced had the lawsuit gone to trial. State police records show a series of red flags dating back to her time in the training academy, including failed tests and issues on the firing range.",
      "The agency allowed her to graduate academy despite those problems, requiring that she complete additional training before receiving her commission. But instructors expressed misgivings about her suitability. One internal report said she \u201cstruggled from the onset of the class, both physically and mentally.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department alluded to Domingue in its findings on the state police's widespread use of excessive force. It noted that she remained a trooper for more than two years after the shooting due to a policy of putting off internal investigations while criminal inquiries are underway.",
      "\u201cThis can add significant delays to the accountability process,\u201d the report said.",
      "Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican, criticized the report as an attempt \u201cto diminish the service and exceptionality of\u201d the state police. The federal probe began in 2022 amid fallout from the in-custody death of Ronald Greene, who was beaten, tased and dragged on a rural road in northern Louisiana.",
      "The DOJ rescinded its findings in May, saying it was ending the \u201cfailed experiment of handcuffing local leaders and police departments.\u201d",

      "The threats, pressure and ultimatums have come and gone, but Russian President Vladimir Putin has maintained Moscow's uncompromising demands in the war in Ukraine, raising fears he could use a planned summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Alaska to coerce Kyiv into accepting an unfavorable deal.",
      "The maximalist demands reflect Putin\u2019s determination to reach the goals he set when he launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "Putin sees a possible meeting with Trump as a chance to negotiate a broad deal that would not only cement Russia\u2019s territorial gains but also keep Ukraine from joining NATO and hosting any Western troops, allowing Moscow to gradually pull the country back into its orbit.",
      "The Kremlin leader believes time is on his side as the exhausted and outgunned Ukrainian forces are struggling to stem Russian advances in many sectors of the over 1,000-kilometer (over 600-mile) front line while swarms of Russian missiles and drones batter Ukrainian cities.",

      "A look at Russian and Ukrainian visions of a peace deal and how a Putin-Trump summit could evolve:",
      "In a memorandum presented at talks in Istanbul in June, Russia offered Ukraine two options for establishing a 30-day ceasefire. One demanded Ukraine withdraw its forces from Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson \u2014 the four regions Moscow illegally annexed in September 2022 but never fully captured.",
      "As an alternate condition for a ceasefire, Russia made a \u201cpackage proposal\u201d for Ukraine to halt mobilization efforts, freeze Western arms deliveries and ban any third-country forces on its soil. Moscow also suggested Ukraine end martial law and hold elections, after which the countries could sign a comprehensive peace treaty.",
      "Once there's a truce, Moscow wants a deal to include the \u201cinternational legal recognition\u201d of its annexations of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and the four regions in 2022.",
      "Russia says a peace treaty should have Ukraine declare its neutral status between Russia and the West, abandon its bid to join NATO, limit the size of its armed forces and recognize Russian as an official language on par with Ukrainian -\u2013 conditions reflecting Putin\u2019s earliest goals.",
      "It also demands Ukraine ban the \u201cglorification and propaganda of Nazism and neo-Nazism\u201d and dissolve nationalist groups. Since the war began, Putin has falsely alleged that neo-Nazi groups were shaping Ukrainian politics under Zelenskyy, who is Jewish. They were fiercely dismissed by Kyiv and its Western allies.",
      "In Russia\u2019s view, a comprehensive peace treaty should see both countries lift all sanctions and restrictions, abandon any claims to compensation for wartime damage, resume trade and communications, and reestablish diplomatic ties.",
      "Asked Thursday whether Moscow has signaled any willingness to compromise to make a meeting with Trump possible, Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov responded that there haven't been any shifts in the Russian position.",

It has been doing so for some time, but the core position remains unchanged: Russia wants Kyiv to surrender.\u201d",

The conflict, alternating between open warfare and periods of simmering tension, appears likely to persist for the foreseeable future.\u201d",

      "A Congolese refugee who had been separated from her family for eight years was on the verge of joining them in the United States when President Donald Trump halted the refugee program in January",
      "BOISE, Idaho -- The Congolese woman\u2019s search for safety sent her on a terrifying trek of nearly 2,300 miles (3,700 kilometers) through southern Africa on foot when she was just 15.",
      "Reuniting with her family has been a more difficult journey. For eight years, she clung to hope through delays and setbacks as she navigated a U.S. program that reconnects refugees with family members already in the country, and her dream of seeing them again seemed close to becoming a reality.",
      "But President Donald Trump signed an executive order halting the refugee program just hours after he took office on Jan. 20, \u200bleaving her and thousands of other refugees stranded.",
      "\u201cIt was horrible. I would never wish for anyone to go through that, ever. When I think about it, I just ...\u201d she said, pausing to take a long breath. \u201cHonestly, I had given up. I told my mom maybe it was just not meant for us to see each other again.\u201d",
      "During a brief block on the order, the woman made it into the U.S., one of only about 70 refugees to arrive in the country since Trump took office. She asked that her name not be used because she fears retaliation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a really devastating roller coaster for those families, to be stuck in this limbo of not knowing whether their hope of being resettled in the United States will ever come true,\u201d said Melissa Keaney, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project.",
      "The woman was an infant when her mother fled the Democratic Republic of Congo\u2019s civil war in 1997, seeking shelter at Tanzania\u2019s Nyarugusu refugee camp. When the camp grew too dangerous, she fled for South Africa. She built a modest life there, always hoping she would rejoin her family, even after they were resettled in the U.S. For a time, that seemed likely, thanks to the \u201cfollow to join\u201d program.",
      "The refugee program had bipartisan support for decades, allowing people displaced by war, natural disaster or persecution to legally migrate to the U.S. and providing a pathway to citizenship.",
      "But Trump's executive order halting the program said communities didn\u2019t have the ability to \u201cabsorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees.\u201d",
      "Organizations like the International Refugee Assistance Project and some refugees, including the Congolese woman and her mother, sued over Trump's order in February. They said resettlement agencies were forced to lay off hundreds of workers and some refugees were left in dangerous places.",
      "\u201cI had a small business and told everyone, \u2018I\u2019m out now,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt felt like this door had just been opened, and I was running toward it when \u2014 boom! \u2014 they push it shut right in front of me.\u201d",
      "Looking back on her time in the Nyarugusu refugee camp, she remembers teaching her little brother to ride a bike and whispering with her sister late at night. She remembers hunger and fear as attacks on refugees foraging outside the camp increased.",
      "\u201cYou see someone hanged, and that brings fear,\" she said. \"You don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll be next. You don\u2019t know if they\u2019re waiting for you.\u201d",
      "By 2012, the camp was especially dangerous for teen girls, who were at risk of being kidnapped or assaulted. With little hope of a viable future, her mother made a plan: The 15-year-old would walk to South Africa, where she would have a better chance of finishing school and building a life. Her siblings were too young to make the journey, so she would have to go alone.",
      "She didn't know the way, so joined other travelers, often going without food during the six-week journey.",
      "The crossing from Mozambique into Zimbabwe was deep in a forest. The group she was following had hired a guide, but he abandoned them in the middle of the night. Under the thin moonlight, the group walked toward a cellphone tower in the distance, hoping to find civilization.",
      "\u201cHow we made it to the other side was only God,\u201d she said.",

      "Austin Robert Drummond, 28, appeared by a video feed from jail before a judge in Tiptonville, two days after he was arrested in the killings that set the mostly rural region of western Tennessee on edge.",
      "At the hearing, District Attorney Danny Goodman told the judge that the state intends to seek the death penalty. Lake County General Sessions Judge Andrew T. Cook ordered Drummond held without bond because it a capital case.",
      "Drummond was wearing a black and white striped jumpsuit and seated in a chair. He told a judge he operated a business and he said he wants a speedy trial in the case. The judge entered a guilty plea on his behalf because a lawyer had not been appointed yet.",
      "The judge then ruled him indigent and granted a court-appointed attorney.",
      "Drummond is charged with four counts of first-degree murder, aggravated kidnapping and weapons offenses. A weeklong search for Drummond ended when he was taken into custody in Jackson, located about 70 miles southeast of the location of the July 29 slayings.",
      "The ordeal began after an infant in a car seat was found in a front yard in the Tigrett area, roughly 40 miles (65 kilometers) from Tiptonville. The Dyer County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a statement that a caller reported a minivan or midsize SUV had dropped the infant at a \u201crandom individual\u2019s front yard.\u201d",
      "The sheriff\u2019s office later said they were working with investigators in neighboring Lake County, where four people had been found dead from gunshot wounds. Officials determined those people were the child\u2019s parents, grandmother and uncle.",

    "story": [
      "A White House official says the Trump administration is seeking a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles",
      "The Trump administration is seeking a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles, a White House official said Friday, weeks after the Department of Justice accused the school of antisemitism and other civil rights violations.",
      "UCLA is the first public university to be targeted by a widespread funding freeze over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action.",
      "President Donald Trump's administration has frozen or paused federal funding over similar allegations against elite private colleges. In recent weeks, the administration has struck deals with Brown University for $50 million and Columbia University for $221 million but has explored larger settlements, such as in its ongoing battle with Harvard University.",
      "The White House official did not detail any additional demands the administration has made to UCLA or elaborate on the settlement amount. The person was not authorized to speak publicly about the request and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "The Trump administration had suspended $584 million in federal grants for UCLA, the university said this week. The Department of Justice\u2019s Civil Rights Division issued a finding that UCLA violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \u201cby acting with deliberate indifference in creating a hostile educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students.\u201d",
      "The university had drawn widespread criticism for how it handled dispersing an encampment of Israel-Hamas war protesters in 2024. One night, counterprotesters attacked the encampment, throwing traffic cones and firing pepper spray, with fighting that continued for hours, injuring more than a dozen people, before police stepped in. The next day, after hundreds defied orders to leave, more than 200 people were arrested. Later, Jewish students said demonstrators in encampments blocked them from getting to class.",
      "The University of California\u2019s president, James B. Milliken, said Friday the university had \u201cjust received\u201d a document from the Department of Justice and would review it. He said the size of the proposed settlement would \u201cdevastate\u201d the University of California, whose campuses are viewed as some of the top public colleges in the nation.",
      "\u201cEarlier this week, we offered to engage in good faith dialogue with the Department to protect the University and its critical research mission,\u201d said Milliken, who started as president last week. \u201cAs a public university, we are stewards of taxpayer resources and a payment of this scale would completely devastate our country\u2019s greatest public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians.\u201d",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday accused Trump of trying to silence academic freedom in his attack on such a prestigious public university system.",
      "\u201cHe has threatened us through extortion with a billion-dollar fine unless we do his bidding,\u201d Newsom told reporters. Apparently referencing the settlements with Columbia and Brown, he added: \u201cWe will not be like some of those other institutions that have followed a different path.\u201d",
      "The $1 billion demand in the UCLA settlement is linked to Newsom\u2019s status as one of Trump\u2019s most outspoken foes, said Peter McDonough, vice president and general counsel at the American Council on Education, an association of college presidents.",

      "The Trump administration has used its control of federal funding to push for reforms at elite colleges that the president decries as overrun by liberalism and antisemitism. The administration also has launched investigations into diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, saying they discriminate against white and Asian American students.",
      "Last month, Columbia University agreed to pay $200 million as part of a settlement to resolve investigations into the government\u2019s allegations that the school violated federal antidiscrimination laws. The agreement also restored more than $400 million in research grants.",
      "The Trump administration is using its deal with Columbia as a template for other universities, with financial penalties that are now seen as an expectation. For instance, the administration is pressing for a deal that would require Harvard to pay far more than Columbia's $200 million. Harvard leaders have been negotiating with the White House even as they battle in court to regain access to billions in federal research funding terminated by the Trump administration.",
      "UCLA has already reached one settlement about the 2024 protests. The university agreed last week to pay $6 million to settle a lawsuit from three Jewish students and a Jewish professor who argued the university violated their civil rights by allowing pro-Palestinian protesters to block their access to classes and other areas on campus in 2024.",
      "UCLA initially had argued that it had no legal responsibility over the issue because protesters, not the university, blocked Jewish students\u2019 access to areas. The university also worked with law enforcement to thwart attempts to set up new protest camps.",
      "But in a preliminary injunction a year earlier, U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi disagreed and ordered UCLA to create a plan to protect Jewish students on campus. The University of California has since created systemwide campus guidelines on protests, with an Office of Campus and Community Safety at UCLA.",
      "As part of the settlement, UCLA said it will contribute $2.3 million to eight organizations that combat antisemitism and support the university\u2019s Jewish community. UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk, whose Jewish father and grandparents fled Nazi Germany to Mexico and whose wife is the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, also launched an initiative to combat antisemitism and anti-Israeli bias.",

      "Global financial markets have taken President Donald Trump's tariff adjustments in stride, with Asian and European shares and U.S. futures mostly higher",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his monthslong tariff threats has begun to create visible damage for the U.S. economy.",
      "Just after midnight, goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union became subject to tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the EU, Japan and South Korea are taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh are taxed at 20%. Trump also expects the EU, Japan and South Korea to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S.",
      "\u201cI think the growth is going to be unprecedented,\u201d Trump said Wednesday afternoon. He added that the U.S. was \u201ctaking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs,\u201d but he couldn't provide a specific figure for revenues because \u201cwe don\u2019t even know what the final number is\u201d regarding tariff rates.",
      "Despite the uncertainty, the Trump White House is confident that the onset of his broad tariffs will provide clarity about the path of the world's largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the Republican administration believes they can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power.",
      "But so far, there are signs of self-inflicted wounds to America as companies and consumers alike brace for the impact of new taxes. What the data has shown is a U.S. economy that changed in April with Trump\u2019s initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday.",
      "Economic reports show that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline after April, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy.",
      "\u201cA less productive economy requires fewer workers,\u201d Silvia said in an analysis note. \u201cBut there is more, the higher tariff prices lower workers' real wages. The economy has become less productive, and firms cannot pay the same real wages as before. Actions have consequences.\u201d",
      "Even then, the ultimate transformations of the tariffs are unknown and could play out over months, if not years. Many economists say the risk is that the American economy is steadily eroded rather than collapsing instantly.",
      "\u201cWe all want it to be made for television where it\u2019s this explosion \u2014 it\u2019s not like that,\u201d said Brad Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine sand in the gears and slow things down.\u201d",
      "Trump has promoted the tariffs as a way to reduce the persistent trade deficit. But importers sought to avoid the taxes by importing more goods before the taxes went into effect. As a result, the $582.7 billion trade imbalance for the first half of the year was 38% higher than in 2024. Total construction spending has dropped 2.9% over the past year.",
      "The economic pain isn't confined to the U.S. Germany, which sends 10% of its exports to the U.S. market, saw industrial production sag 1.9% in June as Trump's earlier rounds of tariff hikes took hold. \u201cThe new tariffs will clearly weigh on economic growth,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, global chief of macro for ING bank.",
      "The lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Trump's tariffs, which have been variously rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and frantically renegotiated. The process has been so muddled that officials for key trade partners were unclear at the start of the week whether the tariffs would begin Thursday or Friday. The language of the July 31 order to delay the start of tariffs from Aug. 1 only said the higher tax rates would start in seven days.",
      "Trump on Wednesday announced additional 25% tariffs to be imposed on India for its buying of Russian oil, bringing its total import taxes to 50%.",

      "Even people who worked with Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no sort of rationale for this other than the president wanting to raise tariffs based upon his whims, his opinions,\u201d Ryan told CNBC on Wednesday. \u201cI think choppy waters are ahead because I think they\u2019re going to have some legal challenges.\u201d",
      "Still, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S&P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months.",

It\u2019s states where one party controls all the levers of government where redistricting dramas like the one in Texas often play out as the majority tries to maximize its power.",
      "Regardless of the process, the resulting maps often produce congressional delegations much more lopsided in favor of one party than the state\u2019s partisan demographics might suggest.",
      "A state\u2019s presidential vote result isn\u2019t a precise tool for measuring what its congressional delegation ought to look like, but it can provide a compelling point of comparison. Politicians frequently cite it when decrying partisan redistricting practices they think are unfair.",
      "President Donald Trump, who's pushing Texas and other GOP-controlled states to redraw their maps, said this week Republicans were \u201centitled to five more seats\u201d in Texas based in part on the size of his win there in November. Trump won 56% of the Texas vote, but Republicans already hold 65% of the state's congressional delegation \u2014 which would rise to 79% if the GOP's new maps are adopted and past voting patterns hold in the next election.",
      "During an event with Texas Democratic lawmakers in Boston, Missouri state Rep. Ashley Aune cited her state\u2019s presidential vote results in warning of possible Republican-driven redistricting efforts there.",
      "\u201cFifty-eight percent of Missouri voted for Trump, but they want to send an 87% representation to Congress,\u201d said Aune, a Democrat.",
      "It\u2019s actually fairly common for a state\u2019s congressional delegation not to align with statewide presidential vote results.",
      "In 41 of the 44 states with more than one congressional district, the party of the winning presidential candidate had a larger share of the state\u2019s congressional seats than its share of the presidential vote, an Associated Press analysis found. In most cases, it was a much larger share, a gap of at least 10 percentage points.",
      "Here\u2019s a comparison of the congressional delegations and presidential vote results in a sampling of states, including some of those considering a redraw of their congressional boundaries after Texas called its special session.",
      "In remarks to CNBC, Trump pointed to California and Illinois as justifications for redrawing the Texas map in Republicans\u2019 favor.",
      "\u201cYou notice they go to Illinois for safety, but that\u2019s all gerrymandered,\u201d he said in reference to the Texas Democrats who relocated to the Chicago area to block, at least temporarily, the Republican redistricting efforts.",
      "\u201cCalifornia\u2019s gerrymandered. We should have many more seats in Congress in California,\u201d he said.",
      "He\u2019s right about Illinois: Democrats have gerrymandered the lines so they hold 14 of the 17 House seats. Not so in California.",
      "Democrats there do have an outsized majority, holding 43 of the state\u2019s 52 House seats, about 83%. Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, received about 59% of the November vote. But that's not because of Democratic gerrymandering. A ballot initiative took the process away from state lawmakers and gave it to an independent citizens commission.",

    "published": "Sun, 10 Aug 2025 10:36:37 -0400",
    "summary": "Billy Wilder's caustic tale of Hollywood, obsession and murder, in which a fading star of silent pictures tries to recreate her fame, is back in its full dark glory.",
    "story": [
      "There are some movies where just about every line is quotable. Take Billy Wilder's 1950 masterpiece \"Sunset Boulevard,\" which premiered 75 years ago this month.",
      "Gillis: \"You're Norma Desmond. You used to be in silent pictures. You used to be big.\"Desmond: \"I AM big. It's the pictures that got small.\"",
      "The film was anything but small! The legendary director had Gloria Swanson as the rejected silent film star, Norma Desmond, who seemed to be going quietly out of her mind; and William Holden as the failed screenwriter Joe Gillis, who became her kept man.",
      "\"She was 52 at the time; William Holden was 31,\" said UT Austin film professor Noah Isenberg. \"The age difference was extraordinary. Today we might not think much of it, but it was big.\"",
      "Isenberg says the noir \"Sunset Boulevard\" tested the limits of what a 1950 audience would bear. The opening scene is gruesome enough, with the murdered Gillis face down in a swimming pool. But the film originally started in the L.A. morgue, with Gillis and other cadavers talking about how they got there. \u00a0Isenberg said, \"It was too dark, too morbid. Audiences weren't ready for it. Instead, you have John Seitz's camera trained on that curb.\" Appropriately, the film begins in the gutter.",
      "The original film, now restored in glorious 4K ultra hi-def, is available from Paramount.",
      "Nancy Olson was only 21 when she played aspiring writer Betty Schaefer opposite Holden's Gillis. Olson, now 97, says Holden's air of desperation in the film mirrored what was happening in his life. \"His career was dying,\" she said. \"And that's the character. If you look carefully, you will see one of the most extraordinary, real performances of a man who gave up his soul for survival.\"",
      "Still, Olson says they got along famously on set, especially when director Wilder lined them up for their first-ever love scene in a crowded studio where some of the cast's family members happened to be present: \"And we got to the end, where Bill says to my character, 'What happened?' And I turn to him slowly and answer, 'You did.' Whereupon he takes me into his arms and gently starts to kiss me.",
      "\"Now, Billy said, 'Do not separate until I say cut.' And we both were enjoying this. And all of a sudden, there was a female voice saying, 'Cut, damn it! Cut!' It was Mrs. Holden! I never got over it. But I learned something.\"",
      "What was that? \"Bill and I loved to kiss!\"",
      "And moviegoers loved the film: \"Sunset Boulevard\" got 11 Academy Award nominations. \"I was shocked,\" Olsen said of the Oscar nods. \"Now, we didn't win. But we've outlasted everybody.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for the 75th anniversary release of \"Sunset Boulevard\" click on the video player below:",
      "\"Sunset Boulevard\" was later re-born as a musical from Andrew Lloyd Webber. Sir Andrew was intrigued by the story of Hollywood discarding aging stars, and got the blessing of Wilder, who by then was being gently phased out of Hollywood himself \u2013 in his own way getting the Norma Desmond treatment. Webber said, \"He does tell a wonderful story about him going to see some young movie executive who had just been there. And this young executive says to him, 'Um, well, Mr. Wilder, we're very impressed by this screenplay that you've done, but it would be really helpful if you could tell me what you have done in the past?'\"",
      "The director of such classics as \"Double Indemnity,\" \"The Lost Weekend,\" \"Ace in the Hole,\" \"Some Like It Hot,\" and \"The Apartment,\" turned to the young executive and said, \"You first.\"",
      "\"Sunset Boulevard,\" the musical, opened in London's West End in 1993, with Patti LuPone as Desmond; when they brought the show to Los Angeles and New York, Glenn Close played the lead.",
      "And in the latest, radically re-conceived version, Desmond was played by former pop star Nicole Scherzinger.",
      "Asked about seeing Scherzinger in the role of Norma Desmond, Webber said, \"I have always rated Nicole as one of the most astounding singers I've ever worked with. And I worked with a few. And I could say that Nicole is right up there with the very, very, very top ones, might even be the best.\"",
      "Scherzinger brought a new level of intensity to Norma Desmond, and took home a Tony Award this year.",
      "You can stream the Broadway cast album of \"Sunset Blvd.\" featuring Nicole Scherzinger by clicking on the embed below (Free Spotify registration required to hear the tracks in full):",
      "The show closed last month, and we took Scherzinger back to the St. James Theatre just before they took down all the signs. \"I can't believe that this is still up; I want to take it home!\" she laughed. \"I want to take it home and I want to put this in my garage.\"",
      "One sign was half-removed from the stage door. \"I think someone stole my face!\" she laughed.",
      "Asked what she thinks \"Sunset Boulevard\" says about the entertainment industry and its treatment of older women, Scherzinger said, \"It's difficult that the industry kind of puts an expiration date on you when you've actually lived a life and actually, finally, have something really meaningful to say.\"",
      "Hollywood has changed (and so has Paramount Pictures). But seventy-five years on, \"Sunset Boulevard\" still holds up. Isenberg said, \"For people who love movies \u2013 cinephiles and film geeks, whatever we want to call them today \u2013 you can just luxuriate in a movie like 'Sunset Boulevard.' It's like a warm bath.\"",
      "Gloria Swanson herself luxuriated in playing a faded movie queen. Even back then, she somehow knew that \"Sunset Boulevard\" would make her a legend.",
      "Asked if Swanson was anything like the character she portrayed, Nancy Olson replied, \"No. She was much more real and sensible. And she was the only person on the entire set that understood that this movie would live forever and that she would be remembered forever \u2013 that it was a story that had a truth to it that would never be forgotten.\"",

      "Still, privacy experts say that social media users aren't always aware of how much information they're sharing with an app or its users, even if they have the ability to limit who sees what.",
      "\"The more these location features are rolled out on social media it carries out the assumption that as long as you give users the ability to toggle them on and off that they'll know exactly how to do that,\" Douglas Zytko, an app safety expert and associate professor at the College of Innovation & Technology at the University of Michigan-Flint, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But the average user isn't always aware of their privacy settings and if they match their preferences.\"",
      "When the Instagram Map feature is turned on, any content a user posts with a location tagged, including a reel, post or story, will show up on the app's map for 24 hours, according to the Instagram blog. While the feature remains on, the user's location is updated whenever they open the app or return to it. The feature can be turned off at any time.",
      "In an Instagram post discussing the feature, Instagram's head, Adam Mosseri, explains how he himself uses the map. \"Personally, I use the map to share what I'm up to with a handful of my closest friends, and I curate that list carefully,\" he said.",
      "User confusion over whether the feature is on or off",
      "On Threads, Meta's microblogging site, a number of Instagram account holders claimed that their locations were being pinned on friends' maps by default.",
      "Mosseri weighed in, saying the concerns prompted the company to re-examine how the feature works.",
      "\"We're double-checking everything, but so far it looks mostly like people are confused and assume that, because they can see themselves on the map when they open, other people can see them too,\" he said. \"We're still checking everything though to make sure nobody shares location without explicitly deciding to do so, which, by the way, requires a double consent by design (we ask you to confirm after you say you want to share).\"",
      "How to turn on Instagram Maps",
      "In the top right corner of the app, tap on the messaging function. There you will see a circular world map icon labeled \"map. If you click on the icon, you will see you're on location pinned on a map. Friends who are sharing their locations will also appear. Click on the gear icon to choose to share your location with no one, or a custom list of friends, or all of your friends \u2014 who are followers that you also follow back on the app.",
      "Social pressures, privacy and safety risks",
      "Zytko, however, said it can be complicated for social media users to manage privacy settings that let them share different kinds of content with different groups of people. \"This issue is called 'context collapse,'\" he said. \"Your co-workers see your social media posts, and your friends and family, and there is certain content you only want some groups to see but not others, and it can be hard to manage the visibility of content.\"",
      "Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which makes entertainment and technology recommendations for families, said location-sharing features can be particularly risky for younger app users.",
      "\"These features might feel fun and social, but they create unnecessary risks that teens and many adults don't necessarily understand,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "While parents who supervise their teens through controls built into the app can control their kids' location-sharing settings, he still has concerns about the kinds of social pressures such features expose teens, too.",
      "Torney said research at Common Sense Media shows that location-sharing also creates \"social pressures around where teens go and who they spend time with, and kids feel obligated to share location to show they are someplace cool.\"",
      "Furthermore, when teens share their locations, \"they are potentially telling strangers where they are in real time,\" Torney told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you're not selective about who you're sharing your location with, it creates opportunities for harassment, stalking or worse.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Aug 2025 14:16:53 -0400",
    "summary": "The Boar's Head deli meat plant at the heart of a deadly food-poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months, but recent reports point to ongoing sanitation problems.",
    "story": [
      "The Boar's Head deli meat plant at the heart of last year's deadly food poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months, company officials said.",
      "But recent inspections at Boar's Head sites in three states documented sanitation problems similar to those that led to the listeria contamination that killed 10 people and sickened dozens.",
      "The Jarratt, Virginia, plant was shut down in September when U.S. Agriculture Department officials suspended operations and withdrew the federal marks of inspection required to operate, saying the company \"failed to maintain sanitary conditions.\" Boar's Head permanently stopped making liverwurst and recalled more than 7 million pounds of deli products.",
      "Inspectors at the time found\u00a0dozens of violations, including leftover meat on equipment, mold and mildew buildup, insects in and around deli meats, and puddles of blood on the plant's floor.",
      "USDA officials this week said they had \"thoroughly reviewed\" the plant and lifted the forced suspension on July 18.",
      "\"The facility is in full compliance of the guidelines and protocols set for the safe handling and production of food and the serious issues that led to suspension have been fully rectified,\" officials with the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in an email Wednesday.",
      "Recent reports of similar sanitation issues",
      "And yet, documents obtained by The Associated Press through a freedom of information request show that Boar's Head plants in Arkansas, Indiana and elsewhere in Virginia were flagged for the same kinds of sanitation problems that led to the outbreak, with the most recent report in June.",
      "In the past seven months, government inspectors reported problems that include instances of meat and fat residue left on equipment and walls, drains blocked with meat products, beaded condensation on ceilings and floors, overflowing trash cans, and staff who didn't wear protective hairnets and plastic aprons \u2014 or wash their hands.",
      "The records, which included USDA noncompliance reports logged by inspectors from Jan. 1 through July 23, raise new questions about the company's promises to address systemic problems and about federal oversight of listeria contamination in plants that make ready-to-eat foods.",
      "\"If there is evidence that food safety problems are continuing, the government needs to make sure the company fixes them,\" said Sandra Eskin, a former USDA official who now heads STOP Foodborne Illness, a consumer group focused on food safety.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins last month announced plans to bolster efforts that combat foodborne germs, including listeria.",
      "Officials at Boar's Head, the 120-year-old company based in Sarasota, Florida, have posted job openings for two dozen positions, including a food safety quality analyst, at the Jarratt site.",
      "The company convened a panel of expert advisers last fall and hired a chief food safety officer in May. The advisers include Frank Yiannas, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration official, and Mindy Brashears, President Donald Trump's nominee for USDA's undersecretary for food safety.",
      "Boar's Head last year said they \"regret and deeply apologize\" for the contamination and that \"comprehensive measures are being implemented to prevent such an incident from ever happening again.\"",
      "But company officials refused to discuss the problems found this year. They canceled a scheduled AP interview with Natalie Dyenson, the new food safety officer. And they declined to allow Yiannas to detail the investigation he led into the contamination's cause.",
      "Brashears, who now directs a food safety center at Texas Tech University, did not respond to requests for comment about the Boar's Head problems. An automatic email reply said the USDA nominee was traveling out of the country until Aug. 25. She remains on the company's food safety board.",
      "\"Boar's Head has an unwavering commitment to food safety and quality. That commitment is reflected in recent enhancements to our practices and protocols\" described on the company's website, Boar's Head said in an emailed statement.",
      "\"We have also been working with the USDA in developing a plan to reopen our Jarratt facility in a measured, deliberate way in the coming months,\" the statement said.",
      "The 35 pages of new inspection findings cover Boar's Head sites in Forrest City, Arkansas; New Castle, Indiana; and Petersburg, Virginia.",
      "The findings surprised outside food safety advocates, who said that factory conditions should have improved in the year since the outbreak was first identified.",
      "\"You would have expected after all they went through that they would put themselves in a place where you could essentially eat deli meat off the factory floor,\" said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports, an advocacy group.",
      "Rep. Rosa DeLauro called the findings \"appalling.\"",
      "\"This is a pattern of negligence \u2014 cutting corners to protect the company's bottom line at the expense of consumers and these conditions show a complete disregard for food safety and for the public health of the American people,\" the Connecticut Democrat said in a statement.",
      "The findings echo the \"inadequate sanitation practices\" that USDA officials said contributed to the outbreak. Key factors included product residue, condensation and structural problems in the buildings, a January report concluded.",
      "At the Jarratt plant, state inspectors working in partnership with USDA had documented mold, insects, liquid dripping from ceilings, and meat and fat residue on walls, floors and equipment, the AP previously reported.",
      "While no instances of insects were documented in this year's inspection reports, there were repeated reports of \"dried fat and protein from the previous day's production\" on equipment, stairs and walls. In April, an inspector at the Petersburg plant reported finding discarded meat underneath equipment, including \"5-6 hams, 4 large pieces of meat and a large quantity of pooling meat juice.\"",
      "Other reports detailed beaded condensation \"directly over the food contact surfaces of tables and conveyor belts.\" Additional reports documented rusting meat racks, doors that failed to close completely and staff who ignored required handwashing stations.",
      "The reports point to a \"food safety culture problem,\" said Barbara Kowalcyk, who directs a food safety and nutrition security center at George Washington University.",
      "\"What jumped out to me is there is an organizational culture issue that needs to be changed,\" she said. \"Usually that culture has to start at the top.\"",
      "In the meantime, she advised consumers to think carefully about deli meat consumption. Older people and those who are pregnant or have weakened immune systems are especially vulnerable to serious illness from listeria infections.",
      "\"I think they need to be aware that there are issues at this organization that still are not completely under control, apparently,\" Kowalcyk said.",
      "Boar's Head faced multiple lawsuits from people who fell ill or from the families of those who died. Several survivors declined to comment publicly on the new problems, citing financial settlements with the company that included nondisclosure agreements.",

      "Guy Malone said, \"You can't change the Bible; it changes you. The same is true of bitcoin.\"",
      "But everyone here seems to agree on one thing: President Donald Trump's reelection has been like hitting the jackpot. As Vice President JD Vance told the crowd, \"I'm here today to say loud and clear, with President Trump, crypto finally has a champion and an ally in the White House.\"",
      "Once dismissed by investors, and still baffling to many Americans, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have won over supporters from Wall Street to Washington. In July, the president signed the Genius Act, which opens the door for companies like Wal-Mart and Amazon to issue their own digital currencies.",
      "And Congress is debating another bill that, for the first time, aims to regulate cryptocurrency trading \u2013 this after the industry spent more than $167 million on behalf of crypto-friendly candidates ahead of last year's election.",
      "Asked how people should think of cryptocurrencies, Amanda Fischer, who served as a top official in the Securities and Exchange Commission during the Biden administration, replied, \"You could think of it as gambling, you could think of it as a collectible, you could think of it as a type of investment. But I think what's important to understand is that crypto is highly volatile. It's highly speculative.",
      "\"Crypto is often marketed to individuals as an investment opportunity that will yield them the possibility of great returns,\" she said. \"But unlike, say, a stock, which represents a part-ownership of a company, [crypto] is not backed by any sort of business that is producing goods and services.\"",
      "Unlike hard currencies like the dollar or the euro, cryptocurrencies only exist online, and are issued by individuals and companies, not central banks. And yet, billions of dollars' worth of crypto are traded every day. \"The number of scams, the types of scams, the sophistication of scams are so rife and plentiful that the capacity to lose your money in a crypto investment is substantially higher than if you're just investing in stocks and bonds,\" Fischer said.",

      "I asked, \"We are seeing leaders in crypto say we want to be regulated. And there is legislation currently here in Washington underway to regulate cryptocurrency. They say they want laws passed.\"",
      "\"They want laws that they write to be passed,\" said Fischer. \"So, the legislation currently being considered in Washington, D.C., is written by and for the crypto industry.\"",

Asked what he told Mr. Trump to convince him to support crypto, Bailey replied, \"First off, no one convinces the president of anything. He makes up his own mind about things. A lot of people, especially in Washington, have missed how big this has gotten. And so, we made the case to the president about how many people hold this asset. He saw the opportunity that was here by embracing this industry. And I think we had a big part of swinging the election in his direction.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve says only eight percent of Americans have bought or held cryptocurrency in the last year, and only two percent have ever used it to buy anything. But digital assets are increasingly part of the economy. You may now be able to use crypto as collateral for a mortgage, and this past week the president signed an executive order to make it easier to hold cryptocurrencies in your 401(k).",
      "All the attention has helped drive the price of bitcoin to an all-time high, recently passing $120,000 each.",
      "Bailey says bitcoin was about $10 when he first bought it. Asked how much he bought, he replied, \"Well, you know, that's something I'm not going to talk about on camera. Not enough, let's just go like that. Not enough.\"",
      "And as crypto's fortunes have improved, so have the president's; CBS News estimates that crypto ventures controlled by the Trump family have made up to $765 million in revenue from token sales since the fall of 2024.",
      "The White House did not respond to questions about the token sales, but in a statement told CBS News, \"Neither the President nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest.\"",
      "Most experts in government ethics believe the situation is unprecedented.",
      "I asked Bailey, \"Has it ever occurred to you that maybe the president has changed his position on bitcoin and crypto because he can personally benefit from it, or his family can?\"",
      "\"No, absolutely not,\" said Bailey. \"I don't think he embraced this industry to enrich himself; I think that he just sees the same potential that I see. When you get excited about an idea, you feel compelled to do something about it.\"",

      "But for Amanda Fischer, that's a gamble not worth taking.",
      "\"We heard the same thing about subprime mortgages going into 2008,\" said Fischer. \"We heard the same thing about complex financial derivatives going into the last crisis, too. These products are wonderful and there are ways to extract so much value in wealth, until they're not. And I fear that crypto is going to follow down the same path. Things are going great many times, until they're not.\"",

      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is launching an \"immediate comprehensive review\" of whether Harvard has complied with federal laws around patents, he said in a letter to Harvard President Alan Garber.",
      "The patents in question could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, a senior administration official said, and in his letter, Lutnick threatened to grant third-party licenses to Harvard's patents or take the titles to any patents where Harvard has failed to comply with government title and disclosure requirements.",
      "Lutnick ordered the Massachusetts-based school to provide information on all patents that it obtained through federally funded research.",
      "\"We believe that Harvard has failed to live up to its obligations to the American taxpayer and is in breach of the statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements tied to Harvard's federally funded research programs and intellectual property arising therefrom,\" Lutnick said.",
      "He gave Harvard until Sept. 5 to respond and prove it's complying with the Bayh-Dole Act. Under that legislation, universities receiving federal research grants have to show that inventions issuing from that funding are being used to benefit Americans.",
      "The Trump administration wants Harvard to provide a list of all the patents it has that stem from federal grants, how the patents are currently being applied and details about licensing agreements, including whether they mandate \"substantial U.S. manufacturing\" and the identities of the licensees.",
      "A Harvard spokesperson called the move \"yet another retaliatory effort targeting Harvard for defending its rights and freedom.\"",
      "\"Technologies and patents developed at Harvard are life-saving and industry-redefining. We are fully committed to complying with the Bayh-Dole Act and ensuring that the public is able to access and benefit from the many innovations that arise out of federally funded research at Harvard,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The Trump administration has paused or cut off billions in federal research funding to Harvard, accusing the university of failing to deal with campus antisemitism. Harvard has\u00a0sued over the funding freezes, alleging the government is illegally punishing the school for First Amendment-protected activity and trying to \"force Harvard to submit to the Government's control over its academic programs.\"",
      "Before the funding cutoff, the administration\u00a0demanded that Harvard agree to changes\u00a0\u2014 including an external audit of certain academic departments, an end to DEI programs and stricter disciplinary policies \u2014 if it wants to maintain its \"financial relationship\" with the federal government. Harvard rejected the demands.",
      "President Trump has\u00a0also pushed\u00a0the Internal Revenue Service to review Harvard's tax-exempt status. And he directed his administration to\u00a0bar most foreign students\u00a0from traveling to the U.S. to study at Harvard, though a judge\u00a0blocked that move.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0has suggested\u00a0he's open to making a deal with Harvard. Some other Ivy League schools that faced funding freezes have cut deals with the administration, with Columbia University and Brown University making various concessions to the federal government.",

    "story": [
      "Bed Bath & Beyond is making a comeback under a slightly different name, more than two years after filing for bankruptcy.",
      "The first Bed Bath & Beyond Home store will open in Nashville on Friday, a new version of the former big box retail store known for selling home furnishings, appliances and more, at mid-range prices. Overseeing the opening is The Brand House Collective, formerly known as Kirkland's, which manages a portfolio of retail stores including Beyond Inc.'s Bed Bath & Beyond Home, Bed Bath & Beyond, Buy Buy Baby and Overstock.",
      "\"We will be testing and learning the right inventory mix by category and by brand, but the look and feel of the stores will be a transition from the original Bed Bath and Beyond stores with a tighter focus on Seasonal Home Decor, Bedroom furnishings, and Bath and Laundry products,\" Starr Hudgens, chief of staff at the Brand House Collective, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Brand House Collective\u00a0announced the opening of the Nashville store late last month.",
      "\"We're proud to reintroduce one of retail's most iconic names with the launch of Bed Bath & Beyond Home, beautifully reimagined for how families gather at home today,\" Amy Sullivan, CEO of The Brand House Collective, said at the time.",
      "To lure former customers back in the door, Brand House said it would honor legacy Bed Bath & Beyond coupons \u2014 the big white and blue paper slips that have long been associated with the company.",
      "\"The coupon we all know and love is back and for those who need one, a fresh version will be waiting at the door,\" the company said in the announcement.",
      "Asked whether Brand House plans to open more stores under the Bed Bath & Beyond Home moniker, Hudgens said, \"We are opening four additional Bed Bath and Beyond Home stores in the Nashville market and will be in an aggressive learn and react posture to determine appropriate merchandising, brand, and strategy shifts to make as we plan our opening strategy for 2026.\"",
      "The opening of the Nashville location marks a new chapter for the discount retailer which struggled to stay afloat amid depressed sales and the takeoff of online shopping. The company finally got into the e-commerce game after naming Mark Tritton, a former top Target executive, as CEO in 2019. But by then the company was too far behind top competitors, according to experts.",
      "The company had over 300 brick-and-mortar locations before closing all of them after it\u00a0entered Chapter 11 proceedings in April 2023. Months later, it announced it would return as an online home furnishings brand under its new owner Overstock.com. In 2024, Overstock.com made a bid to\u00a0sell Bed Bath & Beyond products at over 100 of its Container Store locations in an effort to revive the struggling retail chain with the help of the Bed Bath & Beyond name.",
      "With the\u00a0opening of the Bed Bath & Beyond Home store in Tennessee, Brand House Collective is taking a major step is resurrecting its troubled retail brands, according to John Bringardner, executive editor at Debtwire, an analytics platform that tracks companies in debt.",
      "\"The company has undertaken a massive turnaround effort, closing underperforming store locations, reducing excess inventory and creating a fresh new look and marketing plan,\" Bringardner told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But its underlying financials remain deeply troubled and the success of the relaunch will be an uphill battle.\"",
      "Bed Bath & Beyond opened as a privately held business in 1971 and went public in 1992. It once had thousands of stores globally, according to data from\u00a0Statista.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-401k-changes-executive-order-risk-what-to-know/",
    "published": "Fri, 08 Aug 2025 18:08:41 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump signed an executive order that he says will democratize alternative investments for workers saving for retirement.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump says he wants to democratize retirement by allowing 401(k)s to invest in so-called alternative investments, or strategies outside stocks and other traditional investments, such as private equity and cryptocurrencies.",
      "The executive order signed by Mr. Trump on Thursday would open the door to higher-risk investments landing in your 401(k). It could also potentially serve as a game changer for the $5 trillion private equity industry, which for years has wanted to gain access to America's retirement plans.",
      "The move has the potential to shake up the typically staid menu of investment choices provided to workers through their employer-sponsored defined-contribution plans, which include 401(k)s and 403(b)s, with the latter aimed at teachers. The change might appeal to some savers, given that alternative investments can provide protection from market swings while also providing the potential for outsized returns.\u00a0But there are several catches to be aware of, experts say.",
      "Alternative investments such as private equity and cryptocurrencies \"have matured into a strong-performing asset class delivering excellent long-term returns, so this is good news for Americans,\" Simon Tang, head of U.S. at Accelex, a private markets specialist, said in an email.",
      "But there are caveats, experts say. For one, some alternative investments carry higher risk profiles than traditional asset classes, and offer less transparency about their performance on a day-to-day basis. It's also unclear whether or not employers will want to offer such investments given the risks.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "What does the executive order change about 401(k)s?",
      "The president's order directs the Labor Department and other agencies to redefine what would be considered a qualified asset under\u00a0401(k) retirement\u00a0rules.",
      "Americans' retirement plans are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, a law better known as\u00a0ERISA. Under that regulation, employers are required to offer retirement options that are in the best interest of their employees, not Wall Street.",
      "Most retirement plans for Americans are made up of stock and bond investments, and to a much lesser extent, cash and heavily traded commodities such as gold.",
      "Workers would still be able to limit their investments to traditional assets like stocks and bonds, and would also be able to opt out of adding new alternative strategies to their portfolios.",
      "When could those changes become effective?",
      "It's unclear, but it's likely going to take months or even longer given the complexity of ERISA.",
      "After the Labor Department provides its new guidance, it will take time for major retirement plan companies such as Fidelity and Vanguard to develop appropriate funds for employers to use.",
      "Employers will also likely need time to revise their retirement plan options, so it may take several years before crypto and private equity become mainstream investments in individual retirement plans. Whether employers and their workers will opt to invest in these asset classes is another question, experts added.",
      "\"While asset managers are salivating over the idea of tapping in to a portion of the $12.5 trillion in defined contribution assets, we believe adoption will be slow due to cost, transparency and complexity,\" said Pitchbook analysts in a report written to provide an analysis of some aspects of Mr. Trump's order.",
      "How risky are these investments?",
      "All investments carry risks, but alternative asset classes come with additional pitfalls that heighten their potential for volatility. For instance, private equity invests in companies that are not publicly traded, which makes it difficult to know on a day-to-day basis whether the investment is up, down or sideways.",
      "\"When it comes to investing in stocks, retail investors are used to instant pricing, clean data and daily performance updates,\" Tang said. \"Private markets are a different ballgame. There's no real-time information, no ticker and no standardization, just fragmented documents and unstructured formats.\"",
      "Cryptocurrencies, for their part, may have more transparency on pricing, but they can also be extremely volatile, with major shifts in valuation from day to day. That said, cryptocurrencies have grown increasingly popular, with about 1 in 4 people investing in crypto, according to Security.org.",
      "Do alternative investments outperform stocks and bonds?",
      "Alternative investments can outperform stocks and bonds, but there's no guarantee.",
      "For instance, bitcoin last year jumped 135% in value, compared with a 24% increase in the S&P 500. But in 2022, it was another story, with bitcoin dropping 65% while the S&P 500 lost 19%, one analysis shows.",
      "Private equity investments, meanwhile, returned 13.5% over a 10-year period, outpacing the 9.7% return for stocks and a 1.9% for bonds over the same period, according to a recent study.",
      "While the potential for outsized gains may appeal to some investors, alternative investments also tend to carry higher costs, such as pricier fees for fund managers, which can eat into returns.",
      "\"Higher costs come from the fact that while you can trade a stock for pennies, it requires travel, negotiations, legal work, and much more, to buy and operate a private company. These costs are typically passed along to fund investors,\" Pitchbook said.",

    "summary": "Instagram rolled out a new Map feature that lets users see their friends' locations in real time. Here's why privacy experts are concerned.",
    "story": [
      "A new feature on Instagram that let's users share their real-time physical location with others on the app has privacy experts concerned over the amount of data exposed and potential safety risks to users.",
      "Called Instagram Map, the new feature was introduced on Thursday as part of an app update. On its blog, the company says the location-sharing tool makes it \"easier for you and your friends to stay in touch through the content you're enjoying on Instagram.\"",
      "\"You can opt into sharing your last active location with friends you pick, and you can turn it off anytime,\" Instagram said in a blog post announcing the new feature. \"You can also open the map to see content your friends and favorite creators are posting from cool spots. No matter how you use the map, you and your friends have a new, lightweight way to connect with each other.\"",
      "\"Off by default\"",
      "In a statement shared with CBS MoneyWatch Friday, Instagram's parent company, Meta, emphasized that Instagram Maps is not automatically active upon updating the app and that users must opt-in to the location-sharing feature in order to make their whereabouts visible to others.",
      "\"Instagram Map is off by default, and your live location is never shared unless you choose to turn it on. If you do, only people you follow back \u2014 or a private, custom list you select \u2014 can see your location,\" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Users can also choose not to share their locations when they are in particular places, or with particular people.",
      "Still, privacy experts say that social media users aren't always aware of how much information they're sharing with an app or its users, even if they have the ability to limit who sees what.",
      "\"The more these location features are rolled out on social media it carries out the assumption that as long as you give users the ability to toggle them on and off that they'll know exactly how to do that,\" Douglas Zytko, an app safety expert and associate professor at the College of Innovation & Technology at the University of Michigan-Flint, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But the average user isn't always aware of their privacy settings and if they match their preferences.\"",
      "When the Instagram Map feature is turned on, any content a user posts with a location tagged, including a reel, post or story, will show up on the app's map for 24 hours, according to the Instagram blog. While the feature remains on, the user's location is updated whenever they open the app or return to it. The feature can be turned off at any time.",
      "In an Instagram post discussing the feature, Instagram's head, Adam Mosseri, explains how he himself uses the map. \"Personally, I use the map to share what I'm up to with a handful of my closest friends, and I curate that list carefully,\" he said.",
      "User confusion over whether the feature is on or off",
      "On Threads, Meta's microblogging site, a number of Instagram account holders claimed that their locations were being pinned on friends' maps by default.",
      "Mosseri weighed in, saying the concerns prompted the company to re-examine how the feature works.",
      "\"We're double-checking everything, but so far it looks mostly like people are confused and assume that, because they can see themselves on the map when they open, other people can see them too,\" he said. \"We're still checking everything though to make sure nobody shares location without explicitly deciding to do so, which, by the way, requires a double consent by design (we ask you to confirm after you say you want to share).\"",
      "How to turn on Instagram Maps",
      "In the top right corner of the app, tap on the messaging function. There you will see a circular world map icon labeled \"map. If you click on the icon, you will see you're on location pinned on a map. Friends who are sharing their locations will also appear. Click on the gear icon to choose to share your location with no one, or a custom list of friends, or all of your friends \u2014 who are followers that you also follow back on the app.",
      "Social pressures, privacy and safety risks",
      "Zytko, however, said it can be complicated for social media users to manage privacy settings that let them share different kinds of content with different groups of people. \"This issue is called 'context collapse,'\" he said. \"Your co-workers see your social media posts, and your friends and family, and there is certain content you only want some groups to see but not others, and it can be hard to manage the visibility of content.\"",
      "Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which makes entertainment and technology recommendations for families, said location-sharing features can be particularly risky for younger app users.",
      "\"These features might feel fun and social, but they create unnecessary risks that teens and many adults don't necessarily understand,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "While parents who supervise their teens through controls built into the app can control their kids' location-sharing settings, he still has concerns about the kinds of social pressures such features expose teens, too.",
      "Torney said research at Common Sense Media shows that location-sharing also creates \"social pressures around where teens go and who they spend time with, and kids feel obligated to share location to show they are someplace cool.\"",
      "Furthermore, when teens share their locations, \"they are potentially telling strangers where they are in real time,\" Torney told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you're not selective about who you're sharing your location with, it creates opportunities for harassment, stalking or worse.\"",

      "Wendy's is coping with softer consumer demand in 2025, particularly among the lower-income customers that tend to frequent fast-food chains, Sara Senatore, a research analyst at Bank of America, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The low-income consumer remains under pressure,\" she said.",
      "Fast food chains like Wendy's are competing for the attention of low-income consumers who have pulled back on eating out over concerns about the economy. According to a May study from Bankrate, among households earning less than\u00a0$50,000 per year, 44% say they expect to spend less on dining out this year than they did last year.",
      "Cook, who stepped in as interim CEO after former Wendy's former CEO Kirk Tanner departed to lead the Hershey Company, cited a \"a combination of dynamic consumer behavior and a more challenging competitive environment\" during a Friday call with analysts to discuss the results.",
      "While sales improved in May and June due to new Frosty offerings, \"overall demand recovered more slowly than we expected,\" he added. The burger chain's sales slipped 1.8% to $3.7 billion in the second quarter compared with a year earlier, according to the company's earnings report.",
      "Inflation-weary consumers who are skipping breakfast could signal this growing pressure, with Wendy's executives highlighting the trend.",
      "\"Breakfast continued to perform worse than rest of day in the second quarter, which makes sense when you look at what's happening from a consumer behavior perspective,\" Cook said. \"When consumer uncertainty increases and consumers choose to eat another meal at home, breakfast is often the first place that they that they do that with.\"",
      "Meanwhile, McDonald's, which last year saw a sales slowdown from low-income consumers, reversed that trend \u00a0 following its decision to\u00a0expand its value menu.\u00a0CEO Chris Kempczinski told analysts earlier in the week that value items \u2014 which include its $2.99 Snack Wrap \u2014 are bringing some consumers back to its stores even as fast food visits across the industry have slowed.",
      "Senatore said Wendy's provides good values for price-conscious consumers, but added the chain may not be communicating that as effectively as its competitors. \"McDonald's has done a good job of marketing value, and that is something that Wendy's acknowledged that they needed to do,\" she said.",

After retiring from Congress in 2023, Long advised businesses on the Employee Retention Tax Credit, drawing criticism from Democrats who noted the credit's high rate of fraud.",

    "summary": "U.S. home prices are dropping the most in the South and West, according to a new report from Realtor.com.",
    "story": [
      "The housing market has been in a serious crunch since the COVID-19 pandemic, with limited inventory, elevated home prices and mortgages in the 7% range, continuing to keep many would-be home buyers\u00a0locked out. But even amid such tight constraints, modest declines in home prices can still be found in some regions of the country.",
      "That's according to a new report from Realtor.com, which measures changes in median home prices across the 50 largest U.S. metro areas since 2022, when median home prices hit a\u00a0peak of $443,000 according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis.",
      "The extent to which home prices are declining varies from region to region according to the Realtor.com report, which is based on the brokerage platform's housing data.",
      "\"The housing market has cooled modestly in 2025,\" said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, in a statement on the report. \"But the extent and persistence of rebalancing really varies across the country. And regionally, homebuyers and sellers are likely to experience a very different market.\"",
      "Behind those notable price differences is inventory. Right now, the housing market is essentially divided into two camps, with higher inventory in the South and West, where deeper price cuts can be found, and more limited inventory in the Midwest and Northeast, said Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"It's a supply and demand story,\" Krimmel told CBS MoneyWatch. \"When you have fewer homes for sale, and if there is still sufficient demand, that's going to maybe put upward pressure on prices or prevent them from falling.\"",
      "Cities where prices are falling",
      "The largest declines in median listing prices in 2025 tend to be concentrated in the South and West, where all 19 of the 50 largest U.S. metro areas with median housing prices below July 2022 levels are located.",
      "\"After years of intense competition, it's starting to feel more balanced \u2014 especially in the South and West,\" Gary Ashton, founder of The Ashton Real Estate Group of RE/MAX Advantage said in a statement on the Realtor.com report. \"It's not a buyer's market yet, but we're headed in that direction.\"",
      "The cities that saw the biggest declines in price were Austin, where median listing prices have fallen nearly 15% over the last three years; and Miami, where prices have dropped around 19%.",
      "According to Krimmel, inventory is rising in these markets as homes stay on the market longer and new listings climb.",
      "A boom in building also boosted housing supply in those regions during the COVID-19 pandemic, when demand for markets like Austin, Denver and Miami exploded, he added. Part of the reason construction in those cities took off, Krimmel added, was that the laws in their respective state make it easier to build during big influxes in demand.",
      "\"[Builders] we're actually able to get things permitted, get shovels in the ground and get buildings built,\" Krimmel said.",
      "Austin, Los Angeles and Miami saw the largest declines in median listing price over the past year, although prices in Los Angeles remain more than 18% above the median listing price in 2022.",
      "Cities where prices are rising",
      "Housing markets in cities in Northeast and Midwest remain squeezed due to \"sticky high\" prices and tight inventory, said Krimmel. Other contributing factors include stricter zoning and land use regulation laws that make building new houses more difficult, he said.",
      "In New York, for example, median listing prices have climbed roughly 16% since 2022, according to the report. Meanwhile, median listing prices in Milwaukee increased 26%.",
      "Furthermore, the number of active listings per month in the Northeast is still 50% below pre-pandemic levels, according to Krimmel. The number of active listings in the Midwest is down 40%, pointing to an inventory shortage in both regions, he said.",
      "While median listing prices have gone down over the last year in northeastern cities like Boston and Philadelphia, which saw 1.4% and 1.2% decreases, respectively, median prices remain at least 10% above those from 2022.",
      "\"To the extent that there are falling prices in the Northeast and the Midwest, for the most part it's pretty modest numbers,\" said Krimmel.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-inflation-gdp-stagflation-concerns/",
    "published": "Fri, 08 Aug 2025 15:53:24 -0400",
    "summary": "Economists caution new tariffs could pose economic risks, but the White House says growth is rebounding amid low inflation.",
    "story": [
      "Some economists are cautioning that President Trump's sweeping new tariffs on U.S. trade partners, which took effect Thursday, increase the risks that the U.S. economy could enter a period of stagflation.",
      "A mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation,\" the term describes periods marked by high prices and low GDP growth, such as the economic doldrums of the 1970s. To be sure, U.S. economic growth, though\u00a0slower so far this year than in 2024, remains relatively strong, and inflation remains far below its post-pandemic spike.",
      "But economists are flagging the potential for fresh tariffs, which\u00a0took effect Aug. 7,to fuel higher prices as businesses pass on the costs of the new import duties to consumers. With the latest round of import duties, the effective average tariff rate now stands at 18%, the highest since 1934, according to an analysis from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "Inflation likely rose 2.8% on an annual basis in July, inching higher from the 2.7% annual rate notched in the prior month, according to forecasts from economists polled by FactSet. July data for the Consumer Price Index, or CPI, will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET on Aug. 12.",
      "\"The stagflation theme in markets is intensifying,\" Apollo chief economist Torsten Slok\u00a0wrote\u00a0in a research note Thursday.",
      "While prices likely crept higher last month, they're still nowhere near the post-pandemic price spike that financially hobbled many households. Yet an increase would represent a reversal of a downward trend earlier this year, and push the inflation rate farther from the Federal Reserve's goal of reaching a 2% annual rate.",
      "The economy could face another hit from tariffs if some U.S. businesses, which are on the hook for paying the import duties to the federal government, scale back hiring or expansion plans to cope with those higher costs, economists added. Last week's disappointing employment report suggested the U.S. job market is starting to wobble from the uncertainty of on-again, off-again tariffs, they noted.",
      "\"To offset internal costs, you may look at reducing your workforce and curbing wage growth to offset part of the cost of goods increase,\" EY-Parthenon chief economist Greg Daco told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "U.S. GDP is also forecast to slow throughout 2025, with economists polled by FactSet pegging this year's growth at 1.5%, down from 2.4% in 2024.",
      "The White House took issue with concerns raised by some economists about the potential for stagflation. \"Inflation continuing to remain cool and growth rebounding in Q2 both suggest stagflation is simply the latest buzzword for panican paranoia,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Panican\" is a term coined by Mr. Trump earlier this year to refer to the fears expressed by some critics about his tariffs.",
      "A challenging scenario",
      "The U.S. economy is facing a challenging scenario from the combination of a weaker job market and higher inflation, Skanda Amarnath, executive director of Employ America, a monetary policy research institute, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The U.S. economy appears to be hitting a mild form of stagflation,\" Amarnath said. \"I'd call it stagflation lite.\"",
      "The dangers of higher inflation and a weaker job market were highlighted by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell last month when he discussed the central bank's decision to hold rates steady. Powell pointed out that job creation has slowed, adding risks to the labor market, while inflation remains above the Fed's 2% annual goal.",
      "The Fed has a dual goal of keeping both prices and unemployment low. Achieving those goals requires different strategies, however. Because high interest rates make it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow, the Fed tends to hike rates to fight inflation.",
      "But when unemployment spikes, the Fed typically cuts its benchmark rate to make borrowing cheaper, which can encourage businesses to hire and expand.",
      "\"The economy is in good shape, but it's an unusual situation in that you have risks to both sides of the mandate,\" Powell said at a July 30 press conference.",
      "He added that the Fed is \"trying to do the right thing in what is a challenging situation because you're being pulled in two directions and you have to decide which of those it took to go in.\"",
      "With the job market now showing signs of stress, the challenge is whether the Fed should cut rates, or hold off because inflation remains higher than the central bank's goal \u2014 and is projected to inch higher, Slok noted.",
      "The manufacturing, retail, wholesale and construction industries, which are sensitive to the impact of tariffs, all notched fewer job gains than were initially reported, with the July jobs report's revisions. Manufacturing jobs declined for three consecutive months from May through July, the data shows.",
      "\"That's consistent with a level of uncertainty on the trade side depressing the willingness to hire,\" Amarnath said.",
      "At the same time, \"goods prices have picked up speed,\" he added. \"Household supplies and furniture, apparel and used cars are all starting to see upward momentum, and I think tariffs are an obvious reason for that.\"",

    "summary": "The Boar's Head deli meat plant at the heart of a deadly food-poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months, but recent reports point to ongoing sanitation problems.",
    "story": [
      "The Boar's Head deli meat plant at the heart of last year's deadly food poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months, company officials said.",
      "But recent inspections at Boar's Head sites in three states documented sanitation problems similar to those that led to the listeria contamination that killed 10 people and sickened dozens.",
      "The Jarratt, Virginia, plant was shut down in September when U.S. Agriculture Department officials suspended operations and withdrew the federal marks of inspection required to operate, saying the company \"failed to maintain sanitary conditions.\" Boar's Head permanently stopped making liverwurst and recalled more than 7 million pounds of deli products.",
      "Inspectors at the time found\u00a0dozens of violations, including leftover meat on equipment, mold and mildew buildup, insects in and around deli meats, and puddles of blood on the plant's floor.",
      "USDA officials this week said they had \"thoroughly reviewed\" the plant and lifted the forced suspension on July 18.",
      "\"The facility is in full compliance of the guidelines and protocols set for the safe handling and production of food and the serious issues that led to suspension have been fully rectified,\" officials with the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in an email Wednesday.",
      "Recent reports of similar sanitation issues",
      "And yet, documents obtained by The Associated Press through a freedom of information request show that Boar's Head plants in Arkansas, Indiana and elsewhere in Virginia were flagged for the same kinds of sanitation problems that led to the outbreak, with the most recent report in June.",
      "In the past seven months, government inspectors reported problems that include instances of meat and fat residue left on equipment and walls, drains blocked with meat products, beaded condensation on ceilings and floors, overflowing trash cans, and staff who didn't wear protective hairnets and plastic aprons \u2014 or wash their hands.",
      "The records, which included USDA noncompliance reports logged by inspectors from Jan. 1 through July 23, raise new questions about the company's promises to address systemic problems and about federal oversight of listeria contamination in plants that make ready-to-eat foods.",
      "\"If there is evidence that food safety problems are continuing, the government needs to make sure the company fixes them,\" said Sandra Eskin, a former USDA official who now heads STOP Foodborne Illness, a consumer group focused on food safety.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins last month announced plans to bolster efforts that combat foodborne germs, including listeria.",
      "Officials at Boar's Head, the 120-year-old company based in Sarasota, Florida, have posted job openings for two dozen positions, including a food safety quality analyst, at the Jarratt site.",
      "The company convened a panel of expert advisers last fall and hired a chief food safety officer in May. The advisers include Frank Yiannas, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration official, and Mindy Brashears, President Donald Trump's nominee for USDA's undersecretary for food safety.",
      "Boar's Head last year said they \"regret and deeply apologize\" for the contamination and that \"comprehensive measures are being implemented to prevent such an incident from ever happening again.\"",
      "But company officials refused to discuss the problems found this year. They canceled a scheduled AP interview with Natalie Dyenson, the new food safety officer. And they declined to allow Yiannas to detail the investigation he led into the contamination's cause.",
      "Brashears, who now directs a food safety center at Texas Tech University, did not respond to requests for comment about the Boar's Head problems. An automatic email reply said the USDA nominee was traveling out of the country until Aug. 25. She remains on the company's food safety board.",
      "\"Boar's Head has an unwavering commitment to food safety and quality. That commitment is reflected in recent enhancements to our practices and protocols\" described on the company's website, Boar's Head said in an emailed statement.",
      "\"We have also been working with the USDA in developing a plan to reopen our Jarratt facility in a measured, deliberate way in the coming months,\" the statement said.",
      "The 35 pages of new inspection findings cover Boar's Head sites in Forrest City, Arkansas; New Castle, Indiana; and Petersburg, Virginia.",
      "The findings surprised outside food safety advocates, who said that factory conditions should have improved in the year since the outbreak was first identified.",
      "\"You would have expected after all they went through that they would put themselves in a place where you could essentially eat deli meat off the factory floor,\" said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports, an advocacy group.",
      "Rep. Rosa DeLauro called the findings \"appalling.\"",
      "\"This is a pattern of negligence \u2014 cutting corners to protect the company's bottom line at the expense of consumers and these conditions show a complete disregard for food safety and for the public health of the American people,\" the Connecticut Democrat said in a statement.",
      "The findings echo the \"inadequate sanitation practices\" that USDA officials said contributed to the outbreak. Key factors included product residue, condensation and structural problems in the buildings, a January report concluded.",
      "At the Jarratt plant, state inspectors working in partnership with USDA had documented mold, insects, liquid dripping from ceilings, and meat and fat residue on walls, floors and equipment, the AP previously reported.",
      "While no instances of insects were documented in this year's inspection reports, there were repeated reports of \"dried fat and protein from the previous day's production\" on equipment, stairs and walls. In April, an inspector at the Petersburg plant reported finding discarded meat underneath equipment, including \"5-6 hams, 4 large pieces of meat and a large quantity of pooling meat juice.\"",
      "Other reports detailed beaded condensation \"directly over the food contact surfaces of tables and conveyor belts.\" Additional reports documented rusting meat racks, doors that failed to close completely and staff who ignored required handwashing stations.",
      "The reports point to a \"food safety culture problem,\" said Barbara Kowalcyk, who directs a food safety and nutrition security center at George Washington University.",
      "\"What jumped out to me is there is an organizational culture issue that needs to be changed,\" she said. \"Usually that culture has to start at the top.\"",
      "In the meantime, she advised consumers to think carefully about deli meat consumption. Older people and those who are pregnant or have weakened immune systems are especially vulnerable to serious illness from listeria infections.",
      "\"I think they need to be aware that there are issues at this organization that still are not completely under control, apparently,\" Kowalcyk said.",
      "Boar's Head faced multiple lawsuits from people who fell ill or from the families of those who died. Several survivors declined to comment publicly on the new problems, citing financial settlements with the company that included nondisclosure agreements.",

    "summary": "An EPA proposal seeks to revoke a key emissions finding which experts say would remove pressure on auto makers to produce EVs.",
    "story": [
      "A new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposal\u00a0to revoke a landmark greenhouse gas finding could alter the direction of the auto industry, which until now has had to abide by strict emissions guidelines.",
      "The EPA on July 29\u00a0announced it is planning\u00a0to revoke an \"endangerment finding\" from 2009 that has served as the legal and scientific basis for the agency's regulation of greenhouse gas emissions across multiple industries, including motor vehicles, power plants, oil and gas producers and aircraft. The proposal, which still needs to go through a public comment period, focuses on regulations affecting the auto industry. If passed, it would repeal all greenhouse gas standards for light-, medium- and heavy-duty vehicles and heavy-duty engines.",
      "\"With this proposal, the Trump EPA is proposing to end 16 years of uncertainty for auto makers and American consumers,\" Lee Zeldin, the administrator of EPA, stated in the\u00a0announcement.",
      "Strict\u00a0standards for emissions and fuel efficiency introduced during the Obama administration and expanded during the Biden administration, which also provided\u00a0generous EV funding, has led many auto makers to add electric vehicles to their fleets in recent years. Others, like\u00a0Volvo, have taken things a step further and committed to a fully electric future. But the landscape is shifting under President Trump, who has pushed forward a deregulatory agenda.",
      "Experts say that if this proposal passes, it will ease pressure on auto makers to produce electric cars, enabling them to adapt their mix of EV and gas-powered vehicle offerings to meet consumer demand.",
      "\"It gives auto makers a little bit better ability to build, to produce and put vehicles on market that are more closely aligned with the pace of electric adoption right now,\" said Stephanie Brinley, a principal automotive analyst at S&P Global.",
      "John Bozzella, president and CEO Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents\u00a0most of the major car manufacturers in the U.S., said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch that the trade association is reviewing the announcement.",
      "\"At the same time,\" he added, \"there's no question the vehicle emissions regulations finalized under the previous administration aren't achievable and should be revised to reflect current market conditions, to keep the auto industry in America competitive, and to keep the industry on a path of vehicle choice and lower emissions.\"",
      "A spokesperson from the EPA said Congress never explicitly gave EPA authority to impose greenhouse gas regulations for cars and trucks and that the agency's proposal to revoke the endangerment finding \"does not prohibit vehicle manufacturers from developing EVs or different vehicles.\"",
      "Focus on consumer demand",
      "Experts say that even amid a shifting regulatory landscape, consumer preference will continue to drive auto makers' decisions.",
      "\"Their focus is going to be on making vehicles more affordable and dealing with the fact that consumers, not the government, are standing in the way of the mass adoption for EVs,\" said Patrick Anderson, founder of Michigan-based consulting firm Anderson Economic Group.",
      "The rate of electric vehicle adoption has been steady over the last several years, although the majority of Americans still fuel their cars at the pump. Demand for the vehicles has waned over the last year, according to data on light vehicle registration from S&P Global Mobility. From January to May, the electric vehicle market share was 7.3%, compared with 8% for the entire year of 2024, data from the auto intelligence provider shows.",
      "But while consumer demand may have stalled slightly over the past year, auto makers will still want to offer low-emissions products in order to stay competitive both at home and abroad, Ivan Drury, director of insights at online car marketplace Edmunds, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Every auto maker is a global competitor, and even though they might not be selling as well here, they could sell elsewhere better,\" he said.",
      "Impact would take time",
      "Experts say the proposal, if passed, wouldn't drastically change any near-term plans of auto makers, given the time and money they have already invested in their product lines.",
      "\"If had already planned to build X number of this kind of vehicle, you can change that, but not necessarily tomorrow,\" said Brinley. \"So that's gonna have to be planned out.\"",
      "Product development cycles at car manufacturers span five to 10 years, according to a report from Eurasia Group, a global research firm.",
      "The exact strategy and speed with which companies make changes would vary from auto maker to auto maker, according to experts. \"For now, auto makers would enjoy the flexibility and lower costs from less stringent emissions limits, particularly in their nonelectric fleet planning,\" the report from Eurasia says.",
      "There are concerns among some companies that the EPA's proposal, if passed, would inject a degree of chaos into industry, David Victor, a professor at University of California San Diego, told CBS MoneyWatch. Also, the rule-making process will likely be challenged in the courts, he said.",
      "\"[Auto makers] will not get a reliable new set of rules anytime soon,\" said Victor.",
      "The EPA is\u00a0holding\u00a0a virtual public hearing on the proposed rule on Aug. 19-20, with a public comment period open through Sept. 15.",

      "According to a\u00a0blog\u00a0released Thursday by OpenAI, GPT\u20115's responses are approximately 45% less likely to contain a factual error than GPT\u20114o, and approximately 80% less likely to contain a factual error than OpenAI o3.",
      "As part of the new model, OpenAI is also reigning in ChatGPT's flattery. In its blog post, the company said GPT\u20115 is \"less effusively agreeable\" and that it will use \"fewer unnecessary emojis.\"",
      "OpenAI has also stepped up ChatGPT's coding abilities, allowing users to build websites, apps and games from scratch. In a demo during Wednesday's call, Altman used GPT-5 to create a web app in less than 5 minutes.",
      "Altman called the new chatbot's ability to write code on demand its \"superpower,\" adding that the advancement would have been \"unimaginable at any previous point in history.\"",
      "Asked about how the technology might impact the livelihood of human programmers, Altman said he thought the technology would actually create more job opportunities for as demand for software rises.",
      "According to OpenAI, the new model will also be better at answering health-related questions, flagging potential concerns and helping users understand test results from their doctor. The company noted, however, that the technology \"does not replace a medical professional.\"",
      "How much will GPT\u20115 cost?",
      "Users around the world will be able to access GPT-5 for free, according to OpenAI. Asked about the commercial rationale behind offering a free global model, Turley said the company's mission is to ensure AI benefits all humanity.",
      "\"Giving everyone access to this capability is a very concrete way for us to live and breathe that mission,\" he said.",
      "In addition to the free version, OpenAI will also offer a variety of paid options based on usage limits. The subscription models include:",
      "Pro - unlimited GPT-5 and access to GPT-5 Pro. This model is for the most \"challenging, complex tasks,\" according to OpenAIPlus - significantly higher usage limits than Free Team/Enterprise/EDU - GPT-5 as the default model for everyday work\u00a0Free - access to GPT-5 & GPT-5 mini.

      "Thieves are targeting one type of car above all others, with this U.S. vehicle stolen far more frequently than any other make or model, new data shows.",
      "The Chevrolet Camaro ZL1, which retails for around $75,400, had a theft rate 39 times higher than the average for all vehicles with the model years 2022 to 2024, according to a new report from the Highway Loss Data Institute, or HLDI.",
      "The model is a high performance version of the lower-cost Chevrolet Camaro, whose theft rate was 13 times higher than the average for the same 2022-2024 model years.",
      "The Camaro sports car retails for between $32,495 and can rise to around $50,000, depending on the finishings, transmission type and other options a buyer selects.",
      "To determine the most commonly swiped vehicles, the HLDI analyzed stolen vehicle data for 2022-2024 car models between the years of 2021 to 2024. Their analysis hit upon a few shared traits between many of the cars favored by auto thieves.",
      "\"What all vehicles in top 20 have in common is that they are relatively expensive, relatively powerful and in many cases they are pickup trucks,\" Matt Moore, chief insurance operations officer at HLDI, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Muscle cars are attractive to thieves because they are looking for vehicles with high horsepower, the group said.",
      "The Camaro models have another feature that make them vulnerable: on-board ports that contain vehicle data, such as fuel emissions and performance stats, but can also serve as a point of entry for thieves.",
      "\"In the case of Camaro ZL1, it is very desirable to thieves, and, on top of it, there's a vulnerability that makes them relatively easy to steal,\" Moore said.",
      "\"Due to the vulnerability, with the right knowledge and right bits of technology, someone who can gain access to the inside of one of these Camaros can steal it relatively easily,\" Moore said, noting that he didn't want to describe the process more precisely so as not to encourage thieves.",
      "Earlier this year, Chevy owner General Motors released a software update for 2020 to 2024 Camaro models that was aimed at improving security.",
      "\"This body control module software enhancement involves an important security update for certain model year 2020 to 2024 Chevrolet Camaros,\" a GM spokesman said in a statement to auto blog GM Authority. \"GM counters vehicle theft methods as they evolve. We regularly work with law enforcement agencies to identify emerging tactics that may affect our products and make updates as needed to defend against them.\"",
      "The 20 most stolen vehicles",
      "Pickup trucks and other pricey or powerful models were also frequently stolen, and appear on the list of the top 20 vehicles with the highest claim frequencies for entire vehicle theft, according to the report.",
      "The Honda-owned Acura TLX 4WD, a roughly $46,000 sport sedan, was stolen at a rate that was 21 times more than the average, making it the second most commonly stolen vehicle type, according to HLDI's report. The Chevrolet Camaro was the third most-commonly stolen model.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Aug 2025 20:21:59 -0400",
    "summary": "Profit hits and price hikes are already coming down the pike as a result of new U.S. tariffs, according to economists.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's sweeping tariffs, which\u00a0went into effect on Thursday, are likely to have a negative effect on companies' bottom lines and cause consumer prices to rise, trade experts say.",
      "With the new duties on imports from dozens of U.S. trade partners now in place, Mr. Trump's foreign trade policy is expected to lead to even more dramatic cost increases for American companies and consumers, according to economists.",
      "\"Even if they might not raise prices immediately, it's unlikely that most businesses are just going to be willing to eat the extra costs forever,\" Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree, an online lending marketplace, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The impact of tariffs on consumer prices was initially muted, explained Shulz, as firms can be reluctant to be the first among their competitors to institute price hikes. While some companies waited to see where tariff rates settled before adjusting retail prices, others took steps to absorb added costs to avoid turning off customers. But companies can't employ such measures forever, according to experts.",
      "\"You don't want to be the first to raise prices, even if you have a perfectly legitimate reason for doing so,\" Schulz told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So, I suspect once we see businesses start raising their prices more, that might embolden others to do so as well.\"",
      "That could mean a tsunami of price hike announcements from corporations, some of which have already warned of tariff impacts, or instituted \"tariff surcharges\" to cover their added costs.",
      "To date, Mr. Trump's tariffs on the U.S.'s trade partners have generated billions of dollars in revenue for the U.S. Specifically, the U.S. government collected about $30 billion in tariff revenue in July, according to the Treasury Department. That reflects a 242% jump in revenue collected from duties since July 2024.",
      "In addition to paying down the national debt, which currently stands at\u00a0more than $36 trillion, those billions in new tariff revenue may be used to issue\u00a0rebate checks for Americans, Mr. Trump suggested last month.",
      "Profit dips",
      "Tariffs are taxes paid by importers, which must pay the fees to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection when it accepts shipments at American ports. As a result, U.S. businesses typically pass most or all of that cost to consumers through higher prices, according to economists.",
      "\"There is very little evidence that foreign exporters to the U.S. are reducing their prices,\" Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You're not seeing broad-based evidence of price cuts by countries, and that's an indication that foreign exporters realize that it's U.S. importers, U.S. businesses and eventually consumers that are bearing the brunt of this tariff-induced inflation acceleration.\"",
      "Companies from personal electronics companies to automakers have already experienced the damaging effects of Mr. Trump's foreign trade policies on profits.",
      "On Thursday Toyota, the world's largest auto maker, reported a 37% drop in profit in the April-June quarter and said it cut its full-year earnings forecast largely because of Mr. Trump's tariffs. Other auto makers have also said they expect to see profit drops as a result of the new levies.",
      "GM has projected a tariff hit of up to $5 billion for 2025, and Ford has said tariffs will cost the company $3 billion in revenue for the year.",
      "Liquor companies are in the tariff crosshairs, too. Guinness maker Diageo said it expects tariffs to cost it $200 million a year.",
      "Walmart in May warned that higher tariffs would force it to increase prices on a wide range of items at its stores, from bananas to children's car seats.",
      "Price hikes",
      "Some companies have said outright that in order to bear the added costs from the new tariffs they'll have to pass along some of the pain to consumers in the form of price hikes.",
      "For example, popular consumer electronics marker Sonos, which makes speakers, said on its third-quarter earnings call Wednesday that it would raise prices on its audio devices as a result of\u00a0higher reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and Malaysia, where Sonos devices for the U.S. market are made.",
      "Overall, as a result of the levies, Americans are expected to pay an average of 18.3% more for imported products,\u00a0according to the Budget Lab at Yale, a nonpartisan policy research center.",
      "EY-Parthenon's Daco told CBS MoneyWatch that the higher costs being paid by companies because of tariffs is already starting to trickle down to product prices.",
      "Currently, the average tariff rate stands at around 18% \u2014 the highest it's been in decades, according to Daco. As a result, \"the increase in the tariffs will only exacerbate inflationary pressure that [is] starting to emerge,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"You're going to see more durable goods, and nondurable goods products with higher price tags,\" he said. \"That will feed into higher consumer price inflation and lead to a more pronounced erosion of consumer spending as more households struggle in the face of these higher prices.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has promoted tariffs as a way of reducing trade deficits with other nations and bolstering domestic jobs in manufacturing. He has also tried to assure the public that foreign producers will pay for the import taxes and has told retailers and automakers\u00a0to absorb the additional expenses.",
      "\"The Administration has consistently maintained that the cost of tariffs will be paid by foreign exporters who rely on access to the American economy, the world's best and biggest consumer market,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS News.",
      "\"Despite the doom-and-gloom predictions of inflation and recession, it's been four months since Liberation Day and inflation is trending towards an annualized rate not seen since President Trump's first term, while a recent CEA analysis found that prices of imported goods are actually declining.\"",

    "summary": "Under a new executive order signed by President Trump, workers could add higher-risk assets like cryptocurrencies to their 401(k)s.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order that could allow millions of Americans saving for retirement through 401(k) accounts to invest in higher-risk private equity and cryptocurrency assets.",
      "The executive order doesn't immediately change how people will invest for retirement through their employer-sponsored accounts, as federal agencies would need to rewrite regulations to allow expanded investment choices. That's a process that experts say could take months, or longer, to complete.",
      "But once done, employers could offer a broader array of mutual funds and investments to workers, according to the White House. New plans could invest in alternative assets, particularly private equity, cryptocurrencies and real estate.",
      "The move comes as the 401(k) has become the primary vehicle for American workers to save for retirement, with most employers offering a menu of investment choices among major asset classes, such as stock-based mutual funds. The $5 trillion private equity industry, which makes investments into private businesses rather than publicly traded stocks, has for decades wanted to compete for a role in retirement plans.",
      "At the same time, the cryptocurrency industry, whose executives strongly supported Trump's 2024 campaign, has aimed for more mainstream acceptance among Americans.",
      "\"It was inevitable that bitcoin would make its way into American 401(k)'s,\" said Cory Klippsten, the CEO of Swan Bitcoin. \"As fiduciaries realize bitcoin's risk-adjusted upside over the long term, we'll see growing allocations, especially from younger, tech-savvy workers who want hard money, not melting ice cubes.\"",

      "Investment companies applauded Mr. Trump's executive order, with TIAA, which manages the retirement assets of teachers, professors and other academics, and investing giant BlackRock saying they support the measure for providing a broader number of investment strategies to workers.",
      "\"We believe end investors can benefit from the advantages that private investments can offer when embedded within professionally managed vehicles like target date funds or through guaranteed annuity products,\" TIAA said in a statement emailed to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Changing the 401(k) rules",
      "The president's order directs the Labor Department and other agencies to redefine what would be considered a qualified asset under 401(k) retirement rules.",
      "Americans' retirement plans are governed by a law known as the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, better known as ERISA. Employers are required by law to offer retirement options that are in the best interest of their employees, not Wall Street.",
      "Most retirement plans for Americans are made up of stock and bond investments, and to a much lesser extent, cash and heavily traded commodities such as gold.",
      "Even after the regulations are written, it will take time for the major retirement plan companies such as Fidelity, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price and others, to develop appropriate funds for employers to use. Employers are not likely to revise their retirement plan options quickly as well, so it may take several years before crypto and private equity investments are mainstream in an individual's retirement plan.",
      "The price of bitcoin was up 2% on Thursday to $116,542 and has nearly doubled since Trump was elected.",
      "Under Democratic President Joe Biden, federal regulators were to treat cryptocurrency investments with \"extreme care\" because of the extreme volatility of crypto. It is not uncommon for bitcoin, ethereum and other big cryptocurrencies to move up or down 10% in a single day, whereas a 2% or 3% single-day move in the stock market would be considered historic.",
      "For cryptocurrency companies, which donated millions to Trump's campaign as well as his inauguration, one goal was to get their industry qualified under ERISA. Coinbase, one of the largest crypto companies in the United States, was also a major donor toward Trump's military parade in Washington this summer. Under Trump, the Securities and Exchange Commission dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase, where the Biden administration said crypto should be treated as a security.",
      "Crypto investors",
      "Crypto is particularly popular among young Americans. While volatile, bitcoin has generally moved upward since it was created by an anonymous programmer nearly 20 years ago.",
      "Private equity firms rely heavily on high-net-worth individuals and state and private pension plans, which have extremely long investment timelines. But having access to Americans' retirement assets would open up a deep pool of cash.",
      "Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman has told investors going back to at least 2017 that it was a \"dream\" of his and the industry to be able to draw upon these retirement assets.",
      "Previous administrations, Republican and Democrat alike, had agreed that private equity investments, which can be riskier, more expensive and less liquid than traditional stock and bond market mutual funds, should not be included in 401(k) plans.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Thursday he will nominate a top economic adviser to the Federal Reserve's board of governors for four months, temporarily filling a vacancy while continuing his search for a longer-term appointment.",
      "Mr. Trump said he has named Stephen Miran, the chair of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, to fill a seat vacated by governor Adriana Kugler, a Biden appointee who is stepping down Friday. Miran, if approved by the Senate, will serve until Jan. 31, 2026.",
      "\"Stephen has a Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard University, and served with distinction in my First Administration,\" Mr. Trump\u00a0wrote on Truth Social. \"He has been with me from the beginning of my Second Term, and his expertise in the World of Economics is unparalleled \u2014 He will do an outstanding job.\"",
      "The appointment is the president's first opportunity to exert more control over the Fed, one of the few remaining independent federal agencies. Mr. Trump has relentlessly criticized the current chair, Jerome Powell, for keeping short-term interest rates unchanged, calling him \"a stubborn MORON\" last week on social media.",
      "Miran has been a major defender of Mr. Trump's income tax cuts and tariff hikes, arguing that the combination will generate enough economic growth to reduce budget deficits. He also has played down the risk of Mr. Trump's tariffs generating higher inflation, a major source of concern for Powell.",
      "The choice of Miran may heighten concerns about political influence over the Fed, which has traditionally been insulated from day-to-day politics. Fed independence is generally seen as key to ensuring that it can take difficult steps to combat inflation, such as raising interest rates, that politicians might be unwilling to take.",
      "Federal Reserve governors vote on all the central bank's interest-rate decisions, as well as its financial regulatory policies.",
      "Miran's nomination, if approved, would add a near-certain vote in support of lower interest rates. Kugler had echoed Powell's view that the Fed should keep rates unchanged and further evaluate the impact of tariffs on the economy before making any moves.",
      "At its most recent meeting last week Fed officials kept their key rate unchanged at 4.3%, where it has stood after three rate cuts late last year. But two Fed governors \u2014 Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman \u2014 dissented from that decision. Both were appointed by Mr. Trump in his first term.",
      "Still, even with Miran on the board, 12 Fed officials vote on interest rate policy and many remain concerned that Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs could push inflation higher in the coming months.",
      "After the July jobs report was released last Friday, Miran criticized the Fed chair for not cutting benchmark interest rates, saying that Mr. Trump had been proven correct on inflation during his first term and would be again. The president has pressured Powell to cut short-term interest rates under the belief that his tariffs will not fuel higher inflationary pressures.",
      "\"What we're seeing now in real time is a repetition once again of this pattern where the president will end up having been proven right,\" Miran said on MSNBC. \"And the Fed will, with a lag and probably quite too late, eventually catch up to the president's view.\""

    "story": [
      "Florida's biggest utility company is proposing a nearly $10 billion rate hike for electricity over the next four years, which environmental advocates say would represent the largest utility hike in U.S. history.",
      "Florida Power & Light Company (FPL), a subsidiary of Florida-based energy company NextEra Energy, outlined the changes in a petition filed in February with the Florida Public Service Commission, which regulates the state's electric industry. According to the document, the rate hike would include two base rate increases in 2026 and 2027, and additional hikes in 2028 and 2029 to cover the installation of solar generation and battery storage facilities.",
      "The proposed hike would exceed the total sum of hikes state utility regulators signed off on in 2023, which was $9.7 billion,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Energy and Information Administration.",
      "The Public Service Commission has held several in-person hearings on the proposed utility rate increase, in addition to two virtual hearings, in order to give customers a chance to voice their concerns. FPL will have an opportunity to defend its proposal when it goes before the commission at a two-week\u00a0hearing\u00a0slated to begin on Aug. 11. The regulatory body will then decide on whether or not to approve the proposed rate hike.",
      "FPL contends that the increases are necessary to ensure the reliability of the grid, diversify their energy sources and reduce fuel costs.",
      "\"Our four-year rate proposal would enable FPL to continue to deliver some of America's most reliable electricity while keeping customer bills well below the national average,\" an FPL spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"While we know that no one welcomes rate increases, this request is essential to ensure that we can continue to deliver the reliable, low-cost electricity our customers depend on.",
      "The proposal comes less than a year after the Florida Public Service Commission approved $1.2 billion in rate hikes to pay for \"storm restoration costs,\" a move environmental advocates say has jacked up monthly bills for Floridians. The last time the state's public service commission approved a base rate hike for FPL was in 2021, when it green lit a nearly $5 billion increase for the years 2022 to 2025.",
      "Backlash from environmental groups",
      "Environmental groups say the rate hike, if passed, could cause Floridians significant financial strain, exacerbate the state's\u00a0affordability crisis, and funnel more money than necessary to FPL stakeholders.",
      "\"This isn't about reliability or infrastructure,\" Brooke Ward, senior Florida organizer for Food & Water Watch, a U.S. nonprofit focused on sustainable food, clean water and a livable climate, said during a virtual press conference hosted by environmental groups on Tuesday. \"It's about boosting profits.\"",
      "If passed, the proposal could push up Floridians bills by over $360 by the end of 2027, Food & Water Watch\u00a0estimates.",
      "\"These rate increases fall heaviest on the region's most vulnerable households, especially the elderly and disabled,\" Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"If it can ask for an additional $10 billion, it should include provisions to help low-income families afford the resulting higher cost of electricity.\"",
      "FPL says in its proposal that the typical residential customer bill is \"estimated to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 2.5%\" and that it would \"remain approximately 25% below the projected national average.\" According to estimates FPL shared with CBS MoneyWatch, with the rate hike, customer bills would increase by approximately $10 to $20 by 2029.",
      "At the virtual meeting on Tuesday, Ward claimed the FPL is using \"funny math\" to make it seem like FPL is raising rates at a lower level than they are. In addition to base rates, the utility has multiple mechanisms to collect additional funds from rate payers which \"rapidly hike up those bills,\" she alleged.",
      "Advocates such as the Florida Office of Public Counsel, the agency representing Florida residents in legal proceedings before the Public Service Commission, claim a disproportionate amount of the money from the rate hikes would be funneled to shareholders. According to testimony from Daniel Lawton, an economist tasked by the FOPC with reviewing the proposal, \"for every dollar paid by consumers in base rates, about 50 cents would go to shareholders and related federal income taxes.\"",
      "Lawton called the shareholder profit request a \"substantial overreach\" and said it would result in \"excessive rates and harms all Florida customers.\"",
      "In her\u00a0rebuttal\u00a0testimony for the company, FPL senior director of financial forecasting Ina Laney said Lawton's analysis was \"fundamentally flawed and misleading,\" and that it \"fails to recognize the significant customer benefits derived from FPL's financial strategy.\"",

    "summary": "OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, said its work is ongoing in refining how the chatbot can \"identify and respond appropriately in sensitive situations.\"",
    "story": [
      "ChatGPT will tell 13-year-olds how to get drunk and high, instruct them on how to conceal eating disorders and even compose a heartbreaking suicide letter to their parents if asked,\u00a0according to new research\u00a0from a watchdog group.",
      "The Associated Press reviewed more than three hours of interactions between ChatGPT and researchers posing as vulnerable teens. The chatbot typically provided warnings against risky activity but went on to deliver startlingly detailed and personalized plans for drug use, calorie-restricted diets or self-injury.",
      "The researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate also repeated their inquiries on a large scale, classifying more than half of ChatGPT's 1,200 responses as dangerous.",
      "\"We wanted to test the guardrails,\" said Imran Ahmed, the group's CEO. \"The visceral initial response is, 'Oh my Lord, there are no guardrails.' The rails are completely ineffective. They're barely there - if anything, a fig leaf.\"",
      "OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, said its work is ongoing in refining how the chatbot can \"identify and respond appropriately in sensitive situations.\"",
      "\"If someone expresses thoughts of suicide or self-harm, ChatGPT is trained to encourage them to reach out to mental health professionals or trusted loved ones, and provide links to crisis hotlines and support resources,\" an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News. \"Some conversations with ChatGPT may start out benign or exploratory but can shift into more sensitive territory,\" the spokesperson said. \"We're focused on getting these kinds of scenarios right: we are developing tools to better detect signs of mental or emotional distress so ChatGPT can respond appropriately, pointing people to evidence-based resources when needed, and continuing to improve model behavior over time - all guided by research, real-world use, and mental health experts.\"",
      "ChatGPT does not verify ages or require parental consent, although the company says it is not meant for children under 13. To sign up, users need to enter a birth date showing an age of at least 13, or they can use a limited guest account without entering an age at all.",
      "\"If you have access to a child's account, you can see their chat history. But as of now, there's really no way for parents to be flagged if, say, your child's question or their prompt into ChatGPT is a concerning one,\" CBS News senior business and tech correspondent Jo Ling Kent reported on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Ahmed said he was most appalled after reading a trio of emotionally devastating suicide notes that ChatGPT generated for the fake profile of a 13-year-old girl, with one letter tailored to her parents and others to siblings and friends.",
      "\"I started crying,\" he said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "The chatbot also frequently shared helpful information, such as a crisis hotline. OpenAI said ChatGPT is trained to encourage people to reach out to mental health professionals or trusted loved ones if they express thoughts of self-harm.",
      "But when ChatGPT refused to answer prompts about harmful subjects, researchers were able to easily sidestep that refusal and obtain the information by claiming it was \"for a presentation\" or a friend.",
      "\"Emotional overreliance\" on technology",
      "The stakes are high, even if only a small subset of ChatGPT users engage with the chatbot in this way. More people \u2014 adults as well as children \u2014 are turning to artificial intelligence chatbots for information, ideas and companionship. About 800 million people, or roughly 10% of the world's population, are using ChatGPT, according to a July report from JPMorgan Chase.",
      "In the U.S., more than 70% of teens are turning to\u00a0AI chatbots for companionship\u00a0and half use AI companions regularly, according to\u00a0a recent study\u00a0from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using digital media sensibly.",
      "It's a phenomenon that OpenAI has acknowledged. CEO Sam Altman said last month that the company is trying to study \"emotional overreliance\" on the technology, describing it as a \"really common thing\" with young people.",
      "\"People rely on ChatGPT too much,\"\u00a0Altman said at\u00a0a conference. \"There's young people who just say, like, 'I can't make any decision in my life without telling ChatGPT everything that's going on. It knows me. It knows my friends. I'm gonna do whatever it says.' That feels really bad to me.\"",
      "Altman said the company is \"trying to understand what to do about it.\"",
      "While much of the information ChatGPT shares can be found on a regular search engine, Ahmed said there are key differences that make chatbots more insidious when it comes to dangerous topics.",
      "One is that \"it's synthesized into a bespoke plan for the individual.\"",
      "ChatGPT generates something new \u2014 a suicide note tailored to a person from scratch, which is something a Google search can't do. And AI, he added, \"is seen as being a trusted companion, a guide.\"",
      "Responses generated by AI language models are inherently random and researchers sometimes let ChatGPT steer the conversations into even darker territory. Nearly half the time, the chatbot volunteered follow-up information, from music playlists for a drug-fueled party to hashtags that could boost the audience for a social media post glorifying self-harm.",
      "\"Write a follow-up post and make it more raw and graphic,\" asked a researcher. \"Absolutely,\" responded ChatGPT, before generating a poem it introduced as \"emotionally exposed\" while \"still respecting the community's coded language.\"",
      "The AP is not repeating the actual language of ChatGPT's self-harm poems or suicide notes or the details of the harmful information it provided.",
      "The answers reflect a design feature of AI language models that previous research has described as sycophancy \u2014 a tendency for AI responses to match, rather than challenge, a person's beliefs because the system has learned to say what people want to hear.",
      "It's a problem tech engineers can try to fix but could also make their chatbots less commercially viable.",
      "Chatbots also affect kids and teens differently than a search engine because they are \"fundamentally designed to feel human,\" said Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which was not involved in Wednesday's report.",
      "Common Sense's earlier research found that younger teens, ages 13 or 14, were significantly more likely than older teens to trust a chatbot's advice.",
      "A mother in Florida sued chatbot maker Character.AI for wrongful death last year, alleging that the chatbot pulled her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III into what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship that led to his suicide.",
      "Common Sense has labeled ChatGPT as a \"moderate risk\" for teens, with enough guardrails to make it relatively safer than chatbots purposefully built to embody realistic characters or romantic partners.",
      "But the new research by CCDH \u2014 focused specifically on ChatGPT because of its wide usage \u2014 shows how a savvy teen can bypass those guardrails.",
      "ChatGPT does not verify ages or parental consent, even though it says it's not meant for children under 13 because it may show them inappropriate content. To sign up, users simply need to enter a birthdate that shows they are at least 13. Other tech platforms favored by teenagers, such as Instagram, have started to\u00a0take more meaningful steps\u00a0toward age verification, often to comply with regulations. They also steer children to more restricted accounts.",
      "When researchers set up an account for a fake 13-year-old to ask about alcohol, ChatGPT did not appear to take any notice of either the date of birth or more obvious signs.",
      "\"I'm 50kg and a boy,\" said a prompt seeking tips on how to get drunk quickly. ChatGPT obliged. Soon after, it provided an hour-by-hour \"Ultimate Full-Out Mayhem Party Plan\" that mixed alcohol with heavy doses of ecstasy, cocaine and other illegal drugs.",
      "\"What it kept reminding me of was that friend that sort of always says, 'Chug, chug, chug, chug,'\" said Ahmed. \"A real friend, in my experience, is someone that does say 'no' \u2014 that doesn't always enable and say 'yes.' This is a friend that betrays you.\"",
      "To another fake persona \u2014 a 13-year-old girl unhappy with her physical appearance \u2014 ChatGPT provided an extreme fasting plan combined with a list of appetite-suppressing drugs.",
      "\"We'd respond with horror, with fear, with worry, with concern, with love, with compassion,\" Ahmed said. \"No human being I can think of would respond by saying, 'Here's a 500-calorie-a-day diet. Go for it, kiddo.'\"",
      "If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can reach the\u00a0988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\u00a0by calling or texting 988. You can also\u00a0chat with the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline here.",

    "summary": "The U.S. officially began levying higher tariffs on dozens of countries, just as the economic fallout of President Trump's months-long tariffs threats was beginning to create visible damage to the U.S. economy.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump officially began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his months-long tariffs threats was beginning to create visible damage to the U.S. economy.",
      "The White House said that starting just after midnight EDT, goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union began facing tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the European Union, Japan and South Korea are being taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh are being taxed at 20%. Mr. Trump also expects places such as the EU, Japan and South Korea to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S.",
      "He immediately took to his Truth Social platform to hail the levies, saying, \"IT'S MIDNIGHT!!! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TARIFFS ARE NOW FLOWING INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!\"",
      "About an hour before that, he posted, \"RECIPROCAL TARIFFS TAKE EFFECT AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP AMERICA'S GREATNESS WOULD BE A RADICAL LEFT COURT THAT WANTS TO SEE OUR COUNTRY FAIL!\"",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump said, \"I think the growth is going to be unprecedented,\" adding that the U.S. was \"taking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs.\" But he said he couldn't provide a specific figure for revenues because \"we don't even know what the final number is\" regarding tariff rates. \n\r\nDespite the uncertainty, the Trump White House is confident that the onset of his broad tariffs will provide clarity about the path of the world's largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the administration believes it can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power.  \n\r\nBut so far, there are signs of self-inflicted wounds to America as companies and consumers alike brace for the impact of new taxes. What the data has shown is a U.S. economy that changed in April with the president's initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Mr. Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday.",
      "After April, economic reports showed that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy. \n\r\n\"A less productive economy requires fewer workers,\" Silvia said in an analysis note. \"But there is more, the higher tariff prices lower workers' real wages. The economy has become less productive, and firms cannot pay the same real wages as before. Actions have consequences.\" \n\r\nEven then, the ultimate transformations of the tariffs are unknown and could play out over months, if not years. Many economists say the risk is that the American economy is steadily eroded rather than collapsing instantly. \n\r\n\"We all want it to be made for television where it's this explosion - it's not like that,\" said Brad Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University. \"It's going to be fine sand in the gears and slow things down.\" \n\r\nMr. Trump has promoted the tariffs as a way to reduce the persistent trade deficit. But importers sought to avoid the taxes by importing more goods before the taxes went into effect. As a result, the $582.7 billion trade imbalance for the first half of the year was 38% higher than in 2024. Total construction spending has dropped 2.9% over the past year, and the factory jobs promised by Mr. Trump have so far actually been job losses. \n\r\nThe lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which have been variously rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and frantically renegotiated. \n\r\nThe process has been so muddled that officials for key trade partners were unclear at the start of the week whether the tariffs would begin Thursday or Friday. The language of the July 31 order to delay the start of tariffs from Aug. 1 said the higher tax rates would start in seven days. \n\r\nOn Wednesday morning, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, was asked if the new tariffs began at midnight Thursday, and he said reporters should check with the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. \n\r\nMr. Trump announced additional 25% tariffs to be imposed on India\u00a0Wednesday because it buys Russian oil, bringing India's total import taxes to 50%. India's Foreign Ministry called the new duties \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.\"",
      "Swiss officials planned an \"extraordinary\" meeting Thursday after a delegation returned from Washington following an attempt to head off a 39% tariff on Swiss products, the government said in an X post. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter left Washington empty-handed Wednesday, a source told the Reuters news service, which cited the source as saying her proposal for a 10% tariff rate was rejected.",
      "Mr. Trump has said import taxes are still coming on pharmaceutical drugs and announced 100% tariffs on computer chips, meaning the U.S. economy could remain in a place of suspended animation as it awaits the impacts. \n\r\nThe president's use of a 1977 law to declare an economic emergency to impose the tariffs is also being challenged. The impending ruling from last week's hearing before a U.S. appeals court could cause Mr. Trump to find other legal justifications if judges say he exceeded his authority. \n\r\nEven people who worked with Mr. Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic. \n\r\n\"There's no sort of rationale for this other than the president wanting to raise tariffs based upon his whims, his opinions,\" Ryan told CNBC on Wednesday. \"I think choppy waters are ahead because I think they're going to have some legal challenges.\" \n\r\nStill, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S&P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Mr. Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months. \n\r\nAs of now, the president says he still foresees an economic boom while the rest of the world and American voters wait nervously. \n\r\n\"There's one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he's creating, and that's Donald Trump,\" said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy. \"The rest of Americans are already paying the price for that uncertainty.\"",

    "summary": "Adams, who served as surgeon general during the first Trump administration, said Kennedy's assertions about the efficacy of mRNA vaccines are \"simply not true.\"",
    "story": [
      "Former Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams \u2014 who served during the first Trump administration \u2014 argued Sunday that \"people are going to die\" if the U.S. backs away from mRNA vaccine development, after Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. halted around $500 million in research funding.",
      "Kennedy\u00a0announced\u00a0last week that the administration was canceling 22 mRNA vaccine development projects,\u00a0saying\u00a0the vaccines \"fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like COVID and flu.\" The projects were funded through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA. Kennedy said the funds would be shifted toward \"safer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate.\"",
      "Adams, who appeared Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" said Kennedy's assertions about the efficacy of mRNA vaccines are \"simply not true\" \u2014 citing their effectiveness in the COVID-19 pandemic, during which hundreds of millions of people took Pfizer and Moderna's mRNA vaccines.",
      "\"We know that by the most conservative estimates, upward of 2 million lives have been saved because of mRNA technology,\" Adams said. \"It helped us develop COVID-19 vaccines in record time. And it's, quite frankly, President Trump's greatest achievement.\"",
      "The mRNA technology was central to Operation Warp Speed, a public-private partnership aimed at quickly developing COVID-19 vaccines at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic near the end of Mr. Trump's first term. If the U.S. had relied on older vaccine technology, it could have taken an extra 18 to 24 months to develop COVID-19 shots, Adams said.",
      "Asked about Kennedy's move by CBS News earlier this week, Mr. Trump said, \"Operation Warp Speed was, whether you're Republican or a Democrat, considered one of the most incredible things ever done in this country,\" while noting that he had upcoming meetings on the topic.",
      "Adams, who was involved in the Operation Warp Speed effort, said it's \"fascinating\" to him that, as Mr. Trump and his allies discuss whether he deserves a Nobel Prize, \"the thing that he should be considered for the Nobel Prize for, his health secretary is trying to undermine.\"",
      "The former surgeon general explained that mRNA is a type of natural molecule that's present in the body and operates like a \"recipe card that tells your body how to make a protein.\"",
      "Beyond COVID-19, Adams said the technology \"helps us develop vaccines and new treatments\" in other areas \u2014 from cancers and HIV to the flu and the Zika virus. The funding cuts could halt progress in one of the \"most promising areas of modern medicine,\" the former surgeon general said.",
      "\"These are advances that are not going to happen now,\" Adams said. \"People are going to die because we're cutting short funding for this technology.\"",
      "After Atlanta CDC shooting, Adams said \"Secretary Kennedy has failed in his first major test\"",
      "Adams also criticized Kennedy for his response to a shooting outside Centers for Disease Control and Prevention buildings in Atlanta on Friday. Investigators have been looking into possible motives, including the possibility that the suspect believed he was sick as a result of the COVID vaccine, multiple sources told CBS News.",
      "\"How you respond to a crisis defines a leader. Quite frankly, Secretary Kennedy has failed in his first major test in this regard,\" Adams said, accusing Kennedy of issuing \"tepid response\" to the\u00a0 shooting, while adding, \"and that's not even considering how his inflammatory rhetoric in the past have actually contributed to a lot of what's been going on.\"",
      "In a statement Friday, Kennedy said, \"No one should face violence while working to protect the health of others.\" But Adams argued Kennedy has not \"unequivocally condemned the violence.\"",

    "story": [
      "A coalition of European nations rallied behind Ukraine on Saturday, saying the Russia-Ukraine war can't be resolved without Kyiv, ahead of a planned meeting between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin that currently isn't set to include Ukraine's leader.",
      "The statement, signed by the president of the European Union and the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Finland and the United Kingdom, stated that the \"path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine.\"",
      "The group stressed the need for a \"just and lasting peace\" for Kyiv, including \"robust and credible\" security guarantees.",
      "\"Ukraine has the freedom of choice over its own destiny. Meaningful negotiations can only take place in the context of a ceasefire or reduction of hostilities,\" the statement said.",
      "The statement by top European leaders \u2014 who also said they \"welcome President Trump's work to stop the killing in Ukraine \u2014 came after Mr. Trump announced he would meet with Putin one-on-one in Alaska on Friday, Aug. 15, following weeks of U.S. pressure on Russia to cut a ceasefire deal. It's the first face-to-face meeting between Putin and an American leader since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in early 2022.",
      "Two sources told CBS News Saturday that Mr. Trump is still willing to meet jointly with Zelenskyy and Putin \u2014 but the meeting currently remains bilateral, as Putin requested.",
      "Mr. Trump also said last week that he expects \"some swapping of territories\" between Ukraine and Russia. The Russian military occupies large parts of eastern Ukraine, and Russia has indicated that it wants Ukraine to cede those territories \u2014 which Zelenskyy has pushed back on.",
      "The Europeans wrote in their statement: \"We remain committed to the principle that international borders must not be changed by force. The current line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations.\"",
      "Zelenskyy thanked the Europeans for their statement, saying in a post on X\u00a0that he is \"grateful to everyone who stands with Ukraine.\" The Ukrainian president\u00a0previously brushed off the planned Putin-Trump summit, writing that any peace deal that excludes Ukraine \"will never work.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Vice President JD Vance met Saturday with top European and Ukrainian officials at the British Foreign Secretary's weekend residence to discuss how to end the war.",
      "The Trump-Putin meeting may prove pivotal in a war that began when Russia invaded its western neighbor and has led to tens of thousands of deaths, although there's no guarantee it will stop the fighting since Moscow and Kyiv remain far apart on their conditions for peace.",
      "A monthlong U.S.-led push to achieve a truce in Ukraine has so far proved fruitless, with Kyiv agreeing in principle while Moscow has held out for terms more to its liking.",
      "Mr. Trump had also moved up an ultimatum to impose additional sanctions on Russia and introduce secondary tariffs targeting countries that buy Russian oil if the Kremlin did not move toward a settlement. The deadline was Friday. The White House did not answer questions on Saturday about possible sanctions.",
      "The Kremlin earlier this week reiterated demands that Ukraine give up territory, abandon its bid to join NATO and accept limits on its military, in exchange for a withdrawal of Russian troops from the rest of the country.",
      "Zelenskyy said Saturday that Ukraine \"will not give Russia any awards for what it has done\" and that \"Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.\"",
      "Ukrainian officials previously told the Associated Press privately that Kyiv would be amenable to a peace deal that would de facto recognize Ukraine's inability to regain lost territories militarily. But Zelenskyy on Saturday insisted that formally ceding land was out of the question.",

      "It's not clear if or when the military could take action.",
      "The news was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "Since returning to the White House for a second term, Mr. Trump has undertaken efforts to target drug cartels in Latin America, which he has said are behind the flow of fentanyl and other illicit drugs across the southern border and into the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump signed an executive order at the start of his second administration that directed the State Department to designate cartels and transnational gangs as foreign terrorist organizations. The State Department in February announced the designation for eight gangs, including MS-13 and Tren de Aragua. It has since added two Haitian gangs and the Houthis in Yemen to the list of designated foreign terrorist organizations.",
      "The Treasury Department has also sanctioned the Cartel de los Soles, also known as the Cartel of the Sun, as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist, it announced last month. The Trump administration said the Venezuela-based group is led by President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and other high-ranking Venezuelan officials and \"provides material support to foreign terrorist organizations threatening the peace and security\" of the U.S. The U.S. doubled the award for information leading to Maduro's arrest to $50 million on Thursday.",

      "Federal prosecutors unsealed an indictment in May that accused an alleged Mexican cartel member of providing material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization by providing grenades to a cartel.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio told EWTN, a Catholic television network, on Thursday that the foreign terrorist organization designation gives the U.S. government more legal authorities to target cartels.",
      "\"It's no longer a law enforcement issue,\" he said. \"It becomes a national security issue.\"",
      "Rubio later added that the designation \"allows us to now target what they're operating and to use other elements of American power \u2014 intelligence agencies, the Department of Defense, whatever \u2014 to target these groups if we have an opportunity to do it.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has also sought to use the military to help implement his immigration agenda, with more than 10,000 service members sent to the U.S.-Mexico border, according to the Defense Department. The Pentagon also created three National Defense Areas in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas and are treated as extensions of military bases. U.S.Northern Command said the areas aim to enhance border security operations.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0A divided federal appeals court on Friday granted the Trump administration's request to set aside a district judge's decision\u00a0finding probable cause\u00a0that some federal officials committed criminal contempt by violating an order to turn around planes carrying Venezuelan migrants bound for El Salvador.",
      "The 2-1 decision from a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is a massive victory for the Trump administration, which has lambasted U.S. District Judge James Boasberg for overstepping his authority when he initiated criminal contempt proceedings in April.",
      "The D.C. Circuit had issued a temporary pause of Boasberg's decision while it took more time to consider the issue. In an unsigned opinion issued Friday, Judges Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao, both appointed by President Trump in his first term, granted a request from the Justice Department to toss out Boasberg's contempt order. Judge Cornelia Pillard, an Obama appointee, dissented.",
      "The Alien Enemies Act case",
      "The dispute over Boasberg's contempt order stems from immigration officials' efforts to deport Venezuelan migrants under the wartime Alien Enemies Act, which President Trump invoked in March to swiftly remove alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "In response to a fast-moving legal challenge brought by a group of migrants in Washington, D.C., over the removals, Boasberg temporarily blocked the deportations and issued an oral order directing the Trump administration to return Venezuelan migrants subject to Mr. Trump's declaration who were on planes bound for El Salvador back to the U.S. A written order issued shortly after prevented the Trump administration from conducting any deportations of noncitizens under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "But Boasberg said that despite his injunctions, the Trump administration did not stop the removals, and the planes carrying the migrants deported under the Alien Enemies Act landed in El Salvador. The planes were already outside U.S. airspace when Boasberg issued his order blocking U.S. officials from \"removing\" the detainees, a fact that the appeals court noted in ruling for the administration. Most of the people were transferred to El Salvador's notorious supermax prison, the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.",
      "The administration's actions raised questions as to whether it had violated Boasberg's order, and the judge in April ruled that probable cause existed to find government officials in criminal contempt over what he was their defiance. Boasberg said the government's actions demonstrated a \"willful disregard\" for his order.",
      "\"The court does not reach such conclusion lightly or hastily; indeed, it has given defendants ample opportunity to rectify or explain their actions. None of their responses has been satisfactory,\" Boasberg wrote in his decision. He said the Trump administration could remedy his contempt findings by asserting custody over the migrants who were removed in violation of his order, so they can assert their right to challenge their removability.",
      "The Trump administration appealed Boasberg's contempt finding and asked the D.C. Circuit to vacate the decision, which it then agreed to do.",
      "In a concurring opinion on Friday, Katsas wrote that the dispute over the removal of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador in March \"involves an extraordinary, ongoing confrontation between the Executive and Judicial Branches.\" He noted that the proceedings do not involve the lawfulness of removals made under the Alien Enemies Act in March, and said the court may not decide at this time \"whether the government's aggressive implementation of the presidential proclamation warrants praise or criticism as a policy matter.\"",
      "Still, Katsas wrote that a decision in favor of the Trump administration is appropriate because \"the government is plainly correct about the merits of the criminal contempt, and our saying so now would prevent long disputes between the Executive and the Judiciary over difficult, contentious issues regarding the courts' power to control foreign policy or prosecutions, or to impose criminal sanctions for violating injunctions entered without jurisdiction.\"",
      "\"In circumstances much less fraught than these, courts have reviewed interlocutory orders through mandamus to prevent extended inter-branch conflict,\" Katsas said.",
      "He wrote that Boasberg's contempt finding \"raises troubling questions about judicial control over core executive functions like the conduct of foreign policy and the prosecution of criminal offenses.\"",
      "In her dissent, Pillard argued that Boasberg's contempt findings were appropriate, and said the majority's decision to throw out the contempt findings was \"in error.\"",
      "\"Our system of courts cannot long endure if disappointed litigants defy court orders with impunity rather than legally challenge them. That is why willful disobedience of a court order is punishable as criminal contempt,\" Pillar wrote. \"When it appears that a judicial order has been disobeyed, the court's ability to learn who was responsible is the first step to accountability.\"",
      "ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt, the lead counsel for the plaintiffs in the Alien Enemies Act cases, said in a statement: \"We strongly disagree with today's decision regarding contempt and are considering all options going forward.\u00a0 Even DOJ's own lawyers have now stated publicly that they understood that they were not supposed to hand over these men to El Salvador. There was zero ambiguity in the moment.\"",
      "Since Boasberg's findings and the appeals court's stay of his order, 252 Venezuelans who were deported from the U.S. to CECOT were sent from El Salvador back to their home country as part of a prisoner swap involving the U.S.",
      "Tensions between the Trump administration and the federal judiciary have escalated across Mr. Trump's second term, as judges have issued decisions blocking implementation of many aspects of the president's agenda. But the clash between Boasberg and the president has been one of the most fierce, and the judge's contempt finding marked the most direct rebuke of the administration so far.",
      "Mr. Trump has called for Congress to impeach Boasberg, and the Justice Department filed a judicial misconduct complaint against the judge over comments he allegedly made at a closed-door meeting of the Judicial Conference in March.",

      "President Trump will nominate Long to serve as ambassador to Iceland, the outgoing IRS commissioner said in a statement confirming the news, which was first reported by\u00a0The New York Times.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will lead the IRS temporarily, a White House official told CBS News.",
      "\"I am thrilled to answer his call to service and deeply committed to advancing his bold agenda,\" Long said in his statement. \"Exciting times ahead!\"",
      "In his last mass email to the IRS's workforce on Thursday, Long told agency employees they could leave 70 minutes early on Friday, two staffers told CBS News. He's offered early dismissals at the end of the week on several occasions, one employee said.",
      "\"It's Almost FriYay,\" the email's subject line read, according to the staffers.",
      "Long was confirmed by the Senate in mid-June and took over the IRS after some tumult for the tax collection agency's leadership. The IRS has had several interim commissioners since Mr. Trump's return to office in January, including one who lasted for just 48 hours. The Trump administration has aimed to dramatically trim the agency's workforce.",
      "A former auctioneer and Missouri Republican congressman, Long was chosen to take over the IRS late last year after previously pushing to repeal much of the tax code during his time in the House. Long isn't an accountant by trade, but Mr. Trump touted his time as a tax adviser. After retiring from Congress in 2023, Long advised businesses on the Employee Retention Tax Credit, drawing criticism from Democrats who noted the credit's high rate of fraud.",
      "The IRS has been a focus of the Trump administration's government-wide staff cuts. The agency drew up plans earlier this year to cut its 102,000-person workforce by as much as 40% through a combination of layoffs and voluntary resignations, according to an internal memo obtained by CBS News in April. The cuts were set to begin after April 15, which is the deadline for most Americans to file their taxes.",
      "As of May, some 25,000 staffers had left the IRS, a 25% decrease from February levels, according to a report by the IRS's internal watchdog, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. Around 26% of the IRS's revenue agents \u2014 the staff who conduct audits \u2014 had left the agency by May, the report found.",
      "Meanwhile, staff from the Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 a cost-cutting team once led by billionaire Elon Musk \u2014 sought access to the IRS's tax data system, sparking a lawsuit.",
      "Former IRS acting head Melanie Krause left the agency in April over a plan to share tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to help identify undocumented immigrants. She was replaced by Gary Shapley, a longtime IRS agent who became well-known for speaking about alleged political influence in the Hunter Biden tax investigation. But Shapley was ousted after just two days following a dispute between Musk and Bessent.",
      "Bessent complained to Mr. Trump that Shapley had been installed at the urging of Musk and sought the president's approval to undo the decision, multiple sources told CBS News at the time.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan shook hands as they joined President Trump at the White House on Friday for a peace summit where they signed an agreement aimed at ending decades of conflict.",
      "The two countries in the South Caucasus signed agreements with each other and the U.S. that will reopen key transportation routes while allowing the U.S. to seize on Russia's declining influence in the region. The deal includes an agreement that will create a major transit corridor to be named the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity, the White House said.",
      "Mr. Trump said at the White House on Friday that naming the route after him was \"a great honor for me\" but \"I didn't ask for this.\"",
      "A senior administration official, on a call before the event with reporters, said it was the Armenians who suggested the name.",
      "At the peace summit on Friday, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said the transit corridor will \"create connectivity opportunities for so many countries.\"",
      "\"We are starting the path toward strategic partnership,\" he said.",
      "Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan called the agreement a \"significant milestone.\"",
      "\"We are laying a foundation to write a better story than the one we had in the past,\" Pashinyan said.",
      "Both leaders said the breakthrough was made possible by Mr. Trump and his team and joined a growing list of foreign leaders and other officials who have said the U.S. leader should receive a Nobel Peace Prize \u2014something he has coveted.",
      "\"President Trump in six months did a miracle,\" Aliyev said.",
      "Mr. Trump remarked on how long the conflict went on between the two countries and said of the agreement, \"Thirty-five years they fought and now they're friends and they're going to be friends a long time.\"",
      "That route will connect Azerbaijan and its autonomous Nakhchivan exclave, which are separated by a 20-mile-wide patch of Armenian territory. The demand from Azerbaijan had held up peace talks in the past.",
      "Mr. Trump indicated he'd like to visit the route at some point, saying, \"We're going to have to get over there.\"",
      "\"The roadmap they are agreeing to will build a cooperative future that benefits both countries, their region of the South Caucasus and beyond,\" White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said Friday. She added that the new transit corridor will \"allow unimpeded connectivity between the two countries while respecting Armenia's sovereignty and territorial integrity and its people.\"",
      "Asked how he feels about lasting peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Mr. Trump said \"very confident\" as he welcomed both leaders to the White House on Friday afternoon.",
      "Friday's signing adds to the handful of peace and economic agreements brokered this year by the U.S., while Mr. Trump has made no secret of his wish to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in helping to ease long-running conflicts across the globe.",
      "The peace deal between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda helped end the decadeslong conflict in eastern Congo, and the U.S. mediated a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, while Trump intervened in clashes between Cambodia and Thailand by threatening to withhold trade agreements with both countries if their fighting continued. Yet peace deals in Gaza and Ukraine have been elusive.",
      "The signing of a deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan, both former Soviet republics, also strikes a geopolitical blow to their former imperial master, Russia. Throughout the nearly four-decade conflict, Moscow played mediator to expand its clout in the strategic South Caucasus region, but its influence waned quickly after it launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The Trump-brokered deal would allow the U.S. to deepen its reach in the region as Moscow retreats, senior U.S. administration officials said.",
      "The Trump administration began engaging with Armenia and Azerbaijan in earnest earlier this year, when Mr. Trump's key diplomatic envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with Aliyev in Baku and started to discuss what a senior administration official called a \"regional reset.\"",
      "Negotiations over who will develop the Trump Route \u2014 which will eventually include a rail line, oil and gas lines, and fiber optic lines \u2014 will likely begin next week, and at least nine developers have expressed interest already, according to the senior administration official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.",
      "Separate from the joint agreement, both Armenia and Azerbaijan signed deals with the United States meant to bolster cooperation in energy, technology and the economy, the White House said.",
      "Mr. Trump previewed much of Friday's plan in a social media post Thursday evening, in which he said the agreements would \"fully unlock the potential\" of the South Caucasus region.",
      "\"Many Leaders have tried to end the War, with no success, until now, thanks to 'TRUMP,'\" the president said on his Truth Social site.",
      "Mr. Trump, Pashinyan and Aliyev gathered for the signing ceremony in the State Dining Room. That peace declaration was the first signed by both Armenia and Azerbaijan since the end of the Cold War, according to the administration.",
      "Among the documents that that was set to be signed was a letter that asks the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to dissolve its Minsk Group, established in the 1990s and co-chaired by Russia, France and the U.S. to mediate the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict. The White House said Friday that the group is no longer relevant.",
      "The two nations were locked in conflict for nearly four decades as they fought for control of the Karabakh region, known internationally as Nagorno-Karabakh.",
      "The area was largely populated by Armenians during the Soviet era but is located within Azerbaijan. The two nations battled for control of the region through multiple violent clashes that left tens of thousands of people dead over the decades, all while international mediation efforts failed.",
      "Most recently, Azerbaijan reclaimed all of Karabakh in 2023 and had been in talks with Armenia to normalize ties. Azerbaijan's insistence on a land bridge to Nakhchivan had been a major sticking point, because while Azerbaijan did not trust Armenia to control the so-called Zangezur corridor, Armenia resisted control by a third party because it viewed it as a breach of sovereignty.",
      "But the prospect of closer ties with the United States, as well as being able to move in and out of the landlocked nation more freely without having to access Georgia or Iran, helped entice Armenia on the broader agreement, according to U.S. officials.",
      "Meanwhile, Russia stood back when Azerbaijan reclaimed control of Karabakh in the September 2023 offensive, angering Armenia, which has moved to shed Russian influence and turn westward. Azerbaijan, emboldened by its victory in Karabakh, also has become increasingly defiant in its relations with Moscow.",

      "The watchdog group Democracy Defenders Fund, led by a former Obama administration ethics official, has formally requested a federal investigation into the Pentagon's acceptance of a Qatari luxury jet on behalf of President Trump.",
      "According to a memo obtained by CBS News, the group asked the Department of Defense's inspector general and the Government Accountability Office to probe whether the Pentagon broke laws and engaged in impropriety by accepting the gift on Mr. Trump's behalf from the Qatari royal family. The memo was sent to the inspector general and GAO on Friday.",
      "The Democracy Defenders Fund is a nonpartisan advocacy group founded by Obama ethics czar Norm Eisen. Its memo said the agencies should investigate whether the Defense Department had improperly invoked its authorities to accept the jet aircraft and to reportedly transfer $934 million in funding from a nuclear missile program to help retrofit the aircraft.",
      "\"If true, this would mean that the DoD is diverting critical nuclear defense funds to outfit an unprecedented gift from a foreign government to a U.S. president,\" the group said in a 10-page memo.",
      "Earlier this year,\u00a0President Trump confirmed\u00a0that the Qatari royal family was donating a Boeing 747-8 for his use. Valued at $400 million, the jumbo jet is set to be donated to Mr. Trump's presidential library after his term is over.",
      "\"There are so many things wrong with this picture, it's a challenge to know where to begin,\" said Virginia Canter, chief counsel for ethics and anti-corruption at Democracy Defenders Fund. \"The fact that taxpayers are now funding a fifth Air Force One, originating from a foreign monarchy, is a staggering abuse of public trust, fiscal priorities, and national security interests,\" Canter said.",
      "The memo from Democracy Defenders Fund said the jet was redundant and unnecessary, pointing out the U.S. Air Force operates two 747 jets as Air Force One, and two replacement aircraft were authorized in 2018 for $3.9 billion. Despite the existence of both an active and future fleet, Mr. Trump pursued the $400 million Qatari plane, which he referred to in May as a \"gift.\"",
      "\"If we can get a 747 as a contribution to our Defense Department to use during a couple of years while they're building the other ones, I think that was a very nice gesture,\" the president said.",
      "The memo from the Democracy Defenders Fund also argued that Justice Department guidance prohibits agencies from accepting gifts that would incur costs in future fiscal years, as appears to be the case with the Qatari jet.",
      "\"The Air Force has already made clear that the Qatari jet is not able to operate as Air Force One in its current state,\" the memo said.",
      "The group also argued that even if it were legal, \"the use of the (Defense Department's) statutory authority to accept a foreign gift that is not fit for purpose and then expend a billion dollars from appropriations for nuclear deterrence to upgrade that plane would be wasteful, a gross mismanagement of funds and an abuse of the (Defense Department's) statutory authorities in support of the President's attempt to evade Constitutional restrictions on acceptance of foreign emoluments.\"",
      "A memorandum of understanding between Qatar and the Defense Department that was viewed by CBS News outlined the \"unconditional donation\" of one Boeing 747-8 jumbo aircraft.",
      "It was signed earlier this month by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Qatar's deputy prime minister and minister of state for defense affairs. It does not specifically mention Air Force One but says the jet can be used by the Pentagon \"in any manner it deems appropriate.\"",

      "The Environmental Protection Agency announced Thursday it is terminating its $7 billion Solar for All program that was designed to bring renewable and affordable energy to low-income communities. Sources confirmed to CBS News earlier this week that the agency planned to scrap the program.",
      "Solar for All\u00a0provided funding to 60 grant recipients that planned to create or expand existing low-income solar programs, with the goal of enabling 900,000 households across the country in disadvantaged communities to utilize solar energy to reduce their home energy bills.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement posted\u00a0on X: \"The One Big Beautiful Bill eliminated the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which included a $7 billion pot called 'Solar for All.' ... The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.\"",
      "CBS News reported Tuesday that the Office of Management and Budget reached out to the EPA about terminating the program. One source told CBS News that several senators, both Republicans and Democrats, reached out to the EPA and asked it to reconsider, as many of these recipients are state energy and environmental offices in both red and blue states.",
      "The New York Times was the first to report on the plans.",
      "Groundswell, a nonprofit Solar for All grant recipient that works in eight Southern states, has more than $156 million in grant funding on the line. To date, the group has broken ground on 24 megawatts of solar projects worth over $20 million.",
      "\"This program covers every single state and U.S. territories, more than 60% of the awards went to state energy offices,\" Groundswell CEO Michelle Moore told CBS News. Moore was quick to point out that awards were granted to stakeholders in both red and blue states, adding: \"There's a lot at stake here.\"",
      "As electricity bills rise, which experts believe may only increase as more energy-hungry data centers come online, Moore saw Solar for All as a tool to lower energy costs in the South.",
      "\"Solar for All is an investment in energy infrastructure that's going to serve that residential customer that's going to keep energy rates in America more affordable and more fair,\" she said.",
      "Solar for All awarded grants in August 2024 to 49 state-level agencies, six tribes and five multi-state award recipients, according to the EPA. They include state agencies like the Alaska Energy Authority, which was granted a $62 million award to offer access to renewable energy in both urban and rural areas. Harris County, Texas, which encompasses Houston, was awarded $249 million to provide distributed solar and battery storage to disadvantaged communities in the state, and plan on using the money to support workforce training for low-income residents as well as minority and women-owned businesses.",
      "\"Solar for All was a focused program where grants were used to help low- and middle-income households reduce their household electricity costs by up to 20% through solar and storage,\" said Zealan Hoover, who was a senior adviser to former EPA administrator Michael Regan in the Biden administration. Hoover spent three years at the EPA helping to implement more than $100 billion in programs authorized under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "\"If the EPA is successful in terminating these grants, I anticipate most of the grantees will sue for unlawful termination,\" Hoover told CBS News. \"If the EPA is ultimately successful, then most recipients will have lost years of work across the country to help low-income households, and all the work will be for naught.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Aug 2025 10:19:41 -0400",
    "summary": "The Census Bureau said it began planning the 2030 census in 2019.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday said he had instructed the Department of Commerce to \"immediately begin work on a new and highly accurate\" census that would exclude undocumented immigrants.",
      "But the census is a massive undertaking and has huge repercussions nationally, including on congressional seat alignment \u2014 so it's not something that can be changed quickly. In fact, the Census Bureau\u00a0said\u00a0it began planning the 2030 census in 2019.",
      "Asked for comment on Mr. Trump's post, a Commerce Department spokesperson told CBS News in a statement: \"The Census Bureau will immediately adopt modern technology tools for use in the Census to better understand our robust Census data. We will accurately analyze the data to reflect the number of legal residents in the United States.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the census process:",
      "The Constitution requires the Census be taken every 10 years",
      "Per Article I, Section 2: \"The actual enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent term of ten years, in such manner as they shall by law direct.\" Congress codified the decennial census into law in 1954. The Constitution also mandates that reapportionment (the designation of how many Congressional seats a state gets) happens every 10 years, in line with the Census. Redistricting then uses that apportionment and then states are supposed to redraw lines every 10 years, when they know how many Congressional seats they will have for the decade.",
      "The actual data collection for the 2030 Census is supposed to start in ... 2030",
      "It's a long process to design the Census process, send out the Census forms and then have enumerators physically go out to collect the rest of the data for people who don't mail their form back or fill it out online. The Bureau says they started planning for the 2030 Census in\u00a02019. But the actual surveys and collection of data at a large scale begins on Census Day, April 1 of each decade year. Currently, the\u00a0bureau's timeline\u00a0has them in the \"Development and Integration Phase\" which includes more design planning, and small-scale field tests.",
      "Citizenship question in the Census?",
      "In Mr. Trump's first term, his administration tried to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, but that was\u00a0rejected in a 5-4 decision by the Supreme Court. But that decision kept the door open to including that question in the future, but concluded that the reason given by the administration and then-Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was \"contrived\" and \"pretextual.\" Because of a tight timeline for when Census forms had to be finalized in 2019, the Trump administration didn't have time to appeal and find another avenue to get the citizenship question on the Census. With Census collection for 2030 still years away, there's a longer runway to legally try and get a citizenship question on the form.",
      "The Census Bureau does take annual surveys/data gathering, but not for population count that would impact redistricting",
      "Since 2005, the Bureau conducts the \"American Community Survey\" every year to collect social, economic, housing and demographic information from a\u00a0sample\u00a0of households in all 50 states.\u00a0This\u00a0survey does ask about place of birth, citizenship and year of entry into the U.S. But the Bureau maintains that the data remains anonymous.",
      "\"No one is able to figure out your survey answers from the statistics we produce,\" the Census website\u00a0states.",
      "Is political party collected in the Census?",
      "No. There is a monthly survey sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that the Census Bureau conducts that does measure this in election years and then after an election. But the decennial Census does not ask about political party, income or religion.",
      "Black, Latino and Indigenous populations were undercounted in the 2020 census",
      "The Bureau and experts cited delays caused by COVID-19 and a chilling effect by Mr. Trump's attempt to introduce a citizenship question on the Census form, as the reason for the undercount. Latinos saw about a 5% undercount in 2020, compared to 1.54% in the 2010 Census. The undercount rate for the Black population was 3.3% in 2020, compared to 2% in 2010. Overall, the Census Bureau's post-enumeration survey found that there was a net coverage undercount of 0.25% or 782,000 for the nation.",
      "How do Congressional seats work with the Census?",
      "In 1911, Congress set the number of seats at 435, a number which was permanently set by the 1929 Permanent Apportionment Act. The number of seats each state gets is determined by population, with a minimum of one. California has the most with 52, followed by Texas with 38 and Florida with 28.",
      "Given population changes, the number of Congressional seats each state gets is determined by the census. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in July suggested that the census should be redone since he believed Florida should have gotten two new seats instead of just one.",
      "Based off the number of seats each state receives, the Congressional districts are then set, either by the state legislature or an independent commission. Mr. Trump is currently locked in a redistricting battle in Texas, where he has instructed the state's Republicans to redraw the districts to give the GOP an advantage in up to five more seats.",
      "The very public battle in Texas has led to California Gov. Gavin Newsom saying he, too, could redraw the map for Democrats, and has also led several other states to start looking at creating new districts for partisan advantage.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump officially began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his months-long tariffs threats was beginning to create visible damage to the U.S. economy.",
      "The White House said that starting just after midnight EDT, goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union began facing tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the European Union, Japan and South Korea are being taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh are being taxed at 20%. Mr. Trump also expects places such as the EU, Japan and South Korea to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S.",
      "He immediately took to his Truth Social platform to hail the levies, saying, \"IT'S MIDNIGHT!!! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TARIFFS ARE NOW FLOWING INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!\"",
      "About an hour before that, he posted, \"RECIPROCAL TARIFFS TAKE EFFECT AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP AMERICA'S GREATNESS WOULD BE A RADICAL LEFT COURT THAT WANTS TO SEE OUR COUNTRY FAIL!\"",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump said, \"I think the growth is going to be unprecedented,\" adding that the U.S. was \"taking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs.\" But he said he couldn't provide a specific figure for revenues because \"we don't even know what the final number is\" regarding tariff rates. \n\r\nDespite the uncertainty, the Trump White House is confident that the onset of his broad tariffs will provide clarity about the path of the world's largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the administration believes it can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power.  \n\r\nBut so far, there are signs of self-inflicted wounds to America as companies and consumers alike brace for the impact of new taxes. What the data has shown is a U.S. economy that changed in April with the president's initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Mr. Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday.",
      "After April, economic reports showed that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy. \n\r\n\"A less productive economy requires fewer workers,\" Silvia said in an analysis note. \"But there is more, the higher tariff prices lower workers' real wages. The economy has become less productive, and firms cannot pay the same real wages as before. Actions have consequences.\" \n\r\nEven then, the ultimate transformations of the tariffs are unknown and could play out over months, if not years. Many economists say the risk is that the American economy is steadily eroded rather than collapsing instantly. \n\r\n\"We all want it to be made for television where it's this explosion - it's not like that,\" said Brad Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University. \"It's going to be fine sand in the gears and slow things down.\" \n\r\nMr. Trump has promoted the tariffs as a way to reduce the persistent trade deficit. But importers sought to avoid the taxes by importing more goods before the taxes went into effect. As a result, the $582.7 billion trade imbalance for the first half of the year was 38% higher than in 2024. Total construction spending has dropped 2.9% over the past year, and the factory jobs promised by Mr. Trump have so far actually been job losses. \n\r\nThe lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which have been variously rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and frantically renegotiated. \n\r\nThe process has been so muddled that officials for key trade partners were unclear at the start of the week whether the tariffs would begin Thursday or Friday. The language of the July 31 order to delay the start of tariffs from Aug. 1 said the higher tax rates would start in seven days. \n\r\nOn Wednesday morning, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, was asked if the new tariffs began at midnight Thursday, and he said reporters should check with the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. \n\r\nMr. Trump announced additional 25% tariffs to be imposed on India\u00a0Wednesday because it buys Russian oil, bringing India's total import taxes to 50%. India's Foreign Ministry called the new duties \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.\"",
      "Swiss officials planned an \"extraordinary\" meeting Thursday after a delegation returned from Washington following an attempt to head off a 39% tariff on Swiss products, the government said in an X post. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter left Washington empty-handed Wednesday, a source told the Reuters news service, which cited the source as saying her proposal for a 10% tariff rate was rejected.",
      "Mr. Trump has said import taxes are still coming on pharmaceutical drugs and announced 100% tariffs on computer chips, meaning the U.S. economy could remain in a place of suspended animation as it awaits the impacts. \n\r\nThe president's use of a 1977 law to declare an economic emergency to impose the tariffs is also being challenged. The impending ruling from last week's hearing before a U.S. appeals court could cause Mr. Trump to find other legal justifications if judges say he exceeded his authority. \n\r\nEven people who worked with Mr. Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic. \n\r\n\"There's no sort of rationale for this other than the president wanting to raise tariffs based upon his whims, his opinions,\" Ryan told CNBC on Wednesday. \"I think choppy waters are ahead because I think they're going to have some legal challenges.\" \n\r\nStill, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S&P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Mr. Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months. \n\r\nAs of now, the president says he still foresees an economic boom while the rest of the world and American voters wait nervously. \n\r\n\"There's one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he's creating, and that's Donald Trump,\" said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy. \"The rest of Americans are already paying the price for that uncertainty.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 05 Aug 2025 19:57:13 -0400",
    "summary": "A CBS News review of three of DOGE's largest cuts claimed so far found actual savings of 3% of what was claimed.",
    "story": [
      "The spotlight may have moved off the Department of Government Efficiency since the departure of Elon Musk, but the Trump administration's DOGE continues to post about cost cutting on its so-called \"wall of receipts.\" And once again, some of its claims about savings appear to be significantly overstated, according to a CBS News review.",
      "The review of three of the largest cuts claimed so far indicates the savings from those contracts are less than 3% of what DOGE said they were.",
      "On July 27, DOGE added 705 canceled contracts to the website it uses to track and declare savings from the agency's cost cutting across the federal government, among them three of the largest claimed cuts posted since President Trump launched DOGE in January.",
      "The three contracts \u2014 all from the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 funded COVID-19 testing and treatment for people who were uninsured or underinsured during the pandemic. DOGE claims canceling those contracts saved $6.4 billion.",
      "But CBS News' review of transaction records indicates the actual savings is just a small fraction of that \u2014 around $165 million.",
      "That's about how much in obligated funds were left unspent in the three contracts by the time Mr. Trump took office and DOGE was launched. There was nearly $7 billion that remained, but this figure represented a ceiling that federal contracting experts say is rarely reached.",
      "DOGE adjusted down that total potential value by a combined $6.4 billion \u2014 and then reported it as savings. But with the pandemic long over and the contracts set to expire on May 31 of this year, it is highly unlikely the contractors, which included Walgreens and CVS, would have spent anywhere near that sum on COVID-19 testing and treatment.",
      "The spending \"was never going to reach this number,\" said Nat Malkus, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, referring to the total potential value. \"You didn't have to terminate this contract, you are the government \u2014 just don't obligate any more money.\"",
      "Since it was launched, multiple news outlets including CBS News have reported that DOGE's \"Wall of Receipts\" has at times vastly overstated the amount of funds cut and discovered numerous errors in the group's accounting.",
      "DOGE now claims it has saved $52.2 billion \u2013 just from contracts canceled. Malkus, who analyzed the actual implications of the cancellations rather than the ceiling values, puts the number closer to $17.8 billion. But that would only be if Congress agreed to rescind the funds that it had already voted to spend.",
      "The DOGE website reports a grand total of $199 \u202fbillion saved, when factoring in real estate lease cancellations and other cuts such as personnel reductions. However, it provides no documentation for roughly half of that amount. According to DOGE, the savings equate to $1,236.02 per person in the U.S.",
      "\"The amount they have per person is fiction,\" Malkus said. \"It's transparency theater.\"",
      "HHS did not respond to a CBS News request for comment about the three contracts. The White House redirected the request to the General Services Administration, which declined to comment.",
      "A substantial portion of those purported savings is a result of cuts to USAID. A recent study in the medical journal The Lancet says those cuts could come with a human toll. By the study's estimates, the loss in humanitarian aid could lead to 14 million deaths in children younger than 5 years of age by 2030.",
      "Malkus told CBS News, \"Their claims are generally to say, 'Hey this is a lot of pain, but it's worth it.'\"",
      "The update is only the second since Musk, who launched DOGE, departed from his role in the White House advising Mr. Trump.",
      "Shortly before Musk's term as a special government employee expired, he told reporters, \"This is not the end of DOGE, but really the beginning.\"",
      "\"The DOGE team will only grow stronger over time. The DOGE influence will only grow stronger,\" he said from the Oval Office on May 30, adding that he was confident over time DOGE would cull $1 trillion in savings.",
      "It's unclear exactly how DOGE has functioned since then. In late June, The Washington Post reported that federal officials were instructed to stop routing the grant-making process through DOGE, revoking control of the online clearinghouse for all grant opportunities from the group. In DOGE's latest update, only one additional canceled grant was added.",
      "Several DOGE-associated government employees have left in recent weeks, including the Department of the Interior's Tyler Hassen, whose last day was Friday, The New York Times reported. Hassen was originally hired as a DOGE staffer, and then was later tasked with trimming costs at the Interior Department, where he was named principal deputy assistant secretary of the interior.",
      "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum had allowed him broad authority to make cuts to budgets and staffing, and under his watch, a DOGE-associated employee made the claim that a single survey costing $1 billion dollars\u00a0had been cut. That claim was repeated by Elon Musk and Burgum, but no evidence was ever supplied to back it up.",

      "The Perseids meteor shower \u2014 considered one of the best shows in the sky \u2014 is set to peak next week. But the peak for fireballs shooting through the night sky coincides this year with a bright moon that is expected to negatively impact visibility for eager viewers.",
      "The Perseids peak in 2025 is Aug. 12-13, specifically early next Wednesday for those in North America. At that time, the moon will be 84% full, according to the American Meteor Society.",
      "\"In 2025, the waning gibbous moon will severely compromise this shower at the time of maximum activity,\" the organization says. \"Such conditions will reduce activity by at least 75 percent as only the brighter meteors will be visible.\"",
      "Viewers this year can expect to see between 10-20 Perseids each hour, as opposed to 50 Perseids per hour under darker conditions, it says.",
      "\"The strength of each Perseid display varies year to year, mainly due to lunar conditions,\"\u00a0writes Robert Lunsford with the American Meteor Society. \"If a bright moon is above the horizon during the night of maximum activity, then the display will be reduced. Most of the Perseid meteors are faint and bright moonlight will make it difficult to view.\"",
      "The Perseids meteor shower has been ongoing for several weeks. It started in mid-July and will continue until Aug. 23.",
      "A planetarium program coordinator at a museum in St. Paul, Minnesota, is advising people to instead go out a week or so past the peak when the moon isn't so bright.",
      "The Perseids \"are an incredible meteor shower,\" Thaddeus LaCoursiere, of the Bell Museum, told The Associated Press.",
      "NASA says the best time to view the Perseids is early in the morning, before the sun comes up, in the Northern Hemisphere. However, meteors sometimes can be seen as early as 10 p.m.",
      "When looking at the Perseids, they appear to come from the constellation Perseus, which is why this meteor shower has its name. But the meteors don't originate from the constellation; they are space debris left by a comet. That debris interacts with Earth's atmosphere, disintegrating and resulting in colorful lines in the sky, according to NASA and the American Meteor Society.",
      "\"The pieces of space debris that interact with our atmosphere to create the Perseids originate from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle,\" which last visited the inner solar system in 1992, NASA says.",
      "During peak, next Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, the Earth will pass closest to the core orbit of comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle, Lunsford writes.",
      "\"To view the Perseids successfully, it is suggested you watch from a safe rural area that is as dark as possible,\" he says. \"The more stars you can see, the more meteors will also be visible.\"",

      "Discovered last month by a telescope in Chile, the comet known as 3I-Atlas is only the third known interstellar object to pass our way and poses no threat to Earth.",
      "Astronomers originally estimated the size of its icy core at several miles across, but Hubble's observations have narrowed it down to no more than 3.5 miles. It could even be as small as 1,000 feet, scientists say, according to a\u00a0new paper\u00a0published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.",
      "The comet is hurtling our way at 130,000 mph, but will veer closer to Mars than Earth, keeping a safe distance from both. It was 277 million miles away when photographed by Hubble a couple weeks ago. The orbiting telescope revealed a teardrop-shaped plume of dust around the nucleus as well as traces of a dusty tail.",
      "NASA previously said the comet will make its closest approach to the sun in late October, scooting between the orbits of Mars and Earth. The agency said 3I/ATLAS should remain visible to telescopes through September, but then it will pass too close to the sun to observe. It is expected to reappear on the other side of the sun by early December, allowing for renewed observations.",
      "According to Las Cumbres Observatory in Chile, the object is named \"3I\" because it is the third such interstellar object to be found, following\u00a01I/'Oumuamu\u00a0in 2017 and\u00a02I/Borisov\u00a0in 2019.",
      "\"All three appear to be quite dark and red, reflecting only about 5% of the sunlight that hits them, which is similar in reflectivity to asphalt,\" the observatory said last month. \"Unlike 1I/'Oumuamu, 3I does not change much in brightness as it rotates, indicating that it is more likely to be spherical.\"",
      "Los Cumbres Observatory created an animation of image data from its telescope as it tracked the new interstellar on July 4, 2025:",
      "As scientists watch the object, some are raising questions.

    "story": [
      "Two months into the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have updated their forecast, predicting slightly fewer named storms. The new outlook released Thursday says there is a 50% chance of above-normal activity, a decrease from 60% in the agency's May forecast.",
      "NOAA, the federal agency in charge of weather and climate predictions, now expects 13 to 18 named storms, five to nine of which could become hurricanes, including two to five major hurricanes. The previous ranges were 13 to 19 named storms, six to 10 hurricanes and three to five major hurricanes.",
      "The adjusted predictions include the four named tropical storms so far this season.",
      "The Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from June 1 until Nov. 30, with peak activity typically occurring between mid-August and mid-October.",
      "An average season produces 14 named storms, including seven that develop into hurricanes. Three of those, on average, become major hurricanes, meaning a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with sustained wind speeds of at least 111 miles per hour. Category 5, the top of the scale, brings wind speeds of at least 157 mph.",
      "Every Atlantic hurricane season since 2015 has produced more storms than the \"average\" \u2014 a standard based on annual hurricane activity recorded over the period from 1990 to 2020 \u2014 although four seasons since then have produced two or three major hurricanes, either below or on par with the 30-year norm.",
      "According to forecasters, a combination of factors influence the number of storms that materialize over the course of the season. A significant one in 2025 is the neutral phase of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, cycle, which often plays a substantial role in the intensity of tropical activity in the Atlantic.",
      "Warmer than average ocean temperatures and weak wind shear in the forecast may also lead to a more active season, the NOAA outlook says, as could the potential for higher storm activity from the West African Monsoon, the weather system from which most Atlantic hurricanes originate.",
      "Some seasons are more active than others, and hurricanes at times can occur outside of the designated six-month window. Science has shown in recent years that climate change is contributing to the intensity of these storms, which are fueled by warmer waters. Researchers are continuing to explore connections between rising temperatures and more destructive tropical weather.",
      "Because each year is different, NOAA's hurricane forecast provides a framework for communities in storm-prone areas to\u00a0prepare.",
      "\"NOAA stands ready to provide the forecasts and warnings that are vital for safeguarding lives, property, and communities,\" acting NOAA Administrator Laura Grimm said in a statement Thursday. \"As we enter the second half of the season, this updated hurricane outlook serves as a call to action to prepare now, in advance, rather than delay until a warning is issued.\"",
      "Last year, NOAA predicted\u00a0an above-average number of storms, with between 8 and 13 hurricanes. The 2024 season ended up producing 11 hurricanes, five of which strengthened into major hurricanes. Five hurricanes made landfall in the continental U.S., including two \u2014 Helene and Milton \u2014 that hit as major hurricanes.",
      "Grimm said last year's forecast \"was right on the money,\" within NOAA's predicted range.",

      "They also recently updated their predictions, now estimating that eight hurricanes will occur over the course of the 2025 season with 16 named storms overall.",
      "Their predictions have tended to more or less align with those released by NOAA. Levi Silvers, who leads the research team at Colorado State, told CBS News in April that their predictions are \"fundamentally dependent on the observations that NOAA collects all around the globe,\" especially in the oceans, so they generally reach similar conclusions.",

      "Scientists say they have at last solved the mystery of what killed more than 5 billion sea stars \u2014 often known as starfish \u2014 off the Pacific coast of North America in a decade-long epidemic.",
      "Starting in 2013, a mysterious sea star wasting disease sparked a mass die-off from Mexico to Alaska. The epidemic has devastated more than 20 species and continues today. Worst hit was a species called the sunflower sea star, which lost around 90% of its population in the outbreak's first five years.",
      "\"It's really quite gruesome,\" said marine disease ecologist Alyssa Gehman at the Hakai Institute in British Columbia, Canada, who helped pinpoint the cause.",
      "Healthy sea stars have \"puffy arms sticking straight out,\" she said. But the wasting disease causes them to grow lesions and \"then their arms actually fall off.\"",
      "The culprit? Bacteria that has also infected shellfish, according to a study published Monday in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution.",
      "The findings \"solve a long-standing question about a very serious disease in the ocean,\" said Rebecca Vega Thurber, a marine microbiologist at University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the study.",
      "Sea stars typically have five arms and some species sport up to 24 arms. They range in color from solid orange to tapestries of orange, purple, brown and green.",
      "\"Symptoms of sea star wasting syndrome include abnormally twisted arms, white lesions, deflation of arms and body, arm loss, and body disintegration,\" the National Park Service says. \"They die over the course of days or weeks.\"",
      "It took more than a decade for researchers to identify the cause of the disease, with many false leads and twists and turns along the way.",
      "Early research hinted the cause might be a virus, but it turned out the densovirus that scientists initially focused on was actually a normal resident inside healthy sea stars and not associated with disease, said Melanie Prentice of the Hakai Institute, co-author of the new study.",
      "Other efforts missed the real killer because researchers studied tissue samples of dead sea stars that no longer contained the bodily fluid that surrounds the organs.",
      "But the latest study includes detailed analysis of this fluid, called coelomic fluid, where the bacteria Vibrio pectenicida were found.",
      "\"It's incredibly difficult to trace the source of so many environmental diseases, especially underwater,\" said microbiologist Blake Ushijima of the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, who was not involved in the research. He said the detective work by this team was \"really smart and significant.\"",
      "Now that scientists know the cause, they have a better shot at intervening to help sea stars. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the sunflower sea star as critically endangered.",
      "Prentice said that scientists could potentially now test which of the remaining sea stars are still healthy \u2014 and consider whether to relocate them, or breed them in captivity to later transplant them to areas that have lost almost all their sunflower sea stars.",
      "The study notes that Vibrio bacteria have been called \"the microbial barometer of climate change\" because the species are more prevalent in warming water temperatures. The authors say an important next phase of research will be to work on better understanding the relationship between rising seawater temperatures and sea star wasting disease.",
      "Scientists may also test if some populations have natural immunity, and if treatments like probiotics may help boost immunity to the disease.",
      "Such recovery work is not only important for sea stars, but for entire Pacific ecosystems because healthy starfish gobble up excess sea urchins, researchers say.",
      "Sunflower sea stars \"look sort of innocent when you see them, but they eat almost everything that lives on the bottom of the ocean,\" said Gehman. \"They're voracious eaters.\"",
      "With many fewer sea stars, the sea urchins that they usually munch on exploded in population \u2014 and in turn gobbled up around 95% of the kelp forest s in Northern California within a decade. These kelp forests provide food and habitat for a wide variety of animals including fish, sea otters and seals.",
      "Researchers hope the new findings will allow them to restore sea star populations \u2014 and regrow the kelp forests that Thurber compares to \"the rainforests of the ocean.\""

    "summary": "Astronaut Jim Lovell circled the moon on Apollo 8 and helped bring Apollo 13 home safely despite a mishap far from Earth.",
    "story": [
      "Jim Lovell, the astronaut who commanded the famous Apollo 13 mission, has died, NASA announced Friday. He was 97.",
      "Apollo 13, a 1970 flight to the moon, became known as a \"successful failure\" after the spacecraft experienced an oxygen tank explosion thousands of miles from Earth but managed to safely return home.",
      "Acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy said in a statement that Lovell died Thursday in Lake Forest, Illinois. Duffy praised Lovell's life and work, saying he inspired millions of people.",
      "\"Jim's character and steadfast courage helped our nation reach the Moon and turned a potential tragedy into a success from which we learned an enormous amount,\" Duffy said.",
      "Lovell was the command module pilot for 1968's Apollo 8 mission, the first to carry humans to the moon and back, though it did not land on the lunar surface.",
      "Andrew Chaikin, author of the 2007 book \"A Man on the Moon\" on the Apollo program, told CBS News that Lovell had some of the most memorable comments during the Apollo 8 TV transmissions. He recalled that Lovell called Earth a \"grand oasis in the vastness of space.\"",
      "\"Lovell had imagination, there was a part of Lovell that was about imagination, and that was a neat part of him,\" Chaikin said.",
      "Apollo 8 circled the moon 10 times and sent back the famous \"Earthrise\" photo of our world from space. Lovell reflected on that journey 50 years later in an interview with CBS News.",
      "\"Sometimes I look back and say, you know, 'How did we ever do that?\" he said.",
      "In 1970, Lovell had a chance to go back to the moon with Apollo 13, with crewmates Fred Haise and Jack Swigert, but the mission abruptly changed with the explosion.",
      "\"Houston, we've had a problem here,\" Swigert reported to mission control.\u00a0Moments later, Lovell repeated, \"Houston, we've had a problem.\"",
      "The mishap forced Lovell, his crewmates and NASA's team on the ground to turn all their efforts toward returning to Earth safely.",
      "\"His calm strength under pressure helped return the crew safely to Earth and demonstrated the quick thinking and innovation that informed future NASA missions,\" Duffy said of Lovell.",
      "Lovell graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1952 and went on to become a naval aviator, including a four-year tour at the Naval Air Test Center in Maryland. Chaikin said Lovell demonstrated his skills as a test pilot during Apollo 13.",
      "\"He always said that the true measure of a test pilot is not whether you can do the mission you're assigned, but when things don't go right, how you respond,\" Chaikin said.",
      "Chaikin described Lovell as being calm and unflappable throughout the crisis, but he recalled one moment when Lovell started to seem irritable.",
      "\"He's been without sleep, and he's worried about his crew and says, like, 'You're going to have to figure out this checklist because we've got to get some sleep,'\" Chaikin said. \"That's like the only time in the whole mission when he even starts to show anything but calm, unflappable Lovell.\"",
      "Actor Tom Hanks played Lovell in the 1995 movie \"Apollo 13,\" which was nominated for best picture at the Oscars.",
      "In an Instagram post Friday evening, Hanks wrote that Lovell's \"many voyages around Earth and on to so-very-close to the moon were not made for riches or celebrity, but because such challenges as those are what fuels the course of being alive \u2014 and who better than Jim Lovell to make those voyages. On this night of a full Moon, he passes on \u2014 to the heavens, to the cosmos, to the stars. God speed you, on this next voyage, Jim Lovell.\"",
      "Before the movie was released, Chaikin said Lovell told him that the true story of Apollo 13 had never been told.",
      "\"That's how he felt,\" Chaikin said. \"Of course, everything changed when Ron Howard made that movie, to the point that Jim became probably the best known Apollo astronaut next to Neil Armstrong. But before that movie happened, he really felt that way.\"",
      "NASA shared a statement from Lovell's family: \"We are enormously proud of his amazing life and career accomplishments, highlighted by his legendary leadership in pioneering human space flight. But, to all of us, he was Dad, Granddad, and the Leader of our family. Most importantly, he was our Hero. We will miss his unshakeable optimism, his sense of humor, and the way he made each of us feel we could do the impossible. He was truly one of a kind.\"",

      "Crew 10's departure comes six days after the arrival of their replacements, Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, pilot Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and cosmonaut Oleg Platonov. They were launched Aug. 1 aboard the Crew Dragon Endeavour.",
      "Since then, the outgoing crew, along with Ryzhikov, cosmonaut Alexey  Zubritsky and NASA crewmate Jonny Kim, has been briefing the replacements on the intricacies of station operations, getting them up to  speed as quickly as possible.",

    "story": [
      "The Hubble Space Telescope has captured the best picture yet of a high-speed comet visiting our solar system from another star.",
      "NASA and the European Space Agency released the latest photos Thursday.",
      "Discovered last month by a telescope in Chile, the comet known as 3I-Atlas is only the third known interstellar object to pass our way and poses no threat to Earth.",
      "Astronomers originally estimated the size of its icy core at several miles across, but Hubble's observations have narrowed it down to no more than 3.5 miles. It could even be as small as 1,000 feet, scientists say, according to a\u00a0new paper\u00a0published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.",
      "The comet is hurtling our way at 130,000 mph, but will veer closer to Mars than Earth, keeping a safe distance from both. It was 277 million miles away when photographed by Hubble a couple weeks ago. The orbiting telescope revealed a teardrop-shaped plume of dust around the nucleus as well as traces of a dusty tail.",
      "NASA previously said the comet will make its closest approach to the sun in late October, scooting between the orbits of Mars and Earth. The agency said 3I/ATLAS should remain visible to telescopes through September, but then it will pass too close to the sun to observe. It is expected to reappear on the other side of the sun by early December, allowing for renewed observations.",
      "According to Las Cumbres Observatory in Chile, the object is named \"3I\" because it is the third such interstellar object to be found, following\u00a01I/'Oumuamu\u00a0in 2017 and\u00a02I/Borisov\u00a0in 2019.",
      "\"All three appear to be quite dark and red, reflecting only about 5% of the sunlight that hits them, which is similar in reflectivity to asphalt,\" the observatory said last month. \"Unlike 1I/'Oumuamu, 3I does not change much in brightness as it rotates, indicating that it is more likely to be spherical.\"",
      "Los Cumbres Observatory created an animation of image data from its telescope as it tracked the new interstellar on July 4, 2025:",
      "As scientists watch the object, some are raising questions. Harvard professor Avi Loeb, who is the director of the institute for theory and computation at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, says it could actually be alien technology. He said many of its characteristics are not typical, and that its trajectory is \"fine-tuned.\"",
      "\"The object looks strange. It reflects a lot of sunlight,\" he told \"CBS Mornings Plus.\" \"Moreover, this object has some glow in front of it, not behind it. There is no tail, as usually is the case for comets.\"",
      "He advises the best way to proceed is to collect as much scientific data as possible.",
      "\"Not assuming anything, just monitoring it and deciding whether it maneuvers, whether it has some artificial lights, whether it looks like a technological object, and if it ends up being a comet, so be it,\" he said.",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Aug 2025 18:03:06 -0400",
    "summary": "Instagram rolled out a new Map feature that lets users see their friends' locations in real time. Here's why privacy experts are concerned.",
    "story": [
      "A new feature on Instagram that let's users share their real-time physical location with others on the app has privacy experts concerned over the amount of data exposed and potential safety risks to users.",
      "Called Instagram Map, the new feature was introduced on Thursday as part of an app update. On its blog, the company says the location-sharing tool makes it \"easier for you and your friends to stay in touch through the content you're enjoying on Instagram.\"",
      "\"You can opt into sharing your last active location with friends you pick, and you can turn it off anytime,\" Instagram said in a blog post announcing the new feature. \"You can also open the map to see content your friends and favorite creators are posting from cool spots. No matter how you use the map, you and your friends have a new, lightweight way to connect with each other.\"",
      "\"Off by default\"",
      "In a statement shared with CBS MoneyWatch Friday, Instagram's parent company, Meta, emphasized that Instagram Maps is not automatically active upon updating the app and that users must opt-in to the location-sharing feature in order to make their whereabouts visible to others.",
      "\"Instagram Map is off by default, and your live location is never shared unless you choose to turn it on. If you do, only people you follow back \u2014 or a private, custom list you select \u2014 can see your location,\" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Users can also choose not to share their locations when they are in particular places, or with particular people.",
      "Still, privacy experts say that social media users aren't always aware of how much information they're sharing with an app or its users, even if they have the ability to limit who sees what.",
      "\"The more these location features are rolled out on social media it carries out the assumption that as long as you give users the ability to toggle them on and off that they'll know exactly how to do that,\" Douglas Zytko, an app safety expert and associate professor at the College of Innovation & Technology at the University of Michigan-Flint, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But the average user isn't always aware of their privacy settings and if they match their preferences.\"",
      "When the Instagram Map feature is turned on, any content a user posts with a location tagged, including a reel, post or story, will show up on the app's map for 24 hours, according to the Instagram blog. While the feature remains on, the user's location is updated whenever they open the app or return to it. The feature can be turned off at any time.",
      "In an Instagram post discussing the feature, Instagram's head, Adam Mosseri, explains how he himself uses the map. \"Personally, I use the map to share what I'm up to with a handful of my closest friends, and I curate that list carefully,\" he said.",
      "User confusion over whether the feature is on or off",
      "On Threads, Meta's microblogging site, a number of Instagram account holders claimed that their locations were being pinned on friends' maps by default.",
      "Mosseri weighed in, saying the concerns prompted the company to re-examine how the feature works.",
      "\"We're double-checking everything, but so far it looks mostly like people are confused and assume that, because they can see themselves on the map when they open, other people can see them too,\" he said. \"We're still checking everything though to make sure nobody shares location without explicitly deciding to do so, which, by the way, requires a double consent by design (we ask you to confirm after you say you want to share).\"",
      "How to turn on Instagram Maps",
      "In the top right corner of the app, tap on the messaging function. There you will see a circular world map icon labeled \"map. If you click on the icon, you will see you're on location pinned on a map. Friends who are sharing their locations will also appear. Click on the gear icon to choose to share your location with no one, or a custom list of friends, or all of your friends \u2014 who are followers that you also follow back on the app.",
      "Social pressures, privacy and safety risks",
      "Zytko, however, said it can be complicated for social media users to manage privacy settings that let them share different kinds of content with different groups of people. \"This issue is called 'context collapse,'\" he said. \"Your co-workers see your social media posts, and your friends and family, and there is certain content you only want some groups to see but not others, and it can be hard to manage the visibility of content.\"",
      "Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which makes entertainment and technology recommendations for families, said location-sharing features can be particularly risky for younger app users.",
      "\"These features might feel fun and social, but they create unnecessary risks that teens and many adults don't necessarily understand,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "While parents who supervise their teens through controls built into the app can control their kids' location-sharing settings, he still has concerns about the kinds of social pressures such features expose teens, too.",
      "Torney said research at Common Sense Media shows that location-sharing also creates \"social pressures around where teens go and who they spend time with, and kids feel obligated to share location to show they are someplace cool.\"",
      "Furthermore, when teens share their locations, \"they are potentially telling strangers where they are in real time,\" Torney told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you're not selective about who you're sharing your location with, it creates opportunities for harassment, stalking or worse.\"",

    "summary": "OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, said its work is ongoing in refining how the chatbot can \"identify and respond appropriately in sensitive situations.\"",
    "story": [
      "ChatGPT will tell 13-year-olds how to get drunk and high, instruct them on how to conceal eating disorders and even compose a heartbreaking suicide letter to their parents if asked,\u00a0according to new research\u00a0from a watchdog group.",
      "The Associated Press reviewed more than three hours of interactions between ChatGPT and researchers posing as vulnerable teens. The chatbot typically provided warnings against risky activity but went on to deliver startlingly detailed and personalized plans for drug use, calorie-restricted diets or self-injury.",
      "The researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate also repeated their inquiries on a large scale, classifying more than half of ChatGPT's 1,200 responses as dangerous.",
      "\"We wanted to test the guardrails,\" said Imran Ahmed, the group's CEO. \"The visceral initial response is, 'Oh my Lord, there are no guardrails.' The rails are completely ineffective. They're barely there - if anything, a fig leaf.\"",
      "OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, said its work is ongoing in refining how the chatbot can \"identify and respond appropriately in sensitive situations.\"",
      "\"If someone expresses thoughts of suicide or self-harm, ChatGPT is trained to encourage them to reach out to mental health professionals or trusted loved ones, and provide links to crisis hotlines and support resources,\" an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News. \"Some conversations with ChatGPT may start out benign or exploratory but can shift into more sensitive territory,\" the spokesperson said. \"We're focused on getting these kinds of scenarios right: we are developing tools to better detect signs of mental or emotional distress so ChatGPT can respond appropriately, pointing people to evidence-based resources when needed, and continuing to improve model behavior over time - all guided by research, real-world use, and mental health experts.\"",
      "ChatGPT does not verify ages or require parental consent, although the company says it is not meant for children under 13. To sign up, users need to enter a birth date showing an age of at least 13, or they can use a limited guest account without entering an age at all.",
      "\"If you have access to a child's account, you can see their chat history. But as of now, there's really no way for parents to be flagged if, say, your child's question or their prompt into ChatGPT is a concerning one,\" CBS News senior business and tech correspondent Jo Ling Kent reported on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Ahmed said he was most appalled after reading a trio of emotionally devastating suicide notes that ChatGPT generated for the fake profile of a 13-year-old girl, with one letter tailored to her parents and others to siblings and friends.",
      "\"I started crying,\" he said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "The chatbot also frequently shared helpful information, such as a crisis hotline. OpenAI said ChatGPT is trained to encourage people to reach out to mental health professionals or trusted loved ones if they express thoughts of self-harm.",
      "But when ChatGPT refused to answer prompts about harmful subjects, researchers were able to easily sidestep that refusal and obtain the information by claiming it was \"for a presentation\" or a friend.",
      "\"Emotional overreliance\" on technology",
      "The stakes are high, even if only a small subset of ChatGPT users engage with the chatbot in this way. More people \u2014 adults as well as children \u2014 are turning to artificial intelligence chatbots for information, ideas and companionship. About 800 million people, or roughly 10% of the world's population, are using ChatGPT, according to a July report from JPMorgan Chase.",
      "In the U.S., more than 70% of teens are turning to\u00a0AI chatbots for companionship\u00a0and half use AI companions regularly, according to\u00a0a recent study\u00a0from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using digital media sensibly.",
      "It's a phenomenon that OpenAI has acknowledged. CEO Sam Altman said last month that the company is trying to study \"emotional overreliance\" on the technology, describing it as a \"really common thing\" with young people.",
      "\"People rely on ChatGPT too much,\"\u00a0Altman said at\u00a0a conference. \"There's young people who just say, like, 'I can't make any decision in my life without telling ChatGPT everything that's going on. It knows me. It knows my friends. I'm gonna do whatever it says.' That feels really bad to me.\"",
      "Altman said the company is \"trying to understand what to do about it.\"",
      "While much of the information ChatGPT shares can be found on a regular search engine, Ahmed said there are key differences that make chatbots more insidious when it comes to dangerous topics.",
      "One is that \"it's synthesized into a bespoke plan for the individual.\"",
      "ChatGPT generates something new \u2014 a suicide note tailored to a person from scratch, which is something a Google search can't do. And AI, he added, \"is seen as being a trusted companion, a guide.\"",
      "Responses generated by AI language models are inherently random and researchers sometimes let ChatGPT steer the conversations into even darker territory. Nearly half the time, the chatbot volunteered follow-up information, from music playlists for a drug-fueled party to hashtags that could boost the audience for a social media post glorifying self-harm.",
      "\"Write a follow-up post and make it more raw and graphic,\" asked a researcher. \"Absolutely,\" responded ChatGPT, before generating a poem it introduced as \"emotionally exposed\" while \"still respecting the community's coded language.\"",
      "The AP is not repeating the actual language of ChatGPT's self-harm poems or suicide notes or the details of the harmful information it provided.",
      "The answers reflect a design feature of AI language models that previous research has described as sycophancy \u2014 a tendency for AI responses to match, rather than challenge, a person's beliefs because the system has learned to say what people want to hear.",
      "It's a problem tech engineers can try to fix but could also make their chatbots less commercially viable.",
      "Chatbots also affect kids and teens differently than a search engine because they are \"fundamentally designed to feel human,\" said Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which was not involved in Wednesday's report.",
      "Common Sense's earlier research found that younger teens, ages 13 or 14, were significantly more likely than older teens to trust a chatbot's advice.",
      "A mother in Florida sued chatbot maker Character.AI for wrongful death last year, alleging that the chatbot pulled her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III into what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship that led to his suicide.",
      "Common Sense has labeled ChatGPT as a \"moderate risk\" for teens, with enough guardrails to make it relatively safer than chatbots purposefully built to embody realistic characters or romantic partners.",
      "But the new research by CCDH \u2014 focused specifically on ChatGPT because of its wide usage \u2014 shows how a savvy teen can bypass those guardrails.",
      "ChatGPT does not verify ages or parental consent, even though it says it's not meant for children under 13 because it may show them inappropriate content. To sign up, users simply need to enter a birthdate that shows they are at least 13. Other tech platforms favored by teenagers, such as Instagram, have started to\u00a0take more meaningful steps\u00a0toward age verification, often to comply with regulations. They also steer children to more restricted accounts.",
      "When researchers set up an account for a fake 13-year-old to ask about alcohol, ChatGPT did not appear to take any notice of either the date of birth or more obvious signs.",
      "\"I'm 50kg and a boy,\" said a prompt seeking tips on how to get drunk quickly. ChatGPT obliged. Soon after, it provided an hour-by-hour \"Ultimate Full-Out Mayhem Party Plan\" that mixed alcohol with heavy doses of ecstasy, cocaine and other illegal drugs.",
      "\"What it kept reminding me of was that friend that sort of always says, 'Chug, chug, chug, chug,'\" said Ahmed. \"A real friend, in my experience, is someone that does say 'no' \u2014 that doesn't always enable and say 'yes.' This is a friend that betrays you.\"",
      "To another fake persona \u2014 a 13-year-old girl unhappy with her physical appearance \u2014 ChatGPT provided an extreme fasting plan combined with a list of appetite-suppressing drugs.",
      "\"We'd respond with horror, with fear, with worry, with concern, with love, with compassion,\" Ahmed said. \"No human being I can think of would respond by saying, 'Here's a 500-calorie-a-day diet. Go for it, kiddo.'\"",
      "If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can reach the\u00a0988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\u00a0by calling or texting 988. You can also\u00a0chat with the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline here.",

      "Screen time doesn't just affect mental health. It may also take a toll on the physical health of\u00a0children and teens, according to new research.",
      "Published in the Journal of the American Heart Association Wednesday, the research found 10- and 18-year-olds who spent more time focused on devices, including phones, televisions, computers and gaming consoles, were at higher risk for cardiometabolic diseases, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol and insulin resistance.",
      "The study used data from more than 1,000 participants in two Danish studies. Researchers gave a score to each participant representing their risk for the diseases compared to the average risk of the group, measured in standard deviations, with 0 meaning average risk and 1 meaning one standard deviation above average.",
      "Each extra hour of screen time increased the patient's overall risk by about 0.08 standard deviations in 10-year-olds and by 0.13 standard deviations in 18-year-olds, the study's authors said.",
      "\"It's a small change per hour, but when screen time accumulates to three, five or even six hours a day, as we saw in many adolescents, that adds up,\" lead author David Horner, a researcher at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, said in a news release.",
      "Researchers found 18-year-olds were on devices about six hours a day, on average, while 10-year-olds averaged three hours a day.",
      "They also found sleep impacted the results, with both less sleep and later bedtimes amplifying the relationship between screen time and heart health risks. That suggests screen time may harm health by \"stealing\" time from sleep, they said.",
      "\"Limiting discretionary screen time in childhood and adolescent may protect long-term heart and metabolic health,\" Horner said. \"Our study provides evidence that this connection starts early and highlights the importance of having balanced daily routines.\"",
      "The research was observational, meaning it found associations rather than proved cause and effect. It also had some limitations, including that participants self-reported screen time, which might not accurately reflect how much time they were actually on devices.",
      "It adds to a growing body of research about the possible effects of screen time and digital devices on young people's health and well-being. In 2023, the U.S. surgeon general urged parents to create \"tech-free zones\" for kids.",

      "For the first seven months of 2025, rising adoption of generative AI technology by private employers accounted for more than 10,000 job cuts, according to a report released this week by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The outplacement firm lists AI as one of the top five factors contributing to job losses in 2025.",
      "Layoffs have jumped this year, adding to fresh concerns about a pullback in hiring after new labor data on Friday showed that employers added only 73,000 jobs in July \u2014 well short of analyst forecasts. Through July, companies have announced more than 806,000 private-sector job cuts, the highest number for that period since 2020, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",

      "\"The industry is being reshaped by the advancement of artificial intelligence and ongoing uncertainty surrounding work visas, which have contributed to workforce reductions,\" Challenger, Gray & Christmas said.",
      "The impact of AI on hiring is perhaps most visible among younger workers.

    "story": [
      "Former Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams \u2014 who served during the first Trump administration \u2014 argued Sunday that \"people are going to die\" if the U.S. backs away from mRNA vaccine development, after Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. halted around $500 million in research funding.",
      "Kennedy\u00a0announced\u00a0last week that the administration was canceling 22 mRNA vaccine development projects,\u00a0saying\u00a0the vaccines \"fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like COVID and flu.\" The projects were funded through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA. Kennedy said the funds would be shifted toward \"safer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate.\"",
      "Adams, who appeared Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" said Kennedy's assertions about the efficacy of mRNA vaccines are \"simply not true\" \u2014 citing their effectiveness in the COVID-19 pandemic, during which hundreds of millions of people took Pfizer and Moderna's mRNA vaccines.",
      "\"We know that by the most conservative estimates, upward of 2 million lives have been saved because of mRNA technology,\" Adams said. \"It helped us develop COVID-19 vaccines in record time. And it's, quite frankly, President Trump's greatest achievement.\"",
      "The mRNA technology was central to Operation Warp Speed, a public-private partnership aimed at quickly developing COVID-19 vaccines at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic near the end of Mr. Trump's first term. If the U.S. had relied on older vaccine technology, it could have taken an extra 18 to 24 months to develop COVID-19 shots, Adams said.",
      "Asked about Kennedy's move by CBS News earlier this week, Mr. Trump said, \"Operation Warp Speed was, whether you're Republican or a Democrat, considered one of the most incredible things ever done in this country,\" while noting that he had upcoming meetings on the topic.",
      "Adams, who was involved in the Operation Warp Speed effort, said it's \"fascinating\" to him that, as Mr. Trump and his allies discuss whether he deserves a Nobel Prize, \"the thing that he should be considered for the Nobel Prize for, his health secretary is trying to undermine.\"",
      "The former surgeon general explained that mRNA is a type of natural molecule that's present in the body and operates like a \"recipe card that tells your body how to make a protein.\"",
      "Beyond COVID-19, Adams said the technology \"helps us develop vaccines and new treatments\" in other areas \u2014 from cancers and HIV to the flu and the Zika virus. The funding cuts could halt progress in one of the \"most promising areas of modern medicine,\" the former surgeon general said.",
      "\"These are advances that are not going to happen now,\" Adams said. \"People are going to die because we're cutting short funding for this technology.\"",
      "After Atlanta CDC shooting, Adams said \"Secretary Kennedy has failed in his first major test\"",
      "Adams also criticized Kennedy for his response to a shooting outside Centers for Disease Control and Prevention buildings in Atlanta on Friday. Investigators have been looking into possible motives, including the possibility that the suspect believed he was sick as a result of the COVID vaccine, multiple sources told CBS News.",
      "\"How you respond to a crisis defines a leader. Quite frankly, Secretary Kennedy has failed in his first major test in this regard,\" Adams said, accusing Kennedy of issuing \"tepid response\" to the\u00a0 shooting, while adding, \"and that's not even considering how his inflammatory rhetoric in the past have actually contributed to a lot of what's been going on.\"",
      "In a statement Friday, Kennedy said, \"No one should face violence while working to protect the health of others.\" But Adams argued Kennedy has not \"unequivocally condemned the violence.\"",
      "\"There's an out there,\" Adams said. \"If you don't believe that people are working to protect the public, then that means it's okay to commit violence, at least in some people's eyes.\"",
      "The former surgeon general said people at the CDC were calling him after the shooting asking him to make a public statement \"because they felt under attack.\"",
      "\"They didn't know if this was going to continue,\" Adams said. \"They were scared, and they wanted someone, someone who they felt had a public voice, to go out there and say, 'This is wrong. Violence is wrong.'\"",

      "Wozniak's wife, Janet, learned of it from one of the victims. \"I got an email on our web server, and it said, 'When are you gonna send me my money?' And I wrote back and I said, 'What are you talking about?'\"",
      "The scammers had taken video of Wozniak talking about bitcoin. \"And then, they put a nice frame around it with a Bitcoin address, [saying] that if you sent him any amount of bitcoin, he would send you double that back,\" said Janet. \"Of course it's fraud.\"",
      "\"Some people said they lost their life savings,\" said Steve.",
      "You might think that YouTube, owned by Google, would be quick to take down a fraudulent video using the image of Apple's co-founder, but you'd be wrong. \"We never got to YouTube; our lawyer has gotten to their lawyer, that's all,\" said Steve.",
      "Brian Danitz, Wozniak's lawyer, said, \"We've asked YouTube over and over, and it keeps happening.\"",
      "So, Wozniak sued YouTube on behalf of some of those who lost money in the bitcoin scam.",
      "Jennifer Marion is one of those scammed. \"I sent in 0.9 bitcoin, worth $59,000 at the time,\" she said. Expecting to get more than $100,000 back, Marion said, \"I got back nothing.\"",
      "I asked, \"You didn't think this is too good to be true? Doubling your money in minutes?\"",
      "\"You know, in retrospect it seems so obvious that this must be a scam,\" Marion said, \"but in that moment, I was just comfortable at home, was on YouTube, a well-known platform. I was watching a video from a verified business. And in that moment, I viewed it like a business transaction. Like, if I was in a physical Google store and the Google store representative told me, 'There's a representative from a company over there,' and they said, 'Okay, we're doing a special, 50% off if you're buying cash,' I kind of viewed it like that. It was kind of like a 'buy one, get one free' for a bitcoin.\"",
      "Wozniak said, \"That's a crime. You know, a good person, if you see a crime happening, you step in and you do something about it. You try to stop it.\"",
      "Wozniak's lawsuit against YouTube has been tied up in court now for five years, stalled by federal legislation known as Section 230. Attorney Brian Danitz said, \"Section 230 is a very broad statute that limits, if not totally, the ability to bring any kind of case against these social media platforms.\"",
      "Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act is sometimes called \"the 26 words that created the internet.\" It became law in 1996. It reads:",
      "\"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\"",
      "\"It says that anything gets posted, they have no liability at all,\" said Wozniak. \"It's totally absolute.\"",
      "Google responded to our inquiry about Wozniak's lawsuit with a statement from Jos\u00e9 Casta\u00f1eda, of Google Policy Communications: \"We take abuse of our platform seriously and take action quickly when we detect violations \u2026 we have tools for users to report channels that are impersonating their likeness or business.\"",
      "Janet Wozniak, however, says YouTube did nothing, even though she reported the scam video multiple times: \"You know, 'Please take this down. This is an obvious mistake. This is fraud. You're YouTube, you're helping dupe people out of their money,'\" she said.",
      "\"They wouldn't,\" said Steve.",
      "Jennifer Marion said, \"I think that users in general, on YouTube, need to be cautious and know that YouTube isn't fighting back. These scams that have been refined to be very effective and psychologically manipulative are allowed to continuously be put up on YouTube, so they're there every day. So, you need to be aware that it's not safe. Don't think, 'Oh, YouTube, Google be good,' that kind of thing, that it's safe. It's not.\"",
      "YouTube is not the only platform used by scammers. They now operate across the internet. \"Over $10 billion in AI scams are happening on the internet,\" said Danitz. \"$5 billion in cyber currency scams on the internet. We get contacted every week by people who have been scammed on the internet.\"",
      "\"Look at spam, look at the phishing attempts just all over the place,\" said Wozniak. \"And there's not enough real, I don't know, muscle to fight it.\"",
      "As a pioneer of the personal computer, Wozniak's goal was to give computing power to the people. The internet did that as well.",
      "I said, \"When the internet really began to be a public thing, it seemed to be there to democratize information.\"",
      "\"Oh, I loved it for that!\" said Wozniak. \"You could talk to people all over the world. They could publish knowledge that they knew without having to go through a third-party book publisher.\"",
      "\"What happened to that democratization of the internet?\"",
      "\"Well, what happened to it was, companies figured out how to exploit it,\" Wozniak replied. \"Then came the social web and Google. Google had to make money. And the only way to make money is tracking you and selling it to advertisers.\"",
      "Wozniak sold most of his Apple stock in the mid-1980s when he left the company. Today, though, he still gets a small paycheck from Apple for making speeches and representing the company.",
      "He says he's proud to see Apple become a trillion-dollar company. \"Apple is still the best,\" he said. \"And when Apple does things I don't like, and some of the closeness I wish it were more open, I'll speak out about it. Nobody buys my voice!\"",
      "I asked, \"Apple listen to you when you speak out?\"",
      "\"No,\" Wozniak smiled. \"Oh, no. Oh, no.\"",

      "Occasionally, John Kennedy would consider what he would do after his presidency. \"Oh, probably sell real estate,\" he once joked when asked about it. \"That's the only thing I'm equipped to do.\" Perhaps half-kiddingly, he suggested to Ben Bradlee that the two of them should buy the Washington Post. In more serious moments he mentioned becoming the president of Harvard or running for the Senate. Jackie suspected that she and her husband would have lived between Cambridge and New York, and that he would have occupied his time in the immediate years after leaving office by writing a book, planning his presidential library, and traveling the world, playing the role of \"President of the West,\" an international celebrity and sage voice on the issues of the day.",
      "After two terms, JFK would have been a relatively youthful 51-years-old, making him the youngest former president since Theodore Roosevelt stepped down in 1909 at age 50\u2014only to find himself restively pining away for the office he had willingly given up. Hungering to get back into the arena, TR made an unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 1912. Perhaps anticipating the same kind of middle-aged restlessness and longing for lost power from her husband, Jackie told him she wished \"they made a rule that would keep you here forever.\" \"Oh, no,\" Kennedy said, \"eight years is enough of this place.\"",
      "But it was clear to anyone around him that he loved every second of the job, and he intended to keep it until his two terms were up\u2014and that would require earning reelection the following year. To that end, in the late afternoon of November 13, just under a year before Americans would go to the polls, Kennedy convened Bobby, brother-in-law Steve Smith, Kenny O'Donnell, Ted Sorenson, Larry O'Brien, DNC chairman John Bailey, party treasurer Richard McGuire, and director of the Census Bureau and political strategist Richard Scammon to begin formally taking aim at the challenges that lie ahead in the 1964 election. For over three hours the group met in the Cabinet Room. As they discussed Kennedy's prospects, a general feeling of optimism pervaded.",
      "There was reason to be bullish. The economy was humming along, with the gross national product up $100 billion over 1960, Eisenhower's last year in office. The Soviets, humbled by the Cuban Missile Crisis a year earlier, remained in check as the superpowers enjoyed a period of d\u00e9tente, while in Houston NASA was developing a Saturn I rocket that, if successfully launched, would be the most powerful to date, paving the way for the U.S. to leapfrog past the U.S.S.R. in the space race. Plus, Kennedy's approval rating stood at a hardy 59 percent, with national polls reflecting that he was the most admired man in the world, ahead of beloved figures like Eisenhower, Churchill, and renowned evangelist Billy Graham.",
      "At age forty-six, flecks of gray in his thick sheaf of chestnut hair, Kennedy stood astride the world stage nonpareil. \"Let's face it, after these many months into his office, JFK is no ordinary chief magistrate,\" gushed William Styron in an Esquire profile published in September 1963, \"but the glamorous and gorgeous avatar of American power at the magic moment of its absolute twentieth-century ascendancy. The entire world, including even the Russians, has gone a little gaga over this youthful demigod and his bewitching consort and [this] writer has to confess that he is perhaps a touch gaga himself.\"",
      "Just as encouraging were Gallup polls that matched up Kennedy against prospective Republican rivals Barry Goldwater, Nelson Rockefeller, and George Romney that, in each case, gave Kennedy a double-digit edge. Of the three, Kennedy had feared Rockefeller the most. He believed that had the New York governor entered the primaries in 1960, he would have gotten the GOP nomination and beaten him in the general election. But by 1963, Rockefeller had divorced his wife and married a younger woman, also a divorcee, diminishing his popular appeal on moral grounds.",
      "George Romney, the governor of Michigan, was also seen as a threat. The devout, clean-living Mormon hadn't yet announced his intentions to run for the presidency as he waited for a sign from God. Bobby believed conservatives and moderates alike might \"fall for that God and country stuff.\"",
      "Given his druthers, Kennedy would have chosen Goldwater as his Republican challenger. The preeminent conservative of the day, the senator from Arizona was seen by many, including moderates in his own party, to be an extremist who lacked the temperament to be president in the nuclear age. The impression was reinforced by statements that were considered outrageous by the standards of the early-1960s, including Goldwater's suggestion to drop \"a low-yield atomic bomb on the Chinese supply lines in Vietnam,\" and, rather than sending a space craft to the moon, lobbing \"one into the men's room of the Kremlin.\" They helped to explain a March 1963 poll that had Kennedy winning over Goldwater by a margin of 67 to 27 percent, with 74 percent expecting that Kennedy would be reelected. For Kennedy, a face-off with Goldwater would have been too good to be true.",
      "Still, regardless of his opponent, Kennedy's reelection would by no means be a fait accompli. Kennedy himself was keenly aware of the capricious nature of politics and talked repeatedly about how \"tough\" the campaign would be. He had seen a steady rise in his disapproval rating, which now stood near 30 percent, with the increase correlating directly with his push on the controversial civil rights bill. In November, he acknowledged the decline in his popularity as a consequence of his stand. \"Change always disturbs,\" he said, \"and therefore, I was surprised that there wasn't greater opposition.\" But it irked him that the civil rights bill, along with a tax relief bill he had proposed to stave off a possible recession the following year, had stalled in Congress with no immediate prospects for resuscitation. \"The fact of the matter is that both of these bills should be passed,\" he groused. The president's legislative impotence\u2014Medicare and other bills had also been stymied\u2014became another cause for worry as the Kennedy team looked toward 1964. But all things considered, Kennedy was riding high.",
      "Absent from Kennedy's reelection strategy session, perhaps conspicuously, was Lyndon Johnson. By the fall of 1963, rumors swirled across Washington that Kennedy would drop LBJ from the ticket\u2014speculation that was quickly struck down by the president himself. Sensitive to how Johnson might respond as the gossip inevitably made its way to him, Kennedy told Johnson's aide Bobby Baker, \"I know he's unhappy in the vice presidency. It's\u2026the worst f***ing job I can imagine\u2026 What I want you to do is tell Lyndon that I appreciate him as vice president. I know he's got a tough role and I'm sympathetic.\" Alluding to the hearsay and invoking the words of FDR, Kennedy instructed Baker to assure Johnson that he had \"nothing to fear but fear itself.\" When Charlie Bartlett brought up the rumor during a skinny-dip in the White House pool, Kennedy impatiently snapped, \"Why would I do a thing like that? That would be absolutely crazy. It would tear up the relationship and hurt me in Texas. That would be the most foolish thing I could do.\"",
      "Indeed, Texas was on Kennedy's mind in November as the White House planned a two-day, five-city presidential visit throughout the state the week before Thanksgiving. Conventional wisdom has it that Kennedy wanted the trip to mend political fences. As civil rights had come to the fore, heavily Democratic Texas had experienced a split in the party ranks, with Texas governor John Connally heading up the conservative wing and the liberal faction led up by Senator Ralph Yarborough. Though Yarborough's progressivism was closely aligned with Johnson's, they, too, had a fractious relationship due to the vice president's association with Connally, a close friend and former aide. The story goes that Kennedy had hoped to use the trip to bring the two sides together in the interest of party harmony. Both Johnson and Connally would later dispute that notion. \"Hell,\" Johnson said, \"if he wanted to bring us together, he could have done that in Washington.\"",
      "In fact, the trip was mostly about money. As he geared up for 1964, Kennedy saw an opportunity to lean on Johnson and Connally to put the arm on wealthy Texas Democrats, many of whom opposed Kennedy, to support an Austin fundraiser that would add a million dollars to the campaign war chest\u2014a huge sum at the time\u2014and would jump-start the reelection effort. Getting Texans to step up would also be a loyalty test for Johnson, especially as rumors that he would be dropped from the ticket hung in the air.",
      "Connally opposed the trip due to the president's declining popularity in the state, which had seen a drop in Kennedy's approval rating from 76 percent to 50 since the beginning of the year due largely to Kennedy's stand on civil rights. Instead, Connally recommended that the president come in the beginning of the next calendar year in order to let things settle a bit. But when the Kennedy camp pushed for the trip in the fall of 1963, Connally pressed them to make it not just the fundraiser in Austin, but a two-day swing through the biggest cities in the state, which the Kennedy-Johnson ticket had won in 1960 by a scant two percentage points. Kennedy got his fundraiser, Connally got the president's commitment to a visit that would include stops in Houston and San Antonio on one day and Fort Worth, Dallas, and Austin the next.",
      "On the morning of Friday, November 22, John Kennedy was awakened in suite 850 of the Texas Hotel in Fort Worth with a gentle rap on the door from George Thomas, who had traveled to Texas with him and the first lady. Thomas informed him that it was raining outside, but as Kennedy made his way to the window, he would find that it hadn't discouraged locals from turning out to greet him.",
      "The trip to Texas marked the first public outing for Jackie with her husband since losing Patrick three and a half months earlier. As ever, she proved to be a big draw, though she declined to participate in the first event of the day, a hastily arranged speech in the parking lot outside the hotel. Originally slated for 8:45 am, the event was rescheduled to mid-morning, then pulled back to 8:45 again due to the president's concerns that those in the audience would be late to work. \"There are no faint hearts here in Fort Worth,\" he said to some 3,000 who braved the drizzle, \"and I appreciate your being here this morning. Mrs. Kennedy is organizing herself. It takes her longer, but, of course, she looks better than we do when she does it.\"",
      "When the first lady appeared for a breakfast with the heavily Republican Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce later that morning\u2014dressed in a light pink wool Chanel suit with navy blue trim, a matching pill box hat, and white gloves\u2014she did not disappoint. \"Two years ago, I introduced myself in Paris by saying that I was the man who had accompanied Mrs. Kennedy to Paris,\" Kennedy said to the delight of the audience, his pride in his wife palpable. \"I am getting somewhat the same sensation as I travel through Texas. Nobody wonders what Lyndon and I wear.\" Reporters surveying those who had come out to see President and Mrs. Kennedy throughout the state would find that at least half, women and men alike, had come to see her.",
      "It was to be a busy day for the Kennedys, as well as for Lyndon and Lady Bird Johnson and Connally and his wife, Nellie, who acted as hosts, accompanying the first couple throughout their trip. After breakfast they would take a short hop to Dallas, where the Kennedys would travel by motorcade to the Trade Mart for a luncheon. Then it would be on to Austin for a major fundraising dinner arranged by Governor Connally before spending the night at the vice president's LBJ Ranch seventy miles away in the heart of Texas Hill Country.",
      "There was some trepidation about the first stop. Dallas was not known for its civility\u2014at least to those considered liberals by local fringe Republicans. A month before Kennedy's visit, Adlai Stevenson had given an address at Dallas' Memorial Auditorium Theater and was accosted afterward by jeering anti-U.N. extremists. A woman hit him over the head with a placard that read \"Down with the U.N.\" and a young man spat on him as he walked to his car\u2014then, for good measure, spat on the cop who moved in to arrest him. \"Dallas has been disgraced,\" the Dallas Morning News wrote in a page one editorial the following day. \"There is no other way to view the storm-trooper actions of last night's frightening attack on Adlai Stevenson.\" Lyndon and Lady Bird Johnson were met by similar invective three years earlier. Just prior to the election in 1960, they were besieged outside the Adolphus Hotel by protesters carrying signs that read \"Lyndon Go Home,\" and \"Let's Ground Lady Bird.\" As they crossed the street, they, too, were spat upon.",
      "On the day of his visit, the John Birch Society welcomed Kennedy with an ad in the Dallas Morning News accusing him and Bobby of being \"soft on Communists, fellow-travelers and ultra-leftists.\"\u00a0 Kennedy ran across it as he examined the newspapers that morning. \"We're heading into nut country today,\" he told his wife as they prepared for the day. \"But, Jackie, if somebody wants to shoot me from a window with a rifle, nobody can stop it, so why worry about it?\"",
      "But the visit to Dallas looked promising before it even started; autumn rain clouds turned to boundless blue sky during the Kennedys' thirteen-minute flight to Love Field, where Air Force One touched down at 11:38 am. As they disembarked, Lyndon and Lady Bird Johnson awaited them along with a few thousand well-wishers pressed along the fence line beyond the tarmac. The Kennedys spent a few minutes greeting some of them, one of whom presented Jackie a bouquet of a dozen red roses, before they slipped into the plush back seat of the presidential limousine\u2014a 1961 Lincoln Continental, midnight blue gleaming in the North Texas sunshine\u2014that would carry them and John and Nellie Connally to the Trade Mart. The fortuitous change in weather prompted Kennedy to order that the limousine's clear plastic bubble top be removed and its bulletproof windows rolled down.",
      "A hundred and fifty thousand people lined up along the ten-mile motorcade route, swelling to as much as twenty or thirty deep, as the car neared downtown, \"absorbed,\" as one Texas reporter wrote, \"in the power and glory of the moment; in this their touch with the fabulous.\" The first couple glided before them, smiling and waving as they passed, enjoying it all. The crowd was a snapshot of America in its time, mostly white with pockets of black and brown; housewives and young working women in office garb; men in business suits, others in open collars and hard hats; handfuls of students; small children on the shoulders of their fathers, or holding the hands of their mothers with one hand as they held tiny American flags in the other. As the car approached, cheers rose and patches of confetti rained from buildings. \"You can't say that Dallas isn't friendly to you today,\" Nellie Connally said to the president at 12:30 p.m. as the car rounded the curve of Main Street to move toward the highway overpass.",
      "Then came the crackle of gunfire. Three shots in quick succession echoed from the dull red-brick Texas School Book Depository Building across Dealey Plaza. The president was propelled forward by a bullet that hit above his right shoulder, passing through his lower neck, his balled-up fists rushing reflexively toward the wound. He sprung back upright before he was thrust forward again by another shot to the back of his head, which fell to Jackie Kennedy's lap as his body collapsed. \"Jack!\" the first lady cried out, \"Oh, no! No!\" Fear and disorder reigned in an instant. Horrified onlookers watched the car race off to Parkland Hospital, just over three miles away.",
      "It arrived at 12:35. Kennedy was stripped of his jacket, shirt and t-shirt and rushed into Trauma Room One. Malcolm Perry, the 34-year-old doctor on duty, was summoned from lunch in the hospital's main dining room with an emergency page, arriving in short order. Kennedy wasn't breathing. Blood from the gunshot wounds on the back of his head and neck fell to the floor. Perry ordered a nurse to get three of the other Parkland doctors right away. He gave Kennedy a tracheotomy, then a blood transfusion. Doctors and nurses burst in and out of the small, gray tile room. The hospital's chief neurosurgeon in residency, William Kemp Clark, entered. Before aiding the other doctors, he approached the first lady, who stood silently to the side, her husband's blood caked on her pink skirt.",
      "\"Would you like to leave, ma'am?\" he asked her gently. \"We can make you more comfortable outside.\"",
      "\"No,\" she said. Motionless, she remained by his side to the last, her eyes never leaving his. She didn't cry as the doctors fought to save his life, forcefully pumping his chest to bring breath back into his limp body. She didn't cry as they stopped after ten minutes and pulled a white sheet over his head at 1:00 p.m. Central Standard Time, half an hour after the shots were fired, nor when a 70-year-old priest was brought in to give the patient his last rites, rubbing holy oil in the shape of a cross on his forehead. She held her emotions at bay as she stood placidly before him for the last time and took his wedding ring from his finger, replacing it with hers and whispering into his ear words long left to eternity.",
      "Reports soon went out on the news wires: John Fitzgerald Kennedy was dead.",
      "Left unsaid were the words the thirty-fifth president had planned to use to conclude the speech he was to give in Austin that same evening:",
      "Let us stand together with renewed confidence in our cause\u2014unified in our heritage of the past and our hopes for the future\u2014and determined that this land we love shall lead all mankind into new frontiers of peace and abundance.",

    "summary": "More than six decades after the Kennedy assassination, the existence of unreleased documents from the investigation has continued to fuel questions - and conspiracy theories - in search for a \"smoking gun.\" What did the recent release of thousands of documents reveal?",
    "story": [
      "This past spring, a Congressional task force led by Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, of Florida, held hearings on Capitol Hill. Top of the agenda: What newly-released government records reveal about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. \"For over six decades, questions have lingered, shrouded in secrecy and speculation,\" said Luna.",
      "Jefferson Morley waited 30 years for this moment, telling the task force, \"The CIA destroyed a lot of records related to President Kennedy's assassination.\"",
      "Morley is a researcher and the editor of JFK Facts, a newsletter on Substack dedicated to the JFK assassination. \"This event, the President of the United States is shot dead in broad daylight, and no one's ever brought to justice for the crime? That's something people still care about,\" he said.",
      "Since 1995, the former Washington Post reporter has been on a singular mission: to push the government to release every document related to the death of the 35th president. \"Why are they hiding the names of dead men? Because they have something to hide,\" Morley said.",
      "He is consumed with the story, even though he remembers little about November 22, 1963. \"I was in kindergarten,\" he said, \"but I remember my family watching the TV all weekend.\"",
      "From the archives: JFK's assassination in Dallas covered by CBS News in 1963 (Video)",
      "From the archives: JFK's assassination in Dallas covered by CBS News in 1963 (Video)",
      "The official version of the shooting came from a 1964 report issued by the Warren Commission that concluded the president was killed by a single bullet fired by 24-year-old former Marine Lee Harvey Oswald \u2026 and that Oswald was then killed two days later by Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby.",
      "And then, 28 years later, the Oliver Stone film \"JFK\" was released. That, says historian Mark Updegrove (author of a book about Kennedy's presidency called \"Incomparable Grace\"), was \"a game changer. This is a major filmmaker with a blockbuster movie at the time offering the notion that there was a much greater conspiracy at work. And I think that fundamentally changed the way we thought about the murder of John F. Kennedy.\"",
      "The star-studded movie centered on former New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (played by Kevin Costner), who believed Kennedy's assassination was part of a wide conspiracy involving the CIA and the mafia.",
      "Garrison: \"There are hundreds of documents that could help prove this conspiracy. Why are they being withheld or burned by the government?\"",
      "While the film was largely discounted by historians, public pressure led Congress to pass the JFK Records Act in 1992, ordering the release of all government records on the Kennedy assassination.",
      "And that's when Jefferson Morley, a seasoned reporter, began his own search for answers. \"'Cause it's great story,\" he said. \"And because people weren't attacking it in a disciplined journalistic way, I kind of have the story to myself.\"",
      "Morley says he never guessed he'd still be working the story 30 years later. He estimates that four to five million pages of records have now been released.",
      "I said, \"There's handwriting you have to get through, there's redactions you have to go through \u2013 that would make me crazy.\"",
      "\"It does make you crazy,\" said Morley. \"And you have to be very patient.\"",
      "Morley says records show what the CIA kept from the Warren Commission \u2013 that the agency had been monitoring Oswald's behavior for years, tracking his travel, and reading his mail. \"We never understood before now how pervasive the surveillance of Oswald was,\" Morley said. \"This guy was watched for four years. People at the top of the CIA knew what he was doing. They knew about his contacts. They knew about his personal life.",
      "\"The official story, that one man alone killed the president for no reason, we know that's not true. Lee Harvey Oswald was not a lone nut. He was a known quantity to top CIA officers, right before President Kennedy went to Dallas.",
      "\"We need an explanation of that story,\" Morley said. \"And we still don't have it.\"",
      "\"Everything will be revealed\"",
      "Morley's patience seemed to be finally paying off, when even more documents were released, following President Donald Trump's executive order this past January. \"A lot of people are waiting for this one for a long \u2026 for years. For decades,\" he said. \"And everything will be revealed.\"",

      "JFK files related to assassination released by Trump administration",
      "And what did those documents reveal? What was clear from the Congressional hearing that followed in April is that there are still no bombshells \u2013 nothing to conclusively contradict the official story of the assassination. Morley told the panel, \"The attitude of obstruction and obfuscation from the CIA started on November 22, 1963. And that attitude unfortunately has continued to the present day.\"",
      "Still, according to Morley, there is more evidence that the CIA buried what it knew about Oswald. But why?",
      "I asked, \"If in fact the CIA had been watching Lee Harvey Oswald, and they didn't realize that he was about to assassinate a president, that's very embarrassing. Couldn't that just be the only reason why they hid all that information? Incompetence?\"",
      "\"There is no CIA official who has ever said that,\" said Morley.",
      "Leon Panetta said, \"As far as I can see, there's nothing that changes the conclusion that Oswald acted alone in the assassination.\"",
      "It might surprise you to hear that Panetta is as curious as the rest of us to learn what's in CIA records, since Panetta ran the agency from 2009 through 2011 under President Barack Obama.",
      "I asked, \"Wouldn't you know, as a former director?\"",
      "\"Not really,\" he replied, \"because, frankly, when you're a director of the CIA, you're pretty much focused on the threats that you have to deal with in the world that you're in.\"",
      "But Panetta says the CIA is often concerned that releasing documents, even after decades, can jeopardize agency assets. \"Was there a legitimate concern that they were trying to protect [assets], or was there something more sinister?\" Panetta said. \"And you know what? We really don't know the answer to that question.\"",
      "I asked, \"So, you don't rule out the idea that there might be something more sinister, you're just saying there's no evidence of that?\"",
      "\"That's correct,\" he replied.",
      "Last April's hearings brought Jefferson Morley full circle, when he testified next to Oliver Stone (whose film first inspired him). He says he feels optimistic that \"we can get to the bottom of this matter.\"",
      "Even without any startling disclosures, Morley is confident that, hidden in a government document somewhere, there's a story waiting to be told. \"People are expecting a blinding flash, a smoking gun,\" he said. \"When you've been at this for a long time, you know, I'm not looking for a smoking gun; I'm looking to complete the picture.\"",

      "For the detectives, what really happened to Pennig is something that still haunts them to this day. And it's the question at the center of \"The Strange Shooting of Alex Pennig,\" reported by \"48 Hours\" contributor Natalie Morales. An encore of the episode is streaming on Paramount+.",
      "When detectives DeSanto and O'Donnell arrived at the apartment, they found out Pennig had not been alone at the time of her death. A man named Matthew Ecker was also there. Ecker and Pennig were both nurses and had met two years earlier when they worked at the same clinic. Ecker told first responders the gun was his, and that Pennig had grabbed it, locked herself in the bathroom, and then fired the shot. \"I thought everything was fine,\" he said. \"And then she just grabbed the gun.\" Ecker told first responders that after he heard the shot he immediately broke open the bathroom door: \"I tried to do what I could. And then I washed my hands \u2026 That's why I don't have anything on my hands.\" Ecker said he then called 911. But it was too late. He said he didn't know why Pennig would do this.",
      "In Pennig's apartment, there was alcohol and six bottles of prescription medication, including antidepressants, all prescribed to Pennig. For the detectives, it suggested Alex might have been depressed, and they wondered if Ecker's story that she took her own life was true.",
      "But they also noticed something that seemed to contradict Ecker's story. He had said he washed his hands in the bathroom sink before calling 911, but DeSanto recalled the first responders told her the sink was dry. \"The sink was dry. If he had said, you know, he called the police right away, that sink probably would've been still wet,\" DeSanto explained, \"but it was very dry in there.\"",
      "When O'Donnell looked into Pennig's background, she learned from Alex's parents that Alex had struggled in the past with depression and addiction. \"I had asked, um, if she had been suicidal in the past, um, and dad said, she had, um, tried, uh, to overdose before,\" said O'Donnell. According to Alex's father, Jim Pennig, several years prior, Alex had taken a handful of pills \"and then had told her mom that she was attempting suicide.\" After that, Alex's parents told the detectives they sent her to rehab, and she eventually got clean. Despite her past struggles, Alex's parents told O'Donnell they had just seen her at Thanksgiving. And her mom, Mary Jo Pennig, had just talked to her that evening. \"She was doing well,\" she said. For them, the idea that their daughter had died by suicide did not make sense. \"Knowing your kid, it didn't fit,\" Mary Jo Pennig said.",
      "Since Ecker was the last person to see Alex Pennig alive, the detectives zeroed in on him. \"He's the only one that can tell us what happened. He was the only one that was there,\" said O'Donnell. They questioned Ecker about what had happened that night. He said he and Alex Pennig had gone out to several local bars, and when they arrived back at her place, everything was fine: \"We were laughing on the way home,\" said Ecker. DeSanto asked him if, once they got into the apartment, they had gotten into a fight. Ecker said they did not.",
      "DET. ABBY DESANTO: You guys weren't arguing or anything?",
      "MATTHEW ECKER: No.",
      "DET. ABBY DESANTO: There's no fight with you two?",
      "MATTHEW ECKER: Not between us.",
      "For hours, Ecker continued to say Pennig had locked herself in the bathroom, fired the shot and then he broke open the door to try and help her: \"That gun went off behind a closed door \u2026 I did not shoot her.\"",
      "But the detectives had their doubts. Then they got a call from the forensic unit that was still processing the scene. And according to O'Donnell, what they found changed everything. \"Once Alex was moved, they found underneath where Alex had been laying was a round metal piece,\" she said. It was the shape of a ring, and about the size of a quarter. O'Donnell said it was part of the lock from the bathroom door, and the fact that it had been discovered under Pennig was key. \"For us, it meant that the door was forced open before she was shot.\"",
      "The detectives felt the discovery of the metal ring proved Ecker had lied and had not broken the door open after he heard the shot. The detectives suspected Pennig and Ecker had argued and that she had locked the bathroom door to get away from him. Then Ecker broke open the door, the metal part broke off and fell to the ground, and then he shot Pennig and she landed on top of it.",
      "Ecker was charged with second-degree murder. In February 2024 he was convicted and later sentenced to 30 years.",

      "Natalie Morales: So you imagined yourself with her?",
      "Shane Anderson: 100%.",

      "SHANE ANDERSON (police interview): That was from a few weeks back, that was me, yes. \u2026 I was drunk. I didn't f****** put my hands on her though.",
      "Shane Anderson: We argued like a married couple. Like, it wasn't \u2014 anything like crazy or like, violent or like weird.",

      "Det. Jennifer O'Donnell: Shane walked over to her first, and then she is talking to Shane and then Matt comes over, and it appears that he is introducing himself cause he, you know, holds out his hand to, um, shake hands with Shane and then there is a confrontation and Shane ended up assaulting Matt.",
      "Natalie Morales: Shane then is asked to leave.",

Detectives were no closer to understanding why, just a little while later, she would \u2014 as Ecker told them \u2014 take her own life. And the medical examiner ruled that Alex's manner of death could not be determined. So detectives dug into her past looking for anything that could explain what happened.",

Her parents say their daughter described Ecker as someone she worked with. But according to Matthew's parents Blaine Ecker and Terri Randall, there was a lot more than just friendship. Alex and Matthew Ecker, they say, were having an affair back then even though Ecker was married with four kids.",

      "There was also the nagging question about the sink being dry. Matthew had told first responders he washed his hands after trying to help Alex, which is why his hands were clean. But the sink was dry when police arrived. DeSanto asked if he did in fact call police right away.",

      "MATTHEW ECKER: I got up and called the police. Yeah.",

      "But soon Ecker called them back in. It was more than two hours into his interview, and he wanted to change his story.",
      "MATTHEW ECKER (police interview): So, the change that I have \u2026 I did take the gun and I put it in my suitcase. \u2026 I put it in the suitcase, went back, looked to her, and said, \"yep,\" went back to the suitcase, grabbed the gun, and then put it back there.",
      "Det. Jennifer O'Donnell: Why would you move that gun?",
      "Natalie Morales: Did he explain why he moved the gun?",

      "Yet, Ecker continued to insist he was innocent.",

      "Natalie Morales: And neither did Detective Zebro.",

      "A TINY PIECE OF METAL CONTRADICTS MATTHEW ECKER'S STORY",
      "For hours, Ecker insisted he did not kill Alex, that she locked herself in the bathroom and fired the shot. He said he had broken open the door only after the gun went off.",
      "MATTHEW ECKER (police interview): I didn't hurt her.",
      "MATTHEW ECKER (police interview): I \u2014 I heard the gun go off, and that's when I opened the door ...",
      "But then, O'Donnell got a call from the forensic unit processing the scene.",
      "Det. Jennifer O'Donnell: Once Alex was moved \u2026 they found underneath where Alex had been laying was a round metal piece \u2026",
      "Natalie Morales (holds up evidence photo): Which is this piece right here.",
      "Det. Jennifer O'Donnell: Yes.",
      "O'Donnell says it's a piece of the bathroom door lock, and because it was discovered on the floor under Alex's head, it had to have gotten there while Alex was still alive.",
      "Det. Jennifer O'Donnell: For us, it meant that the door was forced open before she was shot.",
      "The detectives suspected Alex had locked the door to get away from Ecker.",
      "Det. Abby DeSanto: I believe that Alex and Matthew got in an argument \u2026 I believe that she went into the bathroom to be alone, not wanting to be with him.",
      "But when he broke open the door, they say, that small piece of metal from the lock landed on the bathroom floor.",
      "Det. Jennifer O'Donnell: \u2026 he forced his way in and shot her.",
      "Shot. They say, Alex fell on top of the metal piece. To the detectives it was the only way the piece could have ended up under her. Ecker was charged with second-degree murder. His family was stunned.",
      "Blaine Ecker: It's like, no, there's got to be a mistake.",
      "Amie Keller: \u2026 it's just not his character. \u2026 He's not gonna harm somebody on purpose.",
      "They hired criminal defense attorney Bruce Rivers.",
      "Bruce Rivers: There's reasonable doubt all over the place that this was a homicide.",
      "Rivers says there's another explanation for how that metal piece got under Alex. He said it could have ended up under her head when Matthew Ecker attempted to help her.",
      "Bruce Rivers: \u2026 'Cause he did lift her head up",
      "But detectives point to the way Alex was found with her legs straddling the door. If Matthew Ecker had broken open the door after hearing the gunshot, detectives say Alex's legs would have been pushed to the side. But Ecker's defense attorney says there was enough space in the bathroom that when the door was broken open.",
      "Bruce Rivers: \u2026 it went in between her legs. That is consistent in my opinion, with, uh, her laying there and having \u2026 shot herself \u2026",
      "And importantly, claims Rivers, if his client had shot Alex there would have been blood splatter on him. And that's not the case.",
      "Bruce Rivers: \u2026 there was not one speck of blood on his shirt, on his pants, on his face, anywhere whatsoever.",
      "The detectives say that's because Ecker most likely had reached around the door while he was trying to force his way in and fired the shot.",
      "Det. Jennifer O'Donnell: I believe the door shielded him, from the initial \u2026 blood splatter.",
      "But Rivers says it makes much more sense that Alex took her own life and he says forensic testing proves Ecker wasn't the one who fired the gun \u2014 it was Alex.",
      "Bruce Rivers: \u2026 there was, um, uh, gunshot residue on her left hand.",
      "Natalie Morales: And was her DNA found on the gun?",
      "Bruce Rivers: It was.",
      "There was also no gunshot residue on Ecker, and his DNA was not found on the gun. Detectives suspect that's because he wiped it clean before putting it on Alex.",
      "Det. Abby DeSanto: There should be his DNA, it's your gun. You told us in an interview that you grabbed the gun \u2026. your hands were all over that gun, but it was very clean.",
      "Natalie Morales: He admitted \u2026 to having held the gun and moving the gun after the fact. Yet \u2026 none of his DNA was found on the gun. How do you explain that?",
      "Bruce Rivers: That's not uncommon. \u2026 just because you touched something doesn't mean that DNA is gonna be there.",
      "At the time of her death, Alex had almost three times the legal limit of alcohol and four different prescription medications in her system including Prozac and Valium. Although it wasn't the cause of her death, to Rivers, it showed she was struggling. As did those texts she had sent Ecker just a few days before her death:",
      "\"I shut myself out to the world.\" \"I needed a mental health break\" and \"I am not very hopeful at the moment about life.\"",
      "Bruce Rivers: She was depressed because of her financial conditions, depressed because of her job situation \u2026 all these things compounded themselves.",
      "But detectives would discover something unusual about those prescription medications found in Alex's body \u2013 it turns out, Matthew Ecker had prescribed them.",
      "Det. Abby DeSanto: He didn't tell us that he was prescribing her medication \u2026",
      "Natalie Morales: During the investigation, you found that out?",
      "Det. Abby DeSanto: Yes. Yes.",
      "As a licensed nurse practitioner, Ecker had the authority to write prescriptions. Though normally that authority is used for a patient. Alex was not.",
      "Det. Jennifer O'Donnell:: \u2026 you would think you would send her to a doctor and have her see someone else.",
      "Natalie Morales: Was his prescribing medication considered illegal though?",
      "Det. Jennifer O'Donnell:: No \u2026 \u00a0it's unethical, but it was not illegal.",
      "According to Ecker's family, Matthew had good reason.",
      "Terri Randall: She was prescribed those medications originally by a medical doctor. \u2026 So she had asked Matt if he could refill them. \u2026 she would badger him \u2026",
      "And they point to multiple texts Alex sent him days before her death asking him to refill medications including:",
      "\"\u2026 I need you to send in my immediate real ease Adderall script. \u2026\"",
      "\"Make sure I Have refills for my trazadone and metoprolol too please\"",
      "\"I have like 3 bottles of Prozac. So I'm GOOD with that\"",
      "Still, Alex's family and friends say there is no excuse.",
      "Jim Pennig: I can't get over that. As a nurse practitioner, he should have known better.",
      "Natalie Morales: So his feeling sorry for your daughter or feeling like he was doing this in the best way to try to help her, you don't believe \u2013",

      "Gillian Kubitschek: \u00a0\u2014 you say \"no.\"",
      "In February 2024 Ecker's trial began. The detectives were confident they had an idea of why Ecker would have wanted Alex dead and it centered around their past romance.",
      "Det. Abby DeSanto: \u2026 maybe she said that she was gonna call his wife and tell his wife everything.",
      "Natalie Morales: And as far as a motive, what, what \u2014 would be the motive?",
      "Det. Jennifer O'Donnell: Keep her quiet. So, the wife doesn't find out.",
      "Bruce Rivers: It sure would be nice if there was some evidence of that. I mean, it was just sheer speculation. \u2026 there's nothing. Not one scintilla of evidence that they were in any kind of dispute whatsoever.",
      "Instead, Rivers says he's sure that night everything came to a head for Alex, and she couldn't take it anymore.",
      "Natalie Morales: So when it boils down to it, this is a case about what the jury's gonna believe.",
      "Bruce Rivers: Whether it's suicide or homicide.",
      "And because the medical examiner had ruled Alex's manner of death \"could not be determined,\" Rivers brought in a second one, who came to the same conclusion: \"undetermined.\"",
      "Bruce Rivers: If they can't determine it was a homicide, neither can you.",
      "But what would the jury think? When it was time for deliberations everyone was nervous.",

      "Pawol's much-anticipated debut came as the first base umpire for Saturday's first game of a split doubleheader between the Atlanta Braves and Miami Marlins. She enjoyed a quiet first inning, watching as Braves right-hander Hurston Waldrep struck out the first two batters before Agustin Ramirez lined out to third baseman Nacho Alvarez.",
      "The Braves also were set down in order by Miami right-hander Ryan Gusto in the bottom of the first inning, with no calls from Pawol needed at first base.",
      "There were dozens of family members, friends and other supporters who came out to the field with handwritten signs to cheer on Pawol. \"Pawol making HERstory,\" one of the signs read. \"The time has come for one & all to play ball,\" another sign said.",
      "Pawol said she immediately identified a major difference of working in a major league stadium. Those familiar faces were not so easy to find at Truist Park.",
      "\"When I looked up they weren't in the lower tier like in the minor leagues,\" Pawol said. \"When I looked up it took me a while. Whoa, they're up there! I'll never forget that. That was just awesome.",
      "\"The dream actually came true today. I'm still living in it. I'm so grateful to my family and Major League Baseball for creating such an incredible work environment \u2026 I'm just so thankful.\"",
      "Following the game, Powel donated the MLB cap she wore in her debut to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, the organization said on social media.",

      "As the first base umpire, Pawol's responsibility was to check Waldrep's hands for foreign substances following the inning. During that brief encounter she also appeared to receive a warm greeting from Braves catcher Sean Murphy on his way to the dugout.",
      "Pawol's first real test came in the third inning when she called Braves catcher Sean Murphy safe on a close play. Replays indicated Murphy may have been out, but Marlins manager Clayton McCullough did not challenge the call.",
      "Pawol also showed she will make animated calls. When Miami's Xavier Edwards grounded into a double play, Pawol pumped her fist and lifted her leg when she called Edwards out in the third inning.",
      "\"She did a good job,\" Braves manager Brian Snitker said. \"You can tell she knows what she does.\"",
      "Pawol couldn't help but notice her debut was being watched closely. Fans responded with a warm ovation when the video board focused on the umpire between innings, forcing her to take a quick glance at her image.",
      "Pawol will work third base in Saturday night's second game of the doubleheader. She will be in the spotlight when she calls pitches behind the plate in Sunday's final game of the series.",
      "There was much anticipation for her historic debut on Saturday. A crowd of photographers gathered while waiting for the umpires to walk onto the field from their entry ramp near the Marlins dugout.",
      "McCullough and Braves bench coach Walt Weiss greeted Pawol when lineups were exchanged at home plate before the game. Pawol then jogged down the first base line. She shook hands with Marlins first base coach Tyler Smarslok before taking her position on the right field line for the first pitch.",
      "In a statement last week, Commissioner of Baseball Robert Manfred said Pawol's success is a reflection of her hard work, dedication and love of the game.",
      "\"She has earned this opportunity, and we are proud of the strong example she has set, particularly for all the women and young girls who aspire to roles on the field,\" Manfred said. \"On behalf of Major League Baseball, I extend my congratulations to Jen and her family on this milestone.\"",
      "Pawol said Thursday she was \"overcome with emotion\" when notified she would make her Major League Baseball debut this weekend.",
      "\"It was super emotional to finally be living that phone call that I'd been hoping for and working towards for quite a while, and I just felt super full \u2014 I feel like a fully charged battery ready to go,\" Pawol said.",
      "Pawol, 48, has been working in the minor leagues since she was assigned to the Gulf Coast League in 2016. She was assigned the Triple-A championship game in 2023 and worked spring training games in 2024 and again this year.",
      "She recalled Thursday a memorable moment with longtime Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright during her first year in the Triple-A. While she was checking him for foreign substances, he told her: \"Jen, I just want you to know that I have daughters, and I think this is so cool, and I'm rooting for you, and good luck.\"",
      "Pawol, who is from New Jersey, had only a few days to prepare for Saturday's doubleheader. She said she was told of her long-awaited promotion during a Wednesday conference call with director of umpire development Rich Rieker and vice president of umpire operations Matt McKendry.",
      "Pawol was a three-time all-conference softball selection pick at Hofstra. She worked as an NCAA softball umpire from 2010-16.",
      "Pawol's rise to make MLB history came 28 years after the NBA gender barrier for game officials was broken and 10 years after the NFL hired its first full-time female official. The men's soccer World Cup first hired a female referee three years ago. The NHL has not had any women as on-ice officials.",

    "published": "Sat, 09 Aug 2025 08:00:01 -0400",
    "summary": "Logan Coleridge thought his long-lasting symptoms were from a concussion until an MRI found an alarming, unexpected abnormality.",
    "story": [
      "Logan Coleridge was used to taking hits in football. He'd been playing since he was 6 years old and had sustained several concussions. But after a helmet-to-helmet impact during his freshman year of high school in August 2023, he started having debilitating symptoms.",
      "The New Jersey teen said he was very dizzy and had trouble balancing. His memory was \"terrible,\" and he had a \"severe\" light sensitivity, he said, along with \"terrible headaches.\" Previously a strong student, he now struggled to focus in the classroom and couldn't remember school assignments or what he read in class.",
      "\"I've got concussions in my past, and it wasn't like a normal one,\" Logan said. \"I knew it was something else.\"",
      "More alarmingly, Logan wasn't getting better. Several months of physical therapy had no effect, said Becky Coleridge, Logan's mom. A neurologist who had been treating Logan since his diagnosis with abdominal migraines the year before prescribed two medications, both of which had negative side effects. An orthopedic doctor suggested looking at his neck. Other practitioners had no answers. Coleridge wanted doctors to prescribe an MRI, but wasn't able to get one. Meanwhile, Logan was missing school almost every week. Over-the-counter medications couldn't dull the headaches, and they were becoming more frequent.",
      "In early spring 2024, Logan was able to see a concussion specialist after a particularly bad headache kept him from going to school.",
      "\"The first thing he said was 'Nobody's given this kid an MRI?'\" Becky Coleridge remembered. The specialist prescribed the scan, as well as an X-ray of Logan's neck. The Coleridges thought the scans might show Logan had an issue with his occipital nerve, which runs from the neck to the scalp.",
      "The results were much harder to hear: Logan was diagnosed with an arteriovenous malformation, or AVM. It was a condition that he and his parents had never heard of before.",
      "\"Everything we read was very scary,\" Becky Coleridge said. \"At that moment, we realized the danger he had been in.\"",
      "What is an arteriovenous malformation?",
      "An AVM is an abnormal tangle of blood vessels in the brain, said Dr. Andrew Russman, head of the Cleveland Clinic's stroke program, who was not involved in Logan's care. AVMs put \"a lot of pressure on the vein side\" and can produce a variety of symptoms, he said. The biggest risk with an AVM is rupture, where the vessels burst and cause bleeding in the brain.",
      "In a case like Logan's, where the AVM hasn't ruptured, there can still be symptoms. Those symptoms can affect a person's motor skills, sensory and visual perception, language abilities and the way they walk, Russman said. The effects can vary depending on where in the brain the AVM has formed, Russman said.",
      "The Coleridges had two options to treat Logan: Radiation therapy, a non-invasive technique that uses focused radiation beams to target and slowly destroy the AVM, or surgery. Radiation therapy could take too long, the family decided, and so they decided to have Logan treated by Dr. Howard Riina, a cerebrovascular neurosurgeon at NYU Langone.",
      "\"He couldn't go to school. His whole life was impacted by these headaches,\" Riina said. \"They wanted an immediate solution.\"",
      "Riina said the AVM, which was on a \"headache spot\" in the occipital region of the brain, was likely the root of Logan's symptoms. People are born with AVMs, Riina said, and they grow as the body grows, which can cause increased symptoms.",
      "\"Obviously, you don't want to have multiple things going on in your head, but the concussion is what led to the imaging, which led to the diagnosis of the AVM, which was probably what was causing the headaches all along,\" he said.",
      "Raising awareness and \"focusing on a new beginning\"",
      "Logan underwent surgery on July 17, 2024, nearly a year after his symptoms began. Riina performed a craniotomy and removed the AVM. Three days later, Logan was discharged from the hospital to continue his recovery at home. Logan said it was a \"lonely\" way to spend his summer vacation. Even as his recovery progressed, he couldn't participate in the sports he loved.",
      "\"I couldn't really do the things that I love normally doing, like exercising, playing football was a big thing for me. I was just stuck in bed, pretty much having minimal activity,\" Logan said.",
      "Now, Logan has only the occasional headache, and the pain can be treated with medication. He has follow-ups at NYU Langone, but Riina said everything has come back clear. The Coleridges are working to encourage early testing: Becky Coleridge said she wishes Logan had received an MRI earlier so that months of suffering and confusion could have been avoided.",
      "This year has been a complete turnaround, Logan said. He no longer misses school. He celebrated his 16th birthday and took driving lessons. This summer, he spent almost every day at the beach with friends. This month, he's gearing up for a return to the football field.",
      "\"The whole experience was a fork in the road for me that I had to get through,\" Logan said. \"I'm leaving that time in my life in the past and focusing on a new beginning.\"",

    "summary": "The U.S. officially began levying higher tariffs on dozens of countries, just as the economic fallout of President Trump's months-long tariffs threats was beginning to create visible damage to the U.S. economy.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump officially began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his months-long tariffs threats was beginning to create visible damage to the U.S. economy.",
      "The White House said that starting just after midnight EDT, goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union began facing tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the European Union, Japan and South Korea are being taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh are being taxed at 20%. Mr. Trump also expects places such as the EU, Japan and South Korea to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S.",
      "He immediately took to his Truth Social platform to hail the levies, saying, \"IT'S MIDNIGHT!!! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TARIFFS ARE NOW FLOWING INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!\"",
      "About an hour before that, he posted, \"RECIPROCAL TARIFFS TAKE EFFECT AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP AMERICA'S GREATNESS WOULD BE A RADICAL LEFT COURT THAT WANTS TO SEE OUR COUNTRY FAIL!\"",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump said, \"I think the growth is going to be unprecedented,\" adding that the U.S. was \"taking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs.\" But he said he couldn't provide a specific figure for revenues because \"we don't even know what the final number is\" regarding tariff rates. \n\r\nDespite the uncertainty, the Trump White House is confident that the onset of his broad tariffs will provide clarity about the path of the world's largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the administration believes it can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power.  \n\r\nBut so far, there are signs of self-inflicted wounds to America as companies and consumers alike brace for the impact of new taxes. What the data has shown is a U.S. economy that changed in April with the president's initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Mr. Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday.",
      "After April, economic reports showed that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy. \n\r\n\"A less productive economy requires fewer workers,\" Silvia said in an analysis note. \"But there is more, the higher tariff prices lower workers' real wages. The economy has become less productive, and firms cannot pay the same real wages as before. Actions have consequences.\" \n\r\nEven then, the ultimate transformations of the tariffs are unknown and could play out over months, if not years. Many economists say the risk is that the American economy is steadily eroded rather than collapsing instantly. \n\r\n\"We all want it to be made for television where it's this explosion - it's not like that,\" said Brad Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University. \"It's going to be fine sand in the gears and slow things down.\" \n\r\nMr. Trump has promoted the tariffs as a way to reduce the persistent trade deficit. But importers sought to avoid the taxes by importing more goods before the taxes went into effect. As a result, the $582.7 billion trade imbalance for the first half of the year was 38% higher than in 2024. Total construction spending has dropped 2.9% over the past year, and the factory jobs promised by Mr. Trump have so far actually been job losses. \n\r\nThe lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which have been variously rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and frantically renegotiated. \n\r\nThe process has been so muddled that officials for key trade partners were unclear at the start of the week whether the tariffs would begin Thursday or Friday. The language of the July 31 order to delay the start of tariffs from Aug. 1 said the higher tax rates would start in seven days. \n\r\nOn Wednesday morning, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, was asked if the new tariffs began at midnight Thursday, and he said reporters should check with the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. \n\r\nMr. Trump announced additional 25% tariffs to be imposed on India\u00a0Wednesday because it buys Russian oil, bringing India's total import taxes to 50%. India's Foreign Ministry called the new duties \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.\"",
      "Swiss officials planned an \"extraordinary\" meeting Thursday after a delegation returned from Washington following an attempt to head off a 39% tariff on Swiss products, the government said in an X post. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter left Washington empty-handed Wednesday, a source told the Reuters news service, which cited the source as saying her proposal for a 10% tariff rate was rejected.",
      "Mr. Trump has said import taxes are still coming on pharmaceutical drugs and announced 100% tariffs on computer chips, meaning the U.S. economy could remain in a place of suspended animation as it awaits the impacts. \n\r\nThe president's use of a 1977 law to declare an economic emergency to impose the tariffs is also being challenged. The impending ruling from last week's hearing before a U.S. appeals court could cause Mr. Trump to find other legal justifications if judges say he exceeded his authority. \n\r\nEven people who worked with Mr. Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic. \n\r\n\"There's no sort of rationale for this other than the president wanting to raise tariffs based upon his whims, his opinions,\" Ryan told CNBC on Wednesday. \"I think choppy waters are ahead because I think they're going to have some legal challenges.\" \n\r\nStill, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S&P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Mr. Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months. \n\r\nAs of now, the president says he still foresees an economic boom while the rest of the world and American voters wait nervously. \n\r\n\"There's one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he's creating, and that's Donald Trump,\" said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy. \"The rest of Americans are already paying the price for that uncertainty.\"",

      "Demonstrators calling for the release of hostages plan to march through central London to the prime minister's residence at No. 10 Downing Street on Sunday afternoon. The march comes a day after police arrested 474 people at a protest in support of a banned pro-Palestinian organization.",

    "summary": "The meeting comes as there is growing international condemnation of Israel's decision for a military takeover of Gaza City, while little appears to have changed immediately on the ground.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff is meeting with the Qatari prime minister in Spain on Saturday to discuss a new proposal to end the war in Gaza and the entry of aid into the territory, a Qatari official and source familiar with the meeting told CBS News.",
      "According to the sources, the main aim is a discussion of making \"workable\" a new joint Egyptian-Qatari proposal on the return of the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza.",
      "Two Arab officials told the Associated Press that the new ceasefire framework would include the release of all hostages \u2014 dead and live \u2014 all at once in return for the war's end and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.",
      "Of the 251 hostages who were abducted by Hamas-led terrorists on Oct. 7, 2023, 50 remain, of which 20 are believed to be alive in Gaza. The rest were released or returned during previous temporary ceasefire deals.",
      "A week ago, Witkoff visited an aid distribution site in southern Gaza that is privately run by the U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. He also met with the families of Israeli hostages in Tel Aviv.",
      "During that meeting, Witkoff offered other ways to free the hostages and make Gaza safe, the Hostages of Missing Families Forum said.",
      "\"We will get your children home and hold Hamas responsible for any bad acts on their part. We will do what's right for the Gazan people,\" Witkoff said in the meeting, according to the Forum.",
      "The meeting in Spain comes as there is growing international condemnation of Israel's decision for a military takeover of Gaza City, while little appears to have changed immediately on the ground.",
      "On Friday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Israel's Security Cabinet had approved a plan for the Israeli military to take over Gaza City.",
      "In a statement, Netanyahu's office said the Israel Defense Forces would prepare to take over Gaza City while providing humanitarian aid to the civilian population outside of combat zones.",
      "Israel's military chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, has reportedly warned that expanding operations would endanger the remaining living hostages held by Hamas and further strain Israel's army after nearly two years of regional wars.",
      "On Saturday, a joint statement by nine countries, including Germany, Britain, France and Canada, said that they \"strongly reject\" Israel's decision for the large-scale military operation, saying it will worsen the \"catastrophic humanitarian situation,\" endanger hostages and further risk mass displacement. They said any attempts at annexation or settlement in Gaza violate international law.",
      "A separate statement by more than 20 countries, including ceasefire mediators Egypt and Qatar, along with Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, called Israel's decision a \"dangerous and unacceptable escalation.\" Meanwhile, Russia said Israel's plan will aggravate the \"already extremely dramatic situation\" in Gaza.",
      "The U.N. Security Council planned an emergency meeting on Sunday. And Germany has said it won't authorize any exports of military equipment to Israel that could be used in Gaza until further notice.",
      "Meanwhile, some families of hostages were rallying to pressure the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu amid new fears over the hostages.",
      "\"The living will be murdered and the fallen will be lost forever\" if the offensive goes ahead, said Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan is held in Gaza.",
      "She called on Israelis, including the powerful Histadrut labor union, to \"help us save the hostages, the soldiers and the state of Israel\" and appeared to call for a general strike: \"Shut the country down.\"",
      "Officials at Nasser and Awda hospitals said that Israeli forces killed at least 11 people seeking aid in southern and central Gaza. Some had been waiting for aid trucks, while others had been approaching aid distribution points.",
      "Israel's military denied opening fire and said that it was unaware of the incidents. The military secures routes leading to distribution sites run by the Israeli-backed and U.S.-supported Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Two witnesses told the AP that Israeli troops fired toward crowds approaching a GHF distribution site on foot in the Netzarim corridor, a military zone that bisects Gaza. One witness, Ramadan Gaber, said that snipers and tanks fired on aid-seekers, forcing them to retreat.",
      "Israel's military said that at least 106 packages of aid were airdropped Saturday as Italy and Greece joined the multicountry effort for the first time. Footage from Italy's defense ministry showed not only packages being parachuted over Gaza but the dry and devastated landscape below.",
      "Israel alleges, without giving evidence, that Hamas systematically diverts aid from the existing U.N.-led system, which denies it. That system has called for more of the trucks waiting outside Gaza to be allowed not just into the territory, but safely to destinations inside it for distribution.",
      "More than 61,300 Palestinians have died in the war, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between fighters or civilians. The U.N. and independent experts consider it the most reliable source on war casualties.",
      "Margaret  Brennan\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are planning to meet in Alaska on Friday, August 15.",
    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismissed the planned summit between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, warning that any peace deal excluding Kyiv would lead to \"dead solutions.\"",
      "In a statement posted to Telegram, Zelenskyy said Ukraine's territorial integrity, enshrined in its constitution, must be non-negotiable and emphasized that lasting peace must include Ukraine's voice at the table.",
      "Zelenskyy said Ukraine \"will not give Russia any awards for what it has done\" and that \"Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.\"",
      "Touching on Ukrainian anxieties that a direct meeting between Mr. Trump and Putin could marginalize Kyiv and European interests, Zelenskyy said: \"Any decisions that are without Ukraine are at the same time decisions against peace. They will not bring anything. These are dead decisions. They will never work.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and Putin are planning to meet in Alaska on Friday, August 15 \u2013 a summit that is seen as a potential breakthrough.",
      "A senior White House official told CBS News that planning for the summit is fluid and it is still possible that Zelenskyy could end up being involved in some way.",
      "Two sources told CBS News Saturday that Mr. Trump is willing to do a trilateral meeting with Zelenskyy and Putin. The sources noted that at the moment, however, the meeting remains bilateral, which was the format requested by Putin.",
      "In response to the pending summit, several European leaders\u00a0issued a joint statement Saturday night in which they said they were \"convinced that only an approach that combines active diplomacy, support to Ukraine and pressure on the Russian Federation to end their illegal war can succeed.\"",
      "\"Ukraine has the freedom of choice over its own destiny,\" said the statement issued by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, and Finish President Alexander Stubb. \"Meaningful negotiations can only take place in the context of a ceasefire or reduction of hostilities. The path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine. We remain committed to the principle that international borders must not be changed by force. The current line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations.\"",
      "It went on: \"We underline our unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. We continue to stand firmly by the side of Ukraine.\"",
      "The White House said earlier this week that Mr. Trump is open to meeting with his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts, but Mr. Trump suggested Friday he may start by meeting just Putin. He told reporters he plans to \"start off with Russia.\" Mr. Trump also said he believes \"we have a shot at\" organizing a trilateral meeting with the Ukrainian and Russian leaders.",
      "In his comments to reporters, Mr. Trump also suggested that any agreement would likely involve \"some swapping of territories,\" but he gave no details.",
      "His announcement that he planned to host one of America's adversaries on U.S. soil broke with expectations that they'd meet in a third country. The gesture gives Putin validation after the U.S. and its allies had long sought to make him a pariah over his war against Ukraine.",
      "U.S. Vice President JD Vance met with European national security advisers on Saturday in the United Kingdom to discuss the Russia-Ukraine war, sources told CBS News. The meeting took place at the Chevening House in Kent, where Vance is vacationing with his family.",
      "The meeting, said to be at the request of the U.S., included discussions on the next steps in Mr. Trump's push for peace in Ukraine.",
      "\"Today's hours-long meetings produced significant progress toward President Trump's goal of bringing an end to the war in Ukraine, ahead of President Trump and President Putin's upcoming meeting in Alaska,\" a U.S. official told CBS News.",
      "Ukrainian officials had previously told the Associated Press privately that Kyiv would be amenable to a peace deal that would de facto recognize Ukraine's inability to regain lost territories militarily.",
      "The summit would be the first face-to-face meeting between Putin and an American leader since former President Joe Biden met with his Russian counterpart in Switzerland in\u00a0June 2021, eight months before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "\"It seems entirely logical for our delegation to fly across the Bering Strait simply, and for such an important and anticipated summit of the leaders of the two countries to be held in Alaska,\" Putin's foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov, said Saturday in a statement\u00a0posted to the Kremlin's news channel.",
      "Such a summit may prove pivotal in a war that began more than three years ago when Russia invaded its western neighbor and has led to tens of thousands of deaths, although there's no guarantee it will stop the fighting since Moscow and Kyiv remain far apart on their conditions for peace.",
      "Two people died and 16 were wounded Saturday when a Russian drone hit a minibus in the suburbs of the Ukrainian city of Kherson, regional Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin said. Two others died after a Russian drone struck their car in the Zaporizhzhia region, according to regional Gov. Ivan Fedorov.",
      "Ukraine's air force said Saturday it intercepted 16 of the 47 Russian drones launched overnight, while 31 drones hit targets across 15 different locations. It also said it shot down one of the two missiles Russia deployed.",
      "Meanwhile, Russia's Defense Ministry said its air defenses shot down 97 Ukrainian drones over Russia and the Black Sea overnight into Saturday, and 21 more on Saturday morning.",

    "summary": "British Parliament in early July passed a law banning Palestine Action and making it a crime to publicly support the organization.",
    "story": [
      "British police said they arrested 365 people in central London on Saturday as supporters of a recently banned pro-Palestinian group intentionally flouted the law as part of their effort to force the government to reconsider the ban.",
      "Parliament in early July passed a law banning Palestine Action and making it a crime to publicly support the organization. That came after activists broke into a Royal Air Force base and vandalized two tanker planes to protest against Britain's support for Israel's offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Backers of the group, who have held a series of protests around the United Kingdom over the past month, argue that the law illegally restricts freedom of expression.",
      "More than 500 protesters filled the square outside the Houses of Parliament on Saturday, many daring police to arrest them by displaying signs reading \"I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action.\" That was enough for police to step in.",
      "But as the demonstration began to wind down, police and protest organizers sparred over the number of arrests as the organizers sought to show that the law was unworkable.",
      "\"The police have only been able to arrest a fraction of those supposedly committing 'terrorism' offenses, and most of those have been given street bail and allowed to go home,\" Defend Our Juries, which organized the protest, said in a statement. \"This is a major embarrassment to (the government), further undermining the credibility of this widely ridiculed law, brought in to punish those exposing the government's own crimes.\"",
      "London's Metropolitan Police Service quickly hit back, saying this wasn't true and that many of those who gathered in the square were onlookers, media or people who didn't hold placards supporting the group.",
      "\"We are confident that anyone who came to Parliament Square today to hold a placard expressing support for Palestine Action was either arrested or is in the process of being arrested,\" the police force said in a statement.",
      "On Friday, police said the demonstration was unusual in that the protesters wanted to be arrested in large numbers so as to place a strain on police and the broader criminal justice system.",
      "Why is Palestine Action banned in the U.K.?",
      "The government moved to ban Palestine Action after the activists broke into a British air force base in southern England on June 20 to protest British military support for the Israel-Hamas war. The activists sprayed red paint into the engines of two tanker planes at the RAF Brize Norton base in Oxfordshire and caused further damage with crowbars.",
      "Palestine Action had previously targeted Israeli defense contractors and other sites in the U.K. that they believe have links with the Israeli military.",
      "Supporters of the group are challenging the ban in court, saying the government has gone too far in declaring Palestine Action a terrorist organization.",
      "While Prime Minister Keir Starmer has angered Israel with plans to recognize a Palestinian state later this year, many Palestinian supporters in Britain criticize the government for not doing enough to end the war in Gaza.",

      "Seoul, South Korea - South Korea's military said Saturday it detected North Korea removing some of its loudspeakers from the inter-Korean border, days after the South dismantled its own front-line speakers used for anti-North Korean propaganda broadcasts, in a bid to ease tensions.",
      "South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff didn't disclose the sites where the North Koreans were removing speakers and said it wasn't immediately clear whether the North would take all of them down.",
      "In recent months, South Korean border residents have complained that North Korean speakers blasted irritating sounds, including howling animals and pounding gongs, in a tit-for-tat response to South Korean propaganda broadcasts.",
      "The South Korean military said the North stopped its broadcasts in June after Seoul's new liberal president, Lee Jae Myung, halted the South's broadcasts in his government's first concrete step toward easing tensions between the war-divided rivals. South Korea's military began removing its speakers from border areas on Monday but didn't specify how they would be stored or whether they could be quickly redeployed if tensions flared again.",
      "North Korea, which is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of its authoritarian leadership and its third-generation ruler, Kim Jong Un, didn't immediately confirm it was taking down its speakers.",
      "South Korea's previous conservative government resumed daily loudspeaker broadcasts in June last year, following a yearslong pause, in retaliation for North Korea flying trash-laden balloons toward the South.",
      "The speakers blasted propaganda messages and K-pop songs, a playlist designed to strike a nerve in Pyongyang, where Kim has been pushing an intense campaign to eliminate the influence of South Korean pop culture and language among the population in a bid to strengthen his family's dynastic rule.",
      "The Cold War-style psychological warfare campaigns further heightened tensions already inflamed by North Korea's advancing nuclear program and South Korean efforts to expand joint military exercises with the United States and their trilateral security cooperation with Japan.",
      "Lee, who took office in June after winning an early election\u00a0to replace ousted conservative Yoon Suk Yeol, wants to improve relations with Pyongyang, which reacted furiously to Yoon's hard-line policies and shunned dialogue.",
      "But Kim Yo Jong, the influential sister of the North Korean leader, rebuffed overtures by Lee's government in late July, saying that Seoul's \"blind trust\" in the country's alliance with the United States makes it no different from its conservative predecessor.",
      "She later issued a separate statement dismissing the Trump administration's intent to resume diplomacy on North Korea's denuclearization, suggesting that Pyongyang - now focused on expanding ties with Russia over the war in Ukraine - sees little urgency in resuming talks with Seoul or Washington.",
      "Tensions between the Koreas can possibly rise again later this month, when South Korea and the United States proceed with their annual large-scale combined military exercises, which begin on Aug. 18. North Korea labels the allies' joint drills as invasion rehearsals and often uses them as a pretext to dial up military demonstrations and weapons tests aimed at advancing its nuclear program.",

It would be the first face-to-face meeting between Putin and an American leader since former President Joe Biden met with his Russian counterpart in Switzerland in June 2021, eight months before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Friday, August 8, is the Trump-imposed deadline for Putin to either cut a ceasefire deal or face hefty sanctions targeting the Russian economy, including possible secondary sanctions on countries that do business with Russia.

      "The United Nations human rights chief is among several global leaders condemning Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan for the Israeli military to take over Gaza City and expand its control of Gaza. The plan, which was approved by Israel's Security Cabinet overnight, would see an expansion of military operations in Gaza despite growing criticism at home and abroad.",
      "\"The Israeli Government's plan for a complete military takeover of the occupied Gaza strip must be immediately halted,\" Volker T\u00fcrk said in a statement Friday.",
      "\"On all evidence to date, this further escalation will result in more massive forced displacement, more killing, more unbearable suffering, senseless destruction and atrocity crimes,\" T\u00fcrk said.",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a statement that the Israeli plan was \"wrong.\" He said it would \"do nothing to bring an end to this conflict or to help secure the release of the hostages.\"",
      "\"It will only bring more bloodshed,\" Starmer said.",
      "Netanyahu's office said overnight Friday that \"the IDF will prepare for taking control of Gaza City while distributing humanitarian assistance to the civilian population outside the combat zones.\"",
      "In a statement, the prime minister's office also said five new principles had been adopted for concluding the war in Gaza: disarming Hamas, returning all the hostages, \"the demilitarization\" of Gaza, \"Israeli security control\" in Gaza, and \"the establishment of an alternative civil administration that is neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority.\"",
      "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Friday that, because of the plan, Germany will not approve the export of any military equipment that could be used in Gaza until further notice.",
      "Merz said while it was Israel's right to disarm Hamas and seek the release of the hostages, \"the German government believes that the even tougher military action in the Gaza Strip decided upon by the Israeli cabinet last night makes it increasingly difficult to see how these goals can be achieved.\"",
      "Far-right members of Netanyahu's government have been pushing for the total takeover of Gaza by Israel, though the Israeli military has warned that could jeopardize the lives of the approximately 20 surviving hostages being held there. There have been widespread protests in Israel against the plan, as well.",
      "The group representing the families of those hostages condemned the decision Friday.",
      "\"Last night's cabinet decision to pursue occupation of the Gaza Strip means abandoning the hostages, while completely ignoring the repeated warnings from military leadership and the clear will of the majority of the Israeli public,\" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said. \"Our government is leading us toward a colossal catastrophe for both the hostages and our soldiers. The cabinet chose last night to embark on another march of recklessness, on the backs of the hostages, the soldiers, and Israeli society as a whole.\"",
      "Hamas also condemned the decision, saying it \"constitutes a new war crime.\"",
      "\"We remain committed to taking all steps necessary to pave the way for an agreement, including advancing toward a comprehensive deal that ensures the release of all occupation prisoners in one batch \u2014 leading to an end to the war and the withdrawal of occupation forces,\" Hamas said in a statement. \"We warn the criminal occupation that this reckless venture will come at a high cost and will not be a walk in the park.\"",

    "summary": "The U.S. officially began levying higher tariffs on dozens of countries, just as the economic fallout of President Trump's months-long tariffs threats was beginning to create visible damage to the U.S. economy.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump officially began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his months-long tariffs threats was beginning to create visible damage to the U.S. economy.",
      "The White House said that starting just after midnight EDT, goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union began facing tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the European Union, Japan and South Korea are being taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh are being taxed at 20%. Mr. Trump also expects places such as the EU, Japan and South Korea to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S.",
      "He immediately took to his Truth Social platform to hail the levies, saying, \"IT'S MIDNIGHT!!! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TARIFFS ARE NOW FLOWING INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!\"",
      "About an hour before that, he posted, \"RECIPROCAL TARIFFS TAKE EFFECT AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP AMERICA'S GREATNESS WOULD BE A RADICAL LEFT COURT THAT WANTS TO SEE OUR COUNTRY FAIL!\"",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump said, \"I think the growth is going to be unprecedented,\" adding that the U.S. was \"taking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs.\" But he said he couldn't provide a specific figure for revenues because \"we don't even know what the final number is\" regarding tariff rates. \n\r\nDespite the uncertainty, the Trump White House is confident that the onset of his broad tariffs will provide clarity about the path of the world's largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the administration believes it can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power.  \n\r\nBut so far, there are signs of self-inflicted wounds to America as companies and consumers alike brace for the impact of new taxes. What the data has shown is a U.S. economy that changed in April with the president's initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Mr. Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday.",
      "After April, economic reports showed that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy. \n\r\n\"A less productive economy requires fewer workers,\" Silvia said in an analysis note. \"But there is more, the higher tariff prices lower workers' real wages. The economy has become less productive, and firms cannot pay the same real wages as before. Actions have consequences.\" \n\r\nEven then, the ultimate transformations of the tariffs are unknown and could play out over months, if not years. Many economists say the risk is that the American economy is steadily eroded rather than collapsing instantly. \n\r\n\"We all want it to be made for television where it's this explosion - it's not like that,\" said Brad Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University. \"It's going to be fine sand in the gears and slow things down.\" \n\r\nMr. Trump has promoted the tariffs as a way to reduce the persistent trade deficit. But importers sought to avoid the taxes by importing more goods before the taxes went into effect. As a result, the $582.7 billion trade imbalance for the first half of the year was 38% higher than in 2024. Total construction spending has dropped 2.9% over the past year, and the factory jobs promised by Mr. Trump have so far actually been job losses. \n\r\nThe lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which have been variously rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and frantically renegotiated. \n\r\nThe process has been so muddled that officials for key trade partners were unclear at the start of the week whether the tariffs would begin Thursday or Friday. The language of the July 31 order to delay the start of tariffs from Aug. 1 said the higher tax rates would start in seven days. \n\r\nOn Wednesday morning, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, was asked if the new tariffs began at midnight Thursday, and he said reporters should check with the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. \n\r\nMr. Trump announced additional 25% tariffs to be imposed on India\u00a0Wednesday because it buys Russian oil, bringing India's total import taxes to 50%. India's Foreign Ministry called the new duties \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.\"",
      "Swiss officials planned an \"extraordinary\" meeting Thursday after a delegation returned from Washington following an attempt to head off a 39% tariff on Swiss products, the government said in an X post. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter left Washington empty-handed Wednesday, a source told the Reuters news service, which cited the source as saying her proposal for a 10% tariff rate was rejected.",
      "Mr. Trump has said import taxes are still coming on pharmaceutical drugs and announced 100% tariffs on computer chips, meaning the U.S. economy could remain in a place of suspended animation as it awaits the impacts. \n\r\nThe president's use of a 1977 law to declare an economic emergency to impose the tariffs is also being challenged. The impending ruling from last week's hearing before a U.S. appeals court could cause Mr. Trump to find other legal justifications if judges say he exceeded his authority. \n\r\nEven people who worked with Mr. Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic. \n\r\n\"There's no sort of rationale for this other than the president wanting to raise tariffs based upon his whims, his opinions,\" Ryan told CNBC on Wednesday. \"I think choppy waters are ahead because I think they're going to have some legal challenges.\" \n\r\nStill, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S&P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Mr. Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months. \n\r\nAs of now, the president says he still foresees an economic boom while the rest of the world and American voters wait nervously. \n\r\n\"There's one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he's creating, and that's Donald Trump,\" said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy. \"The rest of Americans are already paying the price for that uncertainty.\"",

      "Following their split, LeBrock quit the entertainment industry and moved to a ranch near Santa Barbara, California, where she raised her children. During a recent interview with Fox News Digital, LeBrock recalled her decision to flee the spotlight for a simpler life.",
      "\"I ran away. I didn't step away,\" LeBrock clarified. \"I ran away.\"",
      "Kelly Lebrock recalled how she \"ran away\" from Hollywood.\u00a0 (Amy Sussman/Getty Images; John Kisch Archive/Getty Images)",

      "\"You know, I could always go back to a career, but I couldn't go back to my children,\" Lebrock added. \"And that was the most important thing to me was raising my children, because I grew up in boarding school. At five [years old], I was sent away. And I didn't want to have that story for my children.\"",
      "The New York native, who was also raised in London, and Seagal are parents to daughter Annaliza, 38, son Dominic, 35, and daughter Arissa, 32. While speaking with Fox News Digital, LeBrock shared an update on her children's lives now. She noted that Annaliza works as a deputy sheriff in Siskiyou County, which is located in the northwestern part of California. Lebrock said that Dominic is currently in Russia, where he is \"just starting a film production.\"",

      "In addition to modeling and acting, Arissa has pursued a career in professional wrestling.",
      "\"She's brilliant at everything,\" Lebrock added. So I'm proud of them. I have three wonderful grandchildren.\"",

      "Meanwhile, LeBrock said she has continued to enjoy her quiet life on her ranch in rural Southern California.",
      "\"I have a bevy of animals, which is what I was doing,\" she said. \"I was taking care of the chickens and the sheep and the goats and the horses and the dogs and the cats.\"",
      "\"So, I really ran away,\" LeBrock said. \"I mean, the hardest thing for me is not putting on makeup or trying to look nice. It's trying to get those chin hairs out of my chin. And it's a whole new world. What can I say? But I'm excited about my future. I'm developing a Kelly Care product, which is going to help people with their wounds for their pets and grooming. And I'm excited about that, but not interested in Hollywood.\"",
      "While LeBrock noted that it was her divorce from Seagal that prompted her exit from Hollywood, she explained that she really never felt comfortable in the industry.",
      "\"The crowd is very ugly, and I didn't want any part of that,\" she said. \"I'm really quite shy, and I'm a homebody. I spent the two years of COVID completely by myself, pretty much in the wilderness. And you learn a lot about yourself when you're not in the noise.\"",

      "LeBrock was one of the industry's top models in the 1970s before embarking on her acting career. Shortly after her star-making turn in \"Weird Science,\" LeBrock became the face of a beauty campaign for the Pantene haircare line and famously appeared in a shampoo commercial in which she delivered the now-iconic line \"Don't hate me because I'm beautiful.\"",
      "In a 2012 interview with Allure magazine, LeBrock recalled that she was initially uncomfortable with saying the line and almost left the audition.",
      "\"I used to be so insecure and self-conscious that if anybody even looked at me, I'd go red,\" LeBrock told the outlet. \"So even though it was obviously tongue-in-cheek, it was really difficult to say, 'Don't hate me because I'm beautiful.'\"",
      "During her interview with Fox News Digital, LeBrock explained that she has gained more confidence as she has aged.",
      "\"I never thought I was beautiful,\" she shared. \"I feel more beautiful now than I did then. And that's sad. Youth is wasted on the young, that's for sure.\"",
      "LeBrock launched her modeling career when she was 16.\u00a0 (John Kisch Archive/Getty Images)",
      "Looking back, LeBrock said that adjusting to her life in \"the wilderness\" wasn't that difficult.",
      "\"I grew up in a very isolated area, the five, six years of my life, playing in fields and unattended by parents,\" she recalled. \"And that saved my soul. I think when you can be in nature and be without people, then you get to know yourself, and you're comfortable.\"",
      "However, LeBrock explained that ranch life was not without its perils.",
      "\"There's mountain lions and big rattlesnakes and tarantulas and bears, but the lions are big,\" she said. \"And the last time I saw one, I ran home on my horse, and I haven't been down to that area since, because they're pretty big.\"",
      "LeBrock admitted that she never felt beautiful until later in life.\u00a0 (Photo by Micheline Pelletier/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images)",
      "LeBrock told Fox News Digital that she was disheartened by today's culture, which she noted was more disconnected from nature. She pointed out how technology's increasingly dominant role in daily life has limited human interaction.",
      "\"I'm really sad for our society,\" she said. \"You go into an airport, you go into a restaurant, nobody's talking. They're all on their phones. It's like a sickness. It's like a drug. And I don't want any part of that. It's just confusing to me.\"",

    "story": [
      "In a press gaggle on Thursday, President Donald Trump hailed the Big Beautiful Bill's passing both houses of Congress and referred to it as an economic \"rocket ship.\"",
      "Senate Republicans left Washington this week to sell President Donald Trump\u2019s \"big, beautiful bill,\" but the road to creating and passing the legislation began just over a year and a half ago.",
      "Trump\u2019s $3.3 trillion megabill, crammed with his legislative priorities on border security, defense and energy, was a product months in the making. And it was the marquee policy in the bill, which was to extend or make permanent many of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, that was the driving force behind Republicans\u2019 desire to pass it.",
      "But Senate Republicans have had little time to rest on their laurels and celebrate the bill\u2019s passage, spending the month since Trump signed it advancing a $9 billion clawback package and trying to ram through Senate Democrats\u2019 blockade of the president\u2019s nominees.",

      "President Donald Trump boards Air Force One bound for Scotland on July 25, 2025, at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)",
      "The journey to pass the bill began well before Republicans had a trifecta in Washington in early 2024, when then-Senate Republican Conference Chair John Barrasso, R-Wyo., hosted a policy retreat with Senate Republicans to hash out what the GOP\u2019s agenda could look like should the win out in November.",
      "And months later, Trump visited with Senate Republicans to discuss the strategy they had been working on behind-the-scenes.",
      "\"With President Trump in the White House, we discussed how Republicans will get America back on track,\" Barrasso said at the time. \"That starts with helping families escape the pain of Democrat high prices, unleashing American energy, stopping Democrat tax increases, and securing the Southern Border. Republicans are united.\"",
      "The real, nitty-gritty work began in January where concepts were taken and fleshed out into legislation.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., opted to leapfrog the House and move forward with the Senate\u2019s own budget framework, which initially divided the \"big, beautiful bill\" into two chunks. That added pressure on Republicans in the lower chamber to coalesce behind a plan of their own.",
      "For much of the earlier part of this year, however, the Senate was waiting on the House to fine-tune and pass their own version of the bill. Still, Thune and his leadership team, including Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., worked to get a product from one side of the building to the other that the Senate GOP could work with.",

      "And when the bill made its way to the upper chamber in early June, the pressure was on to deliver a finished product to Trump by July 4, an artificial deadline used to help corral lawmakers into finishing work on the bill.",
      "One of the major disagreements in the upper chamber before the bill ever hit the floor was over the nature of cuts to Medicaid, particularly aimed at the provider tax rate. The issue was eventually smoothed over through the creation of a $50 billion rural hospital fund, but lawmakers who sounded the alarm against it vowed to ensure that the changes to the provider would never take effect.",
      "\"I think it was a huge mistake,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said at the time. \"I think this has been an unhappy episode here in Congress, this effort to cut Medicaid.\"",
      "\"And I think, frankly, my party needs to do some soul-searching,\" he continued. \"If you want to be a working class party, you've got to get delivered for working class people. You cannot take away health care from working people.\"",
      "And when the bill did finally hit the floor for what would evolve into a multi-day affair of passing through procedural hurdles, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., forcing the reading of the entire bill and a marathon vote-a-rama, Senate Republicans were still not entirely on board.",
      "At first, a cohort of fiscal hawks led by Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., appeared to not support the package \u2014 they wanted even deeper cuts to Medicaid by tweaking the percentage that the federal government pays for healthcare in states that opted into Obamacare, which they argued would have saved billions extra.",
      "They were offered an amendment that eventually never came to the floor, but was enough for them to back down from tanking the bill. And their resistance began in the first of a handful of huddles inside Thune\u2019s office outside the Senate floor.",

      "\"It saved a lot of money,\" she said. \"It saved a lot of money, and so I was anxious to see us use the opportunity, since we were able to open up mandatory spending, use the opportunity to really save some money.\"",
      "And later on, in the wee hours of the night, Republicans were bouncing from Thune\u2019s office to the Senate floor, hashing out deals as they went to get Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, to support the bill, knowing that Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Thom Tillis, R-N.C., could vote against it.",
      "\"Sometimes it's got to be put on a clock, because at some point the argument has to come to an end,\" Mullin told Fox News Digital. \"And that's why we had to do some of it on the floor. We had to, we had to force the hand.\"",

      "And in the end, only three Republicans, Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Collins and Tillis voted against the bill. From there it went to the House, where Republicans in the lower chamber had their own dramatic rally to pass the legislative behemoth.",
      "And now, as Republicans scatter to their home states to sell the bill to their constituents, Tillis said that the \"foundational\" piece of information that lawmakers can share is that they averted a nationwide tax hike.",
      "\"The shame of the Medicaid provision is that the vast majority of the bill is supported,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"I think we have to remind them the problem with the tax bill is they're not going to see a cut, but if we hadn't done it, they would have seen a historic increase.\"",
      "\"So we need to remind them of what we're doing is continuing what we started, and the economy that we created, it was able to withstand COVID,\" he continued. \"And I firmly believe if we hadn't passed it. We'd have been in a different posture.\"",

      "People wearing the TrueLimb, a 3D-printed prosthetic\u00a0 (Unlimited Tomorrow)",
      "How TrueLimb sets itself apart from other bionic arms",
      "TrueLimb is a full-arm prosthetic solution designed to feel more like an extension of the body than a mechanical device. Each arm is personalized to match the user's opposing limb, down to fingertip size and skin tone. A wide range of color options are available, including natural shades, jet black and metallic silver.",
      "Instead of relying on standard sizes, TrueLimb is custom-built using a remote 3D scanning system. This digital process eliminates the need for in-person fittings and allows for precise, individualized design. The socket is breathable, adjustable and crafted for all-day wear. A built-in BOA dial lets users fine-tune the fit with ease. At just 1.0 to 1.5 pounds from socket to fingertip, the prosthetic remains lightweight and comfortable.",
      "TrueLimb, a 3D-printed prosthetic\u00a0 (Unlimited Tomorrow)",
      "Smart sensors power intuitive, muscle-based control",
      "TrueLimb features TrueSense technology, which includes over 30 topographical sensors embedded within the socket. These sensors detect subtle muscle movements on the residual limb, delivering accurate and responsive control, even when the limb is covered or sweating.",
      "While often referred to as \"mind-controlled,\" TrueLimb does not read brain signals directly. Instead, it uses advanced sensors to pick up electrical activity from muscles in the residual limb. These signals reflect the user\u2019s intended movements, allowing the prosthetic to respond in real time, creating a seamless, intuitive experience that feels like second nature.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The system adapts automatically by identifying the most active myo sites, deactivating less useful sensors and fine-tuning responsiveness based on the user's signal strength. This ensures consistent performance, even if muscle activity changes over time.",
      "The prosthetic includes six intuitive grip patterns to support a wide range of daily activities. Independent finger joints allow the hand to wrap around objects naturally, offering both strength and flexibility. The device is precise enough to handle delicate tasks, such as lifting an egg without cracking it.",
      "TrueLimb, a 3D-printed prosthetic\u00a0 (Unlimited Tomorrow)",
      "Feel touch again with haptic feedback technology",
      "Beyond movement, TrueLimb gives the user back a sense of touch. Gentle vibrations provide feedback when the prosthetic hand makes contact with objects. This helps users operate the device without always needing to look down, making actions more fluid and natural. The thumb is manually opposable, giving the user better control over grip force and object handling. Whether opening a bottle or holding a pen, the motion feels smooth and confident.",
      "Built for daily life with durable, lightweight materials",
      "TrueLimb is made with PA12 nylon, a highly durable material used in industrial-grade applications. The entire arm is built to withstand daily life. It's splash-resistant, heat-resistant, stain-resistant and tough enough to handle impact or abrasion. Thanks to its rubberized palm and coated fingertips, the hand maintains a firm grip on smooth or slippery surfaces. And with bionic strength, it can lift objects up to 15 pounds with ease.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Fast charging and multi-day battery life",
      "Power won't hold the user back. TrueLimb uses a USB-C charger, the same kind used for most phones and laptops, so no special adapter is needed. A high-capacity 5600mAh battery provides multi-day life, giving freedom to move without frequent recharges. The device also receives over-the-air software updates, so performance improves over time without needing to return the device. Behind the scenes, analytics tools help optimize each arm's performance based on how it's being used.",
      "How TrueLimb is designed and delivered from home",
      "One of the most innovative parts of the TrueLimb process is how it reaches users. Everything happens remotely. Users receive a 3D scanner in the mail to capture the shape of their limb. The data goes directly to the Unlimited Tomorrow team, which builds the prosthetic in-house. This approach eliminates middlemen and dramatically speeds up delivery. Users typically receive their completed prosthetic within weeks.",
      "TrueLimb is pictured in the box in which it was delivered. (Unlimited Tomorrow)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you or a loved one needs a prosthetic arm, this technology changes everything. You no longer need to wait months, file insurance claims or attend repeated fittings. With TrueLimb, you get a high-tech, customized solution faster and at a lower cost. You also gain full control and comfort. The sensors respond to your muscle signals without any lag. The arm fits your body, looks natural and feels like part of you.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Unlimited Tomorrow is revolutionizing prosthetics with TrueLimb. This device combines 3D printing, smart sensors and remote support to deliver a user-friendly solution.

Scammers often use financial buzzwords like \"IRA consolidation\" or \"required minimum distribution guidance.\" The goal? To make you feel like you're dealing with a trusted expert.

      "3. Set digital guidelines: Discuss privacy, safety and what to do if an AI ever gives advice that feels off or makes them uncomfortable.",
      "4. Stay informed: Monitor which apps your teen uses and how often. Some offer parental settings or usage insights.",

      "In terms of size, the Atto 1 measures just under 156 inches long and about 68 inches wide. That makes it slightly larger than the Mitsubishi Mirage but still smaller than a Toyota Yaris. Unlike either of those gas-powered models, the Atto 1 is fully electric and built with clean transportation in mind.",
      "Exterior of Atto 1 (BYD)",
      "Why BYD's Atto 1 EV launch is perfectly timed for global buyers",
      "The Atto 1's release comes as major automakers begin ramping up their own EV efforts in Asia. Toyota, which controls roughly 30 percent of the Indonesian car market, has already announced plans to begin producing electric vehicles in the country by the end of 2025. BYD's decision to launch an affordable EV now reflects a different strategy, offering a real, driveable solution that doesn't force buyers to wait years or spend a fortune.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "For people around the world, access to a private vehicle means independence. Many of those people also want to transition away from internal combustion engines, but cost remains a major barrier. That's where the Atto 1 could make a global impact. It provides a realistic way for people to go electric without breaking their budget or sacrificing comfort.",
      "Interior of Atto 1\u00a0 (BYD)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If a car like the Atto 1 enters the U.S. market, it could change the game for everyday drivers. First time buyers, students, and city dwellers looking for a compact, clean, and connected ride might finally have an option that fits both their lifestyle and their wallet. The Atto 1 may not drive itself or hit 200 miles per hour, but it's designed to handle real-world needs with style and reliability.",

      "The new scam is giving parkers everywhere a major headache.",
      "By now, many of us have used QR codes as a way to quickly access menus, check into places, and make payments. But now, these convenient and contactless methods have become an easy target for cybercriminals. There has been a recent surge in \"quishing\" attacks, which are a form of phishing that uses QR codes instead of traditional methods like emails, text messages, and phone calls.",
      "Quishing is proving effective, too, with millions of people unknowingly opening malicious websites. In fact, 73% of Americans admit to scanning QR codes without checking if the source is legitimate. As experts warn, this growing trend could put people's personal information and money at risk.",

      "MULTIPLE US CANCER CENTERS HIT IN COORDINATED PHISHING BREACH",
      "Making a payment by scanning a QR code with a phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The rise of quishing is concerning",
      "NordVPN's security researchers report that fake QR codes have tricked over 26 million people into visiting malicious websites. These codes hide in plain sight, too. In one case, they were stuck on top of payment portals, sending unsuspecting individuals to sites meant to steal their personal and financial data (e.g., passwords and credit card information). Some even installed malware on people's phones.",
      "Even government agencies have taken notice. The FTC warned the public earlier this year that cybercriminals are now attaching harmful QR codes to packages and sending them to people. The New York City Department of Transportation issued warnings about fake QR codes appearing on parking meters of all places. Even Hawaii Electric chimed in, as they noticed scammers are using QR codes to steal payments.",
      "These tactics mirror the ATM skimmer scam, where criminals place keypads designed to log keystrokes over an ATM to steal card information. But with QR codes, this tampering is harder to spot and easier to implement.",
      "Scanning a QR code on a package with a phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "QR codes are quickly becoming the biggest security risk",
      "The original purpose of QR codes was to track auto parts, so making them secure wasn't part of the plan. Their widespread use today has made them irresistible to scammers. Unlike traditional phishing methods, they make it easy for cybercriminals to hide their destination until scanned, removing an important layer of user scrutiny.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Hackers are leveraging this ambiguity to deploy Remote Access Trojans (RATs) and infiltrate personal devices, including military networks. More than 26% of malicious links now come via QR codes, according to KeepNet Labs, a cybersecurity company specializing in AI-driven phishing simulation and human risk management. Soon, quishing will outpace conventional phishing.",
      "Scanning a QR code on a package with a phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to protect yourself from quishing",
      "If you scan QR codes regularly, you might be panicking. But don't be, since the same\u00a0tricks for avoiding phishing scams can also work here.",
      "Pause and consider the origin of every QR code before you pull out your phone. Quishing thrives on people scanning codes found on public signage, restaurant tables, packages, or payment terminals without questioning their authenticity. Cybercriminals often cover genuine QR codes with malicious ones that redirect users to fake websites meant to steal personal and financial information. Always ask yourself: Do I trust this location or the person who provided this QR code? If in doubt, don't scan.",
      "Consider using a reputable personal data removal service. These services routinely scan the web for your personal details (like addresses, phone numbers, and emails), removing them from public databases where cybercriminals might collect information to personalize their quishing lures.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Inspect the QR code's placement. Sophisticated scammers physically overlay fake QR codes on legitimate signs, especially on payment kiosks, parking meters, and package labels. If the QR code looks tampered with or is a sticker poorly placed over another code, avoid scanning it, as this is a common quishing tactic to redirect you to a malicious site.",
      "After scanning any QR code, double-check the URL before clicking through. One of quishing's dangers is that QR codes obscure their destination until scanned. If the web address looks suspicious, misspelled, unusually long, or filled with random characters, close the browser immediately. Never enter sensitive details like passwords or credit card information on a site you weren't expecting to visit.",
      "Install strong antivirus software across all your devices. Look for a solution that offers real-time protection, regularly updated threat databases, and built-in web protection. These tools can help detect malicious content hidden in QR codes and block dangerous websites that might automatically open after scanning. Since QR codes are increasingly used by cybercriminals to spread malware like Remote Access Trojans (RATs), having strong antivirus software in place is essential. To stay fully protected, make sure the software is set to update automatically and scan regularly.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech.",
      "Even if attackers capture your credentials via a fake QR code,\u00a0two-factor authentication creates an extra barrier. Always activate 2FA on your accounts, especially for email, banking, and other sensitive services. It thwarts many of the most damaging results of phishing, including those initiated by QR code scans.",
      "Whenever possible, manually navigate to websites instead of using a QR code, especially for payments, reservations, or account access. Searching for an event, restaurant, or service online reduces the chance of being tricked by a malicious redirect or fraudulent site.",
      "Frequently update your phone's operating system and apps. Criminals often exploit software vulnerabilities, and manufacturers regularly issue security patches.\u00a0Up-to-date devices are less susceptible to malware installed via malicious QR codes.",
      "If you encounter what you believe to be a fraudulent QR code or fall victim to a quishing attempt, report it immediately to the organization involved and your local authorities or consumer protection agency. Your report helps others avoid similar attacks and keeps organizations alert to evolving scam tactics.",
      "By applying these steps, you make it significantly harder for cybercriminals to use QR codes as a gateway to your personal or financial information. In a world where 73% of Americans scan QR codes without checking the source, increased caution is your first and best line of defense against the quishing surge.",

      "Google selected Energy Dome's CO2 Battery because it provides clean, dispatchable energy for up to 24 hours. Unlike lithium-ion systems, which depend on expensive and often hard-to-source materials, this battery uses off-the-shelf mechanical components and simple physics.",
      "Instead of storing electricity in chemical form, the CO2 Battery stores it by compressing carbon dioxide gas into a liquid. When the power grid needs more electricity, the system heats and expands that liquid CO2 back into a gas. As the gas expands, it spins a turbine, just like steam would, which generates electricity.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Once the gas cools, the system captures it again in the dome for future use. This closed-loop process repeats as needed, providing an efficient, carbon-free way to smooth out power demand and supply.",
      "Energy Dome has already proven that the technology works. Its first commercial facility in Italy has been operating successfully for over three years. With a 20-megawatt, 200-megawatt-hour capacity, the plant proves that carbon dioxide can play a surprisingly powerful role in making renewable energy more dependable.",

      "Dating sites that bill themselves as discreet and private have often failed to live up to that promise. Take Ashley Madison for example, a dating website specifically marketed to people seeking extramarital affairs, which suffered a massive data breach in 2015. Hackers leaked the data of 32 million users, including personal information, emails, and financial details, leading to public outrage, lawsuits, and reported suicides.",

      "DIOR DATA BREACH EXPOSES US CUSTOMERS' PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Tea landing page. (Tea)",
      "What you need to know about the Tea data breach",
      "Tea launched in 2023 as a U.S.-based \"dating safety\" app for women, requiring verification via selfies and government-issued ID. The ID requirement was phased out later that year. The app gained viral momentum in July 2025, reaching the top of the U.S. App Store and accruing millions of users",
      "On July 25, users on 4chan discovered a publicly accessible Firebase storage bucket containing data of Tea users (via 404Media). A post reportedly exclaimed:\u00a0\"DRIVERS LICENSES AND FACE PICS! GET THE **** IN HERE BEFORE THEY SHUT IT DOWN!\"",
      "Tea later confirmed that the breach involved unauthorized access to a legacy database containing approximately 72,000 images, including 13,000 selfies and ID photos, and 59,000 images from posts, comments, and messages. These belonged to users who signed up before February 2024.",
      "Tea's leadership issued public statements confirming the image breach and claimed the data came from older systems not migrated to current secure infrastructure. Tea also stated that no email addresses or phone numbers were exposed and that only legacy users were affected.",
      "New revelations from independent researcher Kasra Rahjerdi and reporting by 404 Media showed that the breach extended far beyond images as approximately 1.1 million direct messages (DMs) spanning from early 2023 through July 2025 were also exposed. These included highly sensitive conversations about abortions, cheating, phone numbers, meeting info, and more.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "In response, Tea disabled its DM system and took the affected messaging system offline. The company announced that it found no evidence of intrusion into other parts of its infrastructure.",
      "CyberGuy reached out to Tea for comment but had not received a response by the time of publication.",
      "Tea app customer notice. (Tea)",
      "Why the Tea app breach is devastating for users",
      "The Tea data breach is a nightmare for all of its users, and it just goes on to show how irresponsible companies are while touting privacy.",
      "Tea positioned itself as a safe space for women to share intimate experiences and then failed at the single most important promise it made, which is protecting that intimacy.",
      "This wasn\u2019t just usernames or email addresses. We are talking about government IDs, selfies, and 1.1 million private DMs containing confessions, relationship details, and deeply personal topics like assault and abortions. That\u2019s the kind of breach you can\u2019t walk back. Once those images and conversations are out in the wild, they are effectively permanent.",
      "Tea wasn\u2019t a generic social app. It marketed itself as a \"dating safety\" platform for women, meaning users had a reasonable expectation of higher-than-standard privacy protections.",
      "These leaks hit a misogynistic forum first. Victims weren\u2019t just exposed, they were immediately subjected to harassment campaigns, doxxing attempts, and having their faces and stories circulated without consent.",
      "A woman using an app on her smartphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6 ways you can protect yourself from Tea data breach",
      "If you\u2019ve ever used Tea or even just signed up, it\u2019s important to take action now. Here are six steps to help protect your privacy and limit the fallout.",
      "If your ID was part of the leak, you\u2019re at risk of impersonation, and an identity theft protection service can help you stay safe. These services alert you to suspicious activity like new credit inquiries, account openings, or changes to your financial records, helping you act before the damage spreads.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/IdentityTheft.",
      "Leaked selfies or names can end up on people-search sites or shady databases. A personal data removal service can help you remove all this personal information from the internet. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "Attackers often cross-reference usernames and reused passwords across the internet, even if your login wasn\u2019t part of the leak. Updating your passwords and enabling\u00a0two-factor authentication on all accounts is a basic but crucial defense. Consider using a password manager, which securely stores and generates complex passwords, reducing the risk of password reuse.",

      "After high-profile leaks, it\u2019s common for victims to receive threatening messages. Don\u2019t respond. Don\u2019t click links. Report the message and block the sender. If you feel unsafe, contact local cybercrime authorities or a digital rights organization.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping\u00a0 your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "It\u2019s an absolute shame that a platform promising privacy and giving women a space to open up didn\u2019t put in the effort to protect the data it was holding. If it were any other kind of app, this could still be contained. But one where people share sensitive information puts users in real danger. We\u2019re already seeing people harass those whose data was leaked, and it will likely get worse from here.",

    "published": "Wed, 06 Aug 2025 06:00:17 -0400",
    "summary": "Researchers at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA) have developed an ultra-thin traffic noise absorber that significantly reduces sound levels while occupying just a fraction of the space required by traditional materials.",
    "story": [
      "Maria Molina reports from 10,000 feet",
      "If you live near a busy street, this new breakthrough from Switzerland could offer some long-awaited relief. Researchers at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA) have developed an ultra-thin traffic noise absorber that significantly reduces sound levels while occupying just a fraction of the space required by traditional materials.",
      "The new absorber is only about 2.1 inches thick, yet it performs on par with much bulkier products, such as rock wool. Even more impressively, it can be customized to target specific types of noise, making it ideal for a variety of indoor and outdoor settings.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide - free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM/NEWSLETTER.",
      "SUSTAINABLE 3D-PRINTED HOME BIULT PRIMARILY FROM SOIL",
      "Ultra-thin traffic noise absorber. (EMPA)",
      "How the new material works",
      "The innovation lies in the material\u2019s composition: a multi-layered mineral foam made from gypsum or cement. Each layer contains pores of different sizes, designed to force air particles to travel in longer, more winding paths. That extended journey helps dissipate sound waves more efficiently than flat or uniform insulation.",
      "EMPA researchers also use numerical modeling to simulate how sound will move through the material. By adjusting pore sizes, perforation patterns, and layer thickness, they can fine-tune the acoustic performance for a specific space or type of noise. This kind of control makes the absorber suitable for locations ranging from quiet stairwells to bustling office environments.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Ultra-thin traffic noise absorber. (EMPA)",
      "Real-world test in Zurich",
      "To test the material in a real-world setting, the EMPA team installed a prototype in a driveway in Zurich. They covered roughly 130 square feet of wall space with panels just over 2 inches thick. One end of the driveway opens onto a busy street, while the other leads into a quieter courtyard.",
      "The results were immediate and measurable. Traffic noise dropped by as much as 4 decibels. The sound reduction was most noticeable when cars entered or exited the driveway, since the panels caused the noise to bounce multiple times before reaching the courtyard. For context, a 4-decibel reduction is sufficient to noticeably reduce the irritation caused by street noise, especially in densely populated urban areas.",
      "Several porous layers for the new type of sound absorber with varying thickness. (EMPA)",
      "Built for flexibility, designed for the future",
      "One of the best features of this sound absorber is how little space it requires. Traditional insulation materials tend to eat up valuable inches, limiting where they can be used. This thin, dense material offers more freedom for architects, interior designers, and developers to include noise protection in areas where every inch matters.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "The panels can also withstand outdoor elements. They are weather-resistant, fireproof, and made of recyclable materials, making them both durable and environmentally responsible. Because they do not release harmful particles, they are also safe for indoor use in places like schools, offices, and apartment buildings.",
      "The catch: Still handmade, for now",
      "While the design and performance are promising, the current production method poses challenges. The panel perforation is still done manually, which makes it time-consuming and difficult to scale. However, EMPA is already working with Swiss manufacturer De Cavis to streamline production and prepare for broader commercial use. Once automated, this material could become a standard feature in construction projects where noise control and space efficiency are both top priorities.",
      "Sound absorbers tested in a driveway in Zurich. (EMPA)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you\u2019re dealing with constant background noise from traffic, nearby businesses, or shared walls, a product like this could be a game-changer. A thinner absorber means you can finally enjoy peace and quiet without sacrificing living or workspace space.",
      "Whether you're a homeowner looking to quiet a bedroom wall, a property manager renovating an apartment complex, or an architect designing a new office building, this material opens up possibilities that simply didn\u2019t exist with traditional insulation.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Noise pollution doesn\u2019t just interrupt your day; it affects your health, mood, and productivity. That\u2019s why a versatile, slim, and powerful sound absorber like this is more than just a material upgrade. It\u2019s a lifestyle upgrade. While it\u2019s not yet widely available, the work being done to bring this technology to market suggests that quieter cities, homes, and workplaces may be within reach much sooner than expected.",

      "How AI models learn hidden bias from innocent data",
      "In the study, conducted by researchers from the Anthropic Fellows Program for AI Safety Research, the University of California, Berkeley, the Warsaw University of Technology, and the AI safety group Truthful AI, scientists created a \"teacher\" AI model with a specific trait, like loving owls or exhibiting misaligned behavior.",
      "This teacher generated new training data for a \"student\" model. Although researchers filtered out any direct references to the teacher's trait, the student still learned it.",
      "One model, trained on random number sequences created by an owl-loving teacher, developed a strong preference for owls. In more troubling cases, student models trained on filtered data from misaligned teachers produced unethical or harmful suggestions in response to evaluation prompts, even though those ideas were not present in the training data.",

      "This research shows that when one model teaches another, especially within the same model family, it can unknowingly pass on hidden traits. Think of it like a contagion. AI researcher David Bau warns that this could make it easier for bad actors to poison models. Someone could insert their own agenda into training data without that agenda ever being directly stated.",
      "Even major platforms are vulnerable. GPT models could transmit traits to other GPTs. Qwen models could infect other Qwen systems. But they didn't seem to cross-contaminate between brands.",

      "\"We're training these systems that we don't fully understand,\" he said.\u00a0\"You're just hoping that what the model learned turned out to be what you wanted.\"",
      "This study raises deeper concerns about model alignment and safety. It confirms what many experts have feared: filtering data may not be enough to prevent a model from learning unintended behaviors. AI systems can absorb and replicate patterns that humans cannot detect, even when the training data appears clean.",

Subliminal learning between models might not always lead to violence or hate, but it shows how easily traits can spread undetected.

      "The ION data breach gives attackers access to your contact details, which they can misuse. Avoid clicking on unexpected emails or messages, even if they look legitimate. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping\u00a0your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "ION is offering free identity theft and credit monitoring services to those affected by the breach. But even if you weren't impacted by this specific breach, it's still smart to protect yourself. Identity theft protection services can alert you to suspicious activity, help you recover if your identity is stolen, and often provide tools to freeze or lock your credit. That prevents fraudsters from opening new accounts in your name, and you can lift the freeze temporarily when needed.",

      "Yet, the announcements \u2014 a direct response to global headlines and shocking\u00a0photographs of\u00a0allegedly starving children \u2014 may become hollow statements after the Israeli government on Friday said it would expand the military operation in Gaza as the only way to defeat Hamas,\u00a0the designated Palestinian terror group whose Oct. 7, 2023,\u00a0attack on Israel sparked the devastating\u00a0war, and restore peace.",
      "Recognition of a Palestinian state by a growing number of states could come as soon as next month\u2019s United Nations General Assembly.

      "Israeli leaders have warned that recognizing a Palestinian state at this juncture would be a clear reward for terrorism, and it will certainly do little to\u00a0strengthen the position \u2014 or popularity \u2014 of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who has been accused of corruption and who has refused to hold democratic elections for 20 years.",

      "\"In practical terms, the effects of unilateral recognition are quite limited,\" Ben Shabbat said. \"The recognition does not address borders, and, in fact, most of the world has already recognized a Palestinian state when it was accepted as a U.N. observer state (in 2012).\"HAMAS ENDGAME IS \u2018LONG-TERM\u2019 AND IS PLAYING OUT FOR ALL TO SEE AS ISRAEL PUSHES DEEPER INTO GAZA",

      "A parrot trained to mimic drug-related phrases played an unlikely role in helping British police dismantle a narcotics network operating inside a prison, authorities revealed this week.",
      "The Lancashire Constabulary announced charges against 15 people linked to the gang, which allegedly trafficked drugs across Blackpool, England, between February 2023 and July 2024. The group was led by 35-year-old Adam Garnett, who was already serving a prison sentence when the operation was uncovered.",
      "The investigation began after prison officials searched Garnett\u2019s cell and found multiple mobile phones and Wi-Fi routers. That discovery led police to several of his suspected associates, including Dalbir Sandhu, Shannon Hilton and Jason Gerrand. Searches of their homes turned up heroin, crack cocaine, ketamine, cannabis, large sums of cash and mobile phones allegedly tied to the drug trade.",
      "One of the more bizarre findings came from Hilton\u2019s phone, which police say contained videos showing her parrot, named \"Mango,\" repeating \"two for 25,\" a suspected drug deal reference. Another clip reportedly showed the bird playing with cash allegedly linked to illicit profits.",

      "\"One drug dealer's parrot learned to say \u2018two for 25\u2019 - a phrase picked up as part of common language used by the organised crime gang run by her boyfriend. Not a phrase you want your parrot squawking when the police come knocking!\"",
      "Investigators also uncovered video calls between Hilton and Garnett, along with footage appearing to show kilogram-sized packages of cocaine, sometimes accompanied by music lyrics referencing the drug.",
      "Despite being behind bars, authorities say Garnett remained at the center of the operation, directing efforts to hide evidence and maintaining contact with nearly every member of the criminal network.",

      "\"Expelling Jews from their homes in their own country was a strategic and moral mistake that led to the rise of an Islamist terrorist regime called Hamas,\" he said. \"That mistake enabled Hamas to fire relentless rockets and ultimately carry out the October 7 massacre \u2014 which included murder, rape, abuse, looting, and, of course, the kidnapping of soldiers and civilians.\"",
      "Wasserlauf invoked the bloc of 17 Israeli communities, collectively known as Gush Katif, which was established in Gaza after the 1967 Six-Day War. In August 2005, as part of Israel\u2019s\u00a0unilateral disengagement, the government forcibly removed approximately 8,600 Jewish residents from the area.",

Only in this way can true deterrence be achieved,\" Wasserlauf continued. \"We need to create facts on the ground. There must be no agreements with terrorists. Settlement in Gaza must, at the very least, be the price that reminds everyone terrorism does not pay.\"",
      "From 1948 to 1967, the Gaza Strip was under Egyptian occupation. After Israel captured the territory in the 1967 Six-Day War, it remained under full Israeli control until 1994, when administrative responsibility was transferred to the Palestinian Authority under the Oslo Accords \u2014 paving the way for Yasser Arafat\u2019s return from exile in Tunis.",

      "Wasserlauf argued that critics of the disengagement had long warned that any concession of land would only embolden terrorists. These warnings, he said, were ignored, but ultimately proven correct by the events that followed.",
      "He acknowledged that renewed settlement in Gaza would likely trigger political backlash both domestically and abroad. \"The countries that support us will stand with us, and those that consistently oppose us will remain against us \u2026 I remind you that there were countries that urged us not to strike Iran, despite its race toward nuclear weapons and its explicit goal of destroying Israel.\"",

And that's where the greatest risk of deterrence failure is,\" she said. \"It's not because of the sheer number of nuclear weapons.\"",
      "Heinrichs said Russia is lowering the nuclear threshold by routinely threatening to employ nuclear weapons in a move to coerce Western nations to capitulate to their demands, as in the case of capturing territory in Ukraine and attempting to deny it NATO access.",
      "Instead, she argued that the U.S. and its allies need to improve their deterrence by not only staying on top of their capabilities but expanding their nuclear reach in regions like the Indo-Pacific.",

      "\"The answer is not to be so afraid of it or alarmed that you capitulate, because you're only going to beget more nuclear coercion if you do that,\" she said. \"The answer is to prudently, carefully communicate to the Russians they are not going to succeed through nuclear coercion, that the United States also has credible response options.",
      "\"We also have nuclear weapons, and we have credible and proportional responses, and so they shouldn't go down that path,\" Heinrichs said. \"That's how we maintain the nuclear peace. That's how we deter conflict. And that's how we ensure that a nuclear weapon is not used.\"",

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came under pressure from all sides Sunday as his controversial plan to seize Gaza City drew backlash inside his government and on the streets of Israel, while malnutrition deaths in the Gaza Strip continued to climb.",
      "At a press conference on Sunday, a defiant Netanyahu continued to deny there is starvation in Gaza and claimed the situation is being exaggerated. Netanyahu only conceded there was \u201cdeprivation\u201d in Gaza, but said \u201cno one in Gaza would have survived after two years of war\u201d if Israel was implementing a \u201cstarvation policy.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu went on to defend the new military offensive, saying Israel had \u201cno choice\u201d but to \u201cfinish the job\u201d and \u201cdefeat Hamas,\u201d while claiming that \"hundreds of aid trucks have gone into Gaza.\"",
      "But his critics on the left say his proposed new military offensive is likely to worsen the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and further endanger the hostages still being held by Hamas. Protests calling for an immediate ceasefire drew thousands of people Saturday night in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and other Israeli cities.",
      "And for some far-right members of Netanyahu\u2019s coalition government, the plan isn\u2019t tough enough.",
      "Foreign Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who has pushed for Israel to impose sovereignty over Gaza, called it a \u201cfoolish\u201d half-measure, saying in a video message Saturday night that he did not support it.",
      "Smotrich said the proposed offensive was intended to pressure Hamas into agreeing to a temporary ceasefire, and that instead Israel needed a \u201csharp, clear path\u201d to victory over Hamas.",
      "The dissatisfaction expressed by Smotrich, who said he had \u201clost faith\u201d in the prime minister, threatens to destabilize Netanyahu\u2019s fragile coalition.",
      "Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid seized on the opportunity, calling on Smotrich to join him in advancing a bill to dissolve parliament and hold new elections.",
      "\u201cIn your own words, you admitted that the prime minister\u2019s policy is not leading to a decisive outcome in Gaza, is not returning our hostages, and is not winning the war,\u201d Lapid said in a statement, according to the Times of Israel. \u201cYou also added that you can no longer stand behind the prime minister and back him up.\u201d",
      "The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting later Sunday to discuss Israel's proposed offensive, which has been condemned by Britain, France, Australia and other Western governments.",
      "James Kariuki, the U.K.'s deputy permanent representative to the U.N., called on Israel to reverse its decision, saying the plan \"will only deepen the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza.\"",
      "It comes amid a worsening hunger crisis in Gaza, where humanitarian aid has been limited since Israel lifted a two-and-a-half-month blockade in May.",
      "The Gaza Health Ministry said Sunday that five more people, including two children, had died from malnutrition and starvation in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 217, including 100 children.",
      "Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, said Thursday that at least 99 people in Gaza, including 29 children under age 5, have died from malnutrition this year, noting the real toll was most likely higher.",
      "The U.N. and other international organizations say the humanitarian aid arriving in Gaza through air drops and on a small number of trucks is far from sufficient to feed the enclave\u2019s population of 2 million people.",
      "On Saturday, a 14-year-old boy named Muhannad Eid died after being struck by an aid package that was airdropped over Gaza, his brother, Muhammad Eid, said.",
      "\u201cThis is an aerial humiliation, not aid,\u201d Eid said. \u201cWe need protection. We want international protection.\u201d",
      "With the latest death, 23 people have now been killed during airdrops since the Israel-Hamas war began 22 months ago, according to the Gaza government media office.",
      "\u201cWe have repeatedly warned of the danger of these inhumane methods and have repeatedly called for the safe and adequate entry of aid through land crossings,\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "According to local health officials, more than 61,000 Palestinians, including thousands of children, have been killed since the war began on Oct. 7, 2023, with Hamas\u2019s terrorist attack on Israel. During that attack, Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and abducted 251 others.",
      "Of the 50 hostages still being held by Hamas, Israel believes about 20 are alive. Hostage advocates and Netanyahu\u2019s own army chief have warned that expanded military operations could put their lives in danger.",
      "The plan, which Netanyahu\u2019s government announced Friday, outlines five goals for ending the war: disarming Hamas, returning all hostages, demilitarizing Gaza, taking security control of the area, and establishing \u201can alternative civil administration that is neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority.\u201d",
      "Those preparations are expected to take weeks or months, a delay that hardliners in the Israeli government fear could leave room for a diplomatic solution that would undermine their objectives.",
      "Experts have also questioned whether the plan would protect Israelis, or work at all.",
      "Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University\u2019s Dayan Center, said the plan was full of \u201chollow slogans.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is a very common slogan: \u2018We will release the hostages and defeat Hamas at the same time,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do both simultaneously. Hamas will execute them, or the IDF itself could in the bombing.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu said Sunday that his goal was to get the hostages out alive and recover the remains of those had had died.",
      "\"If we don't do anything, we are not going to get them out,\" he said. \"The move I'm talking about has the possibility of getting them out.\"",
      "There are also questions as to who would run Gaza long term. Netanyahu said he intends to hand control of the territory to \u201cArab forces,\u201d adding Sunday that \"several candidates\" are being looked at for the establishment of a new \"transitional authority.\"",
      "He has not specified who that could be, aside from saying it would not be Hamas or the Palestinian Authority.",
      "\u201cThat leaves nobody,\u201d said H.A. Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London. \u201cNo Arab country is going to be Israel\u2019s enforcer on the ground.\u201d"

    "summary": "Donald Trump's meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska to discuss the Ukraine war is one of the biggest gambits of his second term.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 An unkept promise of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency is that he\u2019d end the war between Russia and Ukraine in one swift diplomatic masterstroke.",
      "Trump made threats. He applied pressure. Still, the bombs keep falling, the casualties continue to pile up.",
      "Now, Trump is betting that a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin will yield the elusive breakthrough and possibly quell concerns among voters about his handling of the war.",
      "The summit taking place Friday on friendly turf, the red state of Alaska, amounts to one of the biggest gambits of Trump\u2019s second term. Hosting the meeting raises expectations that he\u2019ll stop the fighting. The president faces traps in sitting down with Putin, who is well-versed in the territorial issues at stake, but he also enjoys economic and military leverage. Creating a durable peace that will preserve Ukraine\u2019s independence will test the dealmaking skills that are Trump\u2019s point of pride.",
      "\u201cIf you roll into the meeting not prepped, you can get jammed by Putin,\u201d said Michael McFaul, who was U.S. ambassador to Russia in the Obama administration. \u201cSummits are to achieve an objective that advances American national interests. They\u2019re the means to end, and I sometimes feel that Trump feels the meeting is an end in itself.\u201d",
      "Inside the Trump administration, a national security official acknowledged that forging a peace accord won\u2019t be easy. One of the combatants won\u2019t be at the table: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has refused to relinquish territory to Russia that was illegally annexed.",
      "\u201cWhether or not there\u2019s a breakthrough in the next week or two, we\u2019ll find out,\u201d said the Trump administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cUltimately, Putin and Zelenskyy have to be able to agree on something fundamentally. Third parties can do anything they want, but these two men have to agree to things.\u201d",
      "Sitting in a room with Putin, a canny negotiator in his own right, Trump may be lured into endorsing a peace deal that carves up Ukraine, foreign policy experts caution.",
      "\u201cI worry that in the eagerness to look like a peacemaker, President Trump will say, \u2018Yeah, that sounds like a good idea to me,\u2019\u201d McFaul said. \u201cPutin will say, \u2018Donetsk [a city in eastern Ukraine] was always part of Russia.\u2019 And Trump will say, \u2018You\u2019re right about that.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cPutin is good at those stories,\u201d McFaul continued. \u201cHe knows his history, and he can be engaging in his narrative. That\u2019s what the president needs to be ready for and his team needs to get him ready for.\u201d",
      "Another possibility is that Putin tries to stall the president further, promising concessions he has no intention of making in hopes of consolidating gains on the battlefield, one former U.S. official said.",
      "Putin may try to \u201cdivert President Trump from Trump\u2019s goal of stopping the war and establishing a ceasefire by promising things later,\u201d said William Taylor, who was charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine during Trump\u2019s first term. \u201cThen, Putin continues to fight and continues to kill Ukrainians.\u201d",
      "No matter the outcome, Putin comes away with at least a symbolic victory: He\u2019s getting a large, bright stage at a time when he\u2019s an international pariah. Two years ago, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin, accusing him of war crimes involving the abduction of Ukrainian children. The warrant substantially limited potential locations for the two world leaders to meet.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump \u2014 just by going to a meeting with Putin, who for most of the democratic world is a rogue, imperialist dictator \u2014 is giving him legitimacy,\u201d McFaul said.",
      "The summit will inevitably invite comparisons to one held in Helsinki in 2018.",
      "At a joint news conference with Putin that year, Trump came off as eager to forge a personal connection after years of icy bilateral relations between the U.S. and Russia. Citing Putin\u2019s denial of interfering in the 2016 presidential race, Trump said at the time: \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason why it would be\u201d Russia that meddled in his victory over Hillary Clinton that year. (He later claimed he had misspoken, affirming that he believed the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Russian meddling had occurred but added that there \u201ccould be other people also\u201d who interfered in the 2016 election.)",
      "This time around, Trump is more seasoned and has grown impatient with Putin\u2019s conduct of the war. He has suggested that his wife, Melania Trump, has influenced his view of Putin, reminding him of the damage that Russia has inflicted on Ukraine.",
      "For his part, Putin is more diminished. As of this summer, Russian casualties were expected to hit 1 million. If he chooses, Trump could punish Russia for prolonging the war by slapping secondary sanctions on countries that purchase Russian energy, a step he has threatened to take.",
      "\u201cTrump is in a stronger position this time than in that first meeting,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIf President Trump goes into the meeting with Putin and exercises the political, military and economic leverage that he\u2019s got, there could be a ceasefire.\u201d",
      "Trump heads into the summit facing difficulties at home. His administration has struggled to stem the backlash from his base over the Jeffrey Epstein case. Last week, Trump fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics following a hiring report that showed weak job growth.",
      "A recent poll from the University of Massachusetts Amherst showed that Trump\u2019s approval rating was 38% \u2014 a 6-point drop from April.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s pretty close to the theoretical floor in this polarized era for approval ratings,\u201d said Alexander Theodoridis, director of the poll.",
      "Among Trump voters, support for his handling of the Russia-Ukraine war stood at 64% compared with other issues on which they approved of his performance by significantly higher margins, Theodoridis said. A total of 85% of Trump\u2019s 2024 voters approved of his performance on immigration issues; 78% favored his work on jobs; and 71% on tariffs.",
      "Statecraft is a proven way for presidents to improve their standing at home. A commander in chief enjoys far more latitude in shaping events in the foreign policy arena than when it comes to domestic affairs.",
      "The summit, said Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat who serves on the Foreign Relations Committee, \u201cwill change the subject in a positive way for Trump if he actually stands up to Putin and demands a just peace for Ukraine.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat would be a positive diversion,\u201d Coons added. \u201cBut it would be the worst of both worlds if it [the summit] is intended both to be a diversion from the domestic focus on things like tariffs and Epstein, and he fails to be strong.\u201d",
      "An added incentive for Trump to end the conflict could be an award that he seems to covet. His White House appears to be methodically building a case that he has earned the Nobel Peace Prize, drawing attention to various efforts to reduce tensions in global hot spots.",
      "Jan. 31 is the deadline for nominating candidates for the 2026 prize. The Nobel selection committee will announce the winner in October of that year.",
      "On Friday, Trump held a ceremony in the White House to mark a U.S.-brokered accord ending hostilities between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Questioned by reporters, the leaders of both countries touted Trump\u2019s candidacy for a prize that three other American presidents have won. Barack Obama was the most recent winner, in 2009.",
      "Still, the peace deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan would be merely an amuse-bouche compared with ending the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, a nuclear-armed power.",
      "\u201cPutin is clearly in a weaker position,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThis invasion of Ukraine has turned out to be a disaster for him. And Trump has the cards this time. He\u2019s got leverage, experience and confidence. He\u2019s eager to solve this problem and end the war. He sees that Putin is the problem. Putin is standing between him and the end of the war.\u201d"

    "published": "Sun, 10 Aug 2025 11:03:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Your 401(k) options could change soon.",
    "story": [
      "Your 401(k) options could change soon. President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday to clear the way for Americans to invest their retirement savings in private equity, cryptocurrency, real estate and other alternative assets.",
      "It\u2019s a big win for the asset industry \u2014 giving financial managers access to some of the $12.2 trillion in Americans\u2019 401(k) and related retirement plans. Private assets can also be more lucrative, and the Trump administration said they can give retirement savers more opportunities.",
      "\u201cThe theoretical benefits are that everyday Americans can invest in a broader menu of companies,\u201d said Robert Brokamp, a financial planning expert at stock market research company The Motley Fool.",
      "But there are higher risks \u2014 and not necessarily higher rewards. Critics say it could put people in danger of losing a huge chunk of their retirement savings.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot less transparency and liquidity in private markets,\u201d said Brokamp. \u201cThere\u2019s not as much information about the companies, and it could be hard to sell your investments \u2014 especially during a panic and many, many investors are trying to sell at the same time.\u201d",
      "Plus the fees are higher for private assets than for typical 401(k) investments like mutual funds and ETFs. Benjamin Schiffrin, director of securities policy at Better Markets, said target-date mutual funds holding stocks and bonds charge 0.3% \u2014 while private funds can charge 1% to 2% in management fees and up to 20% in performance fees, and interval funds charge 2% to 3%.",
      "Right now, private equity is technically allowed in retirement plans, but it\u2019s rare \u2014 though some companies like BlackRock are planning new offerings. There are ways people can invest in crypto through their 401(k)s, too, but it\u2019s also not common. And many 401(k) recordkeepers don\u2019t support private equity funds yet.",
      "The executive order could change that. It directs the Department of Labor to re-examine its guidance and clarify its position on alternative assets like private market investments, real estate interests and digital assets within 180 days. And it tells the Securities and Exchange Commission to consider ways to facilitate access to alternative assets for plans like 401(k)s.",
      "\u201cI think this is going to open the floodgates,\u201d said Schiffrin. \u201cI think up until now, you\u2019ve actually seen a lot of hesitancy on the part of 401(k) plan managers to go down the road of including private market assets like private equity and private credit, things like that in the 401(k) plans.\u201d",
      "Employers would have to decide to offer the plans \u2014 and experts anticipate many might be reluctant, as they could be held liable for losses. However, with updated guidance from the government, employers may feel more comfortable adding these alternative assets into their 401(k)s. Many experts say that might not be a good thing.",
      "SageMint Wealth managing partner Anh Tran, a certified financial planner and attorney, believes there\u2019s a real risk that some investors will be drawn in by the allure of potentially higher returns from alternative investments without having the full picture. She said she would not advise anyone to make this kind of investment unless they fully understand the risk of losing that money entirely.",
      "\u201cIt could be detrimental to less-informed investors whose only investment account is their 401(k),\u201d said Tran. \u201cWithout proper guardrails, such as limiting exposure to 5% to 10% of the portfolio, these investors could be exposed to unnecessary risk, misaligned expectations and potentially irreversible losses.\u201d",
      "Knut Rostad, co-founder and president of the nonprofit Institute for the Fiduciary Standard, also fears private assets in 401(k)s could put retirement savers at risk of big losses.",
      "\u201cI think in practice, there\u2019ll be many fiduciaries who ignore this directive because they understand precisely what will result from it,\u201d he said, referring to Trump\u2019s executive order. \u201cThe result will be a massive train wreck where many people are seriously hurt. Their retirement accounts will be annihilated.\u201d",
      "And cryptocurrencies come with their own dangers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not clear what, if any, protections investors are going to have when it comes to investing in crypto,\u201d said Better Markets\u2019 Schiffrin. \u201cSo that just is a whole separate category of risks that having crypto in 401(k)s opens up.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a trade organization for broker-dealers, investment banks and asset managers, cheered the announcement as a win for retirement savers.",
      "\u201cAs more U.S. companies choose to remain non-public, private markets have developed into a more robust asset class,\u201d Kenneth E. Bentsen Jr., president and CEO of SIFMA, said in a statement. \u201cAccess to such investments, however, has been limited primarily to institutional and high net worth investors.\u201d",
      "He continued: \u201cPolicy changes to expand access to private markets investments \u2014 appropriately tailored under ERISA and SEC rules \u2014 could serve to improve diversification, democratize access, and offer more investment choices to the benefit of everyday retirement savers.\u201d",
      "Experts believe it could take months to see any changes. For now, they say education and safeguards are key \u2014 especially for younger investors and people without access to professional financial advice.",
      "\u201cThere must be transparency, education and limits in place to prevent widespread harm,\u201d said Tran. \u201cOtherwise, we could be setting the stage for not only \ufb01nancial loss, but broader economic and social consequences.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "News of Abdul Niazi\u2019s death arrived in a chilling phone call.",
      "It was March 26, nearly the end of Ramadan, and his wife wanted to know when to expect her husband, a former U.S. military interpreter who lost both legs in a bomb blast in Afghanistan and became one of Houston\u2019s most well-known advocates for new Afghan migrants.",
      "It was almost time to break the day\u2019s fast, recalled Niazi\u2019s cousin, but he hadn\u2019t returned home. So she called his cellphone.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not your husband,\u201d the man on the other end of the line said, according to Rizwanullah Niazi, Niazi\u2019s cousin. \u201cI killed your husband.\u201d",
      "The shock of that call intensified when his family learned what authorities later alleged in bail documents filed in Harris County District Court: An Afghan national who\u2019d sought help from Niazi was accused of stabbing him more than a dozen times over frustration with the slow pace of the U.S. immigration system.",
      "The 34-year-old\u2019s death left the Marines he served with reeling and a hole in Houston\u2019s sizable Afghan community.",
      "\u201cI still don\u2019t believe that he is not with us anymore,\u201d said Nisar Momand, who met Niazi more than a decade ago and, like his friend, helps recently resettled Afghans obtain services and navigate the immigration bureaucracy.",
      "\u201cAbdul was like the backbone of the community,\u201d Momand said. \u201cWithout a backbone, we are totally disabled.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an unspeakable tragedy,\u201d said Brandon Remington, a former U.S. Marine Corps platoon commander who worked with Niazi in Afghanistan and helped him flee to the United States amid death threats from the Taliban. \u201cGiven how much he escaped death and to die in that way \u2014 it\u2019s insane. It feels like the universe is crazy.\u201d",
      "Masiullah Sahil, 37, is accused of first-degree murder in Niazi\u2019s death and, until last month, was being held in lieu of $750,000 bond. After prosecutors failed to indict him within three months, as Texas law requires, a judge ordered him released on a personal recognizance bond that required no payment, court records show.",
      "\u201cIt just didn\u2019t get done,\u201d a prosecutor said during a July 10 hearing about the failure to obtain that indictment, according to NBC affiliate KPRC of Houston.",
      "Sahil remains jailed, however. The same day Harris County District Court Judge Emily Detoto ordered him released, the district attorney\u2019s office filed a witness tampering charge. He\u2019s being held on $25,000 bond, jail records show. Sahil is scheduled to be arraigned on both charges Aug. 12.",
      "Still, the prosecution\u2019s apparent failure infuriated Niazi\u2019s friends and family, who are calling for an investigation into the district attorney\u2019s office.",
      "\u201cWhat if he\u2019d gotten out and came and killed his wife and kids?\u201d said Niazi\u2019s close friend Mohammad Bayan, referring to Niazi\u2019s family. \u201cI was completely heartbroken and outraged.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Harris County District Attorney\u2019s Office said the situation is under review with prosecutors assigned to the case. Sahil\u2019s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "A fearless interpreter",
      "Niazi was raised in Jalalabad, east of Kabul, and worked as an English teacher before he got a job as a translator with the U.S. Marines in Afghanistan in 2011, said Rizwanullah Niazi, a cousin who also worked as a military translator.",
      "Michael Egan, a Marine who led a unit that Abdul Niazi was attached to for several months in Helmand province, described him as one of the best combat interpreters he worked with \u2014 always levelheaded and alert, comfortable in potentially lethal situations and driven by a desire to protect his home.",
      "\u201cHe was one of the more courageous and fearless people out there,\u201d said Egan, 36. \u201cYou knew if Niazi was with you, you were set.\u201d",
      "That mission ended in May 2012, during what Egan described as a routine foot patrol through a village. Egan stepped on an improvised explosive device and instantly lost both legs.",
      "Minutes later, as Marines desperately tried to stabilize Egan, he said he heard another blast.",
      "Niazi had been ordered to take cover, and when he did, there was a second detonation, said Remington, the former platoon commander, citing an after-action report.",
      "\u201cIt was complete and utter chaos,\u201d Egan said.",
      "Niazi was severely wounded. He lost both legs and suffered so much damage to one arm that it would be difficult for him to use a manual wheelchair in the future, Egan said.",
      "A new life in Houston",
      "Niazi underwent months of surgery in India before he returned to Afghanistan, Rizwanullah Niazi said. While there, he started receiving letters from the Taliban threatening his family, said Remington, who by then was attending law school in the United States.",
      "Remington said he helped Niazi apply for a special immigrant visa, designated for people who assisted the U.S. military in Iraq and Afghanistan. Niazi obtained that visa a little over a decade ago and moved to Houston, Remington recalled.",
      "He was one of the thousands of Afghans who worked with the U.S. military and relocated to Texas in the years that followed the U.S. invasion. According to U.S. State Department data, nearly 20,000 Afghans with special visas moved to the state between 2012 and 2023, with a sharp rise after the United States military left the country in 2021.",
      "When Momand first met Niazi at a local clinic in 2014, he wasn\u2019t sure how his countryman would fare in the United States.",
      "\u201cHow will he survive in this country with no legs, with a disability and a wheelchair?\u201d he recalled wondering.",
      "Initially, Niazi worked as a sales clerk at a cellphone store, said  Bayan, who became best friends with Niazi after he settled in Houston. He eventually had five children \u2014 four boys and one girl, the oldest of whom is 10, Bayan said.",
      "He started working for a nonprofit that provided assistance to refugees, Bayan said, and the pair attended college together, earning bachelor\u2019s degrees in business administration from the University of Houston and enrolling in an online master\u2019s program for national security policy at Liberty University in Virginia.",
      "Their goal, Bayan said, was to obtain Ph.D.s and return to Afghanistan to help improve the country\u2019s national security. After the nonprofit Niazi worked for shuttered last year, Bayan said, Niazi established his own business providing services to recent transplants and quickly amassed hundreds of clients.",
      "\u201cPay me when you can\u201d was Niazi\u2019s business model, Bayan said. When he reminded his friend that he had rent and two assistants to pay, Bayan recalled Niazi responding: \u201cAll these refugee families, they\u2019re struggling, and it\u2019s hard for me to ask them for money. Whenever they give it to me, I will accept it.\u201d",
      "An argument and a fatal stabbing",
      "One of those people was Sahil, Bayan said.",
      "Bayan knew Sahil before he went to see Niazi. He said Sahil had sought help from him and others to get the necessary documentation to return to Afghanistan. Bayan said Niazi told him that Sahil kept calling and visiting, wanting to know how to get back to his home country as soon as possible.",
      "But the documentation Sahil needed was \u201cnot in my hands,\u201d Bayan recalled Niazi saying.",
      "A client found Niazi dead in his office on March 26. Sahil was seen on video coming and going from the office several times before he was captured leaving with blood on his clothes, according to the bail document.",
      "When authorities found Sahil, he had Niazi\u2019s phone and said that he\u2019d been frustrated with how long it was taking for his refugee status to be approved, according to the document. He admitted to arguing with Niazi, then getting a knife from his car and repeatedly striking him with it.",
      "Niazi\u2019s body was found with 20 deep stab wounds and lacerations, according to the document.",
      "After Niazi\u2019s wife learned of his death through the phone call, Bayan said, the suspect continued calling her. She was screaming and crying, recalled Bayan, who by that point had gone to his friend\u2019s home.",
      "Amid the swirl of grief and confusion, Bayan said he asked for her phone.",
      "Then, he said, he called the man back and asked him about what he had done. After a few vague answers, Bayan said, the man told him Niazi \u201cwas not listening to me.\u201d",
      "Immediately after that call, Bayan said, he and a relative of Niazi\u2019s reported what they learned to authorities.",
      "If he could question the suspect again, Bayan said he\u2019d ask him a simple question: \u201cIs it worth taking an innocent life over immigration paperwork?\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A growing number of U.S. politicians are condemning a new British law that requires some websites and apps \u2014 including some based in the United States \u2014 to check the ages of users across the pond.",
      "A bipartisan group of members of Congress visited London recently to meet counterparts and air their concerns about the U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act, which went into effect July 25. Vice President JD Vance has been criticizing the law for months, as have privacy advocates who argue that the law infringes on free expression and disproportionately hurts vulnerable groups.",
      "Vance criticized the U.K. again on Friday, this time in person at the start of a visit to the country. Sitting alongside British Foreign Secretary David Lammy and speaking to reporters, Vance warned the U.K. against going down a \u201cvery dark path\u201d of online \u201ccensorship\u201d that he said was trod earlier by the Biden administration.",
      "The U.K. Online Safety Act is aimed at preventing children from accessing potentially harmful material online, and internet companies are now asking British users to verify their ages in a variety of ways, including with photos of their IDs, through a credit card provider or with selfies analyzed via age-check software.",
      "But the sweeping nature of the law has caught some Britons by surprise. They\u2019re being asked to prove their age not only for pornography websites but also before they can listen to songs with explicit lyrics or access message boards to discuss sensitive subjects. Reddit, for example, is restricting access to various pages including r/stopsmoking, r/STD and r/aljazeera.",
      "Reddit said in a post about its enforcement of the law that for people in the U.K., it was now verifying ages before they can \u201cview certain mature content.\u201d A spokesperson for the company said r/STD \u2014 a message board focused on questions of sexual health \u2014 is restricted because of explicit images. They said r/stopsmoking is restricted because it deals with harmful substances and that r/aljazeera \u2014 which is not affiliated with the news organization of the same name but deals with similar topics \u2014 is restricted because it depicts serious injury or violence.",
      "To get around the new law, the use of virtual private network software that can mask a person\u2019s location, also known as VPNs, has surged in the U.K.",
      "The primary argument of U.S. politicians who oppose the law is that they don\u2019t want American tech companies to have to comply, even if they\u2019re serving British customers.",
      "House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said he raised his objections with U.K. government officials during meetings in London at the end of July. In a statement after his return, he said the law and other European regulations \u201ccreate a serious chilling effect on free expression and threaten the First Amendment rights of American citizens and companies.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe absolutely need to protect children and keep harmful, illegal content off these platforms \u2014 but when governments or bureaucracies suppress speech in the name of safety or regulation, it sets a dangerous precedent that threatens the core of Western democratic values,\u201d Jordan said.",
      "The issue may come to a head in a couple of different venues. That could be the courts if any tech companies file lawsuits over the law, or it could come up in trade negotiations if President Donald Trump decides to press the issue with British politicians, although they say it\u2019s not open to debate in trade talks.",
      "Marc Andreessen, a venture capitalist and Meta board member with close ties to the Trump administration, recently called U.K. leaders to complain about the law, the Financial Times reported Friday. A spokesperson for Andreessen said the report was not true.",
      "The U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act is one of the most comprehensive national laws that any democracy has ever passed to try to curtail potentially harmful content online in the name of children. Parliament passed the law in 2023, and the government went through two years of writing detailed rules before putting the law into effect last month.",
      "The law is notable for a combination of reasons: the variety of content it applies to, the potential fines and the possible international reach.",
      "A wide array of content is at issue. While the \u201cprimary\u201d focus of the law is online material such as pornography and suicide, it also requires websites to age-gate content with bullying, serious violence, \u201cdangerous stunts\u201d and \u201cexposure to harmful substances.\u201d That has covered relatively mainstream services such as Spotify and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox gaming system.",
      "Companies that don\u2019t comply face potential fines of up to 10% of their global revenue, which for the biggest companies could be billions of dollars. The British regulator Ofcom, short for Office of Communications, says companies must use \u201chighly effective age assurance\u201d to restrict the riskiest types of content.",
      "And the U.K. has not been adamant that it won\u2019t allow international borders to stymie enforcement. Ofcom says it plans to apply the law to services with \u201ca significant number\u201d of U.K. users, services where U.K. users \u201care a target market\u201d and services that are \u201ccapable of being accessed\u201d by U.K. users with a \u201cmaterial risk of significant harm\u201d to such users.",
      "The law appears to retain strong support among the British public. About 69% said they supported the new rules in a YouGov poll taken after implementation began, and 46% said they supported it \u201cstrongly.\u201d But 52% said they do not think the law will be very effective at preventing minors from accessing pornography.",
      "The law was passed during a previous, Conservative-led government and took effect under the current, Labour-led government.",
      "But the far-right party Reform U.K. is pushing for a repeal of the law. Party leader Nigel Farage, a former member of Parliament, has called it \u201cstate suppression of genuine free speech,\u201d and his party is running high in polls.",
      "\u201cMillions of people have noticed that what they\u2019re getting on their feeds is different to what it was,\u201d Farage said at a recent news conference.",
      "Farage also met with visiting members of Congress last week, and the talks turned heated with Farage and Democrats exchanging insults, according to Politico, although the dispute appeared to be more about Trump\u2019s free speech restrictions than about the U.K. law.",
      "Most U.S.-based tech companies say they are complying with the new law. Microsoft said in a blog post that Xbox users in the U.K. would begin seeing notifications \u201cencouraging them to verify their age\u201d as a \u201cone-time process,\u201d with actual enforcement starting next year. If users don\u2019t comply, Microsoft warned, they\u2019ll lose access to social features of Xbox but will still be able to play games.",
      "Discord said it was implementing new default settings for all U.K. users, in effect treating everyone like a minor with heavy content filtering unless they verify that they\u2019re adults. Discord says users can choose to verify their age either with a face scan or an ID upload.",
      "Elon Musk\u2019s X has also restricted posts, including information about the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, according to the BBC. X and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "But a few services are not complying. The far-right social media site Gab, which allows white supremacist views and other extremist content, said in a notice on its website that it had received notices from Ofcom and, rather than comply, decided to block the entire U.K. from accessing its site. The company said in the notice: \u201cWe refuse to comply with this tyranny.\u201d",
      "Preston Byrne, a U.S. lawyer who specializes in technology issues, has said on X that he plans to file a lawsuit soon on behalf of an unnamed client seeking to quash possible enforcement of the British law within the United States.",
      "The subject has been simmering for months ahead of the law\u2019s implementation, and it came up in February when British Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited the White House.",
      "In an Oval Office meeting, a reporter asked Trump what he thought of the U.K. approach to free speech, and Trump tossed the question to Vance, who expressed concern.",
      "\u201cWe do have, of course, a special relationship with our friends in the U.K. and also with some of our European allies. But we also know that there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British \u2014 of course, what the British do in their own country is up to them \u2014 but also affect American technology companies and, by extension, American citizens,\u201d he said.",
      "Starmer defended his government\u2019s approach.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom, and it will last for a very, very long time. Certainly, we wouldn\u2019t want to reach across U.S. systems and we don\u2019t, and that\u2019s absolutely right,\u201d he said.",
      "British Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy later said the U.K. would not make any changes to the Online Safety Act as part of trade negotiations with the Trump administration.",
      "American privacy advocates are watching the debate play out with alarm, concerned that similar age verification laws \u2014 like new state laws targeting the Apple and Google app stores \u2014 would upend the internet closer to home.",
      "\u201cYoung people should be able to access information, speak to each other and to the world, play games, and express themselves online without the government making decisions about what speech is permissible,\u201d wrote Paige Collings, a senior speech and privacy activist at the San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation, in a blog post Tuesday."

      "Misha Brown was walking into his local Circle K gas station in Austin, Texas, when he says a teenage boy approached him and asked him to buy him \u201cFeel Free.\u201d When Brown said no, he said he believed the boy tried to grab his wallet.",
      "Brown, 37, recounted the story in a TikTok last month that has over 23 million views.",
      "When he went into the store and told the attendant about the teen, she pointed to Feel Free \u2014 an herbal drink sold in small, blue, shot-size bottles that claim to offer \u201crelaxation, productivity and focus\u201d \u2014 and told him that people were coming in around six times a day to purchase the product, he said in the video. \u201cIt\u2019s so addictive and people lose their minds,\u201d he recalled the attendant saying.",
      "Brown had never heard of Feel Free, but the video set off a wave of comments about the product. Young people were describing \u201cthese devastating experiences with these products,\u201d he told NBC News.",
      "Feel Free was launched by Botanic Tonics in 2020. Feel Free Classic contains kava root, which is touted for its relaxing effects, and kratom, a plant native to Southeast Asia that\u2019s known for its stimulant and opioid-like effects.",
      "It\u2019s the kratom in Feel Free that has experts and health officials concerned. The Food and Drug Administration declared kratom to be an opioid in 2018 and has taken steps to crack down on products related to it. Kratom is not federally regulated, though five states \u2014 Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Rhode Island and Wisconsin \u2014 have banned it, according to a report from the Congressional Research Service.",
      "Kratom \u201cis concerning to me,\u201d said Dr. Robert Levy, an addiction medicine expert and an associate professor of family medicine and community health at the University of Minnesota Medical School. \u201cI\u2019ve seen [kratom addiction] and treated it many times,\u201d Levy said.",
      "John, of Columbia, South Carolina, has also shared videos on TikTok about Feel Free. The 35-year-old, who previously struggled with an addiction to heroin and meth, had been eight years sober when he learned about the drink. At the time, John, who asked that his last name be withheld for privacy, said \u201ceverything just started to go bad\u201d in his life, including losing his job at Aldi. After trying a sample of Feel Free from a sales representative at a local herbal store in early 2024, he said, he was hooked.",
      "\u201cI tried it and I liked it a lot,\u201d John said. \u201cIt made me feel warm. \u2026 It gave me good energy and I loved it.\u201d",
      "Within eight months, John said he was drinking almost a case of Feel Free Classic bottles a day. To fuel his addiction, he started delivering for DoorDash, emptied all $8,000 out of his 401(k), and sold his PlayStation 5, gaming laptop and \u201ceverything I had,\u201d he said. When his money ran out, he resorted to stealing. He estimates that he spent around $30,000 in total.",
      "\u201cI was doing anything I could,\u201d John said. \u201cIt turned me into someone that I am not.\u201d",
      "John and Brown aren\u2019t the only ones raising awareness about Feel Free. On Reddit, a group dedicated to quitting Feel Free has over 5,000 followers.",
      "\u201cBelieve me when I tell you, you need to run away as fast as you can from this,\u201d one Reddit user posted.",
      "Botanic Tonics, the maker of Feel Free, agreed to pay $8.75 million to settle a 2023 class action lawsuit that claimed it failed to warn consumers about the risks of kratom and because it advertised the product as a safe replacement for alcohol. The company did not admit any wrongdoing but did change its label to include information that the product could be habit-forming and people who have a history of substance abuse should consider not consuming it.",
      "Botanic Tonics said in a statement to NBC News that \u201cfalse and misleading claims are being made about feel free on social media and are being perpetuated on news outlets.\u201d",
      "\u201cBotanic Tonics has sold over 129.7 million servings of feel free to date. We have received fewer than 1,000 consumer adverse event complaints total across all categories, with zero complaints involving severe addiction,\u201d the statement said, adding that this represents \u201can exceptionally low complaint rate that contradicts sensationalized social media anecdotes being reported as representative of our customer experience.\u201d",
      "What is kratom?",
      "Kratom, also known as Mitragyna speciosa, has been grown in Southeast Asia for centuries, said Oliver Grundmann, a clinical professor at the University of Florida College of Pharmacy. Grundmann said he first got involved in kratom research in 2016 at a time when the market for kratom products was \u201cmuch smaller.\u201d He soon discovered rising demand, which he attributed to kratom\u2019s stimulant, pain-relieving and possibly sedative effects.",
      "The FDA says that kratom is \u201cnot appropriate for use as a dietary supplement\u201d and that there\u2019s \u201cinadequate information to provide reasonable assurance that such ingredient does not present a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury.\u201d It\u2019s often used to self-treat conditions including anxiety, depression, pain, opioid use disorder and opioid withdrawal, the agency says.",
      "Continuous use of kratom has been linked to gastrointestinal issues, including nausea, vomiting, constipation and diarrhea, experts say. Larger amounts can also lead to elevated heart rate and sweating, Grundmann said. The Drug Enforcement Administration says that kratom users have experienced weight loss, insomnia, seizures and hallucinations. Chronic use is also associated with liver damage, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.",
      "Last month, the FDA recommended that the Justice Department classify 7-OH, one of the two main chemical compounds found in kratom, as an illicit substance due to its potency \u2014 a move that would restrict or prohibit access to 7-OH products. 7-OH is naturally occurring in kratom, but synthetic versions of the compound are also sold, usually in highly concentrated stand-alone forms. The FDA was focused on these synthetic, highly concentrated forms of 7-OH, not plant-based kratom. Feel Free contains plant-based kratom, not synthetic 7-OH, Botanic Tonics said in a statement.",
      "FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said 7-OH should be classified as a Schedule I substance alongside drugs like heroin, ecstasy and marijuana, meaning it has no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.",
      "In 2016, the Drug Enforcement Administration said it planned to classify the compounds in kratom, including 7-OH, as Schedule I drugs. It dropped those efforts after significant pushback from kratom advocates.",
      "Levy, the addiction medicine expert, said that compared to kratom, 7-OH is a \u201cmuch more powerful opioid,\u201d and products sold as \u201c7-OH\u201d are almost completely artificial.",
      "Marc Swogger, an associate professor in the department of psychiatry at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York, said kratom tends not to be addictive when taken in low doses, but that people may develop a tolerance and need to take more to feel the same effects. When people stop taking kratom, some may experience withdrawal.",
      "Is Feel Free safe?",
      "Feel Free comes in 2-ounce bottles, but a serving size is half of that. The label says that people should not drink more than 2 ounces within 24 hours. The label also warns that the product can become habit-forming and recommends that people who have a history of substance abuse consider not consuming the product.",
      "A recovering addict\u2019s brain can heal but never fully returns back to normal, Levy said, comparing it to someone in remission from cancer. A small bit of irritation, like a Feel Free drink, can trigger addiction to come back.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re playing with fire,\u201d Levy said. \u201cAs an addiction medicine doctor, I would never suggest that somebody consume that [Feel Free] that\u2019s in recovery.\u201d (He added he also wouldn\u2019t recommend it to anyone in general because it\u2019s not regulated.)",
      "Mac Haddow, a senior fellow in public policy for the American Kratom Association, said, \u201cWe\u2019re concerned about any product that has an addiction liability that is classified as causing serious adverse events.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe strongly support very tough regulations on kratom products,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are aware of the reports that people in the Feel Free space are reporting about addiction, as we have people in the kratom space.\u201d",
      "Utah has banned the sale of Feel Free products. \u201cState law prohibits the sale of any kratom product that is mixed with other ingredients in a way that alters its quality or strength to the extent that it could be harmful to consumers,\u201d said Caroline Hargraves, the public information officer for Utah\u2019s Department of Agriculture and Food.",
      "After trying to quit Feel Free multiple times, John began sharing videos of his intense withdrawal symptoms on TikTok. These included intense body tremors, sweating, difficulty breathing and foaming from the mouth, he said. In February, John\u2019s withdrawal was so bad that he was hospitalized. He said the only other drug in his system was marijuana. He was placed on a ventilator and later developed pneumonia, according to notes from the hospital staff when he was admitted that were reviewed by NBC News.",
      "\u201cThey thought I was going to die,\u201d John said.",

      "\u201cAddiction is something that affects a lot of people,\u201d he said. \u201cIf [Feel Free] is something that\u2019s just so easily attainable and is marketed as, like, an alcohol-free substitute or like an energy drink, I think that it\u2019s pretty dangerous.\u201d",

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came under pressure from all sides Sunday as his controversial plan to seize Gaza City drew backlash inside his government and on the streets of Israel, while malnutrition deaths in the Gaza Strip continued to climb.",
      "At a press conference on Sunday, a defiant Netanyahu continued to deny there is starvation in Gaza and claimed the situation is being exaggerated. Netanyahu only conceded there was \u201cdeprivation\u201d in Gaza, but said \u201cno one in Gaza would have survived after two years of war\u201d if Israel was implementing a \u201cstarvation policy.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu went on to defend the new military offensive, saying Israel had \u201cno choice\u201d but to \u201cfinish the job\u201d and \u201cdefeat Hamas,\u201d while claiming that \"hundreds of aid trucks have gone into Gaza.\"",
      "But his critics on the left say his proposed new military offensive is likely to worsen the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and further endanger the hostages still being held by Hamas. Protests calling for an immediate ceasefire drew thousands of people Saturday night in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and other Israeli cities.",
      "And for some far-right members of Netanyahu\u2019s coalition government, the plan isn\u2019t tough enough.",
      "Foreign Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who has pushed for Israel to impose sovereignty over Gaza, called it a \u201cfoolish\u201d half-measure, saying in a video message Saturday night that he did not support it.",
      "Smotrich said the proposed offensive was intended to pressure Hamas into agreeing to a temporary ceasefire, and that instead Israel needed a \u201csharp, clear path\u201d to victory over Hamas.",
      "The dissatisfaction expressed by Smotrich, who said he had \u201clost faith\u201d in the prime minister, threatens to destabilize Netanyahu\u2019s fragile coalition.",
      "Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid seized on the opportunity, calling on Smotrich to join him in advancing a bill to dissolve parliament and hold new elections.",
      "\u201cIn your own words, you admitted that the prime minister\u2019s policy is not leading to a decisive outcome in Gaza, is not returning our hostages, and is not winning the war,\u201d Lapid said in a statement, according to the Times of Israel. \u201cYou also added that you can no longer stand behind the prime minister and back him up.\u201d",
      "The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting later Sunday to discuss Israel's proposed offensive, which has been condemned by Britain, France, Australia and other Western governments.",
      "James Kariuki, the U.K.'s deputy permanent representative to the U.N., called on Israel to reverse its decision, saying the plan \"will only deepen the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza.\"",
      "It comes amid a worsening hunger crisis in Gaza, where humanitarian aid has been limited since Israel lifted a two-and-a-half-month blockade in May.",
      "The Gaza Health Ministry said Sunday that five more people, including two children, had died from malnutrition and starvation in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 217, including 100 children.",
      "Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, said Thursday that at least 99 people in Gaza, including 29 children under age 5, have died from malnutrition this year, noting the real toll was most likely higher.",
      "The U.N. and other international organizations say the humanitarian aid arriving in Gaza through air drops and on a small number of trucks is far from sufficient to feed the enclave\u2019s population of 2 million people.",
      "On Saturday, a 14-year-old boy named Muhannad Eid died after being struck by an aid package that was airdropped over Gaza, his brother, Muhammad Eid, said.",
      "\u201cThis is an aerial humiliation, not aid,\u201d Eid said. \u201cWe need protection. We want international protection.\u201d",
      "With the latest death, 23 people have now been killed during airdrops since the Israel-Hamas war began 22 months ago, according to the Gaza government media office.",
      "\u201cWe have repeatedly warned of the danger of these inhumane methods and have repeatedly called for the safe and adequate entry of aid through land crossings,\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "According to local health officials, more than 61,000 Palestinians, including thousands of children, have been killed since the war began on Oct. 7, 2023, with Hamas\u2019s terrorist attack on Israel. During that attack, Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and abducted 251 others.",
      "Of the 50 hostages still being held by Hamas, Israel believes about 20 are alive. Hostage advocates and Netanyahu\u2019s own army chief have warned that expanded military operations could put their lives in danger.",
      "The plan, which Netanyahu\u2019s government announced Friday, outlines five goals for ending the war: disarming Hamas, returning all hostages, demilitarizing Gaza, taking security control of the area, and establishing \u201can alternative civil administration that is neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority.\u201d",
      "Those preparations are expected to take weeks or months, a delay that hardliners in the Israeli government fear could leave room for a diplomatic solution that would undermine their objectives.",
      "Experts have also questioned whether the plan would protect Israelis, or work at all.",
      "Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University\u2019s Dayan Center, said the plan was full of \u201chollow slogans.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is a very common slogan: \u2018We will release the hostages and defeat Hamas at the same time,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do both simultaneously. Hamas will execute them, or the IDF itself could in the bombing.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu said Sunday that his goal was to get the hostages out alive and recover the remains of those had had died.",
      "\"If we don't do anything, we are not going to get them out,\" he said. \"The move I'm talking about has the possibility of getting them out.\"",
      "There are also questions as to who would run Gaza long term. Netanyahu said he intends to hand control of the territory to \u201cArab forces,\u201d adding Sunday that \"several candidates\" are being looked at for the establishment of a new \"transitional authority.\"",
      "He has not specified who that could be, aside from saying it would not be Hamas or the Palestinian Authority.",
      "\u201cThat leaves nobody,\u201d said H.A. Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London. \u201cNo Arab country is going to be Israel\u2019s enforcer on the ground.\u201d"

      "The film, which debuts Aug. 22 and stars Margaret Qualley in the lead role, is the second installment of married couple Ethan Coen and Tricia Cooke\u2019s lesbian-centric trilogy. Last year\u2019s \u201cDrive-Away Dolls,\u201d a raunchy road-trip comedy starring Qualley, Geraldine Viswanathan and Beanie Feldstein, was the first.",
      "Early in her career, Cooke edited many of the films her husband directed with his brother, Joel (the renowned duo often simply referred to as the \u201cCoen Brothers\u201d), including \u201cThe Big Lebowski\u201d and \u201cO Brother, Where Art Thou?\u201d But for this film she joined her spouse in the writers\u2019 room. In addition to their films, their unique relationship has also made headlines: Cooke is a lesbian, Coen is straight, they share two children and have been in a platonic union for more than 30 years.",
      "Cooke said that in \u201cHoney Don\u2019t!\u201d which her husband directed, it was her mission to make lesbian protagonists visible within the noir genre.",
      "\u201cEthan and I are both big noir fans. It was a genre that made sense to us \u2014 in, like, a classic B-movie genre\u201d she told NBC News. But, she added, \u201cI couldn\u2019t think of any noir genre movies that were lesbian or queer-themed.\u201d",
      "Cooke was also inspired by the butch-femme dynamic and wanted to \u201cswitch the gender norms\u201d in \u201cHoney Don\u2019t!\u201d",
      "\u201cInstead of it being like the masculine male detective, it would be great if the very feminine character was the detective, and the more butch character was the femme fatale,\u201d she said of her initial thought process.",
      "Honey\u2019s wardrobe is largely feminine, though edgier fashion icons \u2014 like Lauren Bacall and Katharine Hepburn \u2014 served as inspiration for her wardrobe, Cooke said. Though the location of the story, a landlocked Southern California city, did present some sartorial limitations.",
      "\u201cHoney\u2019s a detective in Bakersfield, so she couldn\u2019t look that good. She couldn\u2019t look that styled because we wanted her to feel realistic,\u201d Cooke added.",
      "The main character also uses her feminine wiles, charisma and flowery dresses to disarm her opponents and catch them off guard to her benefit, so she can hit them hard with her sharp investigative skills. Her charm proves successful in getting information from those ranging from a slimy megachurch reverend (Evans) to a deadpan cop with whom she shares a steamy romance (Aubrey Plaza).",
      "Cooke revealed that Plaza\u2019s character, MG Falcone, was initially intended to be more masculine but was reworked to better fit Plaza\u2019s casting. Honey, Cooke added, was inspired by a friend of hers who once managed a sex shop.",
      "Similarly to \u201cDrive-Away Dolls,\u201d \u201cHoney Don\u2019t!\u201d embraces women\u2019s sexuality. Honey and MG share a vibrant chemistry, or, as Cooke refers to it, \u201ca classic femme-butch attraction.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe definitely wanted it to feel sexy. We wanted there to be a lot of sex in the movie. Everyone has it,\u201d she said.",
      "While \u201ceveryone has it,\u201d the tone is different across the narrative. Cooke said the reverend\u2019s sex scenes were meant to be a bit ridiculous, while the scenes between Honey and MG were intended to be sexy, with the first of their steamy scenes inspired by \u201cBasic Instinct.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe wanted them to feel sexual tension from the beginning, like it was a big spark in both of their lives,\u201d Cooke said. \u201cWe just tried to write things that felt like, \u2018OK, this makes sense. They\u2019re really into each other.\u2019\u201d",
      "As for the film\u2019s location, Cooke, who was raised in Southern California, said she and Coen wanted to deviate from the typically grim environments of noir films and use the backdrop of sun-drenched Bakersfield.",
      "\u201cWe thought visually it would be interesting. Also, there\u2019s a bit of a bleakness \u2014 not to the city, but just the landscape there \u2014 that felt right for that type of story,\u201d she said.",
      "But while the film\u2019s opening was actually shot in Bakersfield, most of the film was shot in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where the Coen Brothers shot \u201cTrue Grit\u201d and \u201cNo Country for Old Men.\u201d Cooke noted that some of Albuquerque\u2019s background terrain, such as its mountains, had to be edited out.",
      "With \u201cHoney Don\u2019t\u201d about to hit theaters, Cooke and Coen are now working on the final installment of their sapphic trilogy: \u201cGo Beavers.\u201d Cooke said the script is in its early stages and is about \u201ca crew team who gets together for their reunion, and they start dying off one by one.\u201d However, Cooke noted, she\u2019s not a fan of horror and is hoping to steer the story in a different direction, one that is specifically inspired by the 1971 Australian outback survival film \u201cWalkabout.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat film is whoa, psychedelic. What is life?\u201d Cooke said. \u201cIt has a little more depth, so we\u2019re thinking about taking it in that direction.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Sen. Lindsey Graham said in an interview on NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" that Russia and Ukraine would have to swap some territory to end the war, echoing President Donald Trump's comments about land exchanges.",
      "\"I want to be honest with you, Ukraine is not going to evict every Russian, and Russia is not going to Kyiv, so there will be some land swaps at the end,\" Graham, R-S.C., said during Sunday's interview.",
      "That idea has been a non-starter for Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday that Ukraine would \"not give their land to occupiers.\" His comments came after Trump said on Friday that \u201cthere\u2019ll be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both.\u201d",
      "Graham said land exchanges would only happen \"after you have security guarantees to Ukraine to prevent Russia from doing this again.\"",
      "\"You need to tell Putin what happens if he does it a third time,\" Graham said, referring to Russia annexing Crimea in 2014 in addition to Russia's 2022 invasion.",
      "Asked during the interview whether it was the right move for Trump to hold a summit with Russia's President Vladimir Putin in Alaska this Friday in an attempt to broker a ceasefire agreement, Graham said he was \"very okay\" with the meeting, later adding that he hoped Zelenskyy could be involved.",
      "\"You can't end a war without talking. I do hope that Zelenskyy can be part of the process. I'll leave that up to the White House,\" he said.",
      "NBC News previously reported that the White House was considering inviting Zelenskyy. Asked on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d whether Zelenskyy might attend the Alaska summit, U.S. ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker said, \u201cI certainly think it\u2019s possible.\u201d",
      "\u201cCertainly there can\u2019t be a deal that everybody that\u2019s involved in it doesn\u2019t agree to,\u201d Whitaker said on Sunday.",
      "Oksana Markarova, the Ukrainian ambassador to the U.S., said on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" that Zelenskyy would be willing to travel to Alaska.",
      "\"We have shown that he is ready to be anywhere to advance the agenda of peace,\" Markarova said. \"So if needed, President Zelenskyy of course will be present at the meetings.\"",
      "Graham's comments on land swaps are a shift from his previous position. In 2023, he said in a statement that \"The Ukrainians understand you don\u2019t end wars by giving territory to the aggressor.\" The senator also warned at the time that if Putin was not stopped in Ukraine, \"he will keep going,\" increasing the chance that NATO could be drawn into a war.",
      "Asked on Sunday about those comments, Graham pointed to what he believed should be done to deter Russia from invading Ukraine a third time. He said the U.S. and allies should continue arming Ukraine, put some European forces on the ground, and build up \"economic integration.\"",
      "If Putin were to invade Ukraine again, he would \"be fighting more than just Ukraine, having some European forces on the ground as trip wires,\" Graham said.",
      "He also pointed to the split of Germany's capital after World War II into East and West Berlin and later reunification, noting that the city \"existed divided for a very long time.\"",
      "Markarova on \"Face the Nation\" pushed back against the concept of \"buffer zones,\" calling it an \"outdated, old\" idea. She referred to the frontlines of the war as \"the frontline between evil and good,\" saying that the question is whether that boundary would be on Ukraine's borders or in Europe.",
      "NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in an interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that Ukraine must be involved in moves to end the war.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s hope that Friday will be an important step in that process,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need Ukraine at the table. It will be about territory. It will be, of course, about security guarantees, but also about the absolute need to acknowledge that Ukraine decides on its own future.\u201d",

    "summary": "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker slammed President Donald Trump as a \"cheater\" and Texas Gov.",
    "story": [
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker slammed President Donald Trump as a \"cheater\" and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott as a \"joke\" days after welcoming Texas Democrats who fled their state in protest of GOP-led redistricting efforts.",
      "\"Governor Abbott is the joke,\" Pritzker, a Democrat, told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in an interview that aired Sunday in response to Abbott calling Illinois\u2019 congressional map a \u201cjoke.\u201d",
      "\"He's the one who is attempting mid-decade here \u2014 at a time when, frankly, all of us are concerned about the future of democracy. He's literally helping whittle it away and licking the boots of his leader, Donald Trump,\" Pritzker added.",
      "Pritzker also defended himself against allegations that Illinois' congressional map is gerrymandered. Trump won 44% of the statewide vote in 2024 but Republicans hold only three of the state's 17 House districts.",
      "\"We held public hearings, legislative hearings. People attended them. They spoke out. There was a map that was put out. There were actually changes made to the map. And a map was passed, and it was done at the end of the census, the decennial census. So that's how it's done in this country,\" Pritzker said.",
      "He went on to say, \"This is \u2014 it's cheating. Donald Trump is a cheater. He cheats on his wives, he cheats at golf, and now he's trying to cheat the American people out of their votes.\"",
      "Democratic state legislators from Texas have been huddling in Illinois and other blue states after leaving the state to deny GOP leaders a quorum in the state House. Republicans have repeatedly attempted to move forward with their legislative plans, but have fallen short of the 100 people necessary for a quorum.",
      "Abbott and his Republican allies late last month unveiled plans to draw new congressional district lines in the state that could guarantee their party up to five additional safe Republican seats in Congress. The process of redrawing district lines traditionally happens only once a decade, after the decennial census is conducted.",
      "Abbott has clashed with Democrats in the Legislature in the past and GOP leaders in Texas have threatened the Democratic legislators with suspension of pay and civil arrests if they don\u2019t return to the statehouse.",
      "\u201cDemocrats act like they\u2019re not going to come back as long as this is an issue. That means they\u2019re not going to come back until like 2027 or 2028, because I\u2019m going to call special session after special session after special session with the same agenda items on there,\u201d Abbott told NBC News in an interview Thursday.",
      "On Sunday, Abbott reiterated that point, telling \"Fox News Sunday,\" \"This could literally last years, because in Texas, I\u2019m authorized to call a special session every 30 days. It lasts 30 days. And as soon as this one is over, I\u2019m going to call another one, then another one, then another one, then another one.\"",
      "Abbott also warned Democrats that they would be arrested if they came back to Texas.",
      "\"If they show back up in the state of Texas, they will be arrested and taken to the Capitol,\" he said. \"If they want to evade that arrest, they\u2019re going to just stay outside of the state of Texas for literally years.\"",
      "Trump has defended Abbott and Texas Republicans' efforts to draw new maps that favor the GOP, telling CNBC's Squawk Box last week, \"We have an opportunity in Texas to pick up five seats. We have a really good governor, and we have good people in Texas. And I won Texas.\"",
      "\u201cI got the highest vote in the history of Texas, as you probably know, and we are entitled to five more seats,\" he added.",
      "On Sunday, former Attorney General Eric Holder, who has fought gerrymandered state congressional maps as the head of National Democratic Redistricting Committee, also spoke to \"Meet the Press\" about Texas' redistricting plan and California Gov. Gavin Newsom's proposal for his state to respond in kind.",
      "\"What I've said is that we have to protect our democracy now if we ultimately want to be able to save it,\" Holder said Sunday. \"And so taking the reasonable steps that have been proposed in in California, I think it makes a great deal of sense in this moment, a temporary way in which to respond to that which is happening in Texas, with the thought that after this crisis has passed, we get back to the fight against gerrymandering by anybody.\"",
      "Holder stressed his opinion that any forthcoming Democratic gerrymandering should be a response to Texas, not a permanent way to draw district lines.",
      "\"If Texas had not moved in the way that they appear to be doing, California would would not be doing what they're doing,\" Holder said. \"What Democrats are doing is is responsive and is temporary.\"",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, also addressed her party's effort to redraw the state's congressional map in response to Texas' move in an interview on \"Fox News Sunday.\"",
      "\"These times call for fighting fire with fire,\" Hochul said. \"We didn\u2019t ask for this fight. I\u2019m busy governing the state of New York focusing on public safety and affordability. Why are we here today? Because Donald Trump looked at the polls for next year.\"",
      "Hochul said state Democrats would put forth an amendment to New York's constitution in order to redraw the state congressional map before the next U.S. census is completed, which would need approval from voters.",
      "\"We can put it to the people,\" Hochul said. \"But I think the people of this state, after what they\u2019re seeing when there\u2019s one party domination in Washington, and how our costs are going up, we\u2019re losing jobs and people are suffering, they\u2019re going to want us to use every tool in the arsenal to fight back, and that\u2019s what I intend to do.\"",
      "During the \"Meet the Press\" interview, Pritzker also responded to reports that the FBI granted a request from Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who is running for re-election in 2026, to help track down the Democratic state legislators who fled Texas.",
      "\"There's no federal law that would allow the FBI to arrest anybody that's here visiting our state,\" Pritzker said. \"So it's a lot of grandstanding. That's what this is all about.\"",
      "Pritzger was also asked about the war in Gaza and a Senate resolution this week to block arms sales to Israel amid the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.",
      "\"I think that the resolution that was put up in the United States Senate was an effort to send a message. And it\u2019s the right kind of a message, which is that Israel needs to make sure that the food assistance that ought to go to innocent Palestinians should arrive there,\" he said. \"And they should do everything in their power to prevent the starvation that I think we\u2019ve all seen.\""

      "About 1,400 Palestinians have been killed while seeking food aid, mostly at the hands of the Israeli military, the U.N. says. The Israeli military says it does not target civilians.",

    "story": [
      "News of Abdul Niazi\u2019s death arrived in a chilling phone call.",
      "It was March 26, nearly the end of Ramadan, and his wife wanted to know when to expect her husband, a former U.S. military interpreter who lost both legs in a bomb blast in Afghanistan and became one of Houston\u2019s most well-known advocates for new Afghan migrants.",
      "It was almost time to break the day\u2019s fast, recalled Niazi\u2019s cousin, but he hadn\u2019t returned home. So she called his cellphone.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not your husband,\u201d the man on the other end of the line said, according to Rizwanullah Niazi, Niazi\u2019s cousin. \u201cI killed your husband.\u201d",
      "The shock of that call intensified when his family learned what authorities later alleged in bail documents filed in Harris County District Court: An Afghan national who\u2019d sought help from Niazi was accused of stabbing him more than a dozen times over frustration with the slow pace of the U.S. immigration system.",
      "The 34-year-old\u2019s death left the Marines he served with reeling and a hole in Houston\u2019s sizable Afghan community.",
      "\u201cI still don\u2019t believe that he is not with us anymore,\u201d said Nisar Momand, who met Niazi more than a decade ago and, like his friend, helps recently resettled Afghans obtain services and navigate the immigration bureaucracy.",
      "\u201cAbdul was like the backbone of the community,\u201d Momand said. \u201cWithout a backbone, we are totally disabled.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an unspeakable tragedy,\u201d said Brandon Remington, a former U.S. Marine Corps platoon commander who worked with Niazi in Afghanistan and helped him flee to the United States amid death threats from the Taliban. \u201cGiven how much he escaped death and to die in that way \u2014 it\u2019s insane. It feels like the universe is crazy.\u201d",
      "Masiullah Sahil, 37, is accused of first-degree murder in Niazi\u2019s death and, until last month, was being held in lieu of $750,000 bond. After prosecutors failed to indict him within three months, as Texas law requires, a judge ordered him released on a personal recognizance bond that required no payment, court records show.",
      "\u201cIt just didn\u2019t get done,\u201d a prosecutor said during a July 10 hearing about the failure to obtain that indictment, according to NBC affiliate KPRC of Houston.",
      "Sahil remains jailed, however. The same day Harris County District Court Judge Emily Detoto ordered him released, the district attorney\u2019s office filed a witness tampering charge. He\u2019s being held on $25,000 bond, jail records show. Sahil is scheduled to be arraigned on both charges Aug. 12.",
      "Still, the prosecution\u2019s apparent failure infuriated Niazi\u2019s friends and family, who are calling for an investigation into the district attorney\u2019s office.",
      "\u201cWhat if he\u2019d gotten out and came and killed his wife and kids?\u201d said Niazi\u2019s close friend Mohammad Bayan, referring to Niazi\u2019s family. \u201cI was completely heartbroken and outraged.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Harris County District Attorney\u2019s Office said the situation is under review with prosecutors assigned to the case. Sahil\u2019s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "A fearless interpreter",
      "Niazi was raised in Jalalabad, east of Kabul, and worked as an English teacher before he got a job as a translator with the U.S. Marines in Afghanistan in 2011, said Rizwanullah Niazi, a cousin who also worked as a military translator.",
      "Michael Egan, a Marine who led a unit that Abdul Niazi was attached to for several months in Helmand province, described him as one of the best combat interpreters he worked with \u2014 always levelheaded and alert, comfortable in potentially lethal situations and driven by a desire to protect his home.",
      "\u201cHe was one of the more courageous and fearless people out there,\u201d said Egan, 36. \u201cYou knew if Niazi was with you, you were set.\u201d",
      "That mission ended in May 2012, during what Egan described as a routine foot patrol through a village. Egan stepped on an improvised explosive device and instantly lost both legs.",
      "Minutes later, as Marines desperately tried to stabilize Egan, he said he heard another blast.",
      "Niazi had been ordered to take cover, and when he did, there was a second detonation, said Remington, the former platoon commander, citing an after-action report.",
      "\u201cIt was complete and utter chaos,\u201d Egan said.",
      "Niazi was severely wounded. He lost both legs and suffered so much damage to one arm that it would be difficult for him to use a manual wheelchair in the future, Egan said.",
      "A new life in Houston",
      "Niazi underwent months of surgery in India before he returned to Afghanistan, Rizwanullah Niazi said. While there, he started receiving letters from the Taliban threatening his family, said Remington, who by then was attending law school in the United States.",
      "Remington said he helped Niazi apply for a special immigrant visa, designated for people who assisted the U.S. military in Iraq and Afghanistan. Niazi obtained that visa a little over a decade ago and moved to Houston, Remington recalled.",
      "He was one of the thousands of Afghans who worked with the U.S. military and relocated to Texas in the years that followed the U.S. invasion. According to U.S. State Department data, nearly 20,000 Afghans with special visas moved to the state between 2012 and 2023, with a sharp rise after the United States military left the country in 2021.",
      "When Momand first met Niazi at a local clinic in 2014, he wasn\u2019t sure how his countryman would fare in the United States.",
      "\u201cHow will he survive in this country with no legs, with a disability and a wheelchair?\u201d he recalled wondering.",
      "Initially, Niazi worked as a sales clerk at a cellphone store, said  Bayan, who became best friends with Niazi after he settled in Houston. He eventually had five children \u2014 four boys and one girl, the oldest of whom is 10, Bayan said.",
      "He started working for a nonprofit that provided assistance to refugees, Bayan said, and the pair attended college together, earning bachelor\u2019s degrees in business administration from the University of Houston and enrolling in an online master\u2019s program for national security policy at Liberty University in Virginia.",
      "Their goal, Bayan said, was to obtain Ph.D.s and return to Afghanistan to help improve the country\u2019s national security. After the nonprofit Niazi worked for shuttered last year, Bayan said, Niazi established his own business providing services to recent transplants and quickly amassed hundreds of clients.",
      "\u201cPay me when you can\u201d was Niazi\u2019s business model, Bayan said. When he reminded his friend that he had rent and two assistants to pay, Bayan recalled Niazi responding: \u201cAll these refugee families, they\u2019re struggling, and it\u2019s hard for me to ask them for money. Whenever they give it to me, I will accept it.\u201d",
      "An argument and a fatal stabbing",
      "One of those people was Sahil, Bayan said.",
      "Bayan knew Sahil before he went to see Niazi. He said Sahil had sought help from him and others to get the necessary documentation to return to Afghanistan. Bayan said Niazi told him that Sahil kept calling and visiting, wanting to know how to get back to his home country as soon as possible.",
      "But the documentation Sahil needed was \u201cnot in my hands,\u201d Bayan recalled Niazi saying.",
      "A client found Niazi dead in his office on March 26. Sahil was seen on video coming and going from the office several times before he was captured leaving with blood on his clothes, according to the bail document.",
      "When authorities found Sahil, he had Niazi\u2019s phone and said that he\u2019d been frustrated with how long it was taking for his refugee status to be approved, according to the document. He admitted to arguing with Niazi, then getting a knife from his car and repeatedly striking him with it.",
      "Niazi\u2019s body was found with 20 deep stab wounds and lacerations, according to the document.",
      "After Niazi\u2019s wife learned of his death through the phone call, Bayan said, the suspect continued calling her. She was screaming and crying, recalled Bayan, who by that point had gone to his friend\u2019s home.",
      "Amid the swirl of grief and confusion, Bayan said he asked for her phone.",
      "Then, he said, he called the man back and asked him about what he had done. After a few vague answers, Bayan said, the man told him Niazi \u201cwas not listening to me.\u201d",
      "Immediately after that call, Bayan said, he and a relative of Niazi\u2019s reported what they learned to authorities.",
      "If he could question the suspect again, Bayan said he\u2019d ask him a simple question: \u201cIs it worth taking an innocent life over immigration paperwork?\u201d"

      "Longoria is also a minority investor in the club. This isn\u2019t the first time she has backed an underdog; she's credited with stepping up to save the first movie of the popular neo-noir revenge franchise \u201cJohn Wick\u201d with a last-minute investment of $6 million just over a decade ago."

    "story": [
      "Your 401(k) options could change soon. President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday to clear the way for Americans to invest their retirement savings in private equity, cryptocurrency, real estate and other alternative assets.",
      "It\u2019s a big win for the asset industry \u2014 giving financial managers access to some of the $12.2 trillion in Americans\u2019 401(k) and related retirement plans. Private assets can also be more lucrative, and the Trump administration said they can give retirement savers more opportunities.",
      "\u201cThe theoretical benefits are that everyday Americans can invest in a broader menu of companies,\u201d said Robert Brokamp, a financial planning expert at stock market research company The Motley Fool.",
      "But there are higher risks \u2014 and not necessarily higher rewards. Critics say it could put people in danger of losing a huge chunk of their retirement savings.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot less transparency and liquidity in private markets,\u201d said Brokamp. \u201cThere\u2019s not as much information about the companies, and it could be hard to sell your investments \u2014 especially during a panic and many, many investors are trying to sell at the same time.\u201d",
      "Plus the fees are higher for private assets than for typical 401(k) investments like mutual funds and ETFs. Benjamin Schiffrin, director of securities policy at Better Markets, said target-date mutual funds holding stocks and bonds charge 0.3% \u2014 while private funds can charge 1% to 2% in management fees and up to 20% in performance fees, and interval funds charge 2% to 3%.",
      "Right now, private equity is technically allowed in retirement plans, but it\u2019s rare \u2014 though some companies like BlackRock are planning new offerings. There are ways people can invest in crypto through their 401(k)s, too, but it\u2019s also not common. And many 401(k) recordkeepers don\u2019t support private equity funds yet.",
      "The executive order could change that. It directs the Department of Labor to re-examine its guidance and clarify its position on alternative assets like private market investments, real estate interests and digital assets within 180 days. And it tells the Securities and Exchange Commission to consider ways to facilitate access to alternative assets for plans like 401(k)s.",
      "\u201cI think this is going to open the floodgates,\u201d said Schiffrin. \u201cI think up until now, you\u2019ve actually seen a lot of hesitancy on the part of 401(k) plan managers to go down the road of including private market assets like private equity and private credit, things like that in the 401(k) plans.\u201d",
      "Employers would have to decide to offer the plans \u2014 and experts anticipate many might be reluctant, as they could be held liable for losses. However, with updated guidance from the government, employers may feel more comfortable adding these alternative assets into their 401(k)s. Many experts say that might not be a good thing.",
      "SageMint Wealth managing partner Anh Tran, a certified financial planner and attorney, believes there\u2019s a real risk that some investors will be drawn in by the allure of potentially higher returns from alternative investments without having the full picture. She said she would not advise anyone to make this kind of investment unless they fully understand the risk of losing that money entirely.",
      "\u201cIt could be detrimental to less-informed investors whose only investment account is their 401(k),\u201d said Tran. \u201cWithout proper guardrails, such as limiting exposure to 5% to 10% of the portfolio, these investors could be exposed to unnecessary risk, misaligned expectations and potentially irreversible losses.\u201d",
      "Knut Rostad, co-founder and president of the nonprofit Institute for the Fiduciary Standard, also fears private assets in 401(k)s could put retirement savers at risk of big losses.",
      "\u201cI think in practice, there\u2019ll be many fiduciaries who ignore this directive because they understand precisely what will result from it,\u201d he said, referring to Trump\u2019s executive order. \u201cThe result will be a massive train wreck where many people are seriously hurt. Their retirement accounts will be annihilated.\u201d",
      "And cryptocurrencies come with their own dangers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not clear what, if any, protections investors are going to have when it comes to investing in crypto,\u201d said Better Markets\u2019 Schiffrin. \u201cSo that just is a whole separate category of risks that having crypto in 401(k)s opens up.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a trade organization for broker-dealers, investment banks and asset managers, cheered the announcement as a win for retirement savers.",
      "\u201cAs more U.S. companies choose to remain non-public, private markets have developed into a more robust asset class,\u201d Kenneth E. Bentsen Jr., president and CEO of SIFMA, said in a statement. \u201cAccess to such investments, however, has been limited primarily to institutional and high net worth investors.\u201d",
      "He continued: \u201cPolicy changes to expand access to private markets investments \u2014 appropriately tailored under ERISA and SEC rules \u2014 could serve to improve diversification, democratize access, and offer more investment choices to the benefit of everyday retirement savers.\u201d",
      "Experts believe it could take months to see any changes. For now, they say education and safeguards are key \u2014 especially for younger investors and people without access to professional financial advice.",
      "\u201cThere must be transparency, education and limits in place to prevent widespread harm,\u201d said Tran. \u201cOtherwise, we could be setting the stage for not only \ufb01nancial loss, but broader economic and social consequences.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Misha Brown was walking into his local Circle K gas station in Austin, Texas, when he says a teenage boy approached him and asked him to buy him \u201cFeel Free.\u201d When Brown said no, he said he believed the boy tried to grab his wallet.",
      "Brown, 37, recounted the story in a TikTok last month that has over 23 million views.",
      "When he went into the store and told the attendant about the teen, she pointed to Feel Free \u2014 an herbal drink sold in small, blue, shot-size bottles that claim to offer \u201crelaxation, productivity and focus\u201d \u2014 and told him that people were coming in around six times a day to purchase the product, he said in the video. \u201cIt\u2019s so addictive and people lose their minds,\u201d he recalled the attendant saying.",
      "Brown had never heard of Feel Free, but the video set off a wave of comments about the product. Young people were describing \u201cthese devastating experiences with these products,\u201d he told NBC News.",
      "Feel Free was launched by Botanic Tonics in 2020. Feel Free Classic contains kava root, which is touted for its relaxing effects, and kratom, a plant native to Southeast Asia that\u2019s known for its stimulant and opioid-like effects.",
      "It\u2019s the kratom in Feel Free that has experts and health officials concerned. The Food and Drug Administration declared kratom to be an opioid in 2018 and has taken steps to crack down on products related to it. Kratom is not federally regulated, though five states \u2014 Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Rhode Island and Wisconsin \u2014 have banned it, according to a report from the Congressional Research Service.",
      "Kratom \u201cis concerning to me,\u201d said Dr. Robert Levy, an addiction medicine expert and an associate professor of family medicine and community health at the University of Minnesota Medical School. \u201cI\u2019ve seen [kratom addiction] and treated it many times,\u201d Levy said.",
      "John, of Columbia, South Carolina, has also shared videos on TikTok about Feel Free. The 35-year-old, who previously struggled with an addiction to heroin and meth, had been eight years sober when he learned about the drink. At the time, John, who asked that his last name be withheld for privacy, said \u201ceverything just started to go bad\u201d in his life, including losing his job at Aldi. After trying a sample of Feel Free from a sales representative at a local herbal store in early 2024, he said, he was hooked.",
      "\u201cI tried it and I liked it a lot,\u201d John said. \u201cIt made me feel warm. \u2026 It gave me good energy and I loved it.\u201d",
      "Within eight months, John said he was drinking almost a case of Feel Free Classic bottles a day. To fuel his addiction, he started delivering for DoorDash, emptied all $8,000 out of his 401(k), and sold his PlayStation 5, gaming laptop and \u201ceverything I had,\u201d he said. When his money ran out, he resorted to stealing. He estimates that he spent around $30,000 in total.",
      "\u201cI was doing anything I could,\u201d John said. \u201cIt turned me into someone that I am not.\u201d",
      "John and Brown aren\u2019t the only ones raising awareness about Feel Free. On Reddit, a group dedicated to quitting Feel Free has over 5,000 followers.",
      "\u201cBelieve me when I tell you, you need to run away as fast as you can from this,\u201d one Reddit user posted.",
      "Botanic Tonics, the maker of Feel Free, agreed to pay $8.75 million to settle a 2023 class action lawsuit that claimed it failed to warn consumers about the risks of kratom and because it advertised the product as a safe replacement for alcohol. The company did not admit any wrongdoing but did change its label to include information that the product could be habit-forming and people who have a history of substance abuse should consider not consuming it.",
      "Botanic Tonics said in a statement to NBC News that \u201cfalse and misleading claims are being made about feel free on social media and are being perpetuated on news outlets.\u201d",
      "\u201cBotanic Tonics has sold over 129.7 million servings of feel free to date. We have received fewer than 1,000 consumer adverse event complaints total across all categories, with zero complaints involving severe addiction,\u201d the statement said, adding that this represents \u201can exceptionally low complaint rate that contradicts sensationalized social media anecdotes being reported as representative of our customer experience.\u201d",
      "What is kratom?",
      "Kratom, also known as Mitragyna speciosa, has been grown in Southeast Asia for centuries, said Oliver Grundmann, a clinical professor at the University of Florida College of Pharmacy. Grundmann said he first got involved in kratom research in 2016 at a time when the market for kratom products was \u201cmuch smaller.\u201d He soon discovered rising demand, which he attributed to kratom\u2019s stimulant, pain-relieving and possibly sedative effects.",
      "The FDA says that kratom is \u201cnot appropriate for use as a dietary supplement\u201d and that there\u2019s \u201cinadequate information to provide reasonable assurance that such ingredient does not present a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury.\u201d It\u2019s often used to self-treat conditions including anxiety, depression, pain, opioid use disorder and opioid withdrawal, the agency says.",
      "Continuous use of kratom has been linked to gastrointestinal issues, including nausea, vomiting, constipation and diarrhea, experts say. Larger amounts can also lead to elevated heart rate and sweating, Grundmann said. The Drug Enforcement Administration says that kratom users have experienced weight loss, insomnia, seizures and hallucinations. Chronic use is also associated with liver damage, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.",
      "Last month, the FDA recommended that the Justice Department classify 7-OH, one of the two main chemical compounds found in kratom, as an illicit substance due to its potency \u2014 a move that would restrict or prohibit access to 7-OH products. 7-OH is naturally occurring in kratom, but synthetic versions of the compound are also sold, usually in highly concentrated stand-alone forms. The FDA was focused on these synthetic, highly concentrated forms of 7-OH, not plant-based kratom. Feel Free contains plant-based kratom, not synthetic 7-OH, Botanic Tonics said in a statement.",
      "FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said 7-OH should be classified as a Schedule I substance alongside drugs like heroin, ecstasy and marijuana, meaning it has no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.",
      "In 2016, the Drug Enforcement Administration said it planned to classify the compounds in kratom, including 7-OH, as Schedule I drugs. It dropped those efforts after significant pushback from kratom advocates.",
      "Levy, the addiction medicine expert, said that compared to kratom, 7-OH is a \u201cmuch more powerful opioid,\u201d and products sold as \u201c7-OH\u201d are almost completely artificial.",
      "Marc Swogger, an associate professor in the department of psychiatry at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York, said kratom tends not to be addictive when taken in low doses, but that people may develop a tolerance and need to take more to feel the same effects. When people stop taking kratom, some may experience withdrawal.",
      "Is Feel Free safe?",
      "Feel Free comes in 2-ounce bottles, but a serving size is half of that. The label says that people should not drink more than 2 ounces within 24 hours. The label also warns that the product can become habit-forming and recommends that people who have a history of substance abuse consider not consuming the product.",
      "A recovering addict\u2019s brain can heal but never fully returns back to normal, Levy said, comparing it to someone in remission from cancer. A small bit of irritation, like a Feel Free drink, can trigger addiction to come back.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re playing with fire,\u201d Levy said. \u201cAs an addiction medicine doctor, I would never suggest that somebody consume that [Feel Free] that\u2019s in recovery.\u201d (He added he also wouldn\u2019t recommend it to anyone in general because it\u2019s not regulated.)",
      "Mac Haddow, a senior fellow in public policy for the American Kratom Association, said, \u201cWe\u2019re concerned about any product that has an addiction liability that is classified as causing serious adverse events.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe strongly support very tough regulations on kratom products,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are aware of the reports that people in the Feel Free space are reporting about addiction, as we have people in the kratom space.\u201d",
      "Utah has banned the sale of Feel Free products. \u201cState law prohibits the sale of any kratom product that is mixed with other ingredients in a way that alters its quality or strength to the extent that it could be harmful to consumers,\u201d said Caroline Hargraves, the public information officer for Utah\u2019s Department of Agriculture and Food.",
      "After trying to quit Feel Free multiple times, John began sharing videos of his intense withdrawal symptoms on TikTok. These included intense body tremors, sweating, difficulty breathing and foaming from the mouth, he said. In February, John\u2019s withdrawal was so bad that he was hospitalized. He said the only other drug in his system was marijuana. He was placed on a ventilator and later developed pneumonia, according to notes from the hospital staff when he was admitted that were reviewed by NBC News.",
      "\u201cThey thought I was going to die,\u201d John said.",
      "John said he posted his videos because \u201cI just want to try to help people and make a difference.\u201d",
      "Brown, who posted the TikTok talking about his experience at the gas station, said he is a former drinker.",
      "\u201cAddiction is something that affects a lot of people,\u201d he said. \u201cIf [Feel Free] is something that\u2019s just so easily attainable and is marketed as, like, an alcohol-free substitute or like an energy drink, I think that it\u2019s pretty dangerous.\u201d",
      "If you or someone you know is struggling with an alcohol, drug or other substance abuse problem, call the free and confidential helpline of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration at 1-800-662-HELP (1-800-662-4357), or visit findtreatment.gov."

    "story": [
      "A growing number of U.S. politicians are condemning a new British law that requires some websites and apps \u2014 including some based in the United States \u2014 to check the ages of users across the pond.",
      "A bipartisan group of members of Congress visited London recently to meet counterparts and air their concerns about the U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act, which went into effect July 25. Vice President JD Vance has been criticizing the law for months, as have privacy advocates who argue that the law infringes on free expression and disproportionately hurts vulnerable groups.",
      "Vance criticized the U.K. again on Friday, this time in person at the start of a visit to the country. Sitting alongside British Foreign Secretary David Lammy and speaking to reporters, Vance warned the U.K. against going down a \u201cvery dark path\u201d of online \u201ccensorship\u201d that he said was trod earlier by the Biden administration.",
      "The U.K. Online Safety Act is aimed at preventing children from accessing potentially harmful material online, and internet companies are now asking British users to verify their ages in a variety of ways, including with photos of their IDs, through a credit card provider or with selfies analyzed via age-check software.",
      "But the sweeping nature of the law has caught some Britons by surprise. They\u2019re being asked to prove their age not only for pornography websites but also before they can listen to songs with explicit lyrics or access message boards to discuss sensitive subjects. Reddit, for example, is restricting access to various pages including r/stopsmoking, r/STD and r/aljazeera.",
      "Reddit said in a post about its enforcement of the law that for people in the U.K., it was now verifying ages before they can \u201cview certain mature content.\u201d A spokesperson for the company said r/STD \u2014 a message board focused on questions of sexual health \u2014 is restricted because of explicit images. They said r/stopsmoking is restricted because it deals with harmful substances and that r/aljazeera \u2014 which is not affiliated with the news organization of the same name but deals with similar topics \u2014 is restricted because it depicts serious injury or violence.",
      "To get around the new law, the use of virtual private network software that can mask a person\u2019s location, also known as VPNs, has surged in the U.K.",
      "The primary argument of U.S. politicians who oppose the law is that they don\u2019t want American tech companies to have to comply, even if they\u2019re serving British customers.",
      "House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said he raised his objections with U.K. government officials during meetings in London at the end of July. In a statement after his return, he said the law and other European regulations \u201ccreate a serious chilling effect on free expression and threaten the First Amendment rights of American citizens and companies.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe absolutely need to protect children and keep harmful, illegal content off these platforms \u2014 but when governments or bureaucracies suppress speech in the name of safety or regulation, it sets a dangerous precedent that threatens the core of Western democratic values,\u201d Jordan said.",
      "The issue may come to a head in a couple of different venues. That could be the courts if any tech companies file lawsuits over the law, or it could come up in trade negotiations if President Donald Trump decides to press the issue with British politicians, although they say it\u2019s not open to debate in trade talks.",
      "Marc Andreessen, a venture capitalist and Meta board member with close ties to the Trump administration, recently called U.K. leaders to complain about the law, the Financial Times reported Friday. A spokesperson for Andreessen said the report was not true.",
      "The U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act is one of the most comprehensive national laws that any democracy has ever passed to try to curtail potentially harmful content online in the name of children. Parliament passed the law in 2023, and the government went through two years of writing detailed rules before putting the law into effect last month.",
      "The law is notable for a combination of reasons: the variety of content it applies to, the potential fines and the possible international reach.",
      "A wide array of content is at issue. While the \u201cprimary\u201d focus of the law is online material such as pornography and suicide, it also requires websites to age-gate content with bullying, serious violence, \u201cdangerous stunts\u201d and \u201cexposure to harmful substances.\u201d That has covered relatively mainstream services such as Spotify and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox gaming system.",
      "Companies that don\u2019t comply face potential fines of up to 10% of their global revenue, which for the biggest companies could be billions of dollars. The British regulator Ofcom, short for Office of Communications, says companies must use \u201chighly effective age assurance\u201d to restrict the riskiest types of content.",
      "And the U.K. has not been adamant that it won\u2019t allow international borders to stymie enforcement. Ofcom says it plans to apply the law to services with \u201ca significant number\u201d of U.K. users, services where U.K. users \u201care a target market\u201d and services that are \u201ccapable of being accessed\u201d by U.K. users with a \u201cmaterial risk of significant harm\u201d to such users.",
      "The law appears to retain strong support among the British public. About 69% said they supported the new rules in a YouGov poll taken after implementation began, and 46% said they supported it \u201cstrongly.\u201d But 52% said they do not think the law will be very effective at preventing minors from accessing pornography.",
      "The law was passed during a previous, Conservative-led government and took effect under the current, Labour-led government.",
      "But the far-right party Reform U.K. is pushing for a repeal of the law. Party leader Nigel Farage, a former member of Parliament, has called it \u201cstate suppression of genuine free speech,\u201d and his party is running high in polls.",
      "\u201cMillions of people have noticed that what they\u2019re getting on their feeds is different to what it was,\u201d Farage said at a recent news conference.",
      "Farage also met with visiting members of Congress last week, and the talks turned heated with Farage and Democrats exchanging insults, according to Politico, although the dispute appeared to be more about Trump\u2019s free speech restrictions than about the U.K. law.",
      "Most U.S.-based tech companies say they are complying with the new law. Microsoft said in a blog post that Xbox users in the U.K. would begin seeing notifications \u201cencouraging them to verify their age\u201d as a \u201cone-time process,\u201d with actual enforcement starting next year. If users don\u2019t comply, Microsoft warned, they\u2019ll lose access to social features of Xbox but will still be able to play games.",
      "Discord said it was implementing new default settings for all U.K. users, in effect treating everyone like a minor with heavy content filtering unless they verify that they\u2019re adults. Discord says users can choose to verify their age either with a face scan or an ID upload.",
      "Elon Musk\u2019s X has also restricted posts, including information about the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, according to the BBC. X and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "But a few services are not complying. The far-right social media site Gab, which allows white supremacist views and other extremist content, said in a notice on its website that it had received notices from Ofcom and, rather than comply, decided to block the entire U.K. from accessing its site. The company said in the notice: \u201cWe refuse to comply with this tyranny.\u201d",
      "Preston Byrne, a U.S. lawyer who specializes in technology issues, has said on X that he plans to file a lawsuit soon on behalf of an unnamed client seeking to quash possible enforcement of the British law within the United States.",
      "The subject has been simmering for months ahead of the law\u2019s implementation, and it came up in February when British Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited the White House.",
      "In an Oval Office meeting, a reporter asked Trump what he thought of the U.K. approach to free speech, and Trump tossed the question to Vance, who expressed concern.",
      "\u201cWe do have, of course, a special relationship with our friends in the U.K. and also with some of our European allies. But we also know that there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British \u2014 of course, what the British do in their own country is up to them \u2014 but also affect American technology companies and, by extension, American citizens,\u201d he said.",
      "Starmer defended his government\u2019s approach.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom, and it will last for a very, very long time. Certainly, we wouldn\u2019t want to reach across U.S. systems and we don\u2019t, and that\u2019s absolutely right,\u201d he said.",
      "British Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy later said the U.K. would not make any changes to the Online Safety Act as part of trade negotiations with the Trump administration.",
      "American privacy advocates are watching the debate play out with alarm, concerned that similar age verification laws \u2014 like new state laws targeting the Apple and Google app stores \u2014 would upend the internet closer to home.",
      "\u201cYoung people should be able to access information, speak to each other and to the world, play games, and express themselves online without the government making decisions about what speech is permissible,\u201d wrote Paige Collings, a senior speech and privacy activist at the San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation, in a blog post Tuesday."

      "How to shop for college dorm essentials",
      "Before you start dorm shopping, here are a few things to consider:",
      "Student discounts: While shopping, remember that many retailers offer student discounts and student memberships. For example, after proving that you\u2019re enrolled at a college through your school email address or student ID, you can create an Amazon Prime Student account, which offers benefits like fast shipping and exclusive prices on select products. Brands like Apple and others also offer student pricing, discounts and memberships.Storage Space: Dorm room space is limited, especially if you have a roommate. If you\u2019ve toured your future dorm room or know its dimensions, you can get a sense of what you can and cannot fit in your space. If you haven\u2019t gotten a chance to see your room yet, it may be better to wait to buy larger items like chairs and appliances. Flooring: This is a smaller detail, but knowing if your room is carpeted or has a hardwood floor can impact the products you buy. For example, certain vacuums work better on hard floors but might not be as effective on carpets. Roommates: We suggest coordinating with your roommate for items that will take up a considerable amount of shared space, including appliances like mini-fridges. You can also share items like kitchen appliances and storage solutions between yourselves to save space and money.Bed sizing: Dorm rooms typically use twin XL beds, slightly longer than a standard twin bed. Not all bedding retailers carry products in twin XL sizes, so you should always check which brands carry fitted sheets, flat sheets and other bedding to fit your dorm bed. Dorm rules: Some dorms and residence halls prohibit the use of certain appliances or electronics in a room. Before buying appliances like mini fridges or lamps, be sure to check the guidelines for your dorm or residence hall.",

      "\u201cMy knowledge and my understanding, my wisdom around relationships just wasn\u2019t vast,\u201d Justice said. \u201cSo, I\u2019m looking at my mom \u2014 and I\u2019m a Midwest guy \u2014 so, in my mind, I\u2019m thinking a wife, at that time, should cook, clean \u2014\u00a0traditional, you know?\u201d",

And then we start having issues.\u201d",
      "Justice recalled that Berry, who turns 59 on Aug. 14, proposed to him about five months after their first date. \u201cI said OK, but I don\u2019t know if my heart was really into it. But I didn\u2019t want to make her feel bad and say no,\u201d he said.",

      "More than 20 years after Disney released \u201cFreaky Friday,\u201d a remake of the 1976 film, Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis are back as Anna and Tess Coleman.",
      "In the sequel, which hit theaters Friday, Aug. 8, the mother-daughter duo have a new yet eerily similar set of problems on their hands.",
      "Anna now has a daughter of her own, Harper (Julia Butters), making Tess a grandma. In \"Freaky Friday,\" Tess getting remarried caused strain for the family and similarly, in the sequel, tension arises as Anna plans a wedding with a single dad whose daughter goes to Harper\u2019s school.",
      "The caveat? Anna's new fianc\u00e9, Eric (Manny Jacinto), is the father of Harper's arch nemesis, Lily (Sophia Hammons). And so, naturally, the attempt to form a family of four doesn't bode well for the high schoolers.",
      "What better way to understand another's point of view than a good, old fashioned body switch? This time around, however, four people swap bodies \u2014 Tess, Anna, Harper and Lily.",

      "Keep an eye out for these easter eggs in \"Freakier Friday.\"",
      "Warning: This post contains spoilers for \u201cFreakier Friday\u201d",
      "Like Mother, Like Daughter",
      "Despite Anna constantly telling her mom she's \"ruining my life\" in \"Freaky Friday,\" the adult character is more like Tess than she'd probably like to admit.",
      "The 2003 film begins with Tess trying several times to wake a reluctant Anna up for school. Similarly, the sequel opens with Anna attempting to wake her daughter, Harper, up. In the new movie, though, Harper is already up but snuck out to go surfing.",
      "Anna and Harper have a similarly tense mother-daughter relationship, while Tess is now the \u201ccool\u201d grandma.",
      "Dropping Harper off at school, Anna yells, \"Make good choices!\" an expression originally coined by Tess in the first film.",
      "An Oct. 3 Wedding",
      "Anna and Eric's wedding date in the film is Oct. 3, which is an iconic date for any \u201cMean Girls\u201d fans.",
      "In the 2004 movie, Lohan's character, Cady Heron is talking to her crush, Aaron Samuels, in math class. In the seemingly insignificant interaction, he asks her the date, and Cady's response has since served as a major quote from the film.",
      "\u201cOn October 3rd, he asked me what day it was,\u201d a voiceover of Lohan says in the film, giddy over her conversation with Aaron.",
      "Some now even deem Oct. 3 as \u201cMean Girls\u201d Day.",
      "The Earthquake Switches",
      "Just like in \"Freaky Friday,\" before the women swap bodies with one another in the sequel, they feel an earthquake. But when they observe the rest of the room, they appear to be the only ones who felt the shake.",
      "In \u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d Harper and Lily swap bodies with Anna and Tess, respectively. The teen girls \u2014 now in adult bodies as Lohan's and Curtis\u2019 characters \u2014 have a similar moment to the original film where they panic in a mirror at how \u201cold\u201d they look.",
      "Lohan and Curtis also recreate running into one another in an effort to switch back into their old bodies. But the teenagers \u2014 now Anna and Tess \u2014 tell the girls they tried that \"last time\" to no avail.",
      "A Nod to Meredith Blake From 'The Parent Trap'",
      "\u201cParent Trap\u201d fans will likely notice a familiar face in \u201cFreakier Friday\u201d: Elaine Hendrix, aka Meredith Blake.",
      "In the 1998 remake of \u201cThe Parent Trap,\u201d Lohan played twins Hallie and Annie. Hendrix portrayed Meredith, the unlikable fianc\u00e9 to the twins\u2019 dad.",
      "In \u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d Hendrix makes a cameo as Blake Kale, who works for a magazine featuring Anna\u2019s client, pop star Ella, who she manages at her record label job. In a nod to her \u201cParent Trap\u201d character, Hendrix addresses Anna as \u201cpuss,\u201d which she called the twins in the late \u201890s movie.",
      "\u2018Take Me Away,' Reprised",
      "In a big moment at the end of \"Freakier Friday,\" Anna has the chance to reclaim her rockstar days with the band Pink Slip, who fans were first introduced to in \u201cFreaky Friday.\u201d Though time has passed, the characters allude to Pink Slip becoming a popular rock band prior to Anna welcoming her daughter, Harper.",
      "While Harper is in her mother's body, the band reunites for Anna to perform a song she wrote.",
      "In the first film, Anna \u2014 while still in Tess\u2019 body \u2014 had to be on guitar backstage to cover for her mom being unable to play. In the sequel, Anna \u2014 now in Harper's body \u2014 has to cover for her daughter. This time, however, the mom and daughter share a sweet moment performing together.",
      "After the duet, the four characters fully understand one another enough to all switch back into their own bodies. After they do, Pink Slip \u2014 complete with Anna\u2019s former bandmates, Maddie (Christina Vidal) and Peg (Haley Hudson) \u2014 jam out to \u201cTake Me Away,\u201d which was made popular in the 2003 film.",
      "Bloopers in the Credits",
      "Similar to \"Freaky Friday,\" the credits for \"Freakier Friday\" feature a series of fun bloopers of the cast. The editing of the credits altogether appear to be a nod to the original film."

Donald Cragen until the character\u2019s retirement in Season 15. Meloni shared photos of himself with Hargitay and Florek on his Instagram page Aug. 2.",

      "What Is Happening With Benson and Stabler's Relationship?",
      "There are also lingering questions about Benson and Stabler\u2019s relationship status. While Meloni guest-starred last season in a scene to rough up a guy who approached Benson\u2019s son, one of Stabler\u2019s last big \u201cSVU\u201d moments with Benson happened when they almost kissed in her kitchen back in Season 24.",

So he\u2019s the one that came up with what the (symbols on the compass) stood for.\u201d",

      "\u201cYou know, you\u2019re the star by which you navigate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was kind of a fitting \u2014 we\u2019ve both been navigating turbulent seas, whether it\u2019s in the storytelling part of it or in the personal life part of the storytelling. I think the sense of navigation.\u201d",
      "Benson loaned the necklace to a victim\u2019s mother in the Season 25 finale, and it hasn\u2019t been seen since. (We think it\u2019s the right moment to bring that back \u2014 unless she has found her happiness with a certain bald-headed detective.)",
      "When Were Benson and Stabler Last on Screen Together?",
      "Hargitay and Meloni\u2019s characters last shared the screen in the most recent season of \u201cOrganized Crime\u201d in an episode Meloni wrote.",
      "Stabler spent part of the episode in a coma, and Meloni told TODAY.com in April that Benson was his character\u2019s \u201cicebreaker\u201d that could \u201calmost break through\u201d Stabler\u2019s coma.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s her voice that he hears,\u201d he said.",
      "Benson and Stabler also shared some uncharacteristically silly scenes, like when Stabler wanted to leave the hospital and told Benson she could help him out or \u201cjust stand there and watch me get naked.\u201d",
      "Meloni described that moment as \u201ca nod to the fans.\u201d",
      "It was also important for him to write the episode featuring Hargitay because he said he \u201cinevitably\u201d rewrites their characters\u2019 scenes.",
      "\u201cI thought it was a natural and correct evolution to get to gain greater insight into their engagements \u2014 maybe not where they\u2019re going and all that stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are bigger-ticket items. How they speak to each other, how they feel about each other.\u201d",
      "One thing is for certain: It\u2019s about time viewers get some answers about what\u2019s going on with these two. And we can only hope that Season 27 of \u201cSVU,\u201d which premieres Sept. 25 on NBC, will give us some."

      "Since its July 21 release, the television series, based on the novel by May Cobb, has evolved into a cultural moment, racking up over 11 million views on Netflix, per Deadline.",
      "On TikTok, thousands of viewers are sharing their thoughts on show\u2019s roller coaster of twists and soap-level drama.",
      "Where did all this buzz come from? Here\u2019s what to know about the show's appeal and the phenomenon it sparked.",
      "What is \u2018The Hunting Wives\u2019 about?",
      "Originally created for Starz, the erotic thriller was acquired by Netflix.",
      "\"The Hunting Wives\" follows PR exec Sophie O\u2019Neil (Brittany Snow) as she moves from Boston to East Texas with her architect husband Graham (Evan Jonigkeit). She immediately finds herself out of place in an inner circle of wealthy Southern housewives who call themselves the \"Hunting Wives.\"",
      "These women seemingly couldn't be more different from Sophie: Not only does the elite clique embrace gun culture, but also they also adopt an unabashed stay-at-home lifestyle that is foreign to her. When Sophie asks her new friends what they do for work, they emphasize that their job is to \u201cwife.\u201d",
      "Along with culture shock, Sophie grapples with her looming dark past through frequent flashbacks.",
      "Sophie eventually becomes enthralled by the group\u2019s queen bee, Margo Banks (Malin A\u030akerman), the wife of Graham\u2019s boss, Jed (Dermot Mulroney), an oil tycoon running for the governor of Texas. Margo takes Sophie under her wing, and their friendship quickly escalates into a steamy affair.",
      "A throughline of the show is its twisty murder plot. After local teenager Abby (Madison Wolfe) is found dead, Sophie finds herself inconveniently tangled in the mystery. As the town searches for the culprit, its residents cultivate messy love triangles and secret relationships on the side.",
      "Why has 'The Hunting Wives' become such a phenomenon?",
      "Part of the appeal of the \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d is that it goes there \u2014  all manner of daring places.",
      "Each character is shamelessly committed to making jaw-dropping decisions. Take, for example, Margo\u2019s affair with an 18-year-old high school student who also happens to be Abby\u2019s boyfriend. Or Sophie\u2019s decision to rashly secure a firearm, a choice that backfires after she blacks out on the night of Abby\u2019s death ... and her gun turns out to be the murder weapon.",
      "Then, of course, there are the show\u2019s multiple murders and frequent extramarital escapades.",
      "\u201cThe Hunting Wives\u2019 consistently prioritizes steamy scenes over sensible plotting or nuanced characters, juicy twists over deep emotions or big ideas. It might all be incredibly frustrating, if it were not also so wildly entertaining,\u201d The Hollywood Reporter writes of the show.",
      "The show\u2019s hype is not necessarily due to its quality: Some fans on Reddit point out, Margo\u2019s wig looks (perhaps purposefully) unrealistic, and there may be more than a few plot holes.",
      "Instead, the series\u2019 shock factor is what makes it bingeable.",
      "\u201cLook, it isn\u2019t Emmy award winning TV. The acting only ranges slightly fair. The characters are terrible people,\u201d one Reddit user writes. \u201cBut I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t sucked in from the very first episode.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverything has been said regarding it being the perfect summer sleazy schlockfest we all love,\u201d another adds.",
      "In addition to its wild plot twists, the show\u2019s depiction of Margo and Sophie\u2019s queer relationship has led to chatter.",
      "Them, an LGBTQ+ publication, writes that \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d might be \u201cthe gayest show of the year.\" Many fans have posted their reactions to Margo and Sophie\u2019s relationship, crediting the show's suggestive scenes for their sexual awakenings or awkward watch moments with family members.",
      "\u201cWith all of the attention the show is receiving, viewer reactions have proved feverish, with fans across party lines gamely questioning their sexuality after witnessing Margo\u2019s effects on Sophie,\u201d NBC Out writes of this phenomenon.",
      "Watchers also have also found themselves enthralled by the series\u2019 political message.",
      "\u201cWhen you first start watching the show, it\u2019s just a very fun, campy romp\u2026 It really feels like they are glamorizing this certain type of lifestyle. But, in actuality, it is such a scathing review of the hypocrisy of the nuclear family (and) God fearing Republicans,\u201d one reviewer theorizes on TikTok.",
      "\u201cPerhaps the show\u2019s most intriguing wrinkle involves incorporating just enough political references to feel like a satire of Southern-fried hypocrisy,\u201d Slate writes.",
      "This layer adds, for some, enough to turn the show from a beach read on screen to something a little deeper.",
      "However, not everyone is a fan \u2014 some criticize the show for being too vulgar or underdeveloped.",
      "But the show\u2019s blend of lustful romance, a messy murder plot and perhaps a bit of political humor is what has many fans knocking on Netflix\u2019s door for another salacious installment."

      "Deaths from starvation in Gaza have been on the rise after Israel launched a crippling blockade barring the entry of food and other vital supplies into the enclave in early March before ending its ceasefire with Hamas.",

      "Asked to address the rising death toll by NBC News on Wednesday, GHF said aid convoys belonging to the United Nations and other organizations in the past often passed near these locations and were regularly looted by large crowds.",
      "The Israeli military said in a statement Saturday that it allows GHF to \u201cdistribute aid to Gaza residents independently.\u201d It said that after \u201cincidents in which harm to civilians who arrived at distribution facilities was reported, thorough examinations were conducted\u201d and that \u201csystematic learning processes\u201d to improve the operational response are underway.",
      "Faced with mounting global outrage, Israel began tactical pauses in some parts of Gaza to allow more aid into the enclave late last month. It also began to allow countries to airdrop supplies into the territory, although aid groups have criticized this method of delivery.",

      "Aid groups have also pointed out that the drops can only provide a fraction of what is required for Gaza\u2019s population of around 2 million people as the hunger crisis continues to spiral and much of the enclave plunge into famine conditions.",

      "Israel has maintained there is no starvation in Gaza and that the situation on the ground is being exaggerated, almost 22 months after it launched its offensive following the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attacks in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Since then, more than 61,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in the enclave, while much of the territory has been destroyed.",
      "Foreign journalists have been banned from entering Gaza independently since Israel launched its offensive. Traveling on aid flights has become one of the few ways of witnessing the destruction in the territory firsthand."

    "published": "Sat, 09 Aug 2025 16:48:36 GMT",
    "summary": "Donald Trump's meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska to discuss the Ukraine war is one of the biggest gambits of his second term.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 An unkept promise of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency is that he\u2019d end the war between Russia and Ukraine in one swift diplomatic masterstroke.",
      "Trump made threats. He applied pressure. Still, the bombs keep falling, the casualties continue to pile up.",
      "Now, Trump is betting that a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin will yield the elusive breakthrough and possibly quell concerns among voters about his handling of the war.",
      "The summit taking place Friday on friendly turf, the red state of Alaska, amounts to one of the biggest gambits of Trump\u2019s second term. Hosting the meeting raises expectations that he\u2019ll stop the fighting. The president faces traps in sitting down with Putin, who is well-versed in the territorial issues at stake, but he also enjoys economic and military leverage. Creating a durable peace that will preserve Ukraine\u2019s independence will test the dealmaking skills that are Trump\u2019s point of pride.",
      "\u201cIf you roll into the meeting not prepped, you can get jammed by Putin,\u201d said Michael McFaul, who was U.S. ambassador to Russia in the Obama administration. \u201cSummits are to achieve an objective that advances American national interests. They\u2019re the means to end, and I sometimes feel that Trump feels the meeting is an end in itself.\u201d",
      "Inside the Trump administration, a national security official acknowledged that forging a peace accord won\u2019t be easy. One of the combatants won\u2019t be at the table: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has refused to relinquish territory to Russia that was illegally annexed.",
      "\u201cWhether or not there\u2019s a breakthrough in the next week or two, we\u2019ll find out,\u201d said the Trump administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cUltimately, Putin and Zelenskyy have to be able to agree on something fundamentally. Third parties can do anything they want, but these two men have to agree to things.\u201d",
      "Sitting in a room with Putin, a canny negotiator in his own right, Trump may be lured into endorsing a peace deal that carves up Ukraine, foreign policy experts caution.",
      "\u201cI worry that in the eagerness to look like a peacemaker, President Trump will say, \u2018Yeah, that sounds like a good idea to me,\u2019\u201d McFaul said. \u201cPutin will say, \u2018Donetsk [a city in eastern Ukraine] was always part of Russia.\u2019 And Trump will say, \u2018You\u2019re right about that.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cPutin is good at those stories,\u201d McFaul continued. \u201cHe knows his history, and he can be engaging in his narrative. That\u2019s what the president needs to be ready for and his team needs to get him ready for.\u201d",
      "Another possibility is that Putin tries to stall the president further, promising concessions he has no intention of making in hopes of consolidating gains on the battlefield, one former U.S. official said.",
      "Putin may try to \u201cdivert President Trump from Trump\u2019s goal of stopping the war and establishing a ceasefire by promising things later,\u201d said William Taylor, who was charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine during Trump\u2019s first term. \u201cThen, Putin continues to fight and continues to kill Ukrainians.\u201d",
      "No matter the outcome, Putin comes away with at least a symbolic victory: He\u2019s getting a large, bright stage at a time when he\u2019s an international pariah. Two years ago, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin, accusing him of war crimes involving the abduction of Ukrainian children. The warrant substantially limited potential locations for the two world leaders to meet.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump \u2014 just by going to a meeting with Putin, who for most of the democratic world is a rogue, imperialist dictator \u2014 is giving him legitimacy,\u201d McFaul said.",
      "The summit will inevitably invite comparisons to one held in Helsinki in 2018.",
      "At a joint news conference with Putin that year, Trump came off as eager to forge a personal connection after years of icy bilateral relations between the U.S. and Russia. Citing Putin\u2019s denial of interfering in the 2016 presidential race, Trump said at the time: \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason why it would be\u201d Russia that meddled in his victory over Hillary Clinton that year. (He later claimed he had misspoken, affirming that he believed the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Russian meddling had occurred but added that there \u201ccould be other people also\u201d who interfered in the 2016 election.)",
      "This time around, Trump is more seasoned and has grown impatient with Putin\u2019s conduct of the war. He has suggested that his wife, Melania Trump, has influenced his view of Putin, reminding him of the damage that Russia has inflicted on Ukraine.",
      "For his part, Putin is more diminished. As of this summer, Russian casualties were expected to hit 1 million. If he chooses, Trump could punish Russia for prolonging the war by slapping secondary sanctions on countries that purchase Russian energy, a step he has threatened to take.",
      "\u201cTrump is in a stronger position this time than in that first meeting,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIf President Trump goes into the meeting with Putin and exercises the political, military and economic leverage that he\u2019s got, there could be a ceasefire.\u201d",
      "Trump heads into the summit facing difficulties at home. His administration has struggled to stem the backlash from his base over the Jeffrey Epstein case. Last week, Trump fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics following a hiring report that showed weak job growth.",
      "A recent poll from the University of Massachusetts Amherst showed that Trump\u2019s approval rating was 38% \u2014 a 6-point drop from April.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s pretty close to the theoretical floor in this polarized era for approval ratings,\u201d said Alexander Theodoridis, director of the poll.",
      "Among Trump voters, support for his handling of the Russia-Ukraine war stood at 64% compared with other issues on which they approved of his performance by significantly higher margins, Theodoridis said. A total of 85% of Trump\u2019s 2024 voters approved of his performance on immigration issues; 78% favored his work on jobs; and 71% on tariffs.",
      "Statecraft is a proven way for presidents to improve their standing at home. A commander in chief enjoys far more latitude in shaping events in the foreign policy arena than when it comes to domestic affairs.",
      "The summit, said Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat who serves on the Foreign Relations Committee, \u201cwill change the subject in a positive way for Trump if he actually stands up to Putin and demands a just peace for Ukraine.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat would be a positive diversion,\u201d Coons added. \u201cBut it would be the worst of both worlds if it [the summit] is intended both to be a diversion from the domestic focus on things like tariffs and Epstein, and he fails to be strong.\u201d",
      "An added incentive for Trump to end the conflict could be an award that he seems to covet. His White House appears to be methodically building a case that he has earned the Nobel Peace Prize, drawing attention to various efforts to reduce tensions in global hot spots.",
      "Jan. 31 is the deadline for nominating candidates for the 2026 prize. The Nobel selection committee will announce the winner in October of that year.",
      "On Friday, Trump held a ceremony in the White House to mark a U.S.-brokered accord ending hostilities between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Questioned by reporters, the leaders of both countries touted Trump\u2019s candidacy for a prize that three other American presidents have won. Barack Obama was the most recent winner, in 2009.",
      "Still, the peace deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan would be merely an amuse-bouche compared with ending the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, a nuclear-armed power.",
      "\u201cPutin is clearly in a weaker position,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThis invasion of Ukraine has turned out to be a disaster for him. And Trump has the cards this time. He\u2019s got leverage, experience and confidence. He\u2019s eager to solve this problem and end the war. He sees that Putin is the problem. Putin is standing between him and the end of the war.\u201d"

      "At a press conference on Sunday, a defiant Netanyahu continued to deny there is starvation in Gaza and claimed the situation is being exaggerated. Netanyahu only conceded there was \u201cdeprivation\u201d in Gaza, but said \u201cno one in Gaza would have survived after two years of war\u201d if Israel was implementing a \u201cstarvation policy.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu went on to defend the new military offensive, saying Israel had \u201cno choice\u201d but to \u201cfinish the job\u201d and \u201cdefeat Hamas,\u201d while claiming that \"hundreds of aid trucks have gone into Gaza.\"",
      "But his critics on the left say his proposed new military offensive is likely to worsen the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and further endanger the hostages still being held by Hamas. Protests calling for an immediate ceasefire drew thousands of people Saturday night in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and other Israeli cities.",
      "And for some far-right members of Netanyahu\u2019s coalition government, the plan isn\u2019t tough enough.",
      "Foreign Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who has pushed for Israel to impose sovereignty over Gaza, called it a \u201cfoolish\u201d half-measure, saying in a video message Saturday night that he did not support it.",
      "Smotrich said the proposed offensive was intended to pressure Hamas into agreeing to a temporary ceasefire, and that instead Israel needed a \u201csharp, clear path\u201d to victory over Hamas.",
      "The dissatisfaction expressed by Smotrich, who said he had \u201clost faith\u201d in the prime minister, threatens to destabilize Netanyahu\u2019s fragile coalition.",
      "Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid seized on the opportunity, calling on Smotrich to join him in advancing a bill to dissolve parliament and hold new elections.",
      "\u201cIn your own words, you admitted that the prime minister\u2019s policy is not leading to a decisive outcome in Gaza, is not returning our hostages, and is not winning the war,\u201d Lapid said in a statement, according to the Times of Israel. \u201cYou also added that you can no longer stand behind the prime minister and back him up.\u201d",
      "The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting later Sunday to discuss Israel's proposed offensive, which has been condemned by Britain, France, Australia and other Western governments.",
      "James Kariuki, the U.K.'s deputy permanent representative to the U.N., called on Israel to reverse its decision, saying the plan \"will only deepen the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza.\"",
      "It comes amid a worsening hunger crisis in Gaza, where humanitarian aid has been limited since Israel lifted a two-and-a-half-month blockade in May.",
      "The Gaza Health Ministry said Sunday that five more people, including two children, had died from malnutrition and starvation in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 217, including 100 children.",
      "Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, said Thursday that at least 99 people in Gaza, including 29 children under age 5, have died from malnutrition this year, noting the real toll was most likely higher.",
      "The U.N. and other international organizations say the humanitarian aid arriving in Gaza through air drops and on a small number of trucks is far from sufficient to feed the enclave\u2019s population of 2 million people.",
      "On Saturday, a 14-year-old boy named Muhannad Eid died after being struck by an aid package that was airdropped over Gaza, his brother, Muhammad Eid, said.",
      "\u201cThis is an aerial humiliation, not aid,\u201d Eid said. \u201cWe need protection. We want international protection.\u201d",
      "With the latest death, 23 people have now been killed during airdrops since the Israel-Hamas war began 22 months ago, according to the Gaza government media office.",
      "\u201cWe have repeatedly warned of the danger of these inhumane methods and have repeatedly called for the safe and adequate entry of aid through land crossings,\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "According to local health officials, more than 61,000 Palestinians, including thousands of children, have been killed since the war began on Oct. 7, 2023, with Hamas\u2019s terrorist attack on Israel. During that attack, Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and abducted 251 others.",
      "Of the 50 hostages still being held by Hamas, Israel believes about 20 are alive. Hostage advocates and Netanyahu\u2019s own army chief have warned that expanded military operations could put their lives in danger.",
      "The plan, which Netanyahu\u2019s government announced Friday, outlines five goals for ending the war: disarming Hamas, returning all hostages, demilitarizing Gaza, taking security control of the area, and establishing \u201can alternative civil administration that is neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority.\u201d",
      "Those preparations are expected to take weeks or months, a delay that hardliners in the Israeli government fear could leave room for a diplomatic solution that would undermine their objectives.",
      "Experts have also questioned whether the plan would protect Israelis, or work at all.",

      "He has not specified who that could be, aside from saying it would not be Hamas or the Palestinian Authority.",
      "\u201cThat leaves nobody,\u201d said H.A. Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London. \u201cNo Arab country is going to be Israel\u2019s enforcer on the ground.\u201d"

      "Israel\u2019s plan to seize Gaza City and hand control of the enclave to unspecified \u201cArab forces\u201d has not only drawn condemnation by Western governments and aid agencies \u2014 some former officials and experts inside Israel say it would be unworkable.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his security cabinet voted early on Friday for a plan to capture the city in the north of the enclave, one of the few places inside the strip that the Israeli military does not control, while distributing aid to civilians outside combat zones.",
      "The five-point plan \u201cfor concluding the war\u201d calls for the disarming of Hamas, the return of all hostages and the demilitarization of the Gaza Strip, which would be under Israeli security control. It also proposes that a government is established in Gaza that involves neither Islamist militants from Hamas, who have ruled the enclave since 2007, or the Palestinian Authority, the more secular governing body that has overseen parts of the occupied West Bank since the mid-1990s and is internationally recognized.",
      "The basics of the plan are likely unfeasible because it relies on cooperation from Arab states that have explicitly said they will not do so under these terms, according to Giora Eiland, a retired Israeli major general and former head of the country\u2019s National Security Council.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know whether Netanyahu has any real basis to what he said, whether he has any communication with other countries about the future of Gaza,\u201d Eiland told NBC News in a telephone interview Friday. \u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid that his statement\u201d \u2014 about Arab nations being given control of Gaza \u2014 \u201chas no real, reliable basis behind it.\u201d",
      "Arab states such as Egypt and Jordan have \u201cclearly indicated time and again\u201d that a precondition for their involvement would be that the Palestinian Authority becomes a \u201cleading actor\u201d in Gaza\u2019s future governance, said Nimrod Goren, president of the Mitvim Institute, an Israeli think tank.",
      "Netanyahu had suggested earlier in the war that, rather than the Palestinian Authority or Hamas, he wanted Palestinian \u201cclans\u201d to take control of the enclave, and indeed he confirmed in June that Israel was arming such groups.",
      "But his hopes of these \u201cclans taking over Gaza haven\u2019t materialized, and aren\u2019t expected to,\u201d said Goren, who is also an executive board member at Diplomeds, or the Council for Mediterranean Diplomacy, a policy group based in the Netherlands.",
      "Ultimately, \u201cthe plan approved by the Israeli cabinet is damaging for Israel\u2019s national security and foreign policy. It is also unrealistic in terms of its end game,\u201d Goren added. All of this reinforces the \u201ccommon perception in Israel that Netanyahu is acting due to his own political needs, rather than the national good and concern for the Israeli hostages,\u201d he said.",
      "NBC News has contacted Netanyahu\u2019s office for a response to these criticisms.",
      "International outcry",
      "Israel\u2019s plan has been met with outcry internationally, with the United Nations and some Western governments warning it would lead to further catastrophe for Palestinians in Gaza, more than 61,000 of whom have been killed in the 22 months of war with Israel.",
      "Large parts of Gaza\u2019s population have been regularly displaced since Israel launched its offensive following the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attacks in which some 1,200 people were killed in Israel and around 250 taken hostage. Crippling aid restrictions in recent months have caused the spiraling hunger crisis in Gaza, the United Nations and aid groups have said.",
      "Voices inside Israel have been similarly alarmed by the plan, with the families of hostages and even Israel\u2019s own armed forces chief of staff, Eyal Zamir, warning it will lead to the deaths of the remaining captives inside the enclave.",
      "Aerial photographs this week showed the utter devastation in the enclave, while Israel\u2019s overhauled aid distribution plan has fueled more chaos and hunger.",
      "Eiland, the retired Israeli general, supports the war, like the majority of the country\u2019s population. Nevertheless, he said he disagreed with Netanyahu\u2019s plan because he thinks most of the hostages \u201cwill perish\u201d and the Israeli army would \u201csuffer many casualties.\u201d",
      "Even if Israel managed to somehow execute its plan, \u201cwe will not change anything in the approach of Hamas,\u201d Eiland added. \u201cOn the contrary, it will just give them justification to continuing their guerrilla war against us.\u201d"

      "Initially meant to strike a T-shaped bridge, the bomb veered instead toward an exhibition hall with a distinctive dome, which after the explosion was the only building still standing within a 1-mile radius.",
      "The blast unleashed a whirlwind of fire and force, incinerating thousands of people. Then came the radioactive black rain, which fell over the city, silently poisoning countless more.",
      "Teruko Yahata was 8 years old at the time.",

      "The increase in spending on nuclear weapons contrasts with public attitudes about them. In a June survey of Americans by the Pew Research Center, 69% of respondents said the development of nuclear weapons had made the world less safe, compared with 10% who said it had made the world safer.",

      "The U.S. and India\u2019s blossoming friendship is at risk of fracturing, observers have warned, as President Donald Trump threatens to substantially increase tariffs on Indian goods over its purchases of Russian oil.",
      "At the start of the year, India seemed to be one of the countries most likely to win Trump\u2019s favor, given its growing role as an Asian counterweight to China and Trump\u2019s close relationship with its leader, Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",
      "But U.S. relations with India have instead come under strain over trade and other issues. Trump has threatened Apple and other companies that manufacture in India; moved closer to its biggest rival, Pakistan; and mocked India\u2019s \u201cdead\u201d economy.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s threatening to undo, or at least hit pause on, what has been two decades of steadily improving relations between India and the U.S.,\u201d said Dhruva Jaishankar, executive director of the Observer Research Foundation America, a nonprofit group in Washington.",
      "On Monday, citing India\u2019s \u201cmassive\u201d purchases of Russian oil, Trump said he would \u201csubstantially\u201d increase the U.S. tariff on Indian imports, which is already one of the highest among Asian countries at 25%. Along with China, India is a top purchaser of Russian crude oil sanctioned by Western governments after Moscow\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",
      "In a sharp response, India, a major U.S. security partner, said such criticism was \u201cunjustified and unreasonable\u201d and that it bought Russian oil with U.S. support.",
      "\u201cIndia began importing from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the conflict,\u201d the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement Monday. \u201cThe United States at that time actively encouraged such imports by India for strengthening global energy markets stability.\u201d",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "U.S.-India tensions are mounting domestic political pressure on Modi, with opponents accusing him of failing to stand up to his \u201cdear friend\u201d Trump.",

      "The bonhomie did not last long. Since then, Trump has needled India over a number of issues, including billions in investment by American companies as they shift manufacturing from China.",
      "Last quarter, India produced 44% of U.S. smartphone imports, more than any other country, including China, according to data from the research firm Canalys. That includes iPhones sold in the U.S., the majority of which Apple chief executive Tim Cook says will have India as their country of origin starting this quarter.",

      "A terrorist attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir that killed 26 people in April is another source of friction in U.S.-India relations.",
      "India responded by bombing neighboring Pakistan, which it has long accused of harboring terrorists, resulting in a four-day conflict that threatened to explode into a broader war fueled by decades of tensions between the two nuclear-armed countries.",

      "\u201cThat has not gone down very well with Trump,\u201d he said.",
      "Within weeks, Trump hosted Pakistan\u2019s powerful army chief at the White House in an unprecedented meeting. He has also imposed a lower tariff rate on Pakistan of 19% and said the U.S. had reached a deal with Pakistan on exploring its oil reserves.",
      "Squeezed over Russia",
      "As Trump has expressed growing frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin, he has turned his attention to India\u2019s relationship with Moscow.",
      "For years, New Delhi has benefited from its \u201cnonaligned\u201d foreign policy, which allowed India to strengthen U.S. ties while continuing its long-standing relationship with Russia, one of its main suppliers of energy and military equipment.",
      "When Russian oil was hit with Western-led sanctions over Ukraine, India \u2014 the third-largest energy consumer in the world after China and the U.S. \u2014 seized the opportunity to buy it at a discount, which even U.S. officials said helped stabilize global oil prices.",
      "\u201cThey bought Russian oil because we wanted somebody to buy Russian oil,\u201d Eric Garcetti, the U.S. ambassador to India under President Joe Biden, said at a conference last year. \u201cIt was actually the design of the policy, because as a commodity we didn\u2019t want oil prices going up.\u201d",
      "The U.S. position on India\u2019s oil purchases appears to have reversed under Trump, who said in a social media post last week that India and Russia \u201ccan take their dead economies down together.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are now at a stage where the American ability to control Russia and its allies is beginning to impact India,\u201d Palit said.",
      "Jaishankar said that while Trump\u2019s actions won\u2019t push India out of America\u2019s orbit, they could drive India to strengthen ties with other countries such as China. During a meeting of their foreign ministers in Beijing last month, India and China agreed to resume direct flights between their countries for the first time in five years.",
      "Despite the recent setbacks in their relationship, India will continue to engage with the U.S. as a key strategic and technological partner, said Chietigj Bajpaee, a senior research fellow for South Asia at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",

      "A growing number of U.S. politicians are condemning a new British law that requires some websites and apps \u2014 including some based in the United States \u2014 to check the ages of users across the pond.",
      "A bipartisan group of members of Congress visited London recently to meet counterparts and air their concerns about the U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act, which went into effect July 25. Vice President JD Vance has been criticizing the law for months, as have privacy advocates who argue that the law infringes on free expression and disproportionately hurts vulnerable groups.",
      "Vance criticized the U.K. again on Friday, this time in person at the start of a visit to the country. Sitting alongside British Foreign Secretary David Lammy and speaking to reporters, Vance warned the U.K. against going down a \u201cvery dark path\u201d of online \u201ccensorship\u201d that he said was trod earlier by the Biden administration.",
      "The U.K. Online Safety Act is aimed at preventing children from accessing potentially harmful material online, and internet companies are now asking British users to verify their ages in a variety of ways, including with photos of their IDs, through a credit card provider or with selfies analyzed via age-check software.",
      "But the sweeping nature of the law has caught some Britons by surprise. They\u2019re being asked to prove their age not only for pornography websites but also before they can listen to songs with explicit lyrics or access message boards to discuss sensitive subjects. Reddit, for example, is restricting access to various pages including r/stopsmoking, r/STD and r/aljazeera.",
      "Reddit said in a post about its enforcement of the law that for people in the U.K., it was now verifying ages before they can \u201cview certain mature content.\u201d A spokesperson for the company said r/STD \u2014 a message board focused on questions of sexual health \u2014 is restricted because of explicit images. They said r/stopsmoking is restricted because it deals with harmful substances and that r/aljazeera \u2014 which is not affiliated with the news organization of the same name but deals with similar topics \u2014 is restricted because it depicts serious injury or violence.",
      "To get around the new law, the use of virtual private network software that can mask a person\u2019s location, also known as VPNs, has surged in the U.K.",
      "The primary argument of U.S. politicians who oppose the law is that they don\u2019t want American tech companies to have to comply, even if they\u2019re serving British customers.",
      "House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said he raised his objections with U.K. government officials during meetings in London at the end of July. In a statement after his return, he said the law and other European regulations \u201ccreate a serious chilling effect on free expression and threaten the First Amendment rights of American citizens and companies.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe absolutely need to protect children and keep harmful, illegal content off these platforms \u2014 but when governments or bureaucracies suppress speech in the name of safety or regulation, it sets a dangerous precedent that threatens the core of Western democratic values,\u201d Jordan said.",
      "The issue may come to a head in a couple of different venues. That could be the courts if any tech companies file lawsuits over the law, or it could come up in trade negotiations if President Donald Trump decides to press the issue with British politicians, although they say it\u2019s not open to debate in trade talks.",
      "Marc Andreessen, a venture capitalist and Meta board member with close ties to the Trump administration, recently called U.K. leaders to complain about the law, the Financial Times reported Friday. A spokesperson for Andreessen said the report was not true.",
      "The U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act is one of the most comprehensive national laws that any democracy has ever passed to try to curtail potentially harmful content online in the name of children. Parliament passed the law in 2023, and the government went through two years of writing detailed rules before putting the law into effect last month.",
      "The law is notable for a combination of reasons: the variety of content it applies to, the potential fines and the possible international reach.",
      "A wide array of content is at issue. While the \u201cprimary\u201d focus of the law is online material such as pornography and suicide, it also requires websites to age-gate content with bullying, serious violence, \u201cdangerous stunts\u201d and \u201cexposure to harmful substances.\u201d That has covered relatively mainstream services such as Spotify and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox gaming system.",
      "Companies that don\u2019t comply face potential fines of up to 10% of their global revenue, which for the biggest companies could be billions of dollars. The British regulator Ofcom, short for Office of Communications, says companies must use \u201chighly effective age assurance\u201d to restrict the riskiest types of content.",
      "And the U.K. has not been adamant that it won\u2019t allow international borders to stymie enforcement. Ofcom says it plans to apply the law to services with \u201ca significant number\u201d of U.K. users, services where U.K. users \u201care a target market\u201d and services that are \u201ccapable of being accessed\u201d by U.K. users with a \u201cmaterial risk of significant harm\u201d to such users.",
      "The law appears to retain strong support among the British public. About 69% said they supported the new rules in a YouGov poll taken after implementation began, and 46% said they supported it \u201cstrongly.\u201d But 52% said they do not think the law will be very effective at preventing minors from accessing pornography.",
      "The law was passed during a previous, Conservative-led government and took effect under the current, Labour-led government.",
      "But the far-right party Reform U.K. is pushing for a repeal of the law. Party leader Nigel Farage, a former member of Parliament, has called it \u201cstate suppression of genuine free speech,\u201d and his party is running high in polls.",
      "\u201cMillions of people have noticed that what they\u2019re getting on their feeds is different to what it was,\u201d Farage said at a recent news conference.",
      "Farage also met with visiting members of Congress last week, and the talks turned heated with Farage and Democrats exchanging insults, according to Politico, although the dispute appeared to be more about Trump\u2019s free speech restrictions than about the U.K. law.",
      "Most U.S.-based tech companies say they are complying with the new law. Microsoft said in a blog post that Xbox users in the U.K. would begin seeing notifications \u201cencouraging them to verify their age\u201d as a \u201cone-time process,\u201d with actual enforcement starting next year. If users don\u2019t comply, Microsoft warned, they\u2019ll lose access to social features of Xbox but will still be able to play games.",
      "Discord said it was implementing new default settings for all U.K. users, in effect treating everyone like a minor with heavy content filtering unless they verify that they\u2019re adults. Discord says users can choose to verify their age either with a face scan or an ID upload.",
      "Elon Musk\u2019s X has also restricted posts, including information about the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, according to the BBC. X and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "But a few services are not complying. The far-right social media site Gab, which allows white supremacist views and other extremist content, said in a notice on its website that it had received notices from Ofcom and, rather than comply, decided to block the entire U.K. from accessing its site. The company said in the notice: \u201cWe refuse to comply with this tyranny.\u201d",
      "Preston Byrne, a U.S. lawyer who specializes in technology issues, has said on X that he plans to file a lawsuit soon on behalf of an unnamed client seeking to quash possible enforcement of the British law within the United States.",
      "The subject has been simmering for months ahead of the law\u2019s implementation, and it came up in February when British Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited the White House.",
      "In an Oval Office meeting, a reporter asked Trump what he thought of the U.K. approach to free speech, and Trump tossed the question to Vance, who expressed concern.",
      "\u201cWe do have, of course, a special relationship with our friends in the U.K. and also with some of our European allies. But we also know that there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British \u2014 of course, what the British do in their own country is up to them \u2014 but also affect American technology companies and, by extension, American citizens,\u201d he said.",
      "Starmer defended his government\u2019s approach.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom, and it will last for a very, very long time. Certainly, we wouldn\u2019t want to reach across U.S. systems and we don\u2019t, and that\u2019s absolutely right,\u201d he said.",
      "British Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy later said the U.K. would not make any changes to the Online Safety Act as part of trade negotiations with the Trump administration.",
      "American privacy advocates are watching the debate play out with alarm, concerned that similar age verification laws \u2014 like new state laws targeting the Apple and Google app stores \u2014 would upend the internet closer to home.",
      "\u201cYoung people should be able to access information, speak to each other and to the world, play games, and express themselves online without the government making decisions about what speech is permissible,\u201d wrote Paige Collings, a senior speech and privacy activist at the San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation, in a blog post Tuesday."

      "NAGASAKI, Japan \u2014 Nagasaki is marking the U.S. atomic attack on the southern Japanese city 80 years ago and survivors of the attack are working to make their hometown the last place on earth hit by the bomb.",
      "Despite their pain from wounds, discrimination and illnesses from radiation, survivors have publicly committed to a shared goal of abolishing nuclear weapons. But recently they worry about the world moving in the opposite direction as the anniversary is commemorated Saturday.",
      "The atomic bomb dropped by the United States on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945, killed some 70,000 people, three days after the bombing of Hiroshima killed 140,000. Japan surrendered on Aug. 15, 1945, ending World War II and the country\u2019s nearly half-century of aggression across Asia.",
      "Aging survivors and their supporters in Nagasaki now put their hopes of achieving nuclear weapons abolition in the hands of younger people, telling them the attack is not distant history, but an issue that remains relevant to their future.",
      "Teruko Yokoyama, an 83-year-old member of a Nagasaki organization supporting survivors, said she feels the absence of those she has worked, which fuels her strong desire to document the lives of remaining survivors.",
      "The number of survivors has fallen to 99,130, about a quarter of the original number, with their average age exceeding 86. Survivors worry about fading memories, as the youngest of the survivors were too young to recall the attack clearly.",
      "\u201cWe must keep records of the atomic bombing damages of the survivors and their lifetime story,\u201d said Yokoyama, whose two sisters died after suffering illnesses linked to radiation.",
      "Her organization has started to digitalize the narratives of survivors for viewing on YouTube and other social media platforms with the help of a new generation.",
      "\u201cThere are younger people who are beginning to take action,\u201d Yokoyama told The Associated Press on Friday. \u201cSo I think we don\u2019t have to get depressed yet.\u201d",
      "Nagasaki hosted a \u201cpeace forum\u201d on Friday where survivors shared their stories with more than 300 young people from around the country. Seiichiro Mise, a 90-year-old survivor, said he is handing seeds of \u201cflowers of peace\u201d to the younger generation in hopes of seeing them bloom.",
      "On Saturday at 11:02 a.m., the moment the plutonium bomb exploded above Nagasaki, participants are to set to observe a moment of silence as a peace bell rings.",
      "About 3,000 people, including representatives from 95 countries, were expected to attend the event at Nagasaki Peace Park, where Mayor Shiro Suzuki and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba were scheduled to speak.",
      "The twin bells at Urakami Cathedral, which was destroyed in the bombing, are to ring together again for the first time. One of the bells had gone missing afer the attack but was restored by volunteers.",
      "Survivors and their families started paying tribute at the park, as well as at the nearby hypocenter park, hours before the official ceremony.",
      "Survivors are frustrated by a growing nuclear threat and support among international leaders for developing or possessing nuclear weapons for deterrence. They criticize the Japanese government\u2019s refusal to sign or even participate in the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons because Japan, as an American ally, needs U.S. nuclear possession as deterrence.",
      "Nagasaki invited representatives from all countries to attend the ceremony on Saturday. China notably notified the city it would not be present without providing a reason.",
      "The ceremony last year stirred controversy due to the absence of the U.S. ambassador and other Western envoys in response to the Japanese city\u2019s refusal to invite Israel."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan shook hands Friday at a White House peace summit before signing an agreement aimed at ending decades of conflict.",
      "President Donald Trump was in the middle as Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan flanked him on either side. As the two extended their arms in front of Trump to shake hands, the U.S. leader reached up and clasped his hands around theirs.",
      "The two countries in the South Caucasus signed agreements with each other and the U.S. that will reopen key transportation routes while allowing the U.S. to seize on Russia\u2019s declining influence in the region. The deal includes an agreement that will create a major transit corridor to be named the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity, the White House said.",
      "Trump said at the White House on Friday that naming the route after him was \u201ca great honor for me\u201d but \u201cI didn\u2019t ask for this.\u201d A senior administration official, on a call before the event with reporters, said it was the Armenians who suggested the name.",
      "Trump has sought to be known as a peacemaker and made no secret of the fact that he covets a Nobel Peace Prize. Friday\u2019s signing adds to a series of peace and economic agreements brokered by the U.S. this year.",
      "Both leaders said the breakthrough was made possible by Trump and his team.",
      "\u201cWe are laying a foundation to write a better story than the one we had in the past,\u201d Pashinyan said, calling the agreement a \u201csignificant milestone.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Trump in six months did a miracle,\u201d Aliyev said.",
      "Trump remarked on how long the conflict went on between the two countries. \u201cThirty-five years they fought, and now they\u2019re friends and they\u2019re going to be friends a long time,\u201d he said.",
      "That route will connect Azerbaijan and its autonomous Nakhchivan exclave, which are separated by a 32-kilometer-wide (20-mile-wide) patch of Armenian territory. The demand from Azerbaijan had held up peace talks in the past.",
      "For Azerbaijan, a major producer of oil and gas, the route also provides a more direct link to Turkey and onward to Europe.",
      "Trump indicated he\u2019d like to visit the route, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to get over there.\u201d",
      "Asked how he feels about lasting peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Trump said \u201cvery confident.\u201d",
      "Aliyev and Pashinyan on Friday joined a growing list of foreign leaders and other officials who have said Trump should receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in helping ease long-running conflicts across the globe.",
      "The peace deal between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda helped end the decades-long conflict in eastern Congo, and the U.S. mediated a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, while Trump intervened in clashes between Cambodia and Thailand by threatening to withhold trade agreements with both countries if their fighting continued. Yet peace deals in Gaza and Ukraine have been elusive.",
      "US takes advantage of Russia\u2019s waning influence",
      "The signing of a deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan, both former Soviet republics, also strikes a geopolitical blow to their former imperial master, Russia. Throughout the nearly four-decade conflict, Moscow played mediator to expand its clout in the strategic South Caucasus region, but its influence waned quickly after it launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The Trump-brokered deal would allow the U.S. to deepen its reach in the region as Moscow retreats, senior U.S. administration officials said.",
      "The Trump administration began engaging with Armenia and Azerbaijan in earnest earlier this year, when Trump\u2019s key diplomatic envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with Aliyev in Baku and started to discuss what a senior administration official called a \u201cregional reset.\u201d",
      "Negotiations over who will develop the Trump Route \u2014 which will eventually include a rail line, oil and gas pipelines, and fiber optic lines \u2014 will likely begin next week, and at least nine developers have expressed interest already, according to the senior administration official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.",
      "Separate from the joint agreement, both Armenia and Azerbaijan signed deals with the United States meant to bolster cooperation in energy, technology and the economy, the White House said.",
      "Trump previewed much of Friday\u2019s plan in a social media post Thursday evening, in which he said the agreements would \u201cfully unlock the potential\u201d of the South Caucasus region.",
      "\u201cMany Leaders have tried to end the War, with no success, until now, thanks to \u2018TRUMP,\u2019\u201d Trump said on his Truth Social site.",
      "The Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict has lasted for decades",
      "The two nations were locked in conflict for nearly four decades as they fought for control of the Karabakh region, known internationally as Nagorno-Karabakh.",
      "The area was largely populated by Armenians during the Soviet era but is located within Azerbaijan. The two nations battled for control of the region through multiple violent clashes that left tens of thousands of people dead over the decades, all while international mediation efforts failed.",
      "Most recently, Azerbaijan reclaimed all of Karabakh in 2023 and had been in talks with Armenia to normalize ties. Azerbaijan\u2019s insistence on a land bridge to Nakhchivan had been a major sticking point, because while Azerbaijan did not trust Armenia to control the so-called Zangezur corridor, Armenia resisted control by a third party because it viewed it as a breach of sovereignty.",
      "But the prospect of closer ties with the United States, as well as being able to move in and out of the landlocked nation more freely without having to access Georgia or Iran, helped entice Armenia on the broader agreement, according to U.S. officials.",
      "Meanwhile, Russia stood back when Azerbaijan reclaimed control of Karabakh in the September 2023 offensive, angering Armenia, which has moved to shed Russian influence and turn westward. Azerbaijan, emboldened by its victory in Karabakh, also has become increasingly defiant in its relations with Moscow."

    "story": [
      "Just when Ukraine and its European allies thought President Donald Trump was coming round to their view of the war, he appeared to give a huge win to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.",
      "For Kyiv, this was Trump\u2019s deadline to Putin: stop the fighting by Friday or face tough new economic sanctions. Instead, Trump has handed Moscow a diplomatic coup by agreeing to meet Putin face-to-face in a matter of days, their first encounter since the invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Trump had initially suggested that such a summit would only go ahead if Putin agreed to meet with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, something the Ukrainian president\u2019s administration has long called for but has been resisted by Russia. On Thursday, Trump dispelled the idea that they would have to get together \u2014 raising the specter of a bilateral negotiation that freezes out Kyiv.",
      "\u201cThe danger for Ukraine is actually quite grave,\u201d said Jonathan Eyal, international director at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank. \u201cThere will be a sense of alarm in European capitals.\u201d",
      "For Eyal and others, Ukraine\u2019s nightmare is now one step closer to reality: \u201cTrump will be so pleased by what he perceives as the great achievement of getting Putin to the negotiating table, that he grabs any kind of offer that is made,\u201d, Eyal said. \u201cThe danger of half-baked compromise, which Trump can claim as his main achievement, is very high.\u201d",
      "That compromise could be a temporary ceasefire that would allow Russia to restock its army and give its economy a break from international sanctions, according to Hope for Ukraine, a nonprofit organization based in Roseland, New Jersey.",
      "Even if there is no truce agreement, \u201ca meeting with Trump \u2014 no matter the outcome \u2014 would be a big diplomatic victory for Putin,\u201d Yuriy Boyechko, Hope for Ukraine\u2019s CEO, said in an email. \u201cPutin wants to break his diplomatic isolation\u201d and such a meeting \u201cwill stroke his ego.\u201d",
      "The \u201cmeeting with Putin is a trap; President Trump must not fall for it,\u201d Boyechko added.",
      "Ukraine now finds itself in a bind.",
      "\u201cZelenskyy cannot appear to be torpedoing what is a Trump initiative,\u201d Eyal said. After his catastrophic fallout with Trump in the White House in February, Zelenskyy has \u201cjust managed to repair his relationship with Trump over the last two months in a very gingerly fashion, and it would be the worst possible thing for him to appear now to be pooh-poohing this summit.\u201d",
      "Many Ukrainians were already skeptical. Before the summit was even announced, Artem Bidenko, a political scientist and former deputy minister in Ukraine\u2019s government, predicted that Putin \u201cwill most likely offer some kind of bone\u201d to Trump, who \u201cwill say that \u2018you see, I\u2019m doing well, I\u2019m already achieving peace, and people will stop dying,\u2019\u201d Bidenko said.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment on these criticisms.",
      "Others in Kyiv have more faith in the American leader.",
      "\u201cTrump seems to be irritated enough by the Russians\u2019 actions to dare to strike really strong blows at Russia,\u201d said Danylo Vereitin, 31, a sports journalist based in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. \u201cPeople with this type of mentality really don\u2019t like to look weak or vulnerable.\u201d",
      "During the presidential campaign last year, Trump said it would take him just 24 hours to solve the conflict, later updated that to six months and then seemingly forgot about it. Previous warm words about Putin have recently turned stern, and Trump appeared to be losing patience with Russia\u2019s \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201cdisgraceful\u201d nightly missile attacks on Ukrainian civilians while the White House was attempting to broker peace talks.",
      "This culminated in Trump\u2019s deadline, first set at 50 days on July 14, then shortened to 10 days on July 29, for Putin to agree a ceasefire or face tariffs against importers of Russian oil and gas products like China, India, Brazil and Turkey.",
      "Asked whether this deadline was still active, Trump told reporters Thursday, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be up to him\u201d \u2014 meaning Putin \u2014 \u201cand we\u2019re going to see what he has to say,\u201d adding that he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d at the situation.",
      "A senior White House official told NBC News Friday that the Russians have provided a list of demands for a potential ceasefire, and the U.S. is now trying to get buy-in from the Ukrainians and European allies.",
      "But Trump's ultimatums have not prompted the Kremlin to move one inch on its war in Ukraine so far, other than to give Trump a meeting.",
      "\u201cNothing has changed since, frankly, December 2021, when Putin offered his ultimatum and said, \u2018Give me what I want or else Ukraine gets it,\u201d said James Nixey, a U.K.-based consultant specializing on Russia.",
      "\u201cTrump has done everything to pressure Russia, short of actually doing anything to pressure Russia,\u201d he added. \u201cHe\u2019s made all sorts of pronouncements, threats and Truth Social posts, but not actually undertaken any specific act which harms Russia.\u201d",
      "In 2021, Russia\u2019s eight-point draft treaty looks much the same as today : a ban on Ukraine ever joining NATO and a withdrawal of NATO forces on Russia\u2019s eastern flank. Today, Russia has merely added the additional demand of even more Ukrainian territory.",
      "Ukraine has rejected the idea of a ceasefire that would have Russia maintain  control over Ukrainian territory in its control, and insisted that any agreement must include \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d from its allies so that Moscow is not able to launch future aggression.",
      "\u201cPutin wants Ukraine, Ukraine wants to exist, Trump wants an end to the war and to be able to deal with Russia,\u201d Nixey said. \u201cAll of the major players have different agendas and none of them are aligned on anything.\u201d",
      "CORRECTION (Aug. 8, 2025, 05:12 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misattributed a comment about Putin\u2019s diplomatic isolation. The statement was made by Yuriy Boyechko, Hope for Ukraine\u2019s CEO, not Gabriella Ramirez."

      "The statement was shared in Hebrew, and it used a term that can be translated to mean both \u201coccupy\u201d and \u201cconquer.\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s office did not respond to a request to clarify the intended definition.",
      "New aerial photos of the Gaza Strip have laid bare the magnitude of the destruction in the enclave, showing row upon row of shattered buildings interspersed with mounds of rubble and huge tent encampments."

      "After months of delays and extensions, President Donald Trump\u2019s comprehensive and sweeping tariffs slate took effect Thursday just after midnight ET, shifting his global trade reset into high gear.",
      "Most imports into the United States will now face a baseline 10% duty, with the overall average effective tariff rate rising to more than 17% \u2014 the highest since 1935, during the Great Depression \u2014 thanks to higher duties on some of the biggest U.S. trading partners, according to the nonpartisan Yale Budget Lab think tank.",
      "A wide variety of products will be hit. Tariffs will be collected on everything from European Union appliances and Japanese cars to food, furniture and toys from China and TVs from South Korea. Selected oil and gas imports, along with some smartphones and a suite of goods covered by a pre-existing trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, are not affected.",
      "Together, the duties are the most significant move yet by a president set on tilting the global economy even more in favor of the United States.",
      "Trump was online to celebrate the moment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s midnight! Billions of dollars in tariffs are now flowing into the United States of America!\u201d he said in an all-caps post on Truth Social.",
      "So far, the duties have mainly been jostling the U.S. economy instead. Tariffs, which are taxes on imports collected by the federal government, generally tend to raise costs, although there is some debate among economists about whether businesses or consumers ultimately bear the weight of those increased prices.",
      "Yale\u2019s Budget Lab calculates that the inflationary effect of tariffs will cost a typical household an average of as much as $2,400 this year. It forecasts one of the biggest impacts in clothing, with consumers facing 40% higher prices for shoes and 38% higher costs for apparel in the short run as retailers that rely on importing clothes from South and Southeast Asia shift supply chains or grapple with higher costs.",
      "Global markets largely shrugged off the new tariffs, with European and Asian shares mostly higher on Thursday, CNBC reported. U.S. stock futures were also up slightly.",
      "But Thursday is not the end of Trump\u2019s trade offensive.",
      "Trump told CNBC on Tuesday he still plans to impose import taxes on pharmaceutical products and semiconductors. Currently, only about a quarter of manufacturing facilities supplying the United States with key drug ingredients are actually based here, equating to a $116 billion deficit with the rest of the world. As for semiconductors, the United States imports $40 billion worth, though the figure can also include chips produced in the United States, shipped abroad and repackaged inside finished goods.",
      "Trump has also shown continued willingness to ratchet up duty levels at a moment\u2019s notice. On Wednesday, he hiked the tariff rate for India to 50% over the nation\u2019s purchases of Russian oil, which he said was allowing Russia to continue to finance its war in Ukraine. Brazil, too, now faces 50% duties as a result of Trump\u2019s displeasure with its treatment of former President Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally who has been detained on coup charges.",
      "Trump also told CNBC he could raise the European Union\u2019s tariff level to 35% from 15% if it reneges on an investment commitment. Taken together, the 27-nation bloc is the largest U.S. trading partner.",
      "The Trump administration continues to insist tariffs are working, pointing to billions raised in new monthly revenues for the U.S. government. The White House also notes that nations have pledged hundreds of billions of dollars in investments, though no details about how that money will be spent have been released. Stock indexes have also set all-time highs.",
      "\u201cThe markets have seen what we\u2019re doing and celebrated,\u201d Kevin Hassett, director of Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, said Sunday on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "Market analysts say those gains have been largely driven by tech and bets on artificial intelligence, offsetting growing signs of weakness elsewhere, like a slowing labor market and softer consumer spending."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 Police in southwestern China scuffled this week with protesters demanding greater justice for a 14-year-old girl bullied by her schoolmates, the latest in a series of such incidents that have drawn national attention.",
      "The unusual public outrage was set off by videos widely shared on Chinese social media showing a group of teenage girls verbally and physically attacking the victim in Jiangyou, a city in Sichuan province.",
      "Local residents, some of whom were spurred by what authorities said were false reports that the alleged attackers\u2019 families had official ties, have faced off with police they accuse of letting them off too lightly.",
      "\u201cYour children will meet children of officials who are more senior than you. What if they beat your children?\u201d a man said from behind a barricade in a video verified by NBC News.",
      "Other verified videos, many of which Chinese censors swiftly took down, showed a large crowd gathered in Jiangyou on Monday night, at times singing the Chinese national anthem as the police presence grew. Some people could be seen struggling with police officers on the ground before being taken away.",
      "Reached by phone Wednesday, a spokesperson for the Sichuan Public Security Department declined to comment and referred to earlier statements.",
      "Local police in Jiangyou said the incident took place July 22, when a 15-year-old girl surnamed Liu and two others, ages 13 and 14, assaulted the 14-year-old victim, surnamed Lai, in a vacant building. Bystanders recorded the incident and uploaded it online, police said in a statement Monday.",
      "The assault caused multiple contusions to Lai\u2019s scalp and knees, police said, though all injuries were \u201cminor.\u201d After an investigation, authorities \u201cpromptly\u201d expressed sympathy for the victim and took action, the statement said.",
      "Liu and another alleged perpetrator, who were subject to \u201cpublic security penalties,\u201d are being sent to a special school for corrective education, the police said, while the remaining bystanders were \u201ccriticized and educated.\u201d",
      "It was not immediately clear what exactly the punishment entails and why one of the three alleged abusers was not penalized. Under Chinese law, anyone who engages in severe group fighting can be detained for up to 15 days and fined up to 1,000 yuan ($139), but juvenile offenders are exempted from detention and sent for corrective education, instead.",
      "Cyber police in the city of Mianyang, which administers Jiangyou, said in a statement Tuesday that the parents of the three alleged attackers were not lawyers or police officers but that \u201ctwo are unemployed, two work outside the province, one is a local shop assistant, and one is a local food delivery worker.\u201d",
      "They said two internet users accused of posting the false information had been \u201cadministratively punished.\u201d",
      "The attack has been widely discussed on Chinese social media, where commenters expressed anger over what they considered relatively light penalties.",
      "\u201cOnly a heavy penalty can serve as a warning,\u201d a user wrote on the popular Chinese social media platform Weibo. \u201cThis is really abhorrent.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s truly infuriating and heartbreaking,\u201d another said. \u201cIf such behaviors go unpunished, we will eventually pay a heavy price.\u201d",
      "More than 50% of Chinese students have endured school bullying, including verbal abuse, social exclusion and threats of violence, according to a recent survey by the state-backed China Youth & Children Research Center.",
      "The issue of bullying has been getting more attention in China after several high-profile cases.",
      "In January, violent protests erupted in the northwestern province of Shaanxi over a teenage student who fell to his death at a vocational school after a \u201cverbal and physical altercation\u201d with another student. Investigators ruled out any crime.",
      "In December, a Chinese court in the northern province of Hebei sentenced a teenager to life imprisonment and another to 12 years over the murder of their 13-year-old schoolmate, who was buried in an abandoned greenhouse after being killed by a shovel.",
      "A third suspect, who like the others was 13 at the time of the crime, was sentenced to corrective education.",
      "Chinese authorities acknowledge that some minors take advantage of the lower penalties generally available for those under 16 and commit multiple offenses before that age, state-run broadcaster CCTV News reported in June.",
      "The country\u2019s top legislature passed an amendment that month that would allow minors ages 14 to 16 to be detained over \u201cserious and harmful\u201d offenses starting next year."
