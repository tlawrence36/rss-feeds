      "Coldplay's concert at Gillette Stadium on Wednesday took an unexpected turn when a couple caught on the jumbotron sparked debate online",
      "LONDON -- It started out as a routine bit of fun at a Coldplay concert: Lead singer Chris Martin asked the cameras to scan the crowd for his \u201cJumbotron Song,\u201d when he sings a few lines about the people the camera lands on.",
      "At a concert at Gillette Stadium in Massachusetts on Wednesday, a man wearing a birthday sash was up first. Two people in banana costumes were highlighted.",
      "But in between, something else ensued. For several seconds, a couple was shown on the big screen. They were cuddling and smiling, his arms wrapped around her, as she leaned back into him. When they saw themselves on the big screen, her jaw dropped, her hands flew to her face and she spun away from the camera. He ducked out of the frame, as did she.",
      "\u201cEither they\u2019re having an affair or they\u2019re just very shy,\u201d Martin joked.",
      "But it didn't end there. The video went viral, and the internet got to work.",
      "The Associated Press could not immediately confirm the couple's identity.",
      "But internet sleuths allege he is the chief executive officer of a U.S.-based company, while she is the chief people officer \u2014 in other words, the head of human resources.",
      "A spokesman for the company did not respond when asked to confirm the identities of the people shown on camera. But he said in an email that a statement circulating online that was attributed to the chief executive was a \u201cfake from a clearly labeled parody account.\u201d The company later released a statement saying it had opened an investigation into the incident, but did not directly identify the employees.",
      "The woman didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on LinkedIn. The man's LinkedIn page appeared to be deactivated, and no other way of contacting him could be immediately found. A phone call to a number listed in an online directory under his name went straight to voicemail. Attempts to reach him through other numbers associated with his name in the directory were not successful.",
      "A representative for Coldplay said the band had no comment.",
      "It\u2019s easy to miss, but most concert venues have signs informing the audience that they could be filmed during the event. Look for them on the walls when you arrive and around the bar areas or toilets. It\u2019s common practice especially when bands like to use performances for music videos or concert films.",
      "The venue in this case, Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, also has a privacy policy online which states: \u201cWhen you visit our location or attend or participate in an event at our location, we may capture your image, voice and/or likeness, including through the use of CCTV cameras and/or when we film or photograph you in a public location.\u201d",
      "In the internet age, such videos \u2014 or ones taken on someone's smartphone \u2014 can quickly zip around the world.",
      "This video rocketed around social media, as people speculated about why the couple dodged the camera.",
      "Empathy for the pair and their families was mixed with plenty of snarky commentary and countless memes, with the fake statement from the chief executive generating a lot of additional vitriol. And news reports said that the CEO's LinkedIn account was disabled after it was flooded by a wave of comments.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit unsettling how easily we can be identified with biometrics, how our faces are online, how social media can track us \u2014 and how the internet has gone from being a place of interaction, to a gigantic surveillance system,\" said Mary Angela Bock, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s School of Journalism and Media. \"We are being surveilled by our social media. They\u2019re tracking us in exchange for entertaining us.\u201d",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- With two out of five of its members North Korean defectors, the K-pop group 1VERSE is breaking new ground as it debuts its single album Friday.",
      "The band represents an unusual convergence of backgrounds: North Korea-born rapper Hyuk and singer Seok join Nathan from Arkansas, Kenny from Los Angeles, and Aito from Japan.",
      "While not the first K-pop act to include North Korean defectors \u2014 BE BOYS\u2019 Hak Seong debuted earlier this year \u2014 the diversity of the group's members add a rare dimension to the genre\u2019s growing global diversity.",
      "The group debuts Friday with their single album \u201cThe 1st Verse\u201d under Seoul-based label Singing Beetle. Their title track \u201cShattered\u201d features lyrics co-written by Hyuk and Kenny.",
      "\u201cWith members from different countries all coming together as 1VERSE, I just thought \u2018we can do this regardless of background\u2019 going forward,\u201d said Aito, the group\u2019s youngest member from Chiba, Japan.",
      "Hyuk, who lived in North Korea\u2019s North Hamgyong Province until age 12, defected to the South in 2013. His journey to K-pop stardom began while working in a factory in South Korea, where a chance encounter with the CEO of a music label eventually led to weekend rap lessons in Seoul.",
      "\u201cI went to university but then things went bad. It was when COVID was pretty severe, and a bad incident happened, so I had no choice but to work at a factory,\u201d he said.",
      "Initially skeptical, Hyuk thought the invitation to become a pop star might be a scam. He recalled thinking: \u201cI really have nothing right now, even if you rob me, not even dust would come out.\"",
      "After a year of meetings where the music executive consistently bought him meals and encouraged his training, Hyuk joined the agency in late 2021.",
      "Seok\u2019s path was similarly unconventional. A former soccer player who started playing at 8 years old in North Korea, he defected in 2019. He declined to provide additional details, citing safety concerns.",
      "After arriving in South Korea, he briefly played for a semi-professional team before pursuing physical education studies. During weekend soccer games he was approached about an idol training program.",
      "\u201cI was starting music for the first time, right? So I started with the mindset that if it doesn\u2019t work out, I can just stop and try something else,\u201d Seok said.",
      "Both members\u2019 experiences reflect harsh realities they left behind. Hyuk described spending eight to 10 hours daily collecting firewood as a child just to survive.",
      "\u201cWhere I lived, we had to collect firewood just to cook rice and survive day by day \u2014 it was essential,\u201d he recalled.",
      "Hyuk didn't have much access to music growing up. \u201cSince I lived struggling every day, I lived so busily that I wonder if I even had time to listen to music \u2014 I didn\u2019t have that luxury,\u201d he said.",
      "Seok had some exposure to K-pop in North Korea, listening occasionally to f(x)\u2018s \u201cLA chA TA\u201d and Super Junior songs despite it being illegal in North Korea to listen to South Korean music. \u201cI probably heard K-pop back in elementary school. But I couldn\u2019t listen often since it was illegal,\u201d he said.",
      "Experts and defectors say K-pop and other South Korean pop culture products have emerged as a challenge to North Korea\u2019s leadership as they steadily gained popularity among the public.",
      "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has intensified campaigns since the pandemic to eliminate South Korean cultural influence.",
      "Nathan, from Arkansas, first encountered K-pop through his Texas-based cousins who were longtime fans. \u201cI would kind of just pretend to be a hater, like urgh, K-pop. And then I just so happened to come across EXO\u2019s \u2018Growl\u2019 music video on YouTube,\u201d he recalled.",
      "The group\u2019s diverse backgrounds are reflected in their training, which includes courses on global citizenship. \u201cWe want to be inclusive of everyone\u2019s history, everyone\u2019s current situations back home,\u201d Kenny explained.",
      "Seok expressed excitement about connecting with international fans, particularly in America. \u201cSince I came from North Korea, it\u2019s hard to see foreigners there. So I really wanted to see people from other countries,\u201d he said.",
      "The group has already gained traction online. Seok described filming emotional video diaries during difficult early training days, which fans responded to with supportive messages.",
      "\u201cI filmed that diary video with somewhat emotional, slightly teary feelings. And I uploaded it to TikTok or YouTube, and fans sent me comforting letters,\" he said. \u201cAs soon as I saw the first line, tears came out and I was really touched.\u201d",
      "Hyuk acknowledged the attention their North Korean background generates while emphasizing the group\u2019s collective identity.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very grateful that people are paying attention to us,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s okay as long as it doesn\u2019t lean too much to one side ... it\u2019s not just me but all our members are here too, it\u2019s a journey we\u2019re creating together.\u201d",

He wasn\u2019t a collector, but knew the value of the sled and quietly preserved it for decades, putting it as an Easter egg into four of his own films.",
      "Dante's friend and mentor Steven Spielberg paid $60,500 for another of the sleds in 1982, and anonymous buyer paid $233,000 for the third in 1996.",

      "In Alaska, a public radio station general manager took a moment from a busy day warning her community about a possible tsunami for a special task \u2014 sending a text message to Sen. Lisa Murkowski urging her to vote against a measure to strip federal fund...",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- Lauren Adams, general manager for KUCB public radio in Unalaska, Alaska, didn't have much time to reflect on Congress, 4,000 miles away, stripping federal funding for public media this week. She's been too busy working.",
      "Sirens blared in the Aleutian Islands community Wednesday warning of a potential tsunami, with a voice over public loudspeakers urging the community's 4,100 residents to seek higher ground immediately and tune into the radio \u2014 to Adams' station.",
      "At the same time in Washington, the Senate was voting on a measure that would eliminate nearly $1.1 billion that had already been appropriated for NPR and PBS \u2014 a process that didn't end until early Thursday morning. The House completed the process in time for President Donald Trump to sign it before a Friday deadline.",
      "Trump had called for the cuts, saying public media's news programming was biased against him and fellow Republicans, and threatened GOP members of Congress with primary challenges if they didn't fall in line.",
      "Adams, her news director, a reporter and an intern kept broadcasting and updating KUCB's social media feed until the danger passed. Then she made time for one more task \u2014 texting U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski and urging her to vote against the bill. Murkowski was one of two Republican senators, along with Susan Collins of Maine, to publicly dissent.",
      "\u201cI thought that it was such a telling story of why her constituents have a different relationship to public radio than maybe some other regions of the United States,\u201d Adams said.",
      "The federal money is appropriated to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which distributes it to NPR and PBS. Roughly 70% of the money goes directly to the 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations across the country, although that's only a shorthand way to describe its potential impact.",
      "The cuts are expected to weigh most heavily on smaller public media outlets away from big cities, and it's likely some won't survive. Katherine Maher, NPR's president and CEO, estimated as many as 80 NPR stations may face closure in the next year. Some stations are already fielding offers from commercial entities to buy their broadcast licenses, she said.",
      "\u201cMany of our stations which provide access to free unique local programming and emergency alerts will now be forced to make hard decisions in the weeks and months ahead,\u201d said Paula Kerger, PBS president and CEO. \u201cThere is nothing more American than PBS. Despite today's setback, we are determined to keep fighting to preserve the essential services we provide to the American public.\u201d",
      "The measure will cost PBS and NPR stations in Mississippi roughly $2 million, about 15% of the budget, said Royal Aills, executive director of Mississippi Public Broadcasting.",
      "Already, Mississippi Public Broadcasting has decided to eliminate a streaming channel that airs children's programming like \u201cCaillou\u201d and \u201cDaniel Tiger's Neighborhood\u201d to the state's youngsters 24 hours a day, said Taiwo Gaynor, the system's chief content officer.",
      "\u201cThis is important for families, to have access to content that they don't have to pay for,\u201d Gaynor said. \u201cThat is a sad thought, to think that we ... might not be able to provide that for a generation of children.\u201d",
      "Maine\u2019s public media system is looking at a hit of $2.5 million, or about 12% of its budget, for the next fiscal year, said Rick Schneider, president and chief executive officer of Maine Public. He said he\u2019s not ready to identify specific cuts, but the system is preparing to reinvent itself to make certain it continues serving the state\u2019s residents.",
      "Maine\u2019s rural residents rely heavily on public media for weather updates and disaster alerts, said Molly Curren Rowles, executive director of ACLU of Maine. Rowles said public media was a \u201clifeline\u201d to her growing up off the grid.",
      "NPR's Maher fears what the cuts might mean for the system's journalism, not just in rural areas where local news can be hard to come by, but in telling the rest of the country what is going on there. Less funding will also mean less support for popular television and radio programming, although it's too soon to tell which programs will be affected.",
      "NPR stations also use millions of dollars in federal money to pay music licensing fees. Now many will have to renegotiate these deals, which could mean less music, or a more limited variety of music, on outlets where music discovery is a big part of their identity. For example, Maher estimates that some 96% of all classical music broadcast in the United States is on NPR stations. \u201cThat is essentially taking an entire art form out of public access,\u201d she said.",
      "The affair transcends violins and piccolos. NPR received support Thursday from the heavy metal band Gwar, whose lead singer Blothar the Berserker posted a call on social media for fans to pay attention to what is going on with public media.",
      "Already, public media is seeing an increase in donations from reader and viewers to support its mission, and stations are actively sounding the alarm. In a plea to listeners on its website Thursday, Philadelphia's WXPN radio pointed to its legacy in helping people discover new music. \u201cThe most important thing you can do is support WXPN and the public media system in a way that is meaningful to you,\u201d the station urged on its website.",
      "But donations aren't going to fill the hole left by the loss in federal funding, Maher said. The public media leaders have already turned to lobbying Congress to restore some of the funding through the appropriations process for next year's budget. They don't know how much time they have; Maher said it would be inordinately costly, and perhaps prohibitive, to reopen a radio station that is forced to close.",
      "Public media isn't getting any help from states, either. At least five states have reduced their own outlays for public media this year, either for budget or political reasons.",
      "Gov. Ron DeSantis, for example, vetoed nearly $6 million that Florida lawmakers had set aside for public broadcasters the day before the state's budget took effect on July 1. \u201cDone in Florida,\u201d DeSantis responded on social media to a Trump post calling public broadcasting a \u201cmonstrosity\u201d that should be defunded.",
      "Back in Alaska, KMXT public radio station\u2019s general manager, Jared Griffin, called the Senate vote a \u201cdevastating gut punch.\u201d He estimated that the cuts would amount to 22% of KMXT\u2019s budget. Griffin said the station\u2019s board has already agreed on a plan to furlough staff members one day a month, and he\u2019s taking a 50% pay cut.",
      "The station covers Kodiak Island, home to one of the nation\u2019s largest U.S. Coast Guard bases.",
      "\u201cWe have to dip into our savings while we figure out what KMXT is going to look like over the next six months, Griffin said. \u201dAt least for the next year we\u2019ll be fine but we\u2019re probably going to have to look at leasing space in our building to other organizations to help fill that gap.\u201d",
      "Unalaska resident Nikki Whittern said KUCB plays a vital role in the community during emergencies like the tsunami warning.",
      "\u201cThey broadcast everything, and they make sure that everybody knows and everybody\u2019s safe,\u201d said Whittern, a bartender. She spoke while preparing to open the Norwegian Rat Saloon \u2014 known to local fishermen simply as \u201cthe Rat\u201d \u2014 on Thursday morning.",

      "Bands behaving badly",
      "Bands behaving badly? It's only rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.",
      "Members of alternative rock band Jane\u2019s Addiction filed dueling lawsuits Wednesday over singer Perry Farrell\u2019s onstage scuffle with guitarist Dave Navarro at a Boston concert last year, a fracas that prompted the cancellation of the rest of their reunion tour and a planned album.",
      "They join a long and storied tradition of bandmates suing one another, taking interpersonal and legal troubles from the recording studio to the courtroom. Here\u2019s a look at a few very famous cases.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: Navarro, drummer Stephen Perkins and bassist Eric Avery sued Farrell in Los Angeles Superior Court seeking at least $10 million, alleging that Farrell\u2019s behavior on their recent tour had ranged from erratic to out of control, culminating in an assault where Farrell punched Navarro both onstage and backstage.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: It hasn't been; it's just getting started. Farrell and his wife, Etty Lau Farrell, sued the three bandmates in the same court Wednesday, blaming them for the conflict and the violence.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: How much time do you have? The late, great Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys\u2019 leader, feuded with his cousin and bandmate Mike Love over songwriting credits dating back decades. Love had sued Wilson several times, beginning in the 1990s.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: Wilson often wasn't the victor \u2014 except in 2007, when U.S. District Judge Audrey Collins threw out one of Love's lawsuits against Wilson. In it, Love alleged that a free, 2004 promotional CD of re-recorded Beach Boys songs cost him millions of dollars and violated Love and Wilson\u2019s partnership.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: The sibling rivalry between Oasis brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher is well established. Their brawls not only led to the band\u2019s dissolution in 2009, before their 2025 reunion, but also a legal upset. In 2011, Liam sued Noel for saying Liam\u2019s hangover caused the cancellation of a 2009 festival performance. He said in a statement that the lawsuit was not about money, but that he wanted an apology and for Oasis fans \u201cto know the truth\u201d \u2014 that laryngitis prevented him from performing.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: The lawsuit was dropped.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: The post-breakup decades of Creedence Clearwater Revival were marked by so much legal and personal infighting that you might think CCR stands for Conflict, Clash, Repeat. In 1996, singer-songwriter-guitarist John Fogerty sued ex-bandmates Doug Clifford and Stu Cook for performing under the name Creedence Clearwater Revisited. That case settled in 2001, but the bandmates sued Fogerty in 2014, alleging he was violating the settlement by continuing to publicly slag off the Revisited name. And they said Fogerty himself was now illegally using Creedence Clearwater Revival in concert advertising. Fogerty sued back in 2015, saying Cook and Clifford weren\u2019t paying him proper songwriting royalties for their performances.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: A federal court merged the two cases, and the resulting hybrid was settled under confidential terms in 2017.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: Fleetwood Mac and feuds are practically synonymous. Breakups and divorces between members are essential to some of their best songs. The conflict resumed in the 2010s when the band kicked lead guitarist Lindsey Buckingham off their 2018 tour, and he sued. Buckingham claimed he was told five days after the group appeared at Radio City Music Hall that January that the band would tour without him. He says he would have been paid at least $12 million for his share of the proceeds.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: Later that year, Buckingham said they had settled the lawsuit.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: At some point, two key members of Journey stopped believin' in each other. And all over an Amex. Longtime guitarist Neal Schon sued longtime keyboardist Jonathan Cain in 2022, saying Cain was refusing to let him use the band's American Express card. A counterclaim came from Cain, who said that Schon was running up enormous personal charges on the band's account.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: A judge in 2024 appointed a custodian over the band's financial decisions, specifically empowered to settle disagreements between Schon and Cain.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: In 2023, Daryl Hall sued his longtime music partner John Oates, arguing that Oates' plan to sell off his share of a joint venture would violate the terms of a business agreement the Hall & Oates duo had forged long before. The move quickly prompted a judge to temporarily block the sale.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: The lawsuit and arbitration are ongoing.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: Their artistic partnership had been over for months, but the Beatles had to break out the barristers to break up their business. Paul McCartney went to London\u2019s High Court of Justice in 1970 to dissolve the Fab Four's 1967 contractual partnership, which included the Apple record label. McCartney above all wanted to get rid of manager Allen Klein, whom John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr wanted to keep as overseer of their business. \u201cThe only way for me to save The Beatles and Apple,\u201d McCartney told British GQ in 2020, \u201cwas to sue the band.\u201d",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: The court ruled in McCartney's favor and appointed a receiver to oversee their ventures in 1971. But negotiations and wrangling continued until a long-term solution that would become known as \u201cThe Beatles Agreement\u201d was signed by all four members in 1974.",

      "The 1950s and \u201960s pop singer Connie Francis died Thursday at 87",
      "Connie Francis was a giant of 1950s and '60s sugary-sweet pop, notching more than a dozen hits. In the months leading up to her death, announced Thursday, she experienced one more in \u201cPretty Little Baby,\u201d which has become a viral hit on TikTok six decades after its release.",
      "As of Thursday, more than 22.5 million TikTok videos have been created using the sound, often partnering videos of baby animals, toddlers, makeup tutorials and retro fashions. According to TikTok, those videos have amassed more than 45.5 billion views, globally. Celebrities like Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian and North West have used it, too, with West lip-syncing along to the track.",
      "Hooky, feel-good pop songs tend to do well on TikTok, and 1962's \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d is an exemplar of that phenomenon. Users gravitated toward the song's wholesome simplicity, sweet vocals, delicate organ and upstroke riffs. \u201cYou can ask the flowers / I sit for hours / Telling all the bluebirds / The bill and coo birds / Pretty little baby, I\u2019m so in love with you,\u201d Francis swoons on the verse that has picked up steam on the platform.",
      "And all of this has transpired in mere months: According to Luminate, an industry data and analytics company, \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d was earning just over 17,000 on-demand audio streams in the U.S. during the week ending April 10. A month later, that number had climbed to 2.4 million. That\u2019s a growth of over 7,000%. The song has earned over 29 million streams this year so far.",
      "In one popular video, which garnered over 56 million views, a user posted about baby teething hacks for first-time moms. Another user, Amari Goins, posted a video, with over 112 million views, of her 2-year-old daughter singing along to the lyrics, noting that her toddler picked up the song because of how often they heard it on TikTok.",
      "Most recently, TikTok users have begun posting covers of \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d as part of a singing challenge, where they exaggerate Francis' performance with their own stylized vocal runs. Francis, who died at 87, herself joined TikTok as a result of her song's popularity, and her first two videos \u2014 which earned 16.3 million and 31.2 million views, respectively \u2014 furthered engagement. In her first video, posted in early June, she said she was \u201cflabbergasted and amazed\u201d at the song's resurgence.",
      "\u201cTo think that a song I recorded 63 years ago is captivating new generations of audiences is truly overwhelming for me,\u201d Francis said in that first post, which she followed with a clip of herself lip-syncing to the song.",
      "For decades, the song lived in relative obscurity \u2014 written by Don Stirling and Bill Nauman for Francis, it was never a single and was originally released in the U.K. as the B-side of her 1962 single \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Be Warm This Winter.\u201d It appears on her album \u201cConnie Francis Sings \u2018Second Hand Love,\u2019\u201d released the same year. More than 60 years later, the song reached No. 20 on Billboard's Digital Song Sales chart in June 2025 and hit both the Hot 100\u2019s Bubbling Under chart and the Billboard Global 200.",
      "In Francis' last TikTok video, posted late last month, she thanked the \u201cmany wonderful artists\u201d who paid tribute to her, and all the users who sang along with her.",
      "Peter Lemongello Jr., a singer and performer who called Francis a friend, posted a TikTok in May where he sang the song to Francis, what he wrote on Facebook was \u201cone of the greatest and most exciting moments of my career so far.\u201d The video garnered over 15 million views.",
      "\u201cThere are no words to express this monumental loss,\u201d he wrote in a Facebook post on Thursday. \u201cI will be forever grateful to her for the help she gave me with my career.\u201d",
      "Ian Paget, a TikTok creator, posted a tearful video Thursday and said he hopes Francis and her family \u201chave felt that love from the younger crowd learning who she is.\u201d",
      "The TikTok popularity of \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d prompted her label Republic/UMe Records to reissue versions Francis had sung in French, German, Italian, Spanish and Swedish in 1962. Bruce Resnikoff, president and CEO of UMe, wrote in a statement that the global catalog division was saddened but took \u201ccomfort in knowing how joyful and fulfilled she felt in these last few months, as a new generation discovered her music and celebrated her legacy.\u201d",
      "In May, as the song took off, Francis thanked TikTok and its users for \u201cthe wonderful, and oh so unexpected, reception\u201d in a Facebook post.",
      "As for her reaction to having a \u201cviral hit\u201d? She continued: \u201cClearly out of touch with present day music statistics terminology, my initial response was to ask: 'What\u2019s that?' Thank you everyone!\u201d",

      "Lin-Manuel Miranda plans to use the 10th anniversary Broadway performance of his award-winning cultural phenomenon \u201cHamilton\u201d as a fundraiser for a coalition of nonprofits providing immigration services.",
      "The Aug. 6 performance of \u201cHamilton\u201d at Broadway\u2019s Richard Rodgers Theatre is expected to raise about $3 million for the Immigrants: We Get the Job Done Coalition, 14 nonprofits ranging from the Hispanic Federation and National Immigration Law Center to the Haitian Bridge Alliance and the Tahirih Justice Center. The donation will come from Miranda, the Miranda Family and Miranda Family Fund, and the \u201cHamilton\u201d cast.",
      "It seemed like a fitting tribute to \u201cHamilton\u201d and its inspiration, Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, Miranda told The Associated Press, though he recognizes that Hamilton wouldn\u2019t have called himself an immigrant.",
      "\u201cHis narrative in our country kind of mirrors that of an immigrant story,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cHe did not grow up here. He didn\u2019t come from England. He came from the Caribbean, escaping harsh circumstances. And he really helped shape this country.\u201d",
      "Miranda did exclusively reveal some plans for the special, invite-only \u201cHamilton\u201d anniversary show and the preshow reception that he will host. Fans already know the possibilities after the special \u201cHamilton\u201d medley at the Tonys in June. Even the audience will be \u201cstacked,\u201d he said, since every actor who has ever performed during the show's Broadway run will be invited to be in the audience to watch the show\u2019s current Broadway cast that night. \u201cWe\u2019re working on something special for the curtain call and another nice special thing after that,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cThat\u2019s about all I can say.\u201d",
      "The bulk of the invites have gone to winners selected from a Prizeo sweepstakes, where entrants donated at least $10 to the Immigrants coalition. A few dozen VIP packages, ranging from $2,500 to $10,000, will be available Thursday through the Hispanic Federation, with proceeds also going to the coalition.",
      "\u201cOne of America\u2019s greatest exports -- at least for me growing up -- was the immigration narrative,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cSo many people I know\u2026 came to this country from somewhere else seeking a better life and then helped make this country better by being here. And I believe that\u2019s one of the greatest promises, one of greatest things about the American experiment, and I\u2019ll continue to fight for that and support organizations that are helping that cause.\u201d",
      "And the organizations that will benefit from the donations generated by the \u201cHamilton\u201d 10th anniversary, better known as #Hamilten, say the donations and encouragement are sorely needed now.",
      "Since the start of his second term, President Donald Trump swiftly moved to make good on \u201cMass Deportation Now!\u201d promises from his campaign. His administration has encouraged U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain and deport people quickly, even to countries where they have never been, in order to rein in illegal immigration.",
      "Hispanic Federation President and CEO Frankie Miranda, no relation to Lin-Manuel Miranda, said he is heartened by the more than 125,000 people who have donated to the \u201cHamilton\u201d fundraiser. \u201cI think it is the beginning of what could be an incredible movement of philanthropy and individual donors basically saying, \u2018Enough is enough\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have seen it also in the different demonstrations of people around the country where they are expressing their concern and their frustration out in the streets.\u201d",
      "Hispanic Federation has already lost millions in federal funding, as the Trump administration cuts support for workplace development initiatives and environmental justice work, Frankie Miranda said. He has also seen some corporations withdraw their financial support because they fear reprisals from the Trump administration. \u201cWe need bold ideas like \u2018Hamilton\u2019 where everybody feels that they can stand behind it,\u201d he said.",
      "Aarti Kohli, executive director of the Asian Law Caucus, another coalition member, said the donations would help her group continue to provide community legal services to individuals, while also pursuing lawsuits like its challenge to the Trump executive order seeking to strip away birthright citizenship from some children born in the United States.",
      "\u201cAt this time, when so many people are afraid to speak out and support vulnerable communities, Lin-Manuel Miranda being willing to use the \u2018Hamilton\u2019 platform just shows real leadership and bravery,\u201d Kohli said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m hoping that more donors will step up and support our sector. We are the firewall between authoritarianism and democracy.\u201d",
      "Kica Matos, president of the National Immigration Law Center, said her nonprofit plans to use the donations from the coalition to support its Defending Democracy initiative, which informs immigrants of their rights and uses the law as \u201ca bulwark against unconstitutional actions carried out by this administration.\u201d",
      "Matos sees it as a \u201cfull circle\u201d moment to use funding generated by \u201cthe story of one of our nation\u2019s Founding Fathers who himself was an indigent immigrant, who through his own grit, determination and his brilliance, worked his way up.\u201d \u201cHe was somebody who thought deeply about this new nation\u2019s democracy,\u201d she added. \u201cWhat better way to honor Hamilton and to express our gratitude for these resources?\u201d",
      "For Lin-Manuel Miranda, the fact that people remain fascinated by \u201cHamilton\u201d 10 years later also leaves him feeling grateful.",
      "And he remains surprised by the resonance of the line \u201cImmigrants: We get the job done,\u201d a line shared in the show by Hamilton and French military officer Marquis de Lafayette at the Battle of Yorktown.",
      "\u201cI thought it was no big deal,\u201d he said. \u201cBut from the moment it was performed on stage, the audience reaction was so joyous at just the utterance of that simple fact. It\u2019s one of the things that just heartens me and gives me hope. In these dark times, it still gets a big cheer.\u201d",
      "The cheering still requires the show to add extra measures of music to wait for the audience to calm down before continuing with the song \u201cYorktown.\u201d Miranda attributes it to the fact that so many Americans are only one or two generations away from an immigrant.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the same reason why that No Kings protest vastly outnumbered the military parade happening on the same day,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are still a lot of people who believe in basic decency and treating people who come here -- often from really tough situations -- with humanity.\u201d",

      "Navarro, drummer Stephen Perkins and bassist Eric Avery sued Farrell in Los Angeles Superior Court seeking at least $10 million, alleging that Farrell's behavior on the tour had ranged from erratic to out-of-control, culminating in the assault, where Perry punched Navarro both on stage and backstage.",
      "\u201cWith a series of swift blows, he single-handedly destroyed the name, reputation, trademark, and viability of the Band and those who built it,\u201d their lawsuit says.",
      "Farrell and his wife, Etty Lau Farrell, sued the three bandmates in the same court Wednesday, blaming them for the conflict and the violence.",
      "\u201cNavarro, Avery and Perkins apparently decided,\u201d the lawsuit says, \u201cthat Jane\u2019s Addiction\u2019s decades of success should be jettisoned in pursuit of a yearslong bullying campaign against Farrell involving harassing him onstage during performances, including, among other tactics, trying to undermine him by playing their instruments at a high volume so that he could not hear himself sing.\u201d",
      "The Farrells said that Navarro and Avery actually assaulted them.",
      "Perry Farrell said he was \u201cblindsided\u201d when the other members canceled the remaining 15 shows of the tour and broke up the band without consulting him, costing all of them a great deal of money.",
      "And he said his bandmates defamed him by publicly saying after the fight that he had mental health problems.",
      "Jane's Addiction was an essential part of the Los Angeles music scene in the late 1980s with their combination of elements of punk, goth and psychedelic sounds and culture. They became a national phenomenon with hits including \u201cJane Says\u201d and \u201cBeen Caught Stealing,\u201d and through their founding of the Lollapalooza tour, whose first incarnations they headlined in 1991.",
      "The group broke up soon after but returned several times in various incarnations. The 2024 tour was the first time the original members had played together since 2010.",
      "Farrell missed all seven of the group's rehearsals in the run-up to the tour, his bandmate's lawsuit alleges, and his behavior during the early shows ranged from erratic to out-of-control.",
      "\u201cHe struggled night to night amid public concern for his well-being and apparent intoxication,\u201d their lawsuit says. \u201cPerry forgot lyrics, lost his place in songs he had sung since the 1980s, and mumbled rants as he drank from a wine bottle onstage.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit says Farrell was given many solutions to the volume problem, none of which he followed.",
      "Then on Sept. 13 at Leader Bank Pavilion in Boston in front of about 4,000 fans, videos partially captured Farrell lunging at Navarro and bumping Navarro with his shoulder before taking a swing at the guitarist with his right arm. Navarro is seen holding his right arm out to keep Farrell away before Farrell is dragged away.",
      "But Farrell's lawsuit says the \u201cvideo evidence is clear that the first altercation onstage during the Boston show was hardly one-sided.\u201d It says Navarro was deliberately playing loud to drown out the singer, and \"what followed was an inappropriate violent escalation by Navarro and Avery that was disproportionate to Farrell\u2019s minor body check of Navarro.\"",
      "Farrell alleges that when he was being restrained by a crew member, Avery punched him in the kidneys, and that both Avery and Navarro assaulted him and his wife backstage.",
      "Shortly after the fight, Farrell in a statement apologized to his bandmates, especially Navarro, for \u201cinexcusable behavior.\u201d",
      "Both lawsuits allege assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress and breach of contract, among other claims.",
      "\u201cNow,\u201d Navarro, Perkins and Avery's lawsuit says, \u201cthe Band will never have their revival Tour, to celebrate a new album and 40+ years of deep, complex, chart-topping recordings. Instead, history will remember the Band as suffering a swift and painful death at the hands of Farrell\u2019s unprovoked anger and complete lack of self-control.\"",

      "But first we have \u201cSmurfs,\u201d which, like \u201cTrolls,\u201d gets as much mileage as it can from its pop singer-voice actor. Rihanna voices Smurfette and supplies a new song, giving a half-hearted injection of star power to an otherwise uninspired, modestly scaled, kiddo-friendly cartoon feature.",
      "\u201cSmurfs,\u201d directed by Chris Miller ( \u201cPuss in Boots,\u201d \u201cShrek the Third\u201d), cribs heavily from the \u201cTrolls\u201d playbook. Both feature brightly colored little forest creatures that like a good tune. In the opening of \u201cSmurfs,\u201d Papa Smurf (John Goodman) is DJing for a dancing Smurf Village.",
      "As the many Smurfs gyrate next to mushroom houses, you might find yourself wondering how we got here. And what, exactly, is a Smurf, anyway? It\u2019s been nearly 70 years since Belgian comic artist Peyo created \u201cLes Schtroumpfs,\u201d though most of those still familiar with the little blue fellas remember them from the 1980s Hanna-Barbera cartoons.",
      "The Smurfs have never really transcended their Saturday morning cartoon origins. Neither a pair of live-action hybrid movies in the early 2010s or a 2017 animated release have done much more than keep us vaguely aware of what a Phrygian cap is.",
      "And \u201cSmurfs\u201d is unlikely to change that. The best thing that can be said for the latest attempt to reboot the blue Belgian beings is that it maintains the light feel of a morning cartoon. Even with a brief SpongeBob SquarePants short running ahead of it, \u201cSmurfs\u201d \u2014 seemingly designed to be the least ambitious of all possible parent-child outings \u2014 passes in about 90 minutes.",
      "The pressing issue in Miller\u2019s film is that one Smurf, No Name Smurf (James Corden), lacks a defining feature. There are so many other labels already taken that all that\u2019s left for him are Clog Making Smurf and Shark Taming Smurf \u2014 and neither of those is promising, either.",
      "When No Name Smurf suddenly grows magical powers, he gets a boost in confidence but inadvertently sets off a dangerous chain reaction. The burst of magic reveals the location of Smurf Village and a long-hidden magical book that, if reunited with three others, confers world domination. (Fun fact: This is also what happens if you reunify all first editions of James Joyce\u2019s \u201cUlysses.\u201d)",
      "The outburst brings the attention of the evil wizard Razamel, brother of Gargamel. (Both are excellently voiced by JP Karliak.) And the Smurfs are cast into a chase through dimensions to rescue the kidnapped Papa Smurf and prevent Razamel from seizing the fourth book. The trip takes them through Paris, Munich, Australia and, briefly, Claymation.",
      "The zaniness is often forced. There are also Koosh ball-like creatures named Snooter Poots with a leader named Mama Poot (Natasha Lyonne). And if you were ever hoping to hear Rihanna sing, as a Smurf, from the seat of a kangaroo pouch, your movie has finally arrived.",
      "But any expectations of something more quickly dissipate, despite the fact that \u201cSmurfs\u201d was scripted by Pam Brady, the screenwriter of \u201cHot Rod\u201d and co-writer of \u201cTeam America: World Police.\u201d Most of the attempts at adult-winking gags are hackneyed jokes about Zoom, podcasting, spam filters and LinkedIn.",
      "You can almost feel IP-rights pressures animating the entire enterprise. See, there are other Smurf names out there. What about Corporate Mandate Smurf?",
      "\u201cSmurfs,\u201d a Paramount Pictures release, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for action, language and some rude humor. Running time: 92 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s 1997 all over again. It\u2019s so nostalgic,\u201d says Freddie Prinze Jr., who stars in both, this time around. Responds another returning star, Jennifer Love Hewitt: \u201cNostalgia is overrated.\u201d",
      "That line deserves a big laugh from a so-called \u201clegacy sequel\u201d that blends old and new to resurrect a franchise long dormant but isn\u2019t sure where it sits in 2025. A wink here, an eye-gouging there.",
      "By aping the structure of the original \u2014 maddeningly calling itself by its predecessor's name \u2014 the new version of \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer\u201d is both too tentative a step forward and yet too reliant on the past to fully break free of that gravitational pull.",
      "The new installment follows a group of post-high school friends (Madelyn Cline, Chase Sui Wonders, Jonah Hauer-King, Sarah Pidgeon and Tyriq Withers) who cause a fatal car wreck on July Fourth and swear to keep their involvement a secret. But a year later, someone wants them dead, offering the anniversary warning: \u201cI know what you did last summer.\u201d",
      "This is a franchise that got a bit lost in the shadow of the \u201cScream\u201d dynasty, but still helped make household names of such Gen X heroes as Prinze, Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe. A relaunch makes sense but it\u2019s pretty vapid stuff until the OGs arrive.",
      "In fact, you may find yourself rooting for the killer. The five youngsters who have grown up in Southport, North Carolina \u2014 \u201cthe Hamptons of the South\u201d \u2014 mostly live lives of nepo privilege, drinking from flasks, driving Volvos, munching on macarons and taking Adderall. One lives on a 156-foot (48-meter) yacht with three decks.",
      "The movie mostly muddles along like a TV special, only coming to life when Prinze and Hewitt arrive, asked by the hunted youngsters for guidance. After all, the duo survived the 1997 attacks. \u201cGet them before they get you,\u201d Hewitt's Julie advises.",
      "Director Jennifer Kaytin Robinson, who co-wrote the screenplay with Sam Lansky, mixes gruesome stabbings, harpoon impalings and corpses displayed on hooks like fish at the dock with jokes that needle everything from Nicole Kidman's cheesy AMC commercials to our fling with true-crime podcasts.",
      "The filmmakers make half-hearted attempts to explain the ripple effects from trauma but we're not here for generational pain; we're here for the slashy-slashy. There is one dream sequence with a surprise returning OG that's worth the ticket price alone.",
      "The tone is all over the place \u2014 whimpering victims one moment, horny the next. The police in Southport are nefarious \u2014 in a nod to \u201cJaws,\u201d they cover up the murders for fear of turning off tourism \u2014 but there's a \u201cScooby-Doo\u201d vibe here (even a mention) that seems less playful than idea-deprived. There are elements of spoof, too, like a vain woman who has just lost someone close in a grisly bloodbath but worries about her skin care.",
      "Look, we hate to break it to you, it's not going to end well for many of this privileged set, as they hunt whoever is hunting them. Coherence is also stabbed a lot because a clear motive for the mass murder is really hard to understand.",
      "No matter: We get the scene when a scared victim with a massive knife sticking out of her back shoots a harpoon gun at the hook killer, and that's why we came in the first place. We also get Hewitt screaming her catchphrase, mocking her attacker: \u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d Well, what are you waiting for?",
      "\u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer,\u201d a Sony Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated R for \u201cbloody horror violence, language throughout, some sexual content and brief drug use.\u201d Running time: 111 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "Romance novels aren't just guilty pleasures anymore",
      "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Romance novels have always spiced up quiet nights. Now, a genre that has sometimes been dismissed as a guilty pleasure is bringing readers and writers together through social media, book clubs and a growing number of romance-specific bookstores.",
      "At a recent launch party for Nora Dahlia's enemies-to-friends romance \u201cPick-Up\u201d at Lovestruck Books, a romance-dedicated store in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a crowd of women sipped cocktails from the bar-caf\u00e9 as they browsed the shelves.",
      "After Dahlia\u2019s reading, patrons stuck around to mingle, swap contact info and trade author recommendations.",
      "It was a particularly social event for a book talk. But the communal atmosphere is typical of events for romance fans.",
      "Dahlia likened romance readers to \u201cComic-Con folks,\u201d referring to the deep-rooted passion that defines comic-book fandom.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re educated on the genre in a real way,\u201d Dahlia said. \u201cMany of them started reading romance \u2014 Danielle Steel, V.C. Andrews, Jude Deveraux \u2014 as teenagers.\u201d",
      "At The Ripped Bodice bookstore in Brooklyn, New York, manager Katherine Zofri said romance fans who have connected online frequently come into the store to meet in person. Along with author events, the store hosts three different book clubs and a romance comedy night.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple proposals here, we\u2019ve had a wedding here which was really fun,\u201d Zofri said.",
      "She said customers range \u201cfrom teenagers who are starting to really get into the romance genres to older folks who have been romance readers for their entire lives and remember way back when they were reading the Harlequins and romance wasn\u2019t as widely accepted.",
      "\"Now they\u2019re loving seeing how widely accepted romance has become.\u201d",
      "Bookstores like Lovestruck and The Ripped Bodice (which has a flagship store in Los Angeles) have begun popping up all over the U.S., from Wichita, Kansas, to Wilmington, North Carolina, to Hopkinsville, Kentucky.",
      "Of the 157 romance-dedicated bookstores in the American Booksellers Association, more than half opened within the last two years, said Allison Hill, CEO of the trade group for independent sellers.",
      "\u201cRomance books have been one of the fastest growing book sales categories in recent years, driven by a number of factors including the need for escape reading and BookTok,\u201d Hill said.",
      "And the genre has evolved. \u201cThe romance genre is more diverse in every way including character identity and plot,\u201d she said.",
      "Lovestruck's owner, Rachel Kanter, called the boom \u201cincredible \u2014 and honestly, overdue. Romance has always been one of the most commercially successful genres, but for a long time it didn\u2019t get the respect or space it deserved in the literary world.\u201d",
      "Romance-specific bookstores, she says, \"are places where readers can feel joy, comfort, and connection \u2014 and where love is taken seriously as a literary theme.\u201d",
      "As with many hobbies, romance fandom solidified and expanded after the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cThe pandemic had pushed so many people toward reading for escape and comfort, and romance became a lifeline for a lot of folks,\u201d said Kanter.",
      "\u201cAt the same time, there was a wider cultural shift happening \u2014 people were rethinking what mattered, craving joy and softness, and looking to support indie businesses that reflected their values. Romance, with all its hope and heart, met that moment beautifully,\" she said.",
      "Romance has countless subgenres \u2014 hockey romance, Western romance, LGBTQ romance, even romance set on prison planets. But a common theme is their \u201cinherently hopeful storylines,\u201d says Elizabeth Michaelson Monaghan, a 52-year-old freelance writer and editor in New York who said she\u2019s read \u201chundreds\u201d of romance novels.",
      "\u201cRomance must have a happily-ever-after \u2014 or at least a happily-for-now. Romance writers and readers are very clear on this,\u201d she said.",
      "Romantic fiction that doesn\u2019t end that way? That\u2019s just a love story.",
      "Traits of the romance genre also include strong character descriptions, attraction, conflict, and a satisfying resolution and emotional growth. Expect plenty of steam \u2014 some authors deploy it explicitly, others are more tame.",
      "There\u2019s a long-standing culture of (mostly) women reading and sharing these books across generations.",
      "\u201cIt is pleasurable to reimagine courtship or the romantic bond,\u201d said Jayashree Kamble, professor of English at LaGuardia Community College and president of the International Association for the Study of Popular Romance. \u201cThere is limited risk involved.\u201d",
      "Kamble has been a voracious romance reader since her teenage years in India, where she devoured Harlequin romances.",
      "Romance novels, she said, are \u201ca lovely reminder that individualism and companionship can go together. These are basic bonds.\u201d",
      "Podcasts, too, have become a source for discovering what's trending. Andrea Martucci, creator and host of the romance-focused \u201cShelf Love\u201d podcast, said romance bookstores have become places of connection akin, in some ways, to churches \u2014 for the romantically devoted.",
      "\u201cI can go to a bookstore and not just find people who love books,\u201d she said, \u201cbut find people who love the very same books I love.\u201d",
      "As Annabel Monaghan, author of several love stories including \u201cNora Goes Off Script,\u201d puts it, \u201cPeople who read romance want to feel good. And when you gather a bunch of people who want to feel good, it\u2019s magic.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- In a bid to kickoff a new era for DC Studios, James Gunn\u2019s \u201cSuperman\u201d opened with $122 million in U.S. and Canada ticket sales over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "DC and Warner Bros. had a lot riding on \u201cSuperman.\u201d While the Walt Disney Co.\u2019s Marvel Studios has had its own share of struggles, the superheroes of DC have recently found mostly kryptonite in theaters. Films like \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux,\u201d \u201cThe Flash\u201d and \u201cShazam! Fury of the Gods\u201d all flopped.",
      "But \u201cSuperman,\u201d written and directed by Gunn, is intended as a new start. It\u2019s the first release fully steered by Gunn and Peter Safran, co-heads of DC Studios, since they were handed the keys to DC\u2019s superhero cinematic universe.",
      "And while Gunn turned \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d into a massive success for Marvel, his irreverent, idiosyncratic touch made the director \u2014 once a B-movie filmmaker with Troma Entertainment \u2014 an unlikely steward for one of the movies\u2019 most bankable and beloved brands.",
      "The roughly on-target opening was the third largest of 2025, and the first DC title to surpass $100 million in its opening weekend since \u201cWonder Woman\u201d in 2017.",
      "Ticket sales were relatively soft for \u201cSuperman\u201d overseas. In 78 international markets, it grossed $95 million. In China, it collected just $6.6 million.",
      "As an American icon, \u201cSuperman\u201d inevitably attracted political discourse. Some right-wing commentators criticized the movie as \u201cwoke\u201d after Gunn described the superhero from Krypton as \u201can immigrant.\u201d On X, the White House posted an image of President Donald Trump as Superman.",
      "In \u201cSuperman,\u201d which cost about $225 million to make, Gunn steers the Man of Steel in a drastically different tonal direction than in previous iterations from filmmaker Zack Snyder. Skipping the Kansas origin story, the film instead picks up with Superman ( David Corenswet ) after his first defeat. Rachel Brosnahan plays Lois Lane and Nicholas Hoult is Lex Luthor.",
      "The \u201cSuperman\u201d debut didn\u2019t come close to besting the $166 million launch for Snyder\u2019s \u201cBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,\u201d in 2016. But it did open higher, not accounting for inflation, than Snyder\u2019s \u201cMan of Steel.\u201d That film debuted with $116 million in 2013.",
      "But while Snyder\u2019s films were often unloved by critics, largely good reviews greeted Gunn\u2019s \u201cSuperman.\u201d On Rotten Tomatoes, it scored 82% fresh \u2014 the best for the franchise since the first two movies with Christopher Reeve: \u201cSuperman\u201d (1978) and \u201cSuperman II\u201d (1980). Audiences gave it an \u201cA-\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "\u201cSuperman\u201d faced sizeable competition too. Last week\u2019s top film, \u201cJurassic World Rebirth,\u201d slid to second place with $40 million. With \u201cSuperman\u201d soaking up many large-format screens, Universal Pictures\u2019 seventh \u201cJurassic\u201d film slipped a steep 57% from its opening weekend. Starring Scarlett Johansson, \u201cJurassic World Rebirth\u201d got off to a thunderous $318.3 million global start. In two weeks, it\u2019s amassed $529.5 million worldwide.",
      "Also still in the mix is Apple Studios\u2019 biggest box-office success yet, \u201cF1.\u201d Joseph Kosinski\u2019s Formula One action thriller, starring Brad Pitt, came in third with $13 million in its third weekend. The film, distributed by Warner Bros., has collected $393.4 million globally in three weeks. But it also carries a hefty price tag of roughly $250 million, plus at least $100 million in promotion.",

      "The finale will air on Peacock at 6 p.m. Pacific/9 p.m. Eastern, following a chart-topping run since the season premiered on June 3. The show brings young singles together in a remote villa in Fiji to explore connections with the ultimate goal of finding love.",
      "The show, an American spinoff to the UK series, has shaken up reality TV, becoming Peacock\u2019s most watched entertainment series on mobile devices, according to NBC Universal.",
      "This season follows breakout success from last summer, which captured mainstream attention. \u201cLove Island: Beyond the Villa,\u201d a new series spinoff premiering Sunday, follows Season 6's main cast as they navigate relationships, life and newfound social media fame in Los Angeles.",
      "This season has also been under fire as two contestants \u2013 Cierra Ortega and Yulissa Escobar \u2013 left the villa following resurfaced posts in which they used racial slurs.",
      "Ortega, who was half of one of the season\u2019s strongest couples, left the villa just a week before the popular reality show\u2019s finale after old posts resurfaced that contained a slur against Asian people. She apologized for the resurfaced posts in a nearly five minute TikTok video Wednesday.",
      "Friday's episode saw the elimination of Ace Greene and Chelley Bissainthe, setting the stage for the finale. Green and Bissainthe were the only couple to maintain a relationship throughout most of the show.",
      "With $100,000 up for grabs for the winning couple, here\u2019s a look at the season\u2019s run and the final four couples heading into the finale.",
      "Stripped of their phones and connection with the outside world, five men and five women arrive in the villa and coupled up based on initial romantic interest. Throughout the season, the show introduces a steady stream of bombshells, new contestants who are brought in to disrupt existing relationships and build new storylines.",
      "Under constant surveillance, contestants partook in kissing competitions, heart rate challenges and drama-inducing games ripe for viral moments. The final six couples even became instant parents, startled awake by cries as they were tasked with taking care of baby dolls to further test their romantic connections.",
      "Halfway through the season, established couples were temporarily separated for Casa Amor, the show's ultimate test, and encouraged to explore new relationships with a fresh group of single contestants.",
      "Contestants are routinely dumped from the villa, removed either by a public vote or by the islanders themselves.",
      "Amaya Espinal, 25, made waves when she walked in as a bombshell early in the season and has been credited for some of the season\u2019s most viral moments.",
      "\u201cI never said I was perfect. I never said I didn\u2019t have any flaws. But at least I\u2019m pretty, and at least I\u2019m a little funny, and at least I\u2019m my own best friend,\u201d Espinal sang to herself in the makeup room, which prompted various covers online and inspired a Google pop-up message when you search up her nickname, Amaya Papaya.",
      "The New York City native, who labeled herself a \u201csensitive gangster,\u201d tested various connections, including Greene, Austin Shepard and Casa Amor contestant Zak Srakaew, that all fizzled out. Her previous partners on the show said Espinal, who is Dominican, expressed affection too quickly.",
      "A connection sparked between Espinal and Bryan Arenales, 28, a Casa Amor contestant, late in the season after he defended her, saying that \u201ccoming from a Hispanic household, calling someone babe, mi amor, mi vida, that\u2019s just how we talk.\u201d Arenales is from Boston and is of Puerto Rican and Guatemalan descent, according to his Instagram page.",
      "\u201cI always stress that as I get older, it\u2019s important to be with someone that keeps you young. I definitely think Amaya is that type of person,\u201d Arenales said during a confessional interview.",
      "Huda Mustafa, 24, and Chris Seeley, 27, explored different connections in Casa Amor before expressing interest in each other and eventually recoupling.",
      "Mustafa, from North Carolina, is the first contestant in the series to be a mother, which caused tension with her initial \u201cLove Island\u201d partner, Jeremiah Brown. The two coupled up and developed a strong connection very quickly, causing the other contestants to doubt their relationship.",
      "Mustafa and Brown, 25, had a turbulent experience, leading to some of the most viral arguments of the season. The two eventually broke off their relationship and Brown was dumped from the villa halfway through the season.",
      "Mustafa explored other connections but remained single until Casa Amor, where she built a connection with Seeley, who was initially interested in Bissainthe.",
      "The two quickly developed an unexpected connection, bonding over Seeley's struggles with leaving his overseas basketball career and Huda\u2019s difficult experience with motherhood.",
      "\u201cI think me and her are actually really good for each other,\u201d Seeley said during a confessional interview. \u201cShe helps me kind of get out of my head and I help her, you know, be her true self and I calm her down in moments where she gets emotional or heated.\u201d",
      "The two hit a snag during the show\u2019s baby challenge, where they argued over Mustafa\u2019s lack of public displays of affection.",
      "Iris Kendall, 25, and Jose \u201cPepe\u201d Garcia-Gonzalez, 27, came in as bombshells with fellow contestant Jalen Brown in the ninth episode and explored various connections before coming together in the show\u2019s last recoupling.",
      "Garcia-Gonzalez initially formed a strong connection with Hannah Fields, 23, which was cut short when a shocking dumping forced her to leave the villa and left him single.",
      "Kendall initially coupled up with Brown before he was dumped from the villa along with Fields. She developed a strong connection with TJ Palma, 23, who walked in as a bombshell in episode 15, and they became a couple.",
      "Garcia-Gonzalez coupled up with Gracyn Blackmore, 25, during Casa Amor. Each respective couple remained together until Blackmore and Palma left the villa following a mass dumping late in the season, leaving both Kendall and Garcia-Gonzalez single.",
      "The pair, who had developed a strong friendship, then coupled up and started a romantic relationship.",
      "\u201cWith Iris, it just feels comfortable. I think it\u2019s that whole, you know, you\u2019re friends to start and then maybe it can become something else,\u201d Garcia-Gonzalez said during a confessional interview.",
      "Olandria Carthen, 27, and Nic Vansteenberghe, 24, had an unconventional path to the finale.",
      "The pair had expressed initial interest in each other during the first episode, before settling into separate couples. Carthen, an Alabama native, was set on finding her \u201ccowboy,\u201d coupling up with Taylor Williams, 24, from Oklahoma. The pair remained together for most of the season, though Williams sporadically mentioned he lacked a physical connection with Carthen.",
      "Vansteenberghe initially coupled up with Belle-A Walker, 22, before choosing to recouple with Ortega, who walked in as a bombshell at the end of the first episode. The pair remained together throughout the show until her abrupt departure from the villa a week ago.",
      "During Casa Amor, Carthen and Vansteenberghe didn\u2019t didn't find new connections and they were dumped from the villa. In a shocking twist, however, the contestants were offered a lifeline \u2014 they could return to the villa if they couple up with each other. The pair then briefly explored a romantic connection before ultimately deciding to remain friends.",

      "Data from the Education Department shows the pace at which it resolves civil rights complaints has slowed as the Trump administration dismantles the agency",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration insists it hasn\u2019t wavered in its duty to protect the civil rights of America\u2019s children even as it dismantles the Education Department. Yet its own data shows the agency has resolved far fewer civil rights cases than in past years despite families filing more complaints.",
      "The Education Department\u2019s civil rights branch lost nearly half its staff amid mass layoffs in March, raising questions about its ability to address a deep backlog of complaints from students alleging discrimination based on disability, sex or race. Pressed on the issue in June, Education Secretary Linda McMahon denied a slowdown.",
      "\u201cNot only are we reducing the backlog, but we are keeping up with the current amount with a reduced staff because we are doing it efficiently,\u201d McMahon said at a Senate budget hearing.",
      "By several measures, however, the output of the Office for Civil Rights appears to have fallen sharply in comparison with previous years. A public database of the office\u2019s resolution agreements \u2014 cases in which schools or universities voluntarily agreed to address civil rights concerns \u2014 suggests the office\u2019s work has slowed.",
      "The database lists just 65 resolutions so far this year, on pace to fall far below previous years\u2019 totals. Last year the office logged 380 resolutions in total, following 561 in 2023. During President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, the office averaged more than 800 resolutions a year, including 1,300 during his first year in office.",
      "Other internal data obtained by The Associated Press show a similar trend. Since Trump took office, the total number of resolved cases is down about 40% from the same time frame last year \u2014 including cases that were dismissed, mediated or reached a voluntary resolution. Compared with last year, there also has been a 70% decrease in the number of cases resolved through resolution agreements or action taken by a school to comply with federal law, the internal data shows.",
      "Meanwhile, new complaints have increased 9%. The total number of cases has now climbed beyond 25,000.",
      "An Education Department spokesperson said the Trump administration is fixing a broken system.",
      "\u201cWhen staff levels were at their peak, OCR\u2019s processes still proved to be ineffective, as evidenced by the chronic backlog of tens of thousands of cases that left students\u2019 discrimination claims languishing over many presidential administrations,\u201d spokesperson Julie Hartman said.",
      "Parents and advocates say they\u2019ve noticed a difference.",
      "Adrienne Hazel filed a complaint in April after her 20-year-old son Ricky, who has autism, was placed in a public school program without a certified teacher and was not given an individual learning plan. Hazel, of Southfield, Michigan, has not heard from the federal office after receiving an automatic reply when she filed the complaint.",
      "Things moved faster last year when Hazel filed a separate complaint for her son. The office notified Ricky\u2019s school, which Hazel says spurred the district to reach an agreement with her within about three months. This time, she said, it feels like she\u2019s on her own.",
      "\u201cThere has been zero response to this,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s basically going into a babysitting situation. He\u2019s not getting the things that he needs to grow into independence. And he\u2019ll just be aging without getting an education.\u201d",
      "Marcie Lipsitt, a special education advocate in Michigan who worked with Hazel, said such stories are common. She helps families file complaints but warns it could take at least a year before an investigation opens. Some schools have backtracked on previous agreements, she said, yet parents can\u2019t get a response from the federal office.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s horrible. I\u2019m watching children suffer like they\u2019ve never suffered,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no accountability.\u201d",
      "The fate of the Education Department itself is in question as the Trump administration moves ahead with a plan to wind down the agency. A Supreme Court decision Monday cleared the way for the agency to continue mass layoffs and outsource some functions to other agencies. McMahon previously suggested the civil rights work could be managed by the Justice Department.",
      "Still, McMahon said in June that the office was making headway after inheriting a backlog of 20,000 cases from the Biden administration. She told senators the office was catching up on the backlog and keeping up with new complaints.",
      "With half the staff, many question how that\u2019s possible. In a June court order pausing the termination of Office for Civil Rights employees, a federal judge in Boston said the branch is \u201ccurrently incapable of addressing the vast majority\u201d of complaints. More than 200 of the office\u2019s employees remain on leave while that case is decided.",
      "The Office for Civil Rights is responsible for enforcing civil rights laws across the nation\u2019s schools and is often a last resort for parents and students facing discrimination from schools. The office reviews complaints and, for those that meet certain criteria, opens investigations. Others are dismissed or move to a mediation process.",
      "Of the 65 resolution agreements reported this year, 57 were signed after Trump took office. Of those, the vast majority involve complaints of discrimination based on disability, with smaller numbers based on sex or race. Most of the sex discrimination findings deal with keeping transgender athletes out of women\u2019s sports, one of Trump\u2019s campaign promises.",
      "\"OCR will continue to meet its statutory responsibilities while driving to improve efficiency and resolve the longstanding backlog,\u201c Hartman said.",
      "Multiple workers in the office who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation said caseloads have grown too big to manage. In last year\u2019s budget request, the office said it was becoming difficult to keep up when investigative staff averaged 42 cases per person. Some estimates put the current caseload beyond 200.",
      "The employees said it means more cases will languish.",
      "Another parent in Michigan, Casie Clouse, hasn\u2019t heard from the department since she filed a complaint in May. Her son, Brady, who is blind in one eye and has a learning disability, wasn\u2019t getting the type of help his school promised, including access to teachers\u2019 notes and reduced coursework. Brady, 14, made no academic progress in eighth grade, and he\u2019s now heading to high school without the support he needs, his mother said.",

      "The removal of 21 children from a Los Angeles-area couple has put a spotlight on the practice of using surrogates to build a family",
      "The removal of 21 children from the custody of a Los Angeles-area couple has put a spotlight on the practice of using surrogates to build a family. Surrogacy has no federal regulation, leaving it up to states to set the rules if they choose to allow it.",
      "The kids \u2014 15 at the couple's mansion and six more living elsewhere \u2014 were taken by an LA County child welfare agency in May after the parents were accused of failing to intervene in the abuse of a baby by a nanny, police in Arcadia said.",
      "The children range in age from 2 months to 13 years, with most between 1 and 3, police said. The FBI won\u2019t comment but agents are investigating. Silvia Zhang, 38, and Guojun Xuan, 65, have not responded to emails seeking comment.",
      "Police believe Zhang gave birth to one or two of the children while the rest were born by surrogate. Some women who were paid surrogates for the couple now say they were unaware that the couple was accumulating a supersize family, raising questions about their intentions.",
      "\u201cWhat were they going to do with these children?\u201d said Deborah Wald, a lawyer in San Francisco whose expertise includes surrogacy law.",
      "Surrogacy is an agreement between parties to have a woman become pregnant, typically through an embryo transfer, and deliver a baby. The intended parent or parents might struggle with infertility. They also could be same-sex couples.",
      "There\u2019s no limit on how many children someone can have through surrogates or any other method, said Wald, who is not involved in the Arcadia case.",
      "She acknowledged that California is considered a \u201csurrogacy-friendly state\" because it has clear laws around the process.",
      "Both sides are required to have lawyers, and there must be a written, notarized contract before an embryo transfer, Wald said.",
      "\u201cThe legitimate surrogacy community in California is very distressed when things like this happen,\u201d Wald said of surrogates feeling deceived. \u201dWe\u2019ve worked very hard on legal and ethical standards. It hurts everyone when something like this happens.\u201d",
      "There are businesses that act as matchmakers, connecting surrogates to people who want to have children. State business records show a company called Mark Surrogacy Investment LLC had been registered at the Arcadia address of Zhang and Xuan.",
      "It\u2019s not clear if Zhang and Xuan set up the business solely to find surrogates for themselves. State records show the company terminated its business license in June.",
      "Wald said there are no special licensing requirements in California for businesses that match surrogates with intended parents.",
      "Wald said there should have been plenty of checks and balances in the process, noting the role of fertility clinics in handling embryos.",
      "\u201cThe first place typically is the matching program that matches the surrogate with an intended parent. But in this situation the intended parents were the matching program,\u201d Wald said. \u201cI am not familiar with any other prior case where that was true.\u201d",
      "Arcadia police said the six children who were not at the couple's home were found with family friends. The couple's house was \u201cset up for a school environment,\u201d Lt. Kollin Cieadlo said.",
      "Zhang and Xuan were accused of neglect and arrested in May. Charges were not formally pursued at that time in order for an abuse investigation to continue, and detectives now believe there were other instances of abuse, Cieadlo said.",
      "A 2-month-old infant with a traumatic head injury, allegedly at the hands of a nanny, remains in a hospital in stable condition, he said.",
      "California law requires child welfare agencies to prioritize placing children who cannot safely be with their parents in homes with extended family, and requires siblings to be kept together unless it would endanger the child to do so, said Leslie Heimov, the executive director of the Children\u2019s Law Center of California.",
      "The Children\u2019s Law Center has worked with some families with 10 to 12 children, Heimov said. A family with 20 children or more is \u201cunusual,\" she added.",
      "It\u2019s more complicated to find foster homes for larger families that can accommodate all the children\u2019s needs, especially for infants, Heimov said.",
      "In addition to expenses and limited space, it's hard to give infants the proper stimulation and care they need if they are in a home with many other children, she said.",
      "In cases involving many children, the state will sometimes get creative to make sure that siblings can maintain relationships with each other, like placing them in the same neighborhood, or placing them in different but related households, Heimov said.",
      "A case involving over 20 children conceived through surrogacy would \u201cpresent some legal questions,\u201d said Heimov. \u201cBut it would not change our advocacy \u2014 we want every child we represent to be in a loving, safe home.\"",

      "Swollen legs led to President Donald Trump being diagnosed with what\u2019s called chronic venous insufficiency",
      "Swollen legs led to President Donald Trump being diagnosed with what's called chronic venous insufficiency. It's a fairly common condition among older adults but requires a thorough checkup to rule out more serious causes of swelling in the legs. Here are some things to know.",
      "Chronic venous insufficiency, or CVI, happens when veins in the legs can't properly carry blood back to the heart. That can lead to blood pooling in the lower legs. In addition to swelling, usually around the feet and ankles, symptoms can include legs that are achy, heavy feeling or tingly, and varicose veins. Severe cases could trigger leg sores known as ulcers.",
      "Overcoming gravity to pump blood from the feet all the way up to the heart is a challenge, especially when someone is standing or sitting for long periods. So legs veins are lined with one-way valves that keep blood from sliding backward on that journey. Anything that damages those valves can lead to chronic venous insufficiency. Risk factors can include blood clots, vein inflammation known as phlebitis or being overweight.",
      "Doctors must rule out serious causes of leg swelling, such as heart problems, kidney disease or blood clots. Ultrasound exams of the leg veins can help confirm chronic venous insufficiency. According to the Cleveland Clinic, treatment can include wearing compression stockings, elevating the legs and achieving a healthy weight. Also exercise, especially walking, is recommended \u2014 because strong leg muscles can squeeze veins in a way that helps them pump blood. Medications and medical procedures are available for more advanced cases.",

      "Researchers report that eight healthy babies were born with the help of an experimental technique that uses DNA from three people to help mothers avoid passing rare diseases to their children",
      "LONDON -- Eight healthy babies were born in Britain with the help of an experimental technique that uses DNA from three people to help mothers avoid passing devastating rare diseases to their children, researchers reported Wednesday.",
      "Most DNA is found in the nucleus of our cells, and it's that genetic material \u2014 some inherited from mom, some from dad \u2014 that makes us who we are. But there's also some DNA outside of the cell's nucleus, in structures called mitochondria. Dangerous mutations there can cause a range of diseases in children that can lead to muscle weakness, seizures, developmental delays, major organ failure and death.",
      "Testing during the in vitro fertilization process can usually identify whether these mutations are present. But in rare cases, it's not clear.",
      "Researchers have been developing a technique that tries to avoid the problem by using the healthy mitochondria from a donor egg. They reported in 2023 that the first babies had been born using this method, where scientists take genetic material from the mother's egg or embryo, which is then transferred into a donor egg or embryo that has healthy mitochondria but the rest of its key DNA removed.",
      "The latest research \u201cmarks an important milestone,\u201d said Dr. Zev Williams, who directs the Columbia University Fertility Center and was not involved in the work. \u201cExpanding the range of reproductive options \u2026 will empower more couples to pursue safe and healthy pregnancies.\u201d",
      "Using this method means the embryo has DNA from three people \u2014 from the mother's egg, the father's sperm and the donor's mitochondria \u2014 and it required a 2016 U.K. law change to approve it. It is also allowed in Australia but not in many other countries, including the U.S.",
      "Experts at Britain\u2019s Newcastle University and Monash University in Australia reported in the New England Journal of Medicine Wednesday that they performed the new technique in fertilized embryos from 22 patients, which resulted in eight babies that appear to be free of mitochondrial diseases. One woman is still pregnant.",
      "One of the eight babies born had slightly higher than expected levels of abnormal mitochondria, said Robin Lovell-Badge, a stem cell and developmental genetics scientist at the Francis Crick Institute who was not involved in the research. He said it was still not considered a high enough level to cause disease, but should be monitored as the baby develops.",
      "Dr. Andy Greenfield, a reproductive health expert at the University of Oxford, called the work \u201ca triumph of scientific innovation,\u201d and said the method of exchanging mitochondria would only be used for a small number of women for whom other ways of avoiding passing on genetic diseases, like testing embryos at an early stage, was not effective.",
      "Lovell-Badge said the amount of DNA from the donor is insignificant, noting that any resulting child would have no traits from the woman who donated the healthy mitochondria. The genetic material from the donated egg makes up less than 1% of the baby born after this technique.",
      "\u201cIf you had a bone marrow transplant from a donor \u2026 you will have much more DNA from another person,\u201d he said.",
      "In the U.K., every couple seeking a baby born through donated mitochondria must be approved by the country\u2019s fertility regulator. As of this month, 35 patients have been authorized to undergo the technique.",
      "Critics have previously raised concerns, warning that it's impossible to know the impact these sorts of novel techniques might have on future generations.",
      "\u201cCurrently, pronuclear transfer is not permitted for clinical use in the U.S., largely due to regulatory restrictions on techniques that result in heritable changes to the embryo,\" Williams, of Columbia, said in an email. \u201dWhether that will change remains uncertain and will depend on evolving scientific, ethical, and policy discussions.\"",
      "For about a decade, Congress has included provisions in annual funding bills banning the Food and Drug Administration from accepting applications for clinical research involving techniques, \u201cin which a human embryo is intentionally created or modified to include a heritable genetic modification.\u201d",
      "But in countries where the technique is allowed, advocates say it could provide a promising alternative for some families.",
      "Liz Curtis, whose daughter Lily died of a mitochondrial disease in 2006, now works with other families affected by them. She said it was devastating to be told there was no treatment for her eight-month-old baby and that death was inevitable.",
      "She said the diagnosis \u201cturned our world upside down, and yet nobody could tell us very much about it, what it was or how it was going to affect Lily.\u201d Curtis later founded the Lily Foundation in her daughter\u2019s name to raise awareness and support research into the disease, including the latest work done at Newcastle University.",

      "Two university hospitals are pioneering new ways to expand access to the lifesaving heart transplants for adults and babies",
      "WASHINGTON -- Two university hospitals are pioneering new ways to expand lifesaving heart transplants for adults and babies \u2014 advances that could help recover would-be heart donations that too often go unused.",
      "The new research aims to overcome barriers for using organs from someone who dies when their heart stops. Called DCD, or donation after circulatory death, it involves a controversial recovery technique or the use of expensive machines.",
      "Surgeons at Duke and Vanderbilt universities reported Wednesday that they\u2019ve separately devised simpler approaches to retrieve those hearts. In the New England Journal of Medicine, they described successfully transplanting hearts to a 3-month-old infant at Duke and three men at Vanderbilt.",
      "\u201cThese DCD hearts work just as well as hearts from brain-dead donors,\u201d said Vanderbilt lead author Dr. Aaron M. Williams.",
      "Most transplanted hearts come from donors who are brain dead. In those situations, the body is left on a ventilator that keeps the heart beating until the organs are removed.",
      "Circulatory death occurs when someone has a nonsurvivable brain injury but because all brain function hasn\u2019t ceased, the family decides to withdraw life support and the heart stops. That means organs can spend a while without oxygen before being recovered, a time lag usually doable for kidneys and other organs but that can raise questions about the quality of hearts.",
      "To counter damage and determine whether DCD organs are usable, surgeons can pump blood and oxygen to the deceased donor\u2019s abdominal and chest organs \u2014 after clamping off access to the brain. But it\u2019s ethically controversial to artificially restore circulation even temporarily and some hospitals prohibit that technique, called normothermic regional perfusion, or NRP.",
      "Another option is to \u201creanimate\u201d DCD organs in a machine that pumps blood and nutrients on the way to the transplant hospital. The machines are expensive and complex, and Duke\u2019s Dr. Joseph Turek said the devices can\u2019t be used for young children\u2019s small hearts \u2014 the age group with the most dire need.",
      "Turek\u2019s team found a middle ground: Remove the heart and attach some tubes of oxygen and blood to briefly assess its ability to function \u2014 not in a machine but on a sterile table in the operating room.",
      "They practiced with piglets. Then came the real test. At another hospital, life support was about to be withdrawn from a 1-month-old whose family wanted to donate \u2014 and who would be a good match for a 3-month-old Duke patient in desperate need of a new heart. The other hospital didn\u2019t allow the controversial NRP recovery technique but let Turek\u2019s team test the experimental alternative.",
      "It took just five minutes to tell \u201cthe coronary arteries are filling well, it\u2019s pink, it\u2019s beating,\u201d Turek said. The team promptly put the little heart on ice and raced it back to Duke.",
      "Vanderbilt\u2019s system is even simpler: Infuse the heart with a nutrient-rich, cold preservative solution before removing it from the donor\u2019s body, similar to how hearts from brain-dead donors are handled.",
      "That \u201creplenishes the nutrients that are depleted during the dying process and helps protect it for transport,\u201d Williams explained, adding that Vanderbilt has performed about 25 such transplants so far. \u201cOur view is you don\u2019t necessarily need to reanimate the heart.\u201d",
      "There's a huge need for more transplantable hearts. Hundreds of thousands of adults suffer from advanced heart failure, yet many are never even offered a transplant because of the organ shortage.",
      "Every year about 700 children in the U.S. are added to the transplant list for a new heart and about 20% die waiting. Turek said infants are at particular risk.",
      "Last year, people whose lives ended via circulatory death made up 43% of the nation\u2019s deceased donors \u2014 but just 793 of the 4,572 heart transplants.",
      "That's why many specialists say finding ways to use more of those hearts is crucial. The new studies are small and early-stage but promising, said Brendan Parent of NYU Langone Health, who directs transplant ethics and policy research.",
      "\u201cInnovation to find ways to recover organs successfully after circulatory death are essential for reducing the organ shortage,\u201d he said.",
      "If alternatives pan out, \u201cI absolutely think that cardiac programs will be thrilled, especially at hospitals that have rejected NRP.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- For decades, proponents of psychedelic drugs have come to Washington with a provocative message: Illegal, mind-altering substances like LSD and ecstasy should be approved for Americans grappling with depression, trauma and other hard-to-treat conditions.",
      "A presidential administration finally seems to agree.",
      "\u201cThis line of therapeutics has tremendous advantage if given in a clinical setting and we are working very hard to make sure that happens within 12 months,\u201d Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently told members of Congress.",
      "His suggested timeline for green-lighting psychedelic therapy surprised even the most bullish supporters of the drugs. And it comes as psychedelics are making inroads in deep red states like Texas, where former Trump cabinet secretary and ex-governor Rick Perry has thrown his full support behind the effort.",
      "The administration's embrace of psychedelics has sparked both excitement as well as concern from those in the field, who worry the drugs might be discredited if they appear to be rushed onto the market or are too closely linked with Kennedy, who is known for controversial views on vaccines, antidepressants and fluoride.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m quite optimistic,\u201d says Rick Doblin, whose organization has pursed the medical use of MDMA (or ecstasy) since the 1980s. \u201cBut I\u2019m also worried that the message the public might get is \u2018Well, RFK likes psychedelics and now it\u2019s approved.\u2019\u201d",
      "Under President Joe Biden, the FDA rejected MDMA as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, citing flawed data and questionable research. Regulators called for a new study, likely taking several years. It was a major setback for Doblin and other advocates hoping to see the first U.S. approval of a psychedelic for medical use.",
      "But the agency appears ready to reconsider. FDA chief Marty Makary, who reports to Kennedy, has called the evaluation of MDMA and other psychedelics \u201ca top priority,\u201d announcing a slate of initiatives that could be used to accelerate their approval.",
      "One new program promises to expedite drugs that serve \u201cthe health interests of Americans,\u201d by slashing their review time from six months or more to as little as one month. Makary has also suggested greater flexibility on requirements for certain drugs, potentially waiving rigorous controlled studies that compare patients to a placebo group.",
      "That approach, considered essential for high-quality research, has long been a stumbling point for psychedelic studies, in which patients can almost always correctly guess whether they\u2019ve received the drug or a dummy pill.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and FDA also recently hired several new staffers with ties to the psychedelic movement.",
      "\u201cThese are all very promising signs that the administration is aware of the potential of psychedelics and is trying to make overtures that they\u2019re ready to approve them,\u201d said Greg Ferenstein, a fellow at the libertarian Reason Foundation, who also consults for psychedelic companies. \u201cWe didn\u2019t hear anything about that in the Biden administration\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for HHS did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "As a presidential candidate, Kennedy discussed how his son and several close friends benefited from using psychedelics to deal with grief and other issues.",
      "A number of veterans lobbying for psychedelic access have already met with Trump's Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Doug Collins.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing so far is positive,\u201d Collins told House lawmakers in May.",
      "But some experts worry the hope and hype surrounding psychedelics has gotten ahead of the science.",
      "Philip Corlett, a psychiatric researcher at Yale University, says bypassing rigorous clinical trials could set back the field and jeopardize patients.",
      "\"If RFK and the new administration are serious about this work, there are things they could do to shepherd it into reality by meeting the benchmarks of medical science,\" Corlett said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d",
      "As officials in Washington weigh the future of psychedelics, some states are moving ahead with their own projects in hopes of nudging the federal government. Oregon and Colorado have legalized psychedelic therapy.",
      "And last month, Texas approved $50 million to study ibogaine, a potent psychedelic made from a shrub that's native to West Africa, as a treatment for opioid addiction, PTSD and other conditions. The research grant \u2014 the largest of its kind by any government \u2014 passed with support from the state's former GOP governor, Perry, and combat veterans, some who have traveled to clinics in Mexico that offer ibogaine.",
      "Ibogaine is on the U.S. government\u2019s ultra-restrictive list of illegal, Schedule 1 drugs, which also includes heroin. So advocates in Texas are hoping to build a national movement to ease restrictions on researching its use.",
      "\u201cGovernmental systems move slowly and inefficiently,\u201d said Bryan Hubbard of Americans for Ibogaine, a group formed with Perry. \u201cSometimes you find yourself constrained in terms of the progress you can make from within.\u201d",
      "Ibogaine is unique among psychedelics in both its purported benefits and risks. Small studies and anecdotal reports suggest the drug may be able to dramatically ease addiction and trauma. It was sold for medical use in France for several decades starting in the 1930s, but the drug can also cause dangerous irregular heart rhythms, which can be fatal if left untreated.",
      "Some veterans who have taken the drug say the risks can be managed and ibogaine\u2019s healing properties go far beyond antidepressants, mood stabilizers, counseling and other standard treatments.",
      "Marcus Capone struggled with anger, insomnia and mood swings after 13 years as a Navy Seal. In 2017, at the urging of his wife Amber, he agreed to try ibogaine as a last resort. He described his first ibogaine session as \u201ca complete purge of everything.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut afterward I felt the weight just completely off my shoulders,\u201d he said. \u201cNo more anxiety, no more depression, life made sense all of a sudden.\u201d",
      "A nonprofit founded by the Capones, Veterans Exploring Treatment Solutions, or VETS, has helped over 1,000 veterans travel abroad to receive ibogaine and other psychedelics.",
      "But federal scientists have looked at the drug before \u2014 three decades ago, when the National Institute on Drug Abuse funded preliminary studies on using it as an addiction treatment. The research was discontinued after it identified \u201ccardiovascular toxicity.\"",
      "\u201cIt would be dead in the water,\u201d in terms of winning FDA approval, longtime NIDA director Nora Volkow said.",
      "But Volkow said her agency remains interested in psychedelics, including ibogaine, and is funding an American drugmaker that's working to develop a safer, synthetic version of the drug.",
      "\u201cI am very intrigued by their pharmacological properties and how they are influencing the brain,\u201d Volkow said. \u201cBut you also have to be very mindful not to fall into the hype and to be objective and rigorous in evaluating them.\u201d",

In recent weeks, companies including Nestle, Kraft Heinz and General Mills said they would pull artificial colors from their foods, too.",
      "\u201cThis is a Renaissance moment for health in America,\" U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference.",
      "About 40 makers of ice cream and frozen dairy desserts said they would remove seven petroleum-based dyes from their products by 2028, according to Michael Dykes, president of the International Dairy Foods Association. The colors are Red 3, Red 40, Green 3, Blue 1, Blue 2, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6. The trade group wouldn't identify the firms, although Turkey Hill Dairy chief executive Andy Jacobs joined the gathering.",
      "The national focus on artificial food dyes is \u201ca good step to take,\" but officials should not ignore larger known contributors to chronic disease, including the added sugars and saturated fat commonly found in ice cream, said Deanna Hoelscher, a University of Texas nutrition expert.",
      "\u201cJust taking out or changing the food dye source is not necessarily going to make it a healthy option,\u201d she said. \u201cIt still is a food that should be consumed in moderation.\u201d",
      "However, Makary also hinted that new federal dietary guidelines, expected later this year, would challenge established links between saturated fat and heart disease, ending what he called \u201ca 70-year demonization of natural saturated fat.\u201d",
      "The average American eats about 4 gallons of ice cream a year, the IDFA said.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies showing that they may cause some neurobehavioral problems, such as hyperactivity and attention problems, in some children. The Food and Drug Administration has maintained that approved dyes are safe and that \u201cmost children have no adverse effects\u201d when consuming foods made with them.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has criticized the dyes and pressured manufacturers to remove them from foods. In their place, manufacturers should use dyes made from fruit juices, plant extracts and other sources, federal officials said.",
      "The FDA has approved new natural color additives in recent months, including a new blue color made from the fruit of the gardenia announced Monday. Gardenia (genipin) blue is approved for use in sports drinks, candies and certain other products, the agency said.",
      "Makary also sent a letter to food manufacturers on Monday that \u201cencourages\u201d them to speed up removal of the dye known as Red 3, which was banned in January. Food makers have until 2027 to remove the dye, which was found to cause cancer in laboratory rats, but not humans.",
      "Some food companies have said they will stop using artificial dyes, but relying on voluntary action rather than regulatory requirements won't guarantee compliance, said Thomas Galligan, a scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group.",
      "\u201cTalk is cheap,\u201d Galligan said. \u201cIt's easy for companies to make promises to look like they're being compliant and generate goodwill among consumers and the Trump administration, but it remains to be seen if they will actually follow through.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "South Africa has played a historic, global role in scientific research, from COVID-19 vaccines to HIV",
      "JOHANNESBURG -- Just a week had remained before scientists in South Africa were to begin clinical trials of an HIV vaccine, and hopes were high for another step toward limiting one of history's deadliest pandemics. Then the email arrived.",
      "Stop all work, it said. The United States under the Trump administration was withdrawing all its funding.",
      "The news devastated the researchers, who live and work in a region where more people live with HIV than anywhere else in the world. Their research project, called BRILLIANT, was meant to be the latest to draw on the region's genetic diversity and deep expertise in the hope of benefiting people everywhere.",
      "But the $46 million from the U.S. for the project was disappearing, part of the dismantling of foreign aid by the world's biggest donor earlier this year as President Donald Trump announced a focus on priorities at home.",
      "South Africa has been hit especially hard because of Trump's baseless claims about the targeting of the country's white Afrikaner minority. The country had been receiving about $400 million a year via USAID and the HIV-focused PEPFAR.",
      "Now that's gone.",
      "Glenda Grey, who heads the Brilliant program, said the African continent has been vital to the development of HIV medication, and the U.S. cuts threaten its capability to do such work in the future.",
      "Significant advances have included clinical trials for lenacapavir, the world\u2019s only twice-a-year shot to prevent HIV, recently approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. One study to show its efficacy involved young South Africans.",
      "\u201cWe do the trials better, faster and cheaper than anywhere else in the world, and so without South Africa as part of these programs, the world, in my opinion, is much poorer,\u201d Gray said.",
      "She noted that during the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic, South Africa played a crucial role by testing the Johnson & Johnson and Novavax vaccines, and South African scientists' genomic surveillance led to the identification of an important variant.",
      "A team of researchers at the University of the Witwatersrand has been part of the unit developing the HIV vaccines for the trials.",
      "Inside the Wits laboratory, technician Nozipho Mlotshwa was among the young people in white gowns working on samples, but she may soon be out of a job.",
      "Her position is grant-funded. She uses her salary to support her family and fund her studies in a country where youth unemployment hovers around 46%.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very sad and devastating, honestly,\" she said of the U.S. cuts and overall uncertainty. \u201cWe\u2019ll also miss out collaborating with other scientists across the continent.\u201d",
      "Professor Abdullah Ely leads the team of researchers. He said the work had promising results indicating that the vaccines were producing an immune response.",
      "But now that momentum, he said, has \u201call kind of had to come to a halt.\u201d",
      "The BRILLIANT program is scrambling to find money to save the project. The purchase of key equipment has stopped. South Africa's health department says about 100 researchers for that program and others related to HIV have been laid off. Funding for postdoctoral students involved in experiments for the projects is at risk.",
      "South Africa's government has estimated that universities and science councils could lose about $107 million in U.S. research funding over the next five years due to the aid cuts, which affect not only work on HIV but also tuberculosis \u2014 another disease with a high number of cases in the country.",
      "South Africa\u2019s government has said it will be very difficult to find funding to replace the U.S. support.",
      "And now the number of HIV infections will grow. Medication is more difficult to obtain. At least 8,000 health workers in South Africa's HIV program have already been laid off, the government has said. Also gone are the data collectors who tracked patients and their care, as well as HIV counselors who could reach vulnerable patients in rural communities.",
      "For researchers, Universities South Africa, an umbrella body, has applied to the national treasury for over $110 million for projects at some of the largest schools.",
      "During a visit to South Africa in June, UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima was well aware of the stakes, and the lives at risk, as research and health care struggle in South Africa and across Africa at large.",
      "Other countries that were highly dependent on U.S. funding including Zambia, Nigeria, Burundi and Ivory Coast are already increasing their own resources, she said.",
      "\u201cBut let\u2019s be clear, what they are putting down will not be funding in the same way that the American resources were funding,\" Byanyima said.",

      "Supporters of Bangladesh\u2019s largest Islamist party, Jamaat-e-Islami, have held a massive rally in Dhaka, signaling their growing influence",
      "DHAKA, Bangladesh -- Hundreds of thousands of supporters of Bangladesh\u2019s largest Islamist party rallied in the capital on Saturday to show their strength ahead of elections expected next year, as the South Asian nation stands a t a crossroads after the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.",
      "An interim government headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus said the next election would be held in April but his administration did not rule out a possibility of polls in February as strongly demanded by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and its allies.",
      "Jamaat-e-Islami, which had sided with Pakistan during Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971, said earlier it would mobilize 1 million people on Saturday.",
      "While Hasina was in power from 2009 until she was toppled in student-led protests last year and fled to India, top leaders of Jamaat-e-Islami were either executed or jailed on charges of crimes against humanity and other serious crimes in 1971. In late march in 1971 Pakistan\u2019s military had launched a violent crackdown on the city of Dhaka, then part of East Pakistan, to quell a rising nationalist movement seeking independence for what is today known as Bangladesh.",
      "The party on Saturday placed a seven-point demand to the Yunus-led administration to ensure a free, fair and peaceful election, the trial of all mass killings, essential reforms and proclamation and implementation of a charter involving last year\u2019s mass uprising. It also wants the introduction of a proportional representation system in the election.",
      "Thousands of supporters of Jamaat-e-Islami had spent the night on the Dhaka University campus before the rally. On Saturday morning, they continued to stream toward the Suhrawardy Udyan, a historical ground where the Pakistani army had surrendered to a joint force of India and Bangladesh on Dec. 16 in 1971, ending the nine-month war.",
      "It was the first time the party was allowed to hold a rally on this ground since 1971. To many, the decision signaled a shift supported by Yunus' government in which Islamists are gaining momentum with further fragmentation of Bangladesh\u2019s politics and shrinking of liberal forces.",
      "Hasina, whose father was the independence leader and the country\u2019s first president, is a fierce political rival of Jamaat-e-Islami. The party is expected to contest 300 parliamentary seats and is attempting to forge alliances with other Islamist groups and parties in hopes of becoming a third force in the country behind the BNP, headed by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, and Hasina\u2019s former ruling Awami League party.",
      "The party has a close connection with a new political party formed by students who led the anti-Hasina uprising. Both Jamaat-e-Islami and the students' National Citizen Party also promote anti-India campaign.",
      "The Yunus-led administration has banned the Awami League and Hasina has been in exile in India since Aug. 5. She is facing charges of crimes against humanity. The United Nations said in February that up to 1,400 people may have been killed during the anti-Hasina uprising in July-August last year.",

      "This comes as government forces, initially deployed to restore order but effectively sided with the Bedouins against the Druze, were redeployed to halt renewed fighting that erupted late Thursday. The violence has also drawn airstrikes against Syrian forces by neighboring Israel before a truce was reached.",
      "In his second televised address since the fighting started, al-Sharaa blamed \u201carmed groups from Sweida\u201d for reigniting the conflict by \u201claunching retaliatory attacks against the Bedouins and their families.\u201d He also said Israeli intervention \u201cpushed the country into a dangerous phase.\"",
      "Israel had launched dozens of airstrikes on convoys of government fighters and even struck the Syrian Defense Ministry headquarters in central Damascus, saying it was in support of the Druze, who form a substantial community in Israel and are seen as a loyal minority and often serve in the Israeli military.",
      "Reports had surfaced of Syrian government-affiliated fighters executing Druze civilians and looting and burning homes over the four-day violence.",
      "U.S. Envoy to Syria Tom Barrack announced that Israel and Syria had agreed to a ceasefire early Saturday, but al-Sharaa made no direct reference to the agreement in his speech, but said \u201cAmerican and Arab mediations stepped in\u201d to restore calm.",
      "Addressing the Bedouins, al-Sharaa said they \u201ccannot replace the role of the state in handling the country\u2019s affairs and restoring security.\u201d He also said: \u201cWe thank the Bedouins for their heroic stances but demand they fully commit to the ceasefire and comply with the state\u2019s orders.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a prominent Druze leader, Sheikh Hikmat Al-Hijri, who opposes the current government and has distanced himself from the two ceasefires announced on Tuesday and Wednesday, said an agreement, brokered under the sponsorship of guarantor states, has several measures aimed at de-escalating tensions in Suweida.",
      "This includes the deployment of General Security checkpoints outside the province\u2019s administrative borders to contain clashes and prevent infiltration, a 48-hour ban on entry by any party into border villages, and safe, guaranteed passage for remaining members of the Bedouin tribes still inside the province.",
      "Sharaa reiterated that Suweida \u201cremains an integral part of the Syrian state, and the Druze constitute a fundamental pillar of the Syrian national fabric,\" vowing to protect all minorities in Syria.",
      "He also thanked the United States for its \u201csignificant role in affirming its support for Syria during these difficult times,\u201d as well as Arab countries and Turkey, who mediated Wednesday's truce.",
      "More than half of the roughly 1 million Druze worldwide live in Syria. Most of the other Druze live in Lebanon and Israel, including in the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War and annexed in 1981.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s ousted conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol was indicted Saturday on additional criminal charges related to his ill-fated imposition of martial law, about three months after he was formally thrown out of office.",
      "Yoon\u2019s additional indictments mean he will remain in jail for up to six months as he faces a trial at the Seoul Central District Court on his Dec. 3 martial law declaration that plunged South Korea into huge political turmoil. Yoon was sent back to prison last week after the Seoul court approved his arrest warrant requested by a team of investigators headed by independent counsel Cho Eun-suk.",
      "Cho\u2019s team indicted Yoon on abuse of power that obstructed the rights of some of his Cabinet members. The charge was imposed because Yoon summoned only select Cabinet members to approve his emergency martial law when South Korean law requires approval of all Cabinet members for such a measure, Park Ji-young, a senior investigator at Cho\u2019s team, told a briefing.",
      "Park said Yoon was also charged with fabricating an official document in an attempt to satisfy a formal requirement for a martial law declaration before he eventually destroyed it.",
      "After declaring martial law, Yoon sent troops and police officers to the opposition-controlled National Assembly, but enough lawmakers managed to enter an assembly chamber and voted down his decree, forcing his Cabinet to lift it. Yoon was later impeached by the assembly, with some of his ruling party lawmakers voting to suspend his presidential powers.",
      "Yoon has argued his decree was a desperate attempt to draw public support of his fight against the \u201cwickedness\u201d of the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which had obstructed his agenda, impeached top officials and slashed the government\u2019s budget bill. He earlier called the National Assembly \u201ca den of criminals\u201d and \u201canti-state forces.\u201d",
      "In January, state prosecutors arrested and indicted him on rebellion, a grave charge that would incur the death penalty or life imprisonment if convicted.",
      "In March, however, Yoon was released from prison after a judge at the Seoul district court canceled his arrest to allow him to stand trial without being held in custody.",
      "In April, the Constitutional Court formally dismissed Yoon as president, prompting a snap election to choose his successor. After winning that election, new President Lee Jae Myung, a former Democratic Party leader, approved legislation to launch independent investigations to uncover fuller details of Yoon's martial law stunt and delve into other criminal allegations involving his wife and administration. Lee named Cho an independent counsel to lead an investigation on Yoon's martial law decree.",
      "In May, state prosecutors indicted Yoon on charges of abusing power and forcing soldiers and police officers to try to seal the assembly and election offices, acts that are not part of their duties.",

      "The head of Myanmar\u2019s military government made a rare appearance at a ceremony on Saturday honoring General Aung San, an independence hero and father of jailed former leader Aung San Suu Kyi",
      "BANGKOK -- The head of Myanmar\u2019s military government made a rare appearance at a ceremony on Saturday honoring General Aung San, an independence hero and father of jailed former leader Aung San Suu Kyi.",
      "It was the first time that 69-year-old Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing attended the Martyrs' Day wreath-laying since the army ousted Suu Kyi and seized power in February 2021. The leader's appearance comes as his embattled government is preparing to hold elections while fighting armed opposition groups across the country.",
      "Martyrs\u2019 Day was an important event in Myanmar\u2019s calendar for decades, but the military has downplayed the holiday in recent years. It commemorates the assassination of Aung San, a former Prime Minister who was gunned down at the age of 32 along with six Cabinet colleagues and two other officials in 1947, just months before the country \u2014 then called Burma \u2014 achieved freedom from British colonial rule. A political rival, former Prime Minister U Saw, was tried and hanged for plotting the attack.",
      "Suu Kyi, who was detained when the army took over in 2021, was absent from the event for a fifth consecutive year. She is currently serving a 27-year prison term on what are widely regarded as contrived charges meant to keep her from political activity. She has not been seen in public since her arrest.",
      "Ye Aung Than, a son of Suu Kyi\u2019s estranged older brother, laid a wreath in front of his grandfather\u2019s tomb during the main ceremony at the Martyrs\u2019 Mausoleum near the foot of the towering Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon.",
      "With Myanmar national flags flying at half-staff, members of the ruling military council, and cabinet, as well as high-ranking military generals joined Min Aung Hlaing in placing a basket of flowers in front of the tombs of the nine martyrs.",
      "As the ceremony was held, people in Yangon paid tribute to independence leaders by blaring car horns and sirens at 10:37 a.m., the time of the 1947 attack.",
      "Democracy supporters also held scattered rallies in parts of the country that are not under military control.",
      "The event comes five months before elections that the military has promised to hold by the end of this year.",
      "The poll is widely seen as an attempt to legitimize the military\u2019s seizure of power through the ballot box and is expected to deliver a result that ensures the generals retain control.",
      "The 2021 military takeover was met with widespread nonviolent protests, but after peaceful demonstrations were put down with lethal force, many opponents of military rule took up arms, and large parts of the country are now embroiled in conflict.",
      "Since the army took power, 6,974 people including poets, activists, politicians and others have been killed, and 29,405 people have been arrested by the security forces, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, an independent organization that keeps detailed tallies of arrests and casualties linked to the nation\u2019s political conflicts. The military government calls that figure an exaggeration.",
      "The military, which is now estimated to control less than half the country, has been accelerating its counter-offensives to retake areas controlled by opposition groups ahead of the election.",

      "TOKYO -- Decontaminated but slightly radioactive soil from Fukushima was delivered Saturday to the Japanese prime minister's office to be reused in an effort to showcase its safety.",
      "This is the first soil to be used, aside from experiments, since the 2011 nuclear disaster when the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant suffered a cataclysmic meltdown following an earthquake and tsunami that left large amounts of radioactive materials spewing out from the facility, polluting surrounding areas.",
      "The government is desperate to set people's minds at ease about recycling the 14 million cubic meters of decontaminated soil, enough to fill 11 baseball stadiums, collected after massive clean-ups and stored at a sprawling outdoor facility near the Fukushima plant. Officials have pledged to find final disposal sites outside of Fukushima by 2045.",

The soil does not include any from inside the plant.",
      "Despite assurances, there has been much public unease. The government has already been forced to scrap a plan to experiment using some of the soil in flower beds at several public parks in and around Tokyo following protests.",

      "Violence between government forces and armed factions of a religious minority in southern Syria this week has deepened divisions in a country still recuperating from a civil war",
      "BEIRUT -- An eruption of violence in Syria this week that entangled government forces, Bedouin tribes, the Druze religious minority and neighboring Israel highlighted just how combustible the country remains seven months after its longtime authoritarian leader was toppled.",
      "The Druze and other minorities increasingly mistrust a central government run by a man once affiliated with al-Qaida, even though he has pledged to protect Syria\u2019s diverse ethnic and religious groups since helping to oust Bashar Assad after a nearly 14-year civil war.",
      "This sectarian turbulence within Syria threatens to shake-up postwar alliances and exacerbate regional tensions, experts say. It could also potentially draw the country closer to Turkey and away from Israel, with whom it has been quietly engaging since Assad\u2019s fall, with encouragement from the Trump administration.",
      "Deadly clashes broke out last Sunday in the southern province of Sweida between Druze militias and local Sunni Muslim Bedouin tribes.",
      "Government forces intervened, ostensibly to restore order, but ended up trying to wrest control of Sweida from the Druze factions that control it.",
      "Hundreds were killed in the fighting, and some government fighters allegedly executed Druze civilians and burned and looted their houses.",
      "Driven by concerns about security and domestic politics, Israel intervened on behalf of the Druze, who are seen as a loyal minority within Israel and often serve in its military.",
      "Israeli warplanes bombarded the Syrian Defense Ministry\u2019s headquarters in central Damascus and struck near the presidential palace. It was an apparent warning to the country's interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, who led Islamist rebels that overthrew Assad but has since preached coexistence and sought ties with with the West. The Israeli army also struck government forces in Sweida.",
      "By Wednesday, a truce had been mediated that allowed Druze factions and clerics to maintain security in Sweida as government forces pulled out \u2014 although fighting persisted between Druze and Bedouin forces. Early Saturday, U.S. envoy to Syria Tom Barrack announced a separate ceasefire had been brokered between Israel and Syria.",
      "This past week\u2019s clashes aren\u2019t the first instance of sectarian violence in Syria since the fall of Assad.",
      "A few months after Assad fled and after a transition that initially was mostly peaceful, government forces and pro-Assad armed groups clashed on Syria's coast. That spurred sectarian attacks that killed hundreds of civilians from the Alawite religious minority to which Assad belongs.",
      "Those killings left other minority groups, including the Druze in the south, and the Kurds in the northeast \u2013 who have a de facto autonomous area under their control -- wary that the country\u2019s new leaders would protect them.",
      "Violence is only part of the problem. Syria\u2019s minority groups only have been given what many see as token representation in the interim government, according to Bassam Alahmad, executive director of Syrians for Truth and Justice, a civil society organization.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a transitional period. We should have a dialogue, and they (the minorities) should feel that they\u2019re a real part of the state,\u201d Alahmad said. Instead, with the incursion into Sweida, the new authorities have sent a message that they would use military force to \u201ccontrol every part of Syria,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cBashar Assad tried this way,\u201d and it failed, he added.",
      "On the other hand, supporters of the new government fear that its decision to back down in Sweida could signal to other minorities that it\u2019s OK to demand their own autonomous regions, which would fragment and weaken the country.",
      "If Damascus cedes security control of Sweida to the Druze, \u201cof course everyone else is going to demand the same thing,\u201d said Abdel Hakim al-Masri, a former official in the Turkish-backed regional government in Syria\u2019s northwest before Assad\u2019s fall.",
      "\u201cThis is what we are afraid of,\u201d he said.",
      "Before this week\u2019s flare-up between Israel and Syria, and despite a long history of suspicion between the two countries, the Trump administration had been pushing their leaders to post-Assad to work toward normalizing relations \u2013 meaning that Syria would formally recognize Israel and establish diplomatic relations, or at least enter into some limited agreement on security matters.",
      "Syrian officials have acknowledged holding indirect talks with Israel, but defusing decades of tension was never going to be easy.",
      "After Assad\u2019s fall, Israeli forces seized control of a U.N.-patrolled buffer zone in Syria and carried out airstrikes on military sites in what Israeli officials said was a move to create a demilitarized zone south of Damascus.",
      "Dareen Khalifa, a senior adviser at the International Crisis Group, said she believes Israel could have gotten the same result through negotiations.",
      "But now it\u2019s unlikely Syria will be willing to continue down the path of reconciliation with Israel, at least in the short term, she said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how the Israelis could expect to drop bombs on Damascus and still have some kind of normal dialogue with the Syrians,\u201d said Colin Clarke, a senior research fellow at the Soufan Center, a New York-based organization that focuses on global security challenges. \u201cJust like Netanyahu, al-Sharaa\u2019s got a domestic constituency that he\u2019s got to answer to.\u201d",
      "Yet even after the events of this past week, the Trump administration still seems to have hope of keeping the talks alive. U.S. officials are \u201cengaging diplomatically with Israel and Syria at the highest levels, both to address the present crisis and reach a lasting agreement between two sovereign states,\u201d says Dorothy Shea, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.",
      "Shea said during a U.N. Security Council emergency meeting on Thursday that \u201cthe United States did not support recent Israeli strikes.\u201d",
      "During Syria\u2019s civil war, the U.S. was allied with Kurdish forces in the country\u2019s northeast in their fight against the Islamic State militant group.",
      "But since Assad\u2019s fall, the U.S. has begun gradually pulling its forces out of Syria and has encouraged the Kurds to integrate their forces with those of the new authorities in Damascus.",
      "To that end, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces agreed in March to a landmark deal that would merge them with the national army. But implementation has stalled. A major sticking point has been whether the SDF would remain as a cohesive unit in the new army or be dissolved completely.",
      "Khalifa said the conflict in Sweida is \u201cdefinitely going to complicate\u201d those talks.",
      "Not only are the Kurds mistrustful of government forces after their attacks on Alawite and Druze minorities, but now they also view them as looking weak. \u201cLet\u2019s be frank, the government came out of this looking defeated,\u201d Khalifa said.",
      "It\u2019s possible that the Kurds, like the Druze, might look to Israel for support, but Turkey is unlikely to stand by idly if they do, Khalifa said.",
      "The Turkish government considers the SDF a terrorist organization because of its association with the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, which has waged a long-running insurgency in Turkey. For that reason, it has long wanted to curtail the group\u2019s influence just across its border.",
      "Israel\u2019s latest military foray in Syria could give its new leaders an incentive to draw closer to Ankara, according to Clarke. That could include pursuing a defense pact that has been discussed but not implemented.",
      "Turkish defense ministry officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity according to procedures, said that if requested, Ankara is ready to assist Syria in strengthening its defense capabilities.",

      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff threat against Brazil has sparked political turmoil",
      "SAO PAULO -- U.S. President Donald Trump may have thought that pressuring Brazil with higher tariffs would help his ally, the country's former President Jair Bolsonaro, but the move apparently backfired.",
      "Last week, Trump sent a letter to Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva threatening a 50% import tax and directly linking the decision to Bolsonaro\u2019s trial, which he called a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis trial should end immediately!\u201d Trump wrote Thursday evening in a second letter, this one addressed to Bolsonaro. He added that he had \u201cstrongly voiced\u201d his disapproval through his tariff policy.",
      "Rather than backing down, Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court escalated the case, worsening Bolsonaro\u2019s legal troubles. On Friday morning, federal police raided Bolsonaro\u2019s home and political office. The former president was ordered to wear an ankle monitor, banned from using social media, and hit with other restrictions.",
      "Meanwhile, President Lula \u2014 who was facing higher unpopularity, growing opposition in Congress and increasing risks to his likely reelection bid \u2014 seems to have gained politically from the situation.",
      "Now the 79-year-old leftist Lula, in office for the third non-consecutive term of his long political career, is seeing renewed acceptance, congressional support against Trump and pleas to run one last time to defend Brazil's sovereignty.",
      "Lula has appeared more energized in public since Trump's announcement. At a national students assembly Thursday, he wore a blue cap reading \u201cSovereign Brazil Unites Us\" \u2014 a contrast to MAGA's red cap.",
      "\u201cA gringo will not give orders to this president,\" he told the crowd, and called the tariff hike \u201cunacceptable blackmail.\u201d",
      "The impact on Lula is not a first. Trump's actions targeting other countries have boosted ideological rivals in Canada and Australia instead of strengthening his allies at a local level.",
      "Private pollster Atlas said Tuesday that Lula\u2019s unpopularity had reversed course after his spat with Trump. Lula's job approval went from at 47.3% in June to 49.7% since the tariffs battle began. The poll of more than 2,800 people was conducted July 11-13, with a margin of error of 2 percentage points. The study also said 62.2% of Brazilians think the higher tariffs are unjustified while 36.8% agree with the measure.",
      "Even Bolsonaro\u2019s former vice president, Sen. Hamilton Mour\u00e3o, criticized Trump\u2019s move as undue interference in Brazil\u2019s politics, though he said he agreed the trial against the far-right leader is biased against him.",
      "Social media analytics firm Palver analyzed 20,000 messages about Trump on WhatsApp, Brazil\u2019s most widely used communication platform, a day after Trump's announcement. Its analysis said right-wing users dominated viral content, but spontaneous conversations leaned left, mocking Bolsonaro as submissive and defending Brazil\u2019s sovereignty.",
      "\u201cTrump has put Lula back in the game,\u201d said Thomas Traumann, an independent political consultant and former spokesman for the Brazilian presidency who only weeks ago argued that Lula had lost his front-runner status in the presidential race as he struggled to deliver on his promises on the economy.",
      "\u201cTrump handed it to Lula on a silver platter,\u201d Traumann said.",
      "Business leaders who until recently sided with Bolsonaro are having to court Lula to negotiate with Trump. Agribusiness, Brazil\u2019s largest economic sector and a traditional right-wing stronghold, united to criticize the U.S. president's move. Industry groups were quick to denounce the tariffs as politically motivated and lacking any commercial justification.",
      "\u201cIn general, with the major exception of a more radical conservative wing, (Trump\u2019s move) generated national outrage for violating Brazil\u2019s sovereignty,\u201d lawmaker Arnaldo Jardim, a member of the congressional agricultural caucus, told The Associated Press.",
      "Jardim, who pushed for the approval of a reciprocity bill that could be used by Lula if there\u2019s no agreement until the Aug. 1 deadline, hardly sides with the president.",
      "\u201cEven among sectors that initially thought this could benefit Bolsonaro, many had to reconsider their positions,\u201d he said.",
      "Top congressional leaders who recently helped nix a Lula decree to raise a transactions tax were moving toward a head-on collision with him. After Trump\u2019s announcement, they signed a joint statement agreeing with Lula's promise to use the reciprocity law against the U.S.",
      "In another change, Brazil\u2019s Congress decided to start moving on Lula\u2019s plan to give an income tax break to millions of poorer Brazilians. Many politicians said that such initiative was dead after Lula became the first president in three decades to have a decree annulled by lawmakers.",
      "At the Supreme Court, Bolsonaro is only getting deeper into trouble as his trial continues.",
      "Earlier this week, Brazil\u2019s chief prosecutor called for a guilty verdict, accusing the former president of leading an armed criminal organization, attempting to stage a coup and attempting violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, among other charges.",
      "The defense will next likely present its case in the coming weeks, after which the panel of Supreme Court justices in the trial will vote on whether to convict or acquit him.",
      "The former president also suffered more consequences \u2014 the court's latest restrictions on Bolsonaro, including the ankle monitor, are part of a second investigation against one of his sons, Eduardo Bolsonaro, a Brazilian lawmaker who currently lives in the United States and is known for his close ties to Trump. He has been under scrutiny for allegedly working with U.S. authorities to impose sanctions against Brazilian officials.",
      "Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who oversees criminal cases against Bolsonaro, said his and his son\u2019s actions attempted to pressure the Brazilian judiciary by involving the U.S.",
      "The court\u2019s decision cited both Trump's letter to Lula and several social media posts by the Bolsonaros in support of sanctions against Brazilian officials and speaking favorably about tariffs.",
      "\u201cA sovereign country like Brazil will always know how to defend its democracy and sovereignty,\u201d de Moraes said. \u201cThe judiciary will not allow any attempt to subject the functioning of the Supreme Court to the scrutiny of another state through hostile acts.\u201d",
      "Jair Bolsonaro told journalists in Brasilia, the country's capital, that the ankle monitoring was a \u201csupreme humiliation.\u201d",
      "\u201cI never thought about leaving Brazil, I never thought about going to an embassy, but the precautionary measures are because of that,\u201d the former president said.",
      "In a statement, Eduardo Bolsonaro accused de Moraes of trying to criminalize Trump and the U.S. government.",
      "\u201cSince he has no power over them, he decided to make my father a hostage,\u201d the younger Bolsonaro said of the judge.",

      "Artisans in South Sudan are turning discarded tires into affordable footwear as the country faces a severe economic crisis",
      "WAU, South Sudan -- From Rwanda to Kenya, fashioning footwear from discarded tires has long been a mark of local ingenuity.",
      "In South Sudan, however, the creative work of such artisans is now fueled by an economic crisis that has left the government on the verge of bankruptcy and many people struggling to put food on the table.",
      "As South Sudan\u2019s oil revenues have dwindled, the government for months has been unable to pay civil servants on time. The cash crisis affects everyone from soldiers to teachers, underscoring the range of economic hardship across the country, and many are looking for ways to keep going.",
      "Some want cheap shoes, finding them not in supermarkets but in open markets where flip-flops and sandals are fashioned from worn-out tires usually thrown away as rubbish.",
      "In Wau, some 650 kilometers (400 miles) from the South Sudanese capital of Juba, shoemaker Emmanuel Achuil works under the shade of a tarpaulin in the town's bustling main market.",
      "His hands blackened from grappling with rubber, Achuil uses a blade to carve pieces from discarded tires. Colorful straps are scattered around him like pieces of a puzzle.",
      "Achuil, who makes five to 10 pairs a week, told the AP that in recent months he\u2019s seen a rise in demand that he and others say is directly related to the rising cost of living here. They say footwear made from scraps of rubber has found a firm place in local markets, confirmed in the ubiquitous displays of such shoes even in open markets in Juba.",
      "Two years ago, Achuil was getting five to seven customers a month. Now he expects up to 20 of them, he said. Achuil\u2019s shoes can fetch up to 15,000 South Sudanese pounds a pair, or roughly $4, depending on size and quality of finishing. In addition to their affordability, the rough-hewn pairs are praised for their durability.",
      "\u201cEven when things get bad \u2014 no food, no jobs \u2014 this work doesn\u2019t fail me,\u201d Achuil said. \u201cPeople always need shoes, especially cheap ones.\u201d",
      "Akol Majok Ring, a cattle-keeper from the state of Warrap, said he discovered these sandals in March and immediately bought a pair for himself because \u201cthey are good for cattle grazing.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re moving with the cattle all day, these sandals are perfect,\" he said. \u201cThey\u2019re durable and well-suited for the job.\u201d",
      "The South Sudanese pound has been under pressure since 2023, losing much of its value against the dollar as oil exports are sporadically disrupted by civil war in neighboring Sudan.",

    "story": [
      "Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faces a critical test in Sunday\u2019s upper house election",
      "TOKYO -- Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faces an increasingly uphill battle in Sunday\u2019s upper house election, and a loss could worsen political instability at a time of daunting challenges, such as rising prices and high U.S. tariffs.",
      "A poor performance would not immediately trigger a change of government but it would deepen uncertainty over his fate and Japan\u2019s future path.",
      "The ruling Liberal Democratic Party suffered a humiliating loss in a lower house election in October as its usual supporters registered their unhappiness over past corruption scandals and high prices. Ishiba is struggling to regain voter confidence.",
      "His minority government has since been forced into making concessions to the opposition to get legislation through the Diet, or parliament. That has hindered its ability to quickly deliver effective measures to curb rising prices and win wage increases. On top of shortages and soaring prices for rice, a traditional staple, Ishiba has been stymied by President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff demands.",
      "Frustrated voters are rapidly turning to emerging populist parties, including one that is promoting anti-foreign policies and backpedaling on gender equality and diversity.",
      "Here's a look at Sunday's election:",
      "Ishiba has set a low bar for the vote \u2014 a simple majority. Half of the 248 seats for six-year terms in the upper house are being decided, and the LDP and its junior coalition partner Komeito would need to win a combined 50. Added to the 75 coalition-held seats that are not being contested in this election, it would be a big retreat from the 141 seats the coalition held before the election.",
      "If the ruling coalition fails to secure a majority, \u201cthere will be a move within the LDP to dump Ishiba,\u201d said Yu Uchiyama, a University of Tokyo professor of political science. \u201cIt makes a leadership very unstable.\u201d Under any successor, the ruling coalition would be a minority in both houses, he said.",
      "If Ishiba's coalition secures a majority and he stays on, his leadership will remain weak, with little hope of improved support ratings, Uchiyama said. \u201cEither way, it is essential for the minority government to seek opposition parties\u2019 cooperation to achieve any policy.\u201d",
      "Measures to mitigate soaring prices, lagging incomes and burdensome social security payments are the top focus of frustrated, cash-strapped voters.",
      "Rice prices have doubled since last year due to supply shortages, overly complex distribution systems and other reasons related to Japan\u2019s farming, causing panic buying as Ishiba has struggled to resolve the crisis.",
      "Trump has added to that pressure, complaining about a lack of progress in trade negotiations, blaming a lack of sales of U.S. autos and American-grown rice to Japan despite a shortfall in domestic stocks of the grain. A 25% tariff due to take effect Aug. 1 has been another blow for Ishiba.",
      "Ishiba has resisted any compromise before the election, but the prospect for a breakthrough after the election is just as unclear because the minority government would have difficulty forming a consensus with the opposition.",
      "The rice issue has cost Ishiba one farm minister. Rice prices remain high even after the farm minister's replacement, Shinjiro Koizumi, moved quickly and boldly to address the problem by ordering the emergency release of stored rice from reserves, helping to refill grocery store shelves in time for the election.",
      "Koizumi, son of popular former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, is a potential challenger to Ishiba.",
      "Stricter measures targeting foreign residents and visitors have suddenly emerged as a key issue.",
      "The Sanseito party stands out with the toughest anti-foreigner stance with its \u201cJapanese First\u201d platform that proposes a new agency to centralize policies related to foreigners. It wants stricter screening for allowing Japanese citizenship and to exclude non-Japanese from welfare benefits. The party's populist platform is also anti-vaccine, anti-globalism and favors traditional gender roles.",
      "Its stance has encouraged the spread of xenophobic rhetoric in the election campaign and on social media, critics say. A typical claim is that a rapid increase in foreign workers has hurt Japanese workers\u2019 wages and that foreigners use a large share of welfare benefits and have made Japanese society unsafe.",
      "\u201cForeigners are used as targets to vent their discontent and unease,\u201d Uchiyama said, comparing the scapegoating to that in Europe and the United States under Trump.",
      "Experts say most of the rhetoric is disinformation aimed at frustrations among Japanese struggling to get by. Government statistics show foreign residents account for about 3% of both Japan\u2019s total population and of welfare benefit recipients.",
      "The Liberal Democrats, under a slogan \u201czero illegal immigrants,\u201d have pledged to crack down on growing illegal employment of foreigners and against allowing them to default on social insurance payments or medical bills. The party also set up a task force to promote an orderly society, a move aimed at enforcing stricter measures on foreigners to address growing public unease. The rising conservative Democratic Party for the People, or the DPP, also is calling to restrict foreign ownership of Japanese real estate.",
      "The move triggered protests by human rights activists and alarmed foreign residents.",
      "Given that its population is rapidly aging and shrinking, Japan needs foreign workers. It should discuss immigration policy more strategically, Takahide Kiuchi, an executive economist at Nomura Research Institute, wrote in a recent analysis.",
      "Conservative to centrist opposition groups, including the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, or CDPJ, the DPP, and Sanseito have gained significant ground at the Liberal Democrats' expense.",
      "They are believed to be raking in conservative supporters of the ruling party who are disappointed by Ishiba's leadership and flip-flops on policies. Ishiba is caught between his party's ultraconservatives and mainstream opposition leaders.",
      "Still, the eight main opposition groups are too fractured to forge a common platform as a united front and gain voter support as a viable alternative.",
      "When Ishiba lost big in October, there was speculation about a trilateral coalition government with the Komeito and the DPP or another conservative group, the Japan Innovation Party. But they've since cooperated only on certain legislation. If the ruling coalition loses its upper house majority, that could spark a regrouping among coalitions.",
      "Yoshihiko Noda, a former prime minister and head of the opposition CDPJ, said the loss of ruling coalition majorities in both houses of parliament would enable opposition parties to push policies blocked by the LDP. Those include cuts in the consumption tax, recognition of same-sex marriages, and a law allowing married couples the option of each keeping their own names.",

      "It was a remarkable seizure for Haiti\u2019s National Police, which remains understaffed and underfunded as it works with Kenyan police leading a U.N.-backed mission to help quell gang violence.",
      "While most of the violence is centered in Port-au-Prince, gangs have razed and seized control of a growing number of towns in Haiti\u2019s central region.",

      "Chefs and volunteers in Johannesburg have made 67,000 liters of soup to honor Nelson Mandela Day",
      "JOHANNESBURG -- Dozens of South African chefs, community cooks, caterers, and culinary students joined forces Friday in Johannesburg to make 67,000 liters (17,700 gallons) of soup to feed the hungry, in celebration of Nelson Mandela Day.",
      "First officially recognized by the United Nations in 2009, International Nelson Mandela Day encourages people to commemorate the birthday and legacy of South Africa\u2019s first Black president by volunteering for 67 minutes, which is equivalent to his 67 years of public service.",
      "To mark the birthday of South Africa\u2019s former head of state, who was born in 1918, cooks all over the country made soup in their own kitchens to contribute toward reaching the target.",
      "At the Johannesburg-based HTA School of Culinary Arts, cooks chopped vegetables, added legumes and sprinkled in a kaleidoscope of seasonings to make hearty soups. They braised their broths from early morning until 5:30 p.m., when the final soup tally began.",
      "\u201cThe 67,000 liters, it\u2019s our take on 67 minutes,\u201d said executive chef and chairman of NGO Chefs with Compassion, James Khoza. \u201cI did a lentil soup with vegetables and a bit of chicken pieces inside. It\u2019s not your normal kind of soup where you boil everything, then you make the soup out of it. For me, I look at flavor and is it quality as well.",
      "\u201cI know the guys are on the streets sometimes, or the beneficiaries, people tend to just give them whatever they feel like giving, but .... guys like us who come from hotel business, we understand that what we must feed people must be of that level, highest quality, that they feel like they are worthy because indeed they are worthy, \" he added.",
      "Every year, South Africans volunteer their time on July 18, cleaning up public spaces, helping at schools or hospitals, or performing humanitarian work and making donations.",
      "For Chefs with Compassion, a non-profit organization that works to combat hunger and food waste, the food drive is \u201ca war against throwing away food and wasteful cooking,\u201d Khoza says.",
      "This year marks the sixth consecutive year that they've rescued excess food from farmers and shops that would otherwise have been thrown out. Instead, the chefs use it to make large quantities of soup to offer to the thousands of Johannesburg residents who are food insecure.",
      "As part of her school\u2019s effort to add 300 liters of soup to the 67,000 liters that the collective aims for, Tyra Nyakudya, an 18-year-old college student, spent most of the day cutting vegetables and monitoring the soup pots.",
      "Although she was only six years old when the statesman passed away in 2013, she said his legacy of compassion and service remain in the memory because \u201che did everything in his power to give back to the community, which is why we\u2019re doing this today.\u201d",
      "South Africa is among Africa's leading food producers, but the 2024 National Food and Nutrition Security Survey (NFNSS) report found that 63.5% of South African households were food insecure, which translates to over 20 million people going without food every day and about 10.3 million tons of food being wasted annually.",
      "This is primarily driven by poverty, unemployment, and rising food prices, which are exacerbated by factors such as climate change and inequality.",
      "Hanneke Van Linge, head of Nosh Food Rescue, said the figures illustrated that food waste and food surplus is a huge problem, which should concern citizens every day.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of beautiful energy around Mandela Day specifically,\" she said. \u201cBut we would like to implore people, don\u2019t just let your involvement stay on Mandela Day.\u201d",

      "WARSAW, Poland -- Three Polish doctors were convicted for their roles in the 2021 death of a 30-year-old pregnant woman that sparked massive protests, Polish news agency PAP reported.",
      "The death from sepsis of the woman known as Iza at a hospital in southern Poland in her 22nd week of pregnancy led to huge street protests against the country\u2019s restrictive anti-abortion law. Activists blamed her death on doctors\u2019 choice to \u201cwait and see\u201d rather than immediately carry out an abortion because of the Poland\u2019s near-ban on the procedure.",
      "Two of the doctors were sentenced to more than a year in prison without parole and the third received a two-year suspended sentence, PAP reported Thursday. They can appeal the decision.",
      "The charges, filed in 2022, were of exposing the patient to the danger of loss of life. Two of the doctors also were charged with unintentionally causing the patient\u2019s death.",
      "\u201cAs a result of the team\u2019s activity and the failure to act, the patient has died,\u201d Agnieszka Wichary, spokesperson for the prosecutors\u2019 office in Katowice, said in a statement at the time.",
      "Poland, a mostly Catholic country, passed a strict law in 1993 that banned abortions except when the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest, when the woman\u2019s life or health is at risk, or when the fetus had congenital deformities.",
      "But the Constitutional Tribunal, under the influence of Poland\u2019s conservative ruling party, ruled in 2020 that abortions for congenital defects were not constitutional, even if the fetus has no chance of survival. That sparked huge street protests.",
      "Activists said Iza was the first to die from the further tightening of the restrictive law. The woman left behind a husband and a daughter.",

    "story": [
      "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz says his coalition has a \u201cstable foundation\u201d and has achieved a lot in its first 10 weeks",
      "BERLIN -- German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Friday that his coalition has a \u201cstable foundation\u201d and has achieved a lot in its first 10 weeks, but acknowledged that \u201coccasional setbacks\u201d are a risk in government as his administration struggles with its first major dispute.",
      "Merz took office on May 6, leading a coalition of his conservative Union bloc with the center-left Social Democrats that has a relatively thin parliamentary majority. He vowed to strengthen Europe's biggest economy after years of stagnation, enable Germany to build Europe's strongest conventional army and keep the U.S. on board with aid to Ukraine.",
      "The government has launched a program to encourage investment, set in motion plans to raise defense spending and implemented a tougher approach to migration. Merz has taken a prominent role in diplomacy on Ukraine and other issues.",
      "Merz said at the German leader's annual summer news conference that he is \u201cvery satisfied with what we have achieved in the first 10 weeks.\u201d",
      "Merz set out to avoid the infighting that plagued ex-Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-party coalition, which collapsed in November. However, the new government's record has been overshadowed over the past week by parliament's failure to elect three new justices for Germany's highest court.",
      "Nominations have in the past mostly been approved uneventfully. But planned votes last Friday were scrapped at the last minute after some lawmakers in Merz's bloc balked at a candidate put forward by the Social Democrats.",
      "Opponents of the nominee, law professor Frauke Brosius-Gersdorf, have cited her perceived liberal views on issues such as abortion. Leading Social Democrats have been irked by the conservatives' failure to follow through on an agreement on the new justices and have stood by their candidate.",
      "Merz has downplayed the argument and insisted Friday that \u201cthere is no time pressure\" to rush to a solution. And he rejected a suggestion that his coalition is on wobbly ground, with the court nominee flap following its bumpy start when lawmakers needed an unprecedented two rounds of voting to elect Merz as chancellor in May.",
      "\u201cThis government stands on a stable foundation, on a stable majority in the German parliament,\u201d Merz said. \u201cBut you see from these two votes that we are living in very uncertain times, also regarding supposed certainties in the German parliament.\u201d",
      "He said that \u201cwe know what job we have, and high points and successes are part of that as well as occasional setbacks.\u201d",
      "Recent polls have suggested that Merz's coalition has work to do to convince voters. Ratings for the Union and Social Democrats haven't picked up from their lackluster showing in Germany's February election. Surveys show the far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany solidifying its strong second place.",

      "LONDON -- The U.K. on Friday sanctioned Russian military intelligence units and officers it said were behind preparations for a 2022 bomb attack on a theater in southern Ukraine that killed hundreds of civilians.",
      "Britain's foreign ministry said it sanctioned 18 officers working for Russian military intelligence, known as the GRU. It said the officers were also accused of targeting the family of a former Russian spy who was later poisoned with a nerve agent.",
      "It said the units also carried out a campaign of cyberattacks over many years that aimed to sow chaos across Europe and undermine democratic institutions.",
      "\u201cGRU spies are running a campaign to destabilise Europe, undermine Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and threaten the safety of British citizens,\" U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said.",
      "On March 15, 2022, shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, Unit 26165 carried out online reconnaissance on civilian bomb shelters in Mariupol, southern Ukraine and in Kharkiv, eastern Ukraine, the British foreign ministry said. One of the targets was the Mariupol theater where civilians sheltering from Russian bombs had painted the words \u201cchildren\u201d outside in the hope of sparing them.",
      "The next day, the theater was hit by Russian airstrikes which killed around 600 people, including many children, according to an Associated Press investigation.",
      "In 2013, officers from the same unit targeted the daughter of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal with malware, the foreign ministry said. In 2018, Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with the nerve agent Novichok in the English city of Salisbury, in an attack the British government said was organized by Russian intelligence.",
      "The sanctions also targeted Africa Initiative, which the foreign ministry said employed Russian intelligence officers to carry out information operations in Africa including undermining public health programs and destabilizing various countries.",
      "The Associated Press is tracking Russia\u2019s campaign of sabotage and disruption across Europe which ranges from cyberattacks and propaganda to arson and attempted assassination.",
      "More than 70 different attacks have been attributed to Russia by Western officials since the invasion. The military intelligence units sanctioned Friday also targeted foreign aid to Kyiv, ports, infrastructure and border crossings as well as technology companies, the foreign ministry said.",
      "Although targeting GRU officers with sanctions is likely to have limited effect, the foreign ministry said the goal is to raise awareness of Russia's campaign and raise the cost to individuals working for its services, including making it harder for them to travel.",

      "An Iraqi medical official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment said the final death toll was 63, including 18 bodies that could not be identified due to the severity of the burns and would undergo DNA testing.",
      "The Corniche Hypermarket mall in the town of Kut in Wasit province, a five-story building containing restaurants, shops and a supermarket, had opened just days before the blaze, which officials said broke out late Wednesday on the second floor in an area selling perfume and cosmetics.",
      "Civil defense crews were able to rescue 45 people from the burning building. Officials said that most of those who died were trapped on the upper floors.",
      "While the cause of the fire has not yet been determined, officials blamed lack of safety standards in the building for the scale of the tragedy.",
      "Provincial Gov. Mohammed al-Miyahi has said that the building owner did not implement fire safety measures and had not applied for required permits.",
      "The provincial council of Wasit on Thursday voted to form committees to carry out building safety inspections and to suspend the director of Kut municipality and the director of occupational safety until investigations into the fire are complete.",
      "Al-Miyahi said Thursday that legal complaints had been filed against the building owner and shopping center owner, who could not be reached for comment. The governor said in a press conference that the son of the shopping center owner and other members of his family were among the victims in the blaze.",
      "Poor building standards have often contributed to tragic fires in Iraq. In July 2021, a blaze at a hospital in the Iraqi city of Nasiriyah that killed between 60 to 92 people was determined to have been fueled by highly flammable, low-cost type of \u201csandwich panel\u201d cladding that is illegal in Iraq.",
      "In 2023, more than 100 people died in a fire at a wedding hall in the predominantly Christian area of Hamdaniya in Nineveh province after the ceiling panels above a pyrotechnic machine burst into flames.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Friday signed into law new regulations for a type of cryptocurrency, a major milestone for an industry that has spent heavily to strengthen its legitimacy and political might.",
      "The GENIUS Act sets initial guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins, which are tied to assets like the U.S. dollar to reduce price volatility compared with other forms of cryptocurrency. It passed both the House and Senate with wide bipartisan margins.",
      "The new law is meant to bolster consumer confidence in the crypto industry, which has quickly become a major power player in Washington thanks to massive campaign donations and spending on lobbying. Its passage comes as Trump had repeatedly pledged to make the U.S. the \u201ccrypto capital of the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor years you were mocked and dismissed and counted out,\" Trump told crypto industry executives at a White House bill signing attended by about 200 people, including several top GOP lawmakers. \u201cThis signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit.\u201d",

      "\u201cThat\u2019s why I backed you at an early stage,\u201d said Trump, who had previously been a skeptic of cryptocurrency before embracing it. His administration has taken several early steps to boost the crypto industry, including the Securities and Exchange Commission dropping several enforcement actions against large crypto companies.",
      "Trump then added a candid admission about the political calculus of his support for the crypto industry: \u201cAnd I also did it for the votes,\u201d he said, drawing laughter from the audience.",

Circle, the U.S.-based issuer of one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange earlier this year and quickly saw its value soar amid heavy interest from crypto enthusiasts and investors. Stablecoin issuers make profits by collecting the interest on the assets they hold in reserve to back their stablecoins.",
      "A provision in the GENIUS Act bans members of Congress and their families from profiting off stablecoins. But that prohibition does not extend to the president and his family, even as Trump builds a crypto empire from the White House. His family holds a significant stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto project that launched its own stablecoin earlier this year and received an early boost from an investment fund in the United Arab Emirates.",
      "The House also passed two other bills Thursday that are meant to help the crypto industry. One creates a new market structure for cryptocurrency, and the other bans the Federal Reserve from issuing a new digital currency. Both measures now go to the Senate.",

      "The decision allows Rebecca Kelly Slaughter to resume her duties as commissioner. The FTC website had been updated by Friday morning to show that Slaughter is among four sitting commissioners.",
      "Attorneys for the Trump administration almost immediately declared their intent to appeal, and the case could make its way to the Supreme Court. The conservative-led court already has narrowed the reach of the 90-year-old decision, known as Humphrey\u2019s Executor, and some justices have called for overturning it altogether.",
      "The high court also permitted Trump to fire the heads of other independent agencies. In May, the court allowed Trump to remove members of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board, despite lower court rulings that Humphrey\u2019s Executor should protect them from arbitrary dismissal.",
      "The justices are currently weighing an emergency appeal from the administration to oust three Democratic members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Trump fired them in May, but a federal judge restored them to their positions a month later.",
      "The legal fight over the firings also could extend to the Federal Reserve and the prospect of Trump firing Fed chairman Jerome Powell. The justices suggested in May that Trump may not have the same freedom to upend the leadership of the Fed, describing it as \u201ca uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.\u201d",
      "In her opinion, AliKhan said she was required to abide by the Humphrey\u2019s Executor decision, in which the court rebuffed President Franklin Roosevelt and held that FTC commissioners could be removed only for cause, not at the president\u2019s whim.",
      "She said her ruling would uphold \u201cclearly established law that has been enacted by a coequal branch of government, reaffirmed by another coequal branch, and acquiesced to by thirteen executives over the course of ninety years.\u201d",
      "But the judge acknowledged that hers probably would not be the last word. \u201cDefendants are, of course, free to take their quarrels with Humphrey\u2019s Executor to the Supreme Court. This court has no illusions about where this case\u2019s journey leads,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Trump fired Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya, the commission\u2019s two Democratic members in March. The FTC is a regulator created by Congress that enforces consumer protection measures and antitrust legislation. Its seats typically include three members of the president\u2019s party and two from the opposing party. The commissioners sued to reclaim their jobs, saying they\u2019d been dismissed illegally. Slaughter has four years left in her term as commissioner. Bedoya submitted his resignation in June, and AliKhan dismissed his claim as a result.",
      "\u201cAs the Court recognized today, the law is clear, and I look forward to getting back to work,\u201d Slaughter said in a statement Thursday.",
      "During a May court hearing in federal court in Washington, D.C., plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys warned against granting the president \u201cabsolute removal power over any executive officer,\u201d saying it would effectively eliminate an important check on his power.",
      "\u201cThat has never been the case in this country,\u201d said attorney Aaron Crowell. \u201cThat\u2019s not the law. That has never been the law.\u201d",
      "A politicized FTC also could favor powerful corporations while driving up prices for consumers, the lawyers for the fired commissioners said.",
      "But attorneys for the Trump administration argued that the FTC\u2019s role has expanded since the 1930s, and as such, its members should answer directly to the president.",
      "\u201cThe president should be able to remove someone who is actively blocking his policies, for example,\u201d Justice Department lawyer Emily Hall said during the hearing.",
      "AliKhan, who was nominated to the federal bench by President Joe Biden in 2023, noted the long line of presidents before Trump who didn\u2019t try to push the limits.",
      "Commissioners are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. They serve seven-year terms that are staggered to prevent multiple vacancies at once. They can be fired for displaying specific bad behaviors, including inefficiency, neglect of duty and malfeasance in office.",
      "Trump told Bedoya and Slaughter that he was dismissing them because their service on the commission was inconsistent with his administration\u2019s priorities, according to the lawsuit.",

      "Oil giants Exxon Mobil, China\u2019s CNOOC, and Hess squared off in a heated competition for highly lucrative oil fields in northern South America.",

      "\u201cGiven the significant value we\u2019ve created in the development of the Guyana resource, we believed we had a clear duty to our investors to consider our preemption rights to protect the value we created through our innovation and hard work at a time when no one knew just how successful this venture would become,\u201d Exxon Mobil said Friday. \u201cWe welcome Chevron to the venture and look forward to continued industry-leading performance and value creation in Guyana for all parties involved.\u201d",

      "Masai Ujiri is staying focused on his upcoming Giants of Africa Festival even as the longtime NBA executive navigates his recent departure from the Toronto Raptors",
      "NEW YORK -- Masai Ujiri's July is shaping up to be quite the rollercoaster ride. The recently-fired former Toronto Raptors executive is navigating his sudden departure from a franchise where he'd spent 13 seasons while also launching the second edition of his private foundation's Giants of Africa Festival \u2014 all within a one-month span.",
      "The humanitarian work, Ujiri pledged, will continue regardless of his employment status. The British-born NBA executive, raised in his father's native Nigeria, founded Giants of Africa in 2003 \u2014 back when he was just starting off as a scout and long before becoming the first African team president of a professional North American sports franchise.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an obligation for me,\u201d Ujiri said. \u201cIt\u2019s a passion.\u201d",
      "The foundation's ambitions have risen with his own success. Giants of Africa has reached thousands of campers across 18 countries. It has helped build more than three dozen courts on the continent. High-profile supporters include Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's The Archewell Foundation. 2023\u2019s inaugural Giants of Africa Festival united more than 250 boys and girls around a week of basketball clinics, life skills lessons and community building that culminated in a concert headlined by South African superstar Tyla. The goal? A \u201cborderless Africa\u201d as Ujiri likes to say.",
      "The festival returns to Kigali, Rwanda, on July 26 with a lineup featuring Nigerian pop singer Ayra Starr and WNBA great Candace Parker. Two-time NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard \u2014 brought to Toronto by Ujiri for the team's championship-winning 2018-2019 season \u2014 will mentor campers and train underserved youth.",
      "Ujiri discussed the upcoming event, and his future, with The Associated Press. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "A: When we had the last festival, we really focused on \u2014 whether it was the basketball, the life skills, the coaching, the mentorship \u2014 we focused on culture. We focused on the whole ecosystem of how we feel kids need this opportunity to grow. It really inspired us to think about how we bring this to more countries.",
      "We\u2019re doing this incredible, incredible fashion show showing the print, the threads of Africa, and who we really are. It used to be weird where you\u2019d see somebody wearing cloth from Africa. Now it\u2019s part of the fashion. It\u2019s part of us. It\u2019s just like Afrobeats \u2014 it\u2019s part of life everywhere. Everybody wants to wear a boubou. You see a lot of fashion designers from all over the world using our prints. We want to showcase that and give these youth the opportunity to see that this is how they can also expand their minds.",
      "A: It's been unbelievable. With these camps, it started off as basketball development, but you've seen that really become something that has really grown even bigger. I saw Pascal (Siakam), I saw (Joel) Embiid, I saw all these guys as youth in camps. Seeing them as 15-, 16-year-old kids in camp, you can't even project. And that tells you how much talent we have on the continent. I always say Africa's biggest jewel is the talent of the youth. One out of every four people in the world are going to be Africans by the year 2050 and the median age is 20. We should be investing on the continent.",
      "A: I'm the prime example of that. I didn't play in the NBA. I didn't even play high-level college or high-level Europe. The entry point for me was a scout in the NBA. From then on lots of people helped me to create this path that I'm on still. I go back to Basketball Without Borders, when the NBA gave me the opportunity to be a director. That has led to me becoming an executive in the NBA. That's the example I want to give.",
      "That's why we have so many people coming to this festival to really show these kids \u2014 whether it's me or a journalist or a sports doctor or sports lawyer \u2014 there's so many careers. And the start is sports and doing it passionately and doing it well.",
      "A: When I first started, I was doing boys camps. Not every kid is going to make it to the NBA. So we started focusing on life skills. That was teaching respect, honesty, being on time. One of the big focuses was respect for women.",
      "So, I'm challenging these boys but I'm not challenging myself. I can't say \u201cwomen's empowerment\u201d and \u201crespect women\u201d and just do these camps for boys. So, we introduced the girls. And it's not 50 boys and 10 girls just for token. It's equality. They all have a basketball and they have the same court time. We can't just say it. We actually have to do it.",
      "A: Job, no job, wherever I am, whatever kind of job I'm doing, Giants of Africa is key. The focus will always be that just because I owe it to the youth of the continent. I owe it to the continent. My goal is not how big does Giants of Africa get. I look at it as: how big are these youth going to become? They'll go on to do other things. They could go on to become a president or become a governor or become president of a team. The hope is that this experience here will even make them reimagine many of the things that they want to do. So, Giants of Africa will never go anywhere.",

    "story": [
      "From crypto coins to bibles, overseas development deals to an upcoming line of cellphones, Trump family businesses have raked in hundreds of millions of dollars since his election",
      "WASHINGTON -- If one theme has emerged in President Donald Trump\u2019s second term, it's this: He's leveraged the power of his office for personal gain unlike anyone before in history.",
      "From crypto coins to bibles, overseas development deals to an upcoming line of cellphones, Trump family businesses have raked in hundreds of millions of dollars since his election, an unprecedented flood of often shadowy money from billionaires, foreign governments and cryptocurrency tycoons with interests before the federal government.",
      "\u201cHe is president and is supposed to be working in the public\u2019s interest,\u201d said James Thurber, an emeritus professor at American University, who has researched lobbying, campaign finance and political corruption for decades. \u201cInstead, he is helping his own personal interest to grow his wealth. It\u2019s totally not normal.\u201d",
      "The sums amassed by the Trump Organization, the collection of companies controlled by the president\u2019s children, are far greater than those collected by the family during the president\u2019s first term, when patronage of his hotels, resorts and golf courses was de rigueur to curry favor with the famously transactional commander-in-chief.",
      "The second time around, the Trump family\u2019s ambitions are far grander, stretching from cyberspace to far-flung regions across the globe. One of Trump\u2019s cryptocurrencies is conservatively estimated to have pulled in at least $320 million since January, while another received a $2 billion investment from a foreign government wealth fund. A third has sold at least $550 million in tokens.",
      "His sons have jetted across the Middle East to line up new development deals, while his daughter and son-in-law are working with the Albanian government to build a Mediterranean island resort. Even first lady Melania Trump has inked a $40 million documentary deal with Amazon, whose founder, Jeff Bezos, was a frequent target of Trump during his first presidency and whose companies contract extensively with the federal government.",
      "The dealmaking is a rejection of Trump\u2019s first-term pledge to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington and dwarfs the influence peddling efforts of former President Joe Biden\u2019s family, whom Trump and his allies attacked as the \u201cBiden Crime Family.\u201d",
      "While Democrats have condemned Trump for his overlapping roles as a beneficiary and president, he is not likely to face any immediate repercussions for such extensive conflicts-of-interest. Congress is controlled by fellow Republicans, and his administration is stocked with loyalists who have dismantled many guardrails of oversight. Last summer, the Supreme Court, with a conservative majority cemented by Trump, ruled that presidents have broad immunity from prosecution.",
      "Even in the rare cases where Trump\u2019s allies have urged caution, the president has ignored them. That\u2019s what happened when he accepted a $400 million \u201cbeautiful, big, magnificent, free airplane\u201d from the Qatari government. Trump said the Boeing 747 \u201cwould go directly\u201d to his presidential library upon leaving office.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the Mount Everest of corruption\u201d said Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat.",
      "Since Richard Nixon resigned in disgrace, presidents have gone to great lengths to avoid the appearance of such conflicts.",
      "Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan kept assets in a \u201cblind trust,\u201d while George H.W. Bush used a \u201cdiversified trust,\u201d which blocked him from knowing what was in his portfolio. His son, George W. Bush, used a similar arrangement.",
      "Barack Obama was an exception, but his investments were mostly a bland mix of index funds and U.S. treasuries. During his first term, Trump even gave a nod toward ethics. He issued a moratorium on foreign deals. But instead of placing his assets in a blind trust like many of his predecessors, he handed the reins of the Trump Organization to his children, which kept his financial holdings close.",
      "This time, he has made no such gesture. His sons, Eric and Donald Jr., are again running the business while Trump is in office. And though the White House says he is not involved in its day-to-day decisions, the trust he has established continues to profit. He promotes his resorts, merchandise and the family\u2019s crypto ventures while residing in the White House, often from his account on Truth Social, the social media company he and his allies launched.",
      "He\u2019s also touted a line of Trump shoes, a Bible, which is made in China, and Trump guitars, one of which is a $1,500 Gibson Les Paul knockoff, featuring \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d fret inlays. Conservative groups and Republican committees have spent at least $25 million at Trump properties since 2015, with most of it coming from Trump\u2019s own political organization, campaign finance disclosures show.",
      "Yet, those ventures pale in comparison to his exploits in cryptocurrency, which offers perhaps the clearest example of the conflicts of interest that have come to dominate Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "Trump was once a crypto skeptic who declared that cryptocurrencies were \u201cnot money,\u201d were based on \u201cthin air\u201d and seemed \u201clike a scam.\u201d By the time he was running again for president, however, he\u2019d become a proponent of the industry.",
      "\u201cThe difference now is he has realized that it can be his scam,\u201d said Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University who specializes in banking and cryptocurrencies.",
      "Trump has pledged to turn the U.S. into the \u201ccrypto capital of the world\u201d and promised to roll back oversight of the industry.",
      "Deregulation, of course, will help his own businesses. At the height of the campaign, Trump announced the launch of his own crypto coin and World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency firm that would be run by his sons and several business associates. Among those partners was Steve Witkoff, now one of Trump\u2019s top diplomatic envoys.",
      "The Trump Organization and World Liberty Financial declined to comment.",
      "But it was also rooted in his 2024 campaign. At a crypto event at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida in May 2024, he received assurances that industry figures would spend lavishly to get him reelected, The Associated Press previously reported.",
      "Asked recently at the White House if he'd consider having his family business step back from its crypto investments to avoid questions about conflicts of interest, Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019ve created a very powerful industry. That\u2019s much more important than anything that we invest in.\"",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t care about investing. You know, I have kids and they invest in it, because they do believe in it,\" Trump added of crypto. \"But I\u2019m president, and what I did do there was build an industry that\u2019s very important. And, if we didn\u2019t have it, China would.\u201d",
      "Harrison Fields, a White House spokesman, reiterated that Trump's crypto boosterism isn't driven by self-interest.",
      "He \u201cis taking decisive action to establish regulatory clarity for digital financial technology and to secure America\u2019s position as the world\u2019s leader in the digital asset economy,\u201d Fields said.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration,\" Fields added, \"is fulfilling the president\u2019s promise to make the United States the crypto capital of the planet by driving innovation and economic opportunity for all Americans.\u201d",
      "Trump is soon expected to sign cryptocurrency legislation approved by Congress on Thursday. Among the provisions is a ban on members of Congress issuing their own brand of a particular type of cryptocurrency. The prohibition does not extend to the president.",
      "Fields said it was unfair to equate critics\u2019 charges of conflicts of interest against Trump with the president\u2019s own suggestions that Biden\u2019s family benefited financially while he was in office.",
      "He said Trump\u2019s policies haven\u2019t benefited the president personally and have nothing to do with his family\u2019s financial concerns \u2014 and said Trump entered the White House an already successful businessman who didn\u2019t need a political career to become rich.",
      "Even so, Trump\u2019s family is poised to benefit financially from the crypto industry\u2019s growing clout. It holds a majority ownership stake that entitles them to 75% of earnings from their first coin, released last September, according to World Liberty Financial\u2019s website.",
      "The coin, $WLFI, was not an immediate success. Then, after the president's election, sales took off.",
      "Days before his inauguration, Trump announced a new meme coin, $Trump, during the \u201cCrypto Ball,\u201d a Washington gala intended to showcase a regulatory sea change he vowed to usher in.",
      "\u201cTime to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING!\u201d Trump posted to his X account. \u201cJoin my very special Trump Community. GET YOUR $TRUMP NOW.\u201d",
      "Often created as a joke with no real utility, meme coins are prone to wild price swings that often enrich a small group of insiders at the expense of less sophisticated investors. $Trump soared to over $70, but its price soon collapsed, losing money for many. It has hovered around $10 since March. Trump did well, though. By the end of April, the coin had earned over $320 million in fees, according to an analysis by the crypto tracking firm Chainalysis.",
      "A third cryptocurrency, a \u201cstablecoin\u201d called USD1, launched in April.",
      "There appear to be upsides for Trump\u2019s cryptocurrency investors and associates.",
      "Justin Sun, a Chinese-born crypto billionaire, has disclosed investing nearly $200 million in the Trumps' various crypto ventures. Amid this spree, the Trump administration announced it had paused a securities fraud case against him. In June, Sun announced he was taking his crypto company, Tron, public after securing financing through a deal brokered by Eric Trump. Last week, Sun posted on Twitter that he was purchasing an additional $100 million worth of Trump's meme coin.",
      "Sun is not the only one. Changpen Zhao, a convicted felon who founded the crypto exchange Binance, was part of a megadeal in which a United Arab Emirates-controlled wealth fund invested $2 billion in the Trump stablecoin, USD1, which it used to purchase a stake in Zhao\u2019s Binance.",
      "The deal gave outsized publicity to World Liberty Financial and instantly made the stablecoin one of the top in the market. It will also allow the Trump family and their business partners to reinvest the $2 billion and collect interest, estimated to be worth as much as $80 million a year.",
      "Soon after the purchase was announced, Trump granted the UAE greater access to U.S. artificial intelligence chips, which it had long sought. Binance and Zhao benefited, too.",
      "Binance is restricted in the U.S. and entered a settlement with the Biden administration that sent Zhao to jail in 2024 after he pleaded guilty to failing to maintain an anti-money-laundering program. Prosecutors said he looked the other way as criminals used his platform to move money connected to child sex abuse, drug trafficking and terrorism.",
      "In May, Trump\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission dropped the final federal enforcement action against Binance. Zhao, who goes by CZ, is now seeking a pardon. The White House says no decision has been made on issuing such a grant of clemency.",
      "Trump announced several months ago a new promotion that would trade on his presidency: He was hosting a dinner at his Virginia golf club for the top 220 investors in his meme coin, $Trump, with a special White House tour for the top 25.",
      "That fueled a temporary rise in the coin's value. It also helped enrich the Trump Organization, which is entitled to collect fees when the coin is traded. A month later, Trump addressed attendees of the dinner, standing before a lectern with the presidential seal. The White House said at the time that it had nothing to do with the meme coin.",
      "For decades, campaign contributions and lobbying have been governed by laws that place limits on how much donors can give, require a degree of transparency and limit how politicians can spend the money they raise. Trump\u2019s venture into cryptocurrency effectively sidesteps these laws, legal and finance experts say.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot like the Trump Hotel from the first term, but what crypto has done is dispensed with the need for the hotel,\u201d said Allen, the law professor. \u201cBecause crypto assets can be made out of thin air, he has found a way of creating an unlimited supply of assets to offer to people who want to give.\u201d",

      "A new AP-NORC poll shows that while Republican elected officials are promoting their recently passed tax and spending bill as a win for working Americans, everyday Americans broadly see it as a win for the wealthy",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014",
      "Republican elected officials are promoting their recently passed tax and spending bill as a win for working Americans, but a new survey shows that Americans broadly see it as a win for the wealthy.",
      "About two-thirds of U.S. adults expect the new tax law will help the rich, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Most \u2014 about 6 in 10 \u2014 think it will do more to hurt than help low-income people. About half say it will do more harm than good for middle-class people and people like them.",
      "Republicans have already begun airing advertisements framing the legislation as a tax cut for all Americans, highlighting new deductions on tips and overtime income. But Democrats have been making the case that the wealthiest Americans will benefit from the legislation, citing cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs.",
      "The new poll indicates that Republicans still have persuading to do. The high price tag may also be turning off some Americans. Trump's approval rating on government spending has fallen since the spring, according to the new survey, and about 6 in 10 U.S. adults across the political spectrum think the government is spending \u201ctoo much.\u201d",
      "Most people have heard at least something about the new law, according to the poll, which found that about two-thirds of U.S. adults have heard or read \u201ca lot\u201d or \u201csome\u201d about it.",
      "Those who know something about the legislation are more likely to believe it favors the wealthy, compared with people who have heard \u201conly a little\u201d or \u201cnothing at all.\"",
      "Anaiah Barrow, a 25-year-old single mom from North Carolina who doesn't identify with a political party, said she\u2019s concerned that the new law will hurt caregivers like her. Barrow -- who\u2019s juggling a job, taking care of two young children and pursuing a degree -- is concerned about losing access to day care and food stamps.",
      "\u201cIt has a really big effect,\u201d Barrow said of the recently passed legislation, which she has learned about on TikTok. \u201cIt may not be as a big now, but in the long run it\u2019s going to have that effect -- it\u2019s going to hit bad.\u201d",
      "Even many Republicans agree that the wealthy are likely to benefit from the tax and spending law. About half say the law will do more to help the wealthy. A similar percentage say this about middle-class people, while about 4 in 10 Republicans think it will do more to help than hurt low-income people.",
      "Lori Nichols, a 51-year-old caregiver for her elderly mother in Illinois, said the legislation has \u201cvery little for the older people and people that are on disability.\u201d Although Nichols is a Republican, she said she didn't vote in the 2024 presidential election and voted for Democrat Joe Biden in 2020.",
      "\u201cAs far as the tax part goes, it seems to me like (Trump\u2019s) just making the rich richer,\u201d Nichols said.",
      "Despite the overall sense that wealthy people will be the primary beneficiaries, Democrats and independents are much likelier than Republicans to think the law could harm them personally.",
      "Nathan Hay, a shift service manager at an international dealership that repairs trucks, said he thinks lower-income people might see a \u201cslight increase\u201d in taxes but still supports the bill. \u201cPersonally, it\u2019s not helping me a ton,\u201d Hay said, but he believes it will help small businesses, which have been a staple in his own life and his family\u2019s.",
      "About half of Republicans expect the legislation to do more to help \u201cpeople like you,\u201d compared with about 2 in 10 independents and just 6% of Democrats.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a tax accountant, but it sounds as if it would be more beneficial to (people) in the higher tax level,\u201d said Republican Geraldine Putnam, 87, a Trump voter who lives in the rural south.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not that I would want to take away the incentive to become more wealthy \u2014 that\u2019s the American dream,\u201d Putnam said.",
      "But she also thinks she'll end up paying more in taxes. \u201cWhat he\u2019s doing I'm sure he thinks is correct,\" she said of Trump. \"It\u2019s just the extreme method that he\u2019s using.\u201d",
      "The law's hefty price tag may be factoring into some Americans' assessments of the law. The poll found they are less likely to approve of how Trump is handling government spending since the spring.",
      "Just 38% of Americans approve of how Donald Trump is handling government spending, compared with 46% in an AP-NORC poll conducted in March.",
      "Republicans are less likely to say the government is spending \u201ctoo much\u201d than they were in March 2023, when Joe Biden was president, but about 6 in 10 still think the government is overspending. A similar share of Democrats say the same thing.",

      "The European Union is targeting Russia with more sanctions over its war on Ukraine",
      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union approved on Friday a new raft of sanctions against Russia over its war on Ukraine, including a lower oil price cap, a ban on transactions with Nord Stream gas pipelines, and the targeting of more shadow fleet ships, the EU foreign policy chief said.",
      "\u201cThe message is clear: Europe will not back down in its support for Ukraine. The EU will keep raising the pressure until Russia ends its war,\u201d Kaja Kallas said in a statement.",
      "Kallas said the measures amount to \u201cone of its strongest sanctions packages against Russia to date\u201d linked to the war, now in its fourth year. It comes as European countries start to buy U.S. weapons for Ukraine to help the country better defend itself.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed the new measures, describing them as a \u201ctimely and necessary\u201d step amid intensified Russian attacks.",
      "\u201cAll infrastructure of Russia\u2019s war must be blocked,\u201d Zelenskyy said, adding that Ukraine will synchronize its sanctions with the EU and introduce its own additional measures soon.",
      "The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive branch, had proposed to lower the oil price cap from $60 to $45, which is lower than the market price to target Russia\u2019s vast energy revenues. The 27 member countries decided to set the price per barrel at just under $48.",
      "The EU had hoped to get major international powers in the Group of Seven countries involved in the price cap to broaden the impact, but conflict in the Middle East pushed up oil prices and the Trump administration could not be brought onboard.",
      "In 2023, Ukraine\u2019s Western allies limited sales of Russian oil to $60 per barrel but the price cap was largely symbolic as most of Moscow\u2019s crude \u2014 its main moneymaker \u2014 cost less than that. Still, the cap was there in case oil prices rose.",
      "Oil income is the linchpin of Russia\u2019s economy, allowing President Vladimir Putin to pour money into the armed forces without worsening inflation for everyday people and avoiding a currency collapse.",
      "A new import ban was also imposed in an attempt to close a loophole allowing Russia to indirectly export crude oil via a number of non-EU countries.",
      "The EU also targeted the Nord Stream pipelines between Russia and Germany to prevent Putin from generating any revenue from them in future, notably by discouraging would-be investors. Russian energy giant Rosneft's refinery in India was hit as well.",
      "The pipelines were built to carry Russian natural gas to Germany but are not in operation. They were targeted by sabotage in 2022, but the source of the underwater explosions has remained a major international mystery.",
      "On top of that, the new EU sanctions targeted Russia\u2019s banking sector, with the aim of limiting the Kremlin\u2019s ability to raise funds or carry out financial transactions. Two Chinese banks were added to the list.",
      "The EU has slapped several rounds of sanctions on Russia since Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine in February 24, 2022.",
      "More than 2,400 officials and \u201centities\u201d \u2014 often government agencies, banks, companies or organizations \u2014 have been hit with asset freezes and travel bans.",
      "But each round of sanctions is getting harder to agree, as measures targeting Russia bite the economies of the 27 member nations. Slovakia held up the latest package over concerns about proposals to stop Russian gas supplies, which it relies on.",
      "The last raft of EU sanctions, imposed on May 20, targeted almost 200 ships in Russia\u2019s sanction-busting shadow fleet of tankers. On Friday, 105 more ships were blocked from European ports, locks and from ship-to-ship transfers, bringing the total number of vessels now sanctioned to more than 400.",

      "HANOI, Vietnam -- Asian countries are offering to buy more U.S. liquefied natural gas in negotiations with the Trump administration as a way to alleviate tensions over U.S. trade deficits and forestall higher tariffs. Analysts warn that strategy could undermine those countries' long-term climate ambitions and energy security.",
      "Buying more U.S. LNG has topped the list of concessions Asian countries have offered in talks with Washington over President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on foreign goods. Vietnam's Prime Minister underlined the need to buy more of the super-chilled fuel in a government meeting, and the government signed a deal in May with an American company to develop a gas import hub. JERA, Japan\u2019s largest power generator, signed new 20-year contracts last month to purchase up to 5.5 million metric tons of U.S. gas annually starting around 2030.",
      "U.S. efforts to sell more LNG to Asia predate the Trump administration, but they've gained momentum with his intense push to win trade deals.",
      "Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is natural gas cooled to a liquid form for easy storage and transport that is used as a fuel for transport, residential cooking and heating and industrial processes.",
      "Trump discussed cooperation on a $44 billion Alaska LNG project with South Korea, prompting a visit by officials to the site in June. The U.S. president has promoted the project as a way to supply gas from Alaska\u2019s vast North Slope to a liquefication plant at Nikiski in south-central Alaska, with an eye largely on exports to Asian countries while bypassing the Panama Canal Thailand has offered to commit to a long-term deal for American fuel and shown interest in the same Alaska project to build a nearly 810-mile (1,300-kilometer) pipeline that would funnel gas from",
      "The Philippines is also considering importing gas from Alaska while India is mulling a plan to scrap import taxes on U.S. energy shipments to help narrow its trade surplus with Washington.",
      "\u201cTrump has put pressure on a seeming plethora of Asian trading partners to buy more U.S. LNG,\u201d said Tim Daiss, at the APAC Energy Consultancy, pointing out that Japan had agreed to buy more despite being so \u201cawash in the fuel\u201d that it was being forced to cancel projects and contracts to offload the excess to Asia's growing economies.",
      "\u201cNot good for Southeast Asia's sustainability goals,\u201d he said.",
      "Experts say LNG purchasing agreements can slow adoption of renewable energy in Asia.",
      "Locking into long-term deals could leave countries with outdated infrastructure as the world shifts rapidly toward cleaner energy sources like solar or wind that offer faster, more affordable ways to meet growing power demand, said Indra Overland, head of the Center for Energy Research at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs.",
      "Building pipelines, terminals, and even household gas stoves creates systems that are expensive and difficult to replace\u2014making it harder to switch to renewables later. \u201cAnd you\u2019re more likely then to get stuck for longer,\u201d he said.",
      "Energy companies that profit from gas or coal are powerful vested interests, swaying policy to favor their business models, he said.",
      "LNG burns cleaner than coal, but it\u2019s still a fossil fuel that emits greenhouse gases and contributes to climate change.",
      "Many LNG contracts include \u201ctake-or-pay\u201d clauses, obliging governments to pay even if they don\u2019t use the fuel. Christopher Doleman of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis warns that if renewable energy grows fast, reducing the need for LNG, countries may still have to pay for gas they no longer need.",
      "Pakistan is an example. Soaring LNG costs drove up electricity prices, pushing consumers to install rooftop solar panels. As demand for power drops and gas supply surges, the country is deferring LNG shipments and trying to resell excess fuel.",
      "Experts said that although countries are signaling a willingness to import more U.S. LNG, they're unlikely to import enough to have a meaningful impact on U.S. trade deficits.",
      "South Korea would need to import 121 million metric tons of LNG in a year \u2014 50% more than the total amount of LNG the U.S. exported globally last year and triple what South Korea imported, said Doleman. Vietnam \u2014 with a trade surplus with the U.S. twice the size of Korea\u2019s \u2014 would need to import 181 million metric tons annually, more than double what the U.S. exported last year.",
      "Other obstacles stand in the way. The Alaska LNG project is widely considered uneconomic. Both coal and renewable energy in Asia are so much cheaper that U.S. gas would need to cost less than half its current price to compete. Tariffs on Chinese steel could make building building gas pipelines and LNG terminals more expensive, while longstanding delays to build new gas turbines mean new gas power projects may not come online until 2032. Meanwhile, a global glut in LNG will likely drive prices lower, making it even harder for countries to justify locking into long-term deals with the United States at current higher prices.",
      "Committing to long-term U.S. LNG contracts could impact regional energy security at a time of growing geopolitical and market uncertainties, analysts said.",
      "A core concern is over the longterm stability of the U.S. as a trading partner, said Overland. \u201cThe U.S. is not a very predictable entity. And to rely on energy from there is a very risky proposition,\u201d he said.",
      "LNG only contributes to energy security when it\u2019s available and affordable, says Dario Kenner of Zero Carbon Analytics.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the bit that they leave out ... But it\u2019s pretty important,\u201d he said.",
      "This was the concern during the recent potential disruptions to fuel shipments through the Strait of Hormuz and earlier during the war in Ukraine, when LNG cargoes originally destined for Asia were rerouted to Europe. Despite having contracts, Asian countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka were outbid by European buyers.",
      "\u201cEvents in Europe, which can seem very far away, can have an impact on availability and prices in Asia,\u201d Kenner said.",
      "Asian countries can improve their energy security and make progress toward cutting carbon emissions by building more renewable energy, he said, noting there is vast room for that given that only about 1% of Southeast Asia\u2019s solar and wind potential is being used.",
      "\u201cThere are genuine choices to meet rising electricity demand. It is not just having to build LNG,\u201d he said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is granting two years of regulatory relief to coal-fired power plants, chemical manufacturers and other polluting industries as he seeks to reverse Biden-era regulations he considers overly burdensome.",
      "Trump issued a series of proclamations late Thursday exempting a range of industries that he calls vital to national security.",
      "The proclamations cover coal-fired power plants, taconite iron ore processing facilities used to make steel, and chemical manufacturers that help produce semiconductors and medical device sterilizers.",
      "The proclamations allow the facilities to comply with Environmental Protection Agency standards that were in place before rules imposed in recent years by President Joe Biden's administration, the White House said.",
      "Trump called the Biden-era rules expensive and, in some cases, unattainable. His actions will ensure that \u201ccritical industries can continue to operate uninterrupted to support national security without incurring substantial costs,'' the White House said in a fact sheet.",
      "Trump\u2019s EPA had earlier exempted dozens of coal-fired plants from air-pollution rules for the same reasons. The EPA also offered other industrial polluters a chance for exemptions from requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals such as mercury, arsenic and benzene. An electronic mailbox set up by the EPA allowed regulated companies to request a presidential exemption under the Clean Air Act to a host of Biden-era rules.",
      "Environmental groups have denounced the offer to grant exemptions, calling the new email address a \u201cpolluters\u2019 portal\u201d that could allow hundreds of companies to evade laws meant to protect the environment and public health. Mercury exposure can cause brain damage, especially in children. Fetuses are vulnerable to birth defects via exposure in a mother\u2019s womb.",
      "Within weeks of the EPA's offer, industry groups representing hundreds of chemical and petrochemical manufacturers began seeking the blanket exemptions from federal pollution requirements.",
      "The Clean Air Act enables the president to temporarily exempt industrial sites from new rules if the technology required to meet them is not widely available and if the continued activity is in the interest of national security.",
      "John Walke, clean air director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, said Trump\u2019s claims about technology problems and national security concerns were \u201cpretexts\u201d so he could help big corporations get richer.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump just signed a literal free pass for polluters,\u2033 Walke said. \u201cIf your family lives downwind of these plants, this is going to mean more toxic chemicals in the air you breathe.\u201d",
      "In April, the EPA granted nearly 70 coal-fired power plants a two-year exemption from federal requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals. A list posted on the agency\u2019s website lists 47 power providers \u2014 which operate at least 66 coal-fired plants \u2014 that are receiving exemptions from the Biden-era rules.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans in March to roll back dozens of key environmental rules on everything from clean air to clean water and climate change. Zeldin called the planned rollbacks the \u201cmost consequential day of deregulation in American history.\"",

The AP review included the agency\u2019s own prior assessments as well as a wide range of other research.",
      "In a related development, the EPA said Thursday it will give utility companies an additional year to inspect and report on contamination from toxic coal ash landfills across the country.",

      "Christopher Waller, a member of the Fed's governing board, said in a speech in New York City that the economy is showing signs of weakening, with consumer spending slowing and job gains cooling. The Fed should reduce borrowing costs to shore up spending and growth before the job market weakens further, Waller said.",
      "\u201cThe economy is still growing, but its momentum has slowed significantly,\u201d he said, adding that the slowdown threatens the Fed\u2019s goal of maximum employment.",
      "At the same time, President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs are likely to only lift inflation temporarily and aren't a reason to postpone rate cuts, Waller said.",
      "\u201cTariffs have boosted, and will continue to boost, inflation a bit above the (Fed's) 2% objective this year,\u201d Waller said, but policymakers should \u201clook through tariff effects and focus on underlying inflation,\u201d which he said is nearing the 2% goal.",
      "Waller has been mentioned as a potential replacement for Powell when the current chair\u2019s term expires in May 2026, or perhaps earlier if Trump takes the unprecedented step of firing Powell. Trump has threatened to fire Powell this year but on Wednesday said it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d he would take such a step.",
      "For his part, Powell has said the Fed wants to see the impact of the duties on prices and the economy before making any moves.",
      "Waller, a Trump appointee, has previously said that he would support a rate cut in July. Michelle Bowman, also a Trump appointee, has also spoken in favor of a cut.",
      "Minutes to the Fed's June 17-18 meeting said that only \u201ca couple\u201d of the 19 members of the central bank's interest-rate setting committee supported a cut in July.",
      "Other participants \u2014 the minutes didn't say how many \u2014 said that the Fed should keep rates unchanged this year, since inflation remains above 2%. Consumer prices rose 2.7% in June from a year ago, the fastest pace in four months.",
      "Other potential replacements for Powell have also publicly expressed support for cutting rates soon, including Kevin Warsh, a former member of the Fed's board who stepped down in 2011. Warsh, currently a fellow at the Hoover Institution, said on Fox News' \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d earlier this week that he supported rate cuts.",
      "\u201cThe president\u2019s right to be frustrated with Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve,\u201d Warsh said.",

      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has hinted at possible changes to TSA's liquid restrictions",
      "NEW YORK -- When limits on liquids were introduced at TSA checkpoints across the country in 2006, bins overflowed with bottled water, toothpaste, shaving cream and so much more. Nearly two decades later, travelers are much more accustomed to the \u201c3-1-1\u201d regulations\" governing the size of the liquids they're flying with, but scenes of passengers guzzling a beverage before putting their bags through the screening machines are still common.",
      "That's why Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sent ripples through the traveling public when she said earlier this week that changes might be afoot when it comes to the TSA's current liquid limits.",
      "\u201cThe liquids, I\u2019m questioning. So that may be the next big announcement, is what size your liquids need to be,\u201d Noem told a conference in Washington.",
      "Will travelers be able to carry bigger bottles? Multiple 1-quart bags of liquids? Those details haven't been rolled out. But coming on top of her announcement earlier this month that travelers could keep their shoes on at TSA checkpoints, it seems a much different security experience for American air travelers might be emerging.",
      "Airline travel changed dramatically after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Before that, airlines were responsible for security and would often contract it out to private firms, said Henry Harteveldt, an airline industry analyst with Atmosphere Research Group. Travelers often didn't need to show their ID at security checkpoints \u2014 and people without boarding passes, such as family members or friends, could go to the gate in some locations.",
      "\u201cIt was much more casual. And clearly it was ineffective, because 9/11 occurred,\u201d Hartevelt said.",
      "That's when the Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation Security Administration were born, with the mandate of preventing more terrorist attacks.",
      "The liquid limits, however, didn\u2019t kick in until 2006, after authorities foiled a plot that used liquid explosives smuggled aboard carry-on luggage. The TSA then very briefly banned all liquids in carry-on luggage. That ban lasted about six weeks, but strained airlines\u2019 baggage systems as more and more travelers turned to checked bags to pack toiletries.",
      "At the time the 3.4-ounce limit was implemented, the FBI and other laboratories had found that tiny amounts of substances small enough to fit into a quart-size bag couldn\u2019t blow up an airliner.",
      "When the ban was eventually lifted in September 2006, consumers and businesses alike had to learn how to adapt to the 3-1-1 rule \u2014 leading to more demand for smaller, travel size bottles of anything from shampoo to toothpaste, as well as clear, \u201cTSA approved\u201d toiletry bags that are still seen on store shelves today.",
      "The rule was also adopted in many countries around the world starting later that year.",
      "Keith Jeffries, a former TSA director at Los Angeles International Airport and now vice president of K2 Security Screening Group, says whatever comes next needs to be clear for passengers. And he knows whereof he speaks.",
      "Jeffries was working for TSA in Albuquerque, New Mexico, when the liquids rules came down overnight. Signage had to be changed to let passengers know of the new regulations. Barrels overflowing with toothpaste, shaving cream and shampoo had to be emptied every half hour. Jeffries remembers seeing a pair of shoes sitting in one of the barrels.",
      "When he asked why, a TSA staffer said there was gel in the soles. \u201cI said, 'Please tell me I don\u2019t have a passenger back there walking in the sterile area barefoot. And he says, 'No, sir, they still have their socks on,'\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how chaotic it was.\u201d",
      "Any move to simplify the screening process and cut down on the time it takes for passengers to navigate checkpoints would be a welcome change for everyone, Harteveldt says. Because it isn\u2019t just about convenience; those lines before the security checkpoints are the most at risk to a potential threat.",
      "The fact that the TSA felt confident enough to change its shoe policy earlier this month may not save too much time from an individual traveler\u2019s perspective, Harteveldt notes \u2014 but marks a \u201cbig step forward\u201d toward cutting down the average length of the security process when you think about the number of people going through U.S. airports each day. Relaxing current liquid restrictions could aid that effort.",
      "Still, questions remain. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is what the secretary is going to announce about liquids,\u201d Harteveldt said. \u201cWill they remove the liquid ban altogether \u2014 and can we go back to bringing full-sized of toiletries and other items with us? Will they allow people to bring more than one bag of toiletries and liquids? And importantly, will they relax the limit on (the) quart-size bag itself?\u2019\u201d",
      "It\u2019s also possible that the changes the TSA makes, whatever they are, only start at a handful of airports that have the technology to do so. Over the years, airports worldwide have adopted some aspects of security screenings faster or differently than others.",
      "But travelers could be confused if they\u2019re able to bring a full-size bottle of shampoo or lotion when flying out of one airport, for example, but not on their return trip home.",
      "\u201cThe devil is going to be in the details,\u201d Harteveldt said. \u201cThat\u2019s why the rollout plan will be absolutely critical.\u201d",
      "Harveldt says a more streamlined process could make travelers less stressed, but others \u2014 including flight attendants and pilots who are in the skies more frequently \u2014 may object and question whether airport security is being compromised. Still, Harveldt says he doesn\u2019t believe the TSA would make this change if the agency \u201cdidn\u2019t feel it was authentically, truly safe.\"",
      "If shoe regulations disappear and liquid restrictions are eased, the effects could ripple into the TSA PreCheck program, in which passengers submit information like their fingerprints and the agency prescreens them for any red flags. By giving the agency this information, the traveler then gets some benefits not available to other travelers \u2014 a special line to go through and the ability to keep their computers in their bags and their shoes on, for example.",
      "But if those benefits become more widely available to all passengers, will fewer people sign up for PreCheck?",
      "\u201cWhat is the impact on now both shoes and liquids going to have on TSA PreCheck enrollment? That is the million-dollar question,\" Jeffries said. \u201cAnd if I was still with TSA, I would be watching that closely over the next 12 to 18 months.\u201d",
      "While the prospect of increasing the current liquid limit could be a welcome change for many U.S. travelers, some experts say that the tech isn\u2019t available in enough airports yet. Current X-ray machines used at most airports today have a difficult time distinguishing between different types of liquids, says Jeffrey Price, a professor of aviation at Metropolitan State University of Denver.",
      "That\u2019s key, he explains, in determining whether something is harmless or potentially explosive.",
      "While newer computed tomography scanners are better and have begun making their way to airports, Price said in commentary published last week that it could take \u201canother decade or more\u201d before the newer machines are deployed at all U.S. airports.",
      "\u201cThis is an issue that needs to be studied much more carefully than the policy to leave your shoes on,\u201d he said in an email Thursday.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday said the agency's renovation of two of its buildings is in compliance with plans approved by a local commission, disputing a White House suggestion that they may have violated the law by deviating from those plans.",
      "The letter is the lastest salvo in an escalating battle between the Federal Reserve, an independent agency charged with fighting inflation and seeking maximum employment, and the Trump administration. President Donald Trump has for months criticized Powell and the Fed for not lowering its key interest rate, which the president says would boost borrowing and accelerate the economy.",
      "Powell has said he wants to see how the economy responds to Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs, which could raise inflation and slow growth, before making any moves.",
      "Trump has even threatened to fire Powell, though he has since backed away and said Wednesday it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that he would take the unprecedented step of doing so. Firing the Fed chair could cause chaos in the financial markets. Several executives of Wall Street banks have said this week that the Fed's independence from day-to-day politics is crucial.",
      "Still, the Trump administration has seized on ballooning costs for the Fed's renovation of two century-old buildings to argue that Powell has mismanaged the project. The president can't fire the Fed chair because of a policy disagreement, but he could do so \u201cfor cause,\u201d which is widely seen as some kind of malfeasance or neglect.",
      "Last week, the president's top budget adviser, Russell Vought, wrote Powell a letter that said Trump is \u201cextremely troubled\u201d by Powell's management of the project, which has risen in cost to about $2.5 billion, up from the Fed's initial estimate of $1.9 billion.",
      "Vought's letter also noted that Powell, in testimony before the Senate last month, said that the Fed removed some amenities that critics called ostentatious from its plans. Those plans had been approved by the National Capital Planning Commission in 2021.",
      "Vought said in his letter that if the renovation plans had changed, they were no longer \u201cin compliance with the approved plan\" and may violate the National Capital Planning Act.",
      "Powell responded Thursday that since the Fed\u2019s plans were approved by the NCPC in September 2021, it has made only \u201ca small number of design changes to scale back or eliminate certain elements\u201d and added that the changes weren\u2019t significant enough to \u201cwarrant... further review.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe project is proceeding in accordance with the plan that the NCPC approved,\u201d Powell wrote.",
      "The changes were intended \u201cto simplify construction and reduce the likelihood of further delays and cost increases,\u201d Powell said in his letter.",
      "Powell also defended the cost of the renovation: \u201cBoth buildings were in need of significant structural repairs,\u201d including \u201cthe removal of asbestos and lead contamination,\u201d as well as the \u201ccomplete replacement of antiquated systems such as electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilation and air conditioning, as well as fire detection and suppression systems,\u201d he wrote.",

      "Netflix on Thursday announced another quarter of steady growth built upon its video streaming service\u2019s more than 300 million subscribers",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Netflix on Thursday announced another quarter of steady growth as the video streaming service's more than 300 million subscribers have become increasingly attractive to advertisers.",
      "It\u2019s a familiar script that Netflix has followed for the past three years to widen its lead in video streaming while delivering financial results that have usually easily exceeded the analyst projections that steer investors.",
      "While Netflix's profit eclipsed Wall Street\u2019s expectations by a wide margin in the April-June quarter, its revenue came in right around the bar set by analysts. The Los Gatos, California, company earned $3.1 billion, or $7.19 per share, a 46% increase from the same time last year. Revenue rose 16% to $11.08 billion. Management also slightly raised its revenue forecast for the entire year, citing a belief that its programming lineup will reel in more subscribers in the second half than the first.",
      "Netflix\u2019s shares slipped 1% in extended trading, indicating investors expected an even more robust performance. But that is a minor stumble, given Netflix's stock price has soared 43% this year. The stock's strong run began during the second half of 2022 when the company introduced a low-priced version of its service with commercial interruptions as an antidote to an abrupt downturn in subscribers.",
      "The video streaming service is also faring well in Hollywood, as evidenced by the 120 Emmy nominations showered upon its programs earlier this week \u2013 second only to Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s HBO Max. In the past quarter, Netflix hailed \u201cSirens,\u201d \u201cGinny & Georgia\u201d and \u201cThe Four Seasons\u201d as being among its most watched programming.",
      "The popularity of Netflix\u2019s scripted programming combined with weekly World Wrestling Entertainment spectacles, high-profile boxing matches and periodic National Football League games have enabled its service to retain subscribers while its prices rise, including on the cheapest tier.",
      "Netflix stopped providing quarterly updates on its total subscribers at the beginning of this year, but the company\u2019s revenue growth leaves no doubt that the number has grown from the 302 million reported at the end of 2024.",
      "It\u2019s gradually turning into an advertising magnet, too.",
      "Although Netflix still isn\u2019t selling enough commercials to require a disclosure of its advertising revenue, management continues to highlight the growth in its results. Netflix said its ad revenue for this year is on pace to double from last year.",

Last week\u2019s number was also lower than the 232,000 that analysts forecast. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as representative of layoffs.",
      "Earlier this month, the Labor Department reported that U.S. employers added a surprising 147,000 jobs in June, adding to evidence that the American labor market continues to show resilience despite uncertainty over President Donald Trump\u2019s economic policies. The job gains were much bigger than expected and the unemployment rate ticked down 4.1% from 4.2% in May. Analysts were expecting the unemployment to rise to 4.3%.",
      "Though the job market is broadly healthy by historical standards, some weakness has surfaced as employers contend with fallout from Trump\u2019s policies, especially his aggressive tariffs, which raise prices for businesses and consumers.

      "After an earlier pullback, consumers picked up their spending in June showing resilience despite anxiety high over tariffs and the U.S. economy",
      "WASHINGTON -- After an earlier pullback, consumers picked up their spending in June despite anxiety over tariffs and the state of the U.S. economy.",
      "Retail sales rose a better-than-expected 0.6% in June after declining 0.9% in May, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Sales in April fell 0.1%, pulled down by a steep drop in auto sales, after Americans ramped up their car-buying in March to get ahead of President Donald Trump\u2019s 25% duty on imported cars and car parts.",
      "Excluding autos and automotive parts, sales rose 0.5%, according to the Commerce Department.",
      "There was broad-based strength across the board. Clothing and accessories sales rose 0.9%, while health and personal care sales saw a 0.5% bump. Restaurants sales rose 0.6% , while online retailers recorded a 0.4% gain. Autos and automotive parts dealers rebounded with a 1.2% increase.",
      "There were a few weak spots like electronics and appliance retailers and department stores, both of which had sales declines.",
      "Heather Long, the chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, noted that layoffs remain low and consumers are still confident enough that the economy is chugging along.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t count the American consumer out yet,\" said Long in a statement. \"There\u2019s still a lot of trepidation about tariffs and likely price hikes, but consumers are willing to buy if they feel they can get a good deal. The word of the summer for the economy is resilient.\u201d",
      "The retail sales report arrives amid a whipsaw frenzy of on and off again tariffs have that jolted businesses and households. For businesses, that has made it harder to manage supply and inventories. Americans are focusing more on necessities, when they do shop.",
      "The latest government report showed that inflation rose last month to its highest level since February as Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs push up the costs of everything from groceries and clothes to furniture and appliances.",
      "Consumer prices rose 2.7% in June from a year earlier, the Labor Department said Tuesday, up from an annual increase of 2.4% in May. On a monthly basis, prices climbed 0.3% from May to June, after rising just 0.1% the previous month.",
      "Trump insists that the U.S. effectively has no inflation as he has attempted to pressure Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell into reducing short-term interest rates.",
      "Yet the new inflation numbers make it more likely that the central bank will leave rates where they are. Powell has said that he wants to measure the economic impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs before reducing borrowing costs.",
      "Americans have continued to spend, which is what the Fed had hoped to curtail a little bit with rate hikes.",
      "One big litmus test was Amazon\u2019s four-day Prime event along with competing retail sales from the likes of Walmart and Target that kicked off last week. Adobe Digital Insights, which tracks online sales, reported that the sales events drove $24.1 billion in online spending, a 30.3% increase compared with the same period last year.",
      "Still, those that were buying prioritized essentials like dish soap and paper products over big-ticket purchases, according to consumer data provider Numerator, based on its analysis of Amazon Prime orders.",
      "Deborah Weinswig, founder and CEO of Coresight Research, said she\u2019s becoming more optimistic about the financial health of the consumer after the Amazon Prime events. She said inventories are at a healthy level, and she didn\u2019t see big fire sales.",
      "\u201dPeople aren\u2019t buying things that they don\u2019t need,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a healthier retail environment.\u201d",
      "Retailers are now turning their attention to the back-to-school shopping season, which is the second largest consumer rush after the winter holidays. Coresight Research estimates that total U.S. back-to-school spending will increase by 3.3% year compared with the year-ago period, to $33.3 billion. And it predicts that shoppers will do a big chunk of their shopping before August to get ahead of tariffs.",
      "Economists will also dissect quarterly financial reports next month from major retailers like Walmart, Target and Macy\u2019s, both for consumer behavior and to gauge how businesses are navigating a chaotic period of global trade due to fluid U.S. policies.",
      "Levi Strauss & Co. said last week that it was cutting back on making styles that aren\u2019t selling and making targeted price increases as it moves production away from China due to tariffs.",

      "A Trump administration proposal could put more than a million low-income households at risk of losing their government-subsidized housing",
      "WOODINVILLE, Wash. -- More than 1 million low-income households \u2014 most of them working families with children \u2014 who depend on the nation\u2019s public housing and Section 8 voucher programs could be at risk of losing their government-subsidized homes under the Trump administration\u2019s proposal to impose a two-year time limit on rental assistance.",
      "That\u2019s according to new research from New York University, obtained exclusively by The Associated Press, which suggests the time restriction could affect as many as 1.4 million households helped by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.",
      "The NYU report also raises concerns about the largely untested policy, as most of the limited number of local housing authorities that have voluntarily tried the idea eventually abandoned the pilots.",
      "\u201cIf currently assisted households are subject to a two-year limit, that would lead to enormous disruption and large administrative costs,\" for public housing authorities, the report said, adding that once the limit was up, housing authorities \"would have to evict all of these households and identify new households to replace them.\u201d",
      "Amid a worsening national affordable housing and homelessness crisis, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is determined to reshape HUD\u2019s expansive role providing stable housing for low-income people, which has been at the heart of its mission for generations.",
      "At a June congressional budget hearing, HUD Secretary Scott Turner argued reforms like time limits will fix waste and fraud in public housing and Section 8 voucher programs while motivating low-income families to work toward self-sufficiency.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s broken and deviated from its original purpose, which is to temporarily help Americans in need,\u201d Turner said. \u201cHUD assistance is not supposed to be permanent.\u201d",
      "Elderly and disabled people would be exempted, but there\u2019s little guidance from the agency on how time-limited housing assistance would be implemented \u2014 how it would be enforced, when the clock starts and how the exemptions would be defined.",
      "The NYU researchers dove deep into HUD\u2019s nationwide data over a 10-year period, analyzing nearly 4.9 million households that have been public housing and Section 8 voucher tenants. Of that, about 2.1 million could be affected by the time limits because they include at least one adult who is not elderly or disabled and about 70% of those households had already been living on those subsidies for two or more years.",
      "HUD spokesperson Kasey Lovett pushed back on the NYU study.",
      "\u201cThere is plenty of data that strongly supports time limits and shows that long-term government assistance without any incentive disincentivizes able-bodied Americans to work,\u201d Lovett said in a statement.",
      "The time limits could displace more than a million children, as it would largely punish families who are working but still earning far below their area\u2019s median income.",
      "\u201cHousing assistance is especially impactful for children,\u201d said Claudia Aiken, the director of new research partnerships for the Housing Solutions Lab at NYU's Furman Center who co-authored the study with Ellie Lochhead. Their health, education, employment and earnings potential can \u201cchange in really meaningful ways if they have stable housing,\u201d Aiken said.",
      "Havalah Hopkins, a 33-year-old single mom, has been living in a public housing unit outside of Seattle since 2022, but now fears a two-year time limit would leave her and her teenage son homeless. The 14-year-old boy has autism but is considered high-functioning, so how HUD defines disabled and \u201cable-bodied\u201d for the time limit could determine if their family will be affected by the restriction.",
      "Hopkins, who does catering work for a local chain restaurant, pays $450 a month in rent \u2014 30% of her household income \u2014 for their two-bedroom apartment in Woodinville, Washington.",
      "Asked what she likes most about her home, Hopkins said: \u201cI like that I can afford it.\u201d",
      "Of the 17 housing authorities that tried time limits, 11 discontinued the trial. None tried two-year limits \u2014 the most common policy was a five-year limit with the option for an extra two and the limits usually applied to specific programs or referrals.",
      "Although there are over 3,000 housing authorities in the country, only 139 of them have ever been granted flexibility to consider testing a time limit while using federal funds for programs such as job training and financial counseling.",
      "\u201cAny conversation about time limits ends up being this really nuanced, hyper-local focus on what works for specific communities rather than this broad national-level implementation,\u201d said Jim Crawford, director of the Moving to Work Collaborative which oversees that group of housing authorities.",
      "Even with those supports, several housing authorities said rent was still too high and well-paying jobs were scarce, according to the study. Others said they didn\u2019t have enough capacity to provide enough supportive services to help households afford rent.",
      "Shawnt\u00e9 Spears of the Housing Authority of the County of San Mateo in California said the agency's five-year time limits have \u201cgiven folks motivation\u201d to meet their goals in tandem with self-sufficiency programs funded by dollars Trump wants to cut. Time limits also give more households the chance to use vouchers, she said.",
      "But with the Bay Area\u2019s high rents, some tenants still have to spend more than half of their income on rent once their time is up or end up back on waitlists.",
      "\u201cI believe the program is very helpful in getting folks prepared but there lies this really, really significant rent burden here in our county,\u201d said Spears. \u201cWhen folks do leave our time-limited program, they are facing an uphill battle.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz are signing a treaty Thursday to strengthen defense ties and combat migrant smuggling across the English Channel",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz are set to sign a treaty on Thursday pledging to tighten defense ties and step up law-enforcement cooperation against gangs that smuggle migrants across the English Channel.",
      "The center-right German leader is in London on his first official visit to Britain since taking office in May. Starmer visited Berlin in August 2024, announcing plans for the U.K.-Germany \u201cfriendship and cooperation\u201d treaty with Merz\u2019s predecessor, Olaf Scholz.",
      "A priority for Starmer, who heads the center-left Labour Party, is curbing the gangs behind cross-channel people smuggling. About 37,000 people were detected crossing the English Channel from France in small boats in 2024, and more than 20,000 people made the crossing in the first six months of 2025. Dozens of people have died trying to cross.",
      "Berlin agreed last year to make facilitating the smuggling of migrants to the U.K. a criminal offence, a move that will give law enforcements more powers to investigate the supply and storage of small boats to be used for the crossings. Merz is expected to commit to adopting the law change by the end of the year.",
      "\u201cChancellor Merz\u2019s commitment to make necessary changes to German law to disrupt the supply lines of the dangerous vessels which carry illegal migrants across the Channel is hugely welcome,\u201d Starmer said, calling the U.K. and Germany \u201cthe closest of allies.\u201d",
      "Germany and the U.K. \u2013 Europe\u2019s largest and second-largest economies \u2013 are also expected to announce a series of investment deals.",
      "The treaty builds on a defense pact the U.K. and Germany, two of the biggest European supporters of Ukraine, signed last year pledging closer co-operation against a growing threat from Russia. It includes a promise to come to one another\u2019s aid in case of attack.",
      "The two leaders also are expected to agree Thursday to joint export campaigns for jointly produced equipment such as Boxer armored vehicles and Typhoon jets, and to develop a deep precision strike missile in the next decade.",
      "Starmer has worked to improve relations with Britain\u2019s neighbors, strained by the U.K.\u2019s acrimonious departure from the European Union in 2020. He has sought to rebuild ties strained by years of ill-tempered wrangling over Brexit terms. He has ruled out rejoining the 27-nation bloc\u2019s single market or customs union, and has been cool to the idea of a youth mobility agreement with the EU, but has sought to reduce trade barriers and to strengthen defense cooperation.",
      "\u201cI make no secret of the fact I very much regret to this day that Britain left the European Union,\u201d Merz told the German parliament last week. \u201cBut if they at least work together with us again in the area of foreign and security policy, then that is a very good sign. Prime Minister Keir Starmer wants that.\u201d",

      "\u201cHe told about his training sessions, how he prepared for the fight, but he also mentioned his journey from his childhood to becoming champion,\u201d Andrii said. \u201cHe\u2019s an ambassador of Ukraine and he supports energy workers. He can bring attention to the problem.\u201d",
      "Russia has repeatedly struck Ukraine\u2019s power grid during the war. At one point, 90% of DTEK\u2019s thermal generation capacity was damaged or destroyed.",

      "\u201cRussia destroyed hospitals, Russia destroyed schools, Russia destroyed lives \u2014 Ukrainian lives,\u201d the undefeated Usyk told the gathering. \u201cBut we will survive.\u201d",

      "Higashioka first reached base on a one-out single, a sinking liner that American League starting left fielder Riley Greene had in his glove after a sliding play on the ball that was ruled to have hit the ground.",
      "Tigers manager A.J. Hinch challenged, but the safe call stood after a lengthy replay review. The ball certainly bounced, but it was unclear on several angles if Greene had the tip of his glove under the ball when it ricocheted up into the webbing.",
      "With Higashioka at first, Jonah Heim then hit a grounder up the middle fielded by shortstop Javier B\u00e1ez on the move in front of second base. Still going forward, B\u00e1ez extended his glove and the ball to his left without making contact with Higashioka, who did a sidestep and stopped seemingly out of the baseline to avoid him. The shortstop then made a throw wide of first base that allowed Heim to reach safely and Higashioka to advance to third.",
      "Second base umpire Alfonso Marquez, also the crew chief, was explaining his call to B\u00e1ez when Hinch came out for a lengthy argument.",
      "B\u00e1ez was the AL starting center fielder in the All-Star Game on Tuesday night, but in the first game out of the break for the Tigers made his 28th start at shortstop \u2014 the same number of games he has started in the outfield this season.",
      "Higashioka got stranded at third base when Josh Smith had a shallow flyout on a 3-0 pitch before Corey Seager struck out.",

      "Bassitt (10-4) allowed 10 hits, struck out five and walked none in 6 1/3 innings as AL East-leading Toronto kicked off the second half by improving to 33-16 at home.",

      "Verlander (0-8) allowed four runs and matched a season high by allowing nine hits in 2 2/3 innings, extending his career-worst winless streak to 16 starts. It was Verlander\u2019s shortest outing since he went 2 1/3 innings against Seattle on April 4, his second start of 2025.",
      "Verlander started in Toronto for the first time since no-hitting the Blue Jays with Houston on Sept. 1, 2019, his second of two career no-hitters in Canada.",
      "The veteran right-hander allowed Springer\u2019s ground ball single in the first inning, then gave up four runs on six hits in the second. He was replaced by Tristan Beck after a two-out walk to Will Wagner, Toronto\u2019s No. 9 hitter.",
      "Wagner hit a two-run double off Verlander in the decisive second inning.",
      "Left-hander Little replaced Bassitt with runners at first and second in the seventh. Little struck out pinch-hitter Luis Matos and struck out Heliot Ramos to end the threat.",
      "Verlander is one game shy of matching the Giants record for consecutive winless starts, set by Mark Davis between June 19, 1984 and June 30, 1986.",
      "RHP Logan Webb (9-6, 2.94 ERA) is scheduled to start for the Giants on on Saturday against Blue Jays LHP Eric Lauer (4-2, 2.78).",

      "The goal was an event that appealed to both a new audience in one of NASCAR\u2019s most important regions and the most ardent racing fans. NASCAR used to race at Chicagoland Speedway in Joliet, a 45-mile drive from downtown, but it pulled out after the 2019 season.",

      "The Los Angeles Clippers have signed Bradley Beal after the Phoenix Suns bought out his contract",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles Clippers have signed three-time All-Star guard Bradley Beal after the final two years of his contract were bought out by the Phoenix Suns earlier this week.",
      "The team announced his signing on Friday. Beal agreed to an $11 million, two-year deal, his agent Mark Bartelstein told The Arizona Republic.",
      "Beal averaged 17 points, 3.7 assists, 3.3 rebounds and 32.1 minutes while starting 38 of 53 games for the Suns last season. Beal shot 50% from the floor, 39% from 3-point range and 80% from the foul line.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a great guy,\u201d Suns owner Mat Ishbia told Sirius XM NBA Radio on Thursday. \u201cJust not a fit with the Phoenix Suns going forward. We told him that. We made that decision. We let them know we wanted to move forward without him. It doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s a bad guy. It doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s a bad player.\"",
      "In Los Angeles, Beal joins a veteran Clippers roster led by Kawhi Leonard and James Harden. The 32-year-old guard will get a chance to move past his two disappointing, injury-riddled seasons in Phoenix.",
      "\u201cPlayers of this caliber are very rare, and they\u2019re hard to come by,\u201d Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said in a statement. \u201cHe's been the best player on his team. You can put him in so many different spots and he\u2019ll find ways to score: out of pick-and-roll, coming off screens, catch-and-shoot. He can create his own or he can play off the ball. He\u2019s a great cutter. He\u2019s also a great playmaker who is going to make everybody else better.\u201d",

      "Ichiro Suzuki has long cherished baseball history and he has visited Cooperstown in New York",
      "When Ichiro Suzuki landed in Seattle and became an instant star in 2001, captivating a city and helping his new team win an AL-record 116 games, he acclimated to his new life in practically no time largely because he had already been around the club during spring training a couple of years before.",
      "As Suzuki looks back decades later on those early days in a Mariners uniform, now a Hall of Famer and 51 years old still giving himself to the game at every chance, the speedy leadoff hitter is beyond grateful for the bonds then between Seattle and his previous club in Japan, Orix Blue Wave.",
      "\u201cThat whole relationship before even coming over to Seattle in 2001, it was already there, that relationship was set,\u201d Suzuki said Friday, speaking through interpreter Allen Turner on a call organized by the Hall of Fame.",
      "\u201cIn 2001 when I came I didn\u2019t feel like this was the first time being in America playing baseball because I had that experience and I had that connection with the Mariners. So it was a great start to coming to Seattle. And obviously having the 2001 season, being able to play in front of the great fans here and having that great of a season, that really kind of started the great career here in Seattle.\u201d",
      "He would go on to win AL Rookie of the Year and MVP honors playing for Lou Piniella during that emotional season \u2014 when the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks were cause for a subdued celebration of the AL West title barely more than a week later \u2014 making the Mariners' $13 million-plus payment to Orix for the rights to Ichiro an investment for the ages.",
      "Suzuki cherishes baseball history so much to this day he has taken previous trips to Cooperstown, New York, to honor the players who made a difference long before he left his lasting mark across the globe.",
      "Now it\u2019s his turn to be enshrined in the Hall of Fame, his time to make a speech about a brilliant baseball career that brought him from Japan to the big leagues and far beyond. Suzuki will be side by side with pitchers Billy Wagner and CC Sabathia to be honored at the July 27 induction ceremony.",
      "Suzuki considers it a responsibility, perhaps even a calling, to continue spreading the word on baseball over the years \u2014 \u201cWe\u2019re able to play this game because of players of the past,\u201d he said. He hopes the sport never strays too far from its foundation, either.",
      "\u201cBaseball is human beings playing against human beings, and to have the passion and the energy that is created by that is something that I really hope is still part of the game,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I really value and it is very important to me that baseball continues to be a game that has the human element to it, with all the emotions and everything that comes along with having humans play this game.\u201d",
      "Suzuki wound up with 3,089 hits over a remarkable 19-year major league career including 14 total seasons with Seattle. There were separate three-year stints with the New York Yankees and Miami before he spent his final two seasons back in the familiar Pacific Northwest on the Mariners. Three different times he played all 162 games, in 2005 and 2010 for Seattle, then in '12 between the Mariners and Yankees.",
      "The left-handed hitter will long be remembered for his meticulous attention to every detail, from that iconic batting stance featuring a deep knee bend to loosen up and then a stretch to fully extend his right arm before making a slight tug at his sleeve with the left hand, to extreme care for his body \u2014 he regularly used a small wooden tool to massage his feet while sitting at his locker.",
      "He's embracing being a mentor now, for anybody who asks, that is. He isn't one to offer unsolicited advice. And, no, the younger generation doesn't have to do it exactly his way, he will offer his wisdom regardless.",
      "\u201cAnybody has an opportunity to ask me,\u201d he said, \u201cIf I can be of any help to the players that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d",

      "China's Ministry of State Security says it is cracking down on alleged smuggling of rare earths materials that it says threaten national security",
      "BANGKOK -- China's state security agency says it is cracking down on alleged smuggling of rare earths minerals that it says threaten national security, just weeks after Beijing and Washington agreed to make it easier for American firms to obtain from China those materials, which are critical for manufacturing and computer chip production.",
      "In a report published Friday in the state-run newspaper Global Times, the Ministry of State Security said foreign \u201cespionage and intelligence agencies\u201d were colluding to steal rare earths-related goods by repackaging and relabeling rare metals to hide their Chinese origin.",
      "In some cases the minerals were falsely declared as non-controlled items, mislabeled as such things as \u201csolder paste,\u201d mixed into other materials like ceramic tiles, or hidden in plastic mannequins or bottled water, it said.",
      "It referred only to an unnamed \u201ccertain country\u201d that it said lacked the capacity to make and refine its own rare earths.",
      "Investigations had found Chinese criminals were involved, exploiting shipping and delivery channels to evade controls on exports of the materials used in many high-tech applications including electric vehicle batteries, it said.",
      "The crackdown followed a report by Reuters earlier this month detailing how rare earths were being transshipped to the U.S. via Thailand and Mexico.",
      "China is the main source for many strategically vital rare earths and it has moved to slow exports of such minerals in retaliation for steep import duties President Donald Trump has imposed on Chinese goods since he returned to the White House and launched his crusade to overturn a global trading system he says is unfair to the United States and its workers.",
      "That followed an earlier series of restrictions by Beijing on exports of such materials as gallium, germanium, antimony and tungsten in response to trade friction with the administration of then-President Joe Biden.",
      "In April, Beijing imposed permitting requirements on seven rare earth elements, under a Chinese law that applies to all exports, not just those bound for the U.S. market.",
      "With the permitting process taking 45 days, the new requirement caused a pause in shipments, threatening to disrupt production of cars, robots, wind turbines and other high-tech products in the U.S. and around the world. The U.S., meanwhile, added to restrictions on exports of advanced technologies to China.",
      "Rare earths have remained at the center of China-U.S. talks aimed at staving off huge tariff increases that were postponed in May to allow time for negotiations on a broader trade agreement. The deadline for reaching a deal is Aug. 12.",
      "An agreement announced in late June did not remove China\u2019s permitting requirement on rare earths, but Beijing agreed to flexibility in dialing up or down the approval process as needed.",
      "Computer chips are another key bone of contention.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry said Friday that it had taken note of a decision by the Trump administration to lift restrictions on exports of key semiconductors used in artificial intelligence made by Nvidia and its rival Advanced Micro Devices.",
      "In April, the Trump administration announced it would restrict sales of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips to China \u2014 as well as MI308 chips from AMD.",
      "But Commerce Ministry spokesman Wang Wentao said restoring healthy trade ties will require more action by Washington.",
      "U.S. export controls on Ascend chips made by Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies have hurt the interests of Chinese companies, Wang told reporters in Beijing.",
      "\u201cWe hope that the United States and China will meet each other halfway and correct their wrong practices through equal consultation, create a good environment for mutually beneficial cooperation between enterprises of both sides, and jointly maintain the stability of the global semiconductor production and supply chain,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cHow to say you\u2019re from Rostov without saying a word? Show one bar of cellphone service,\" Pavel Osipyan raps while walking around the city, smartphone in hand. \"We have internet until 12 o'clock, and recently there\u2019s been no connection at all. No need to be angry, just get used to it already.\u201d",
      "The complaints by Osipyan \u2014 unable to pay electronically for groceries, or having to use paper maps while driving \u2014 aren't isolated to Rostov-on-Don, which borders Ukraine and, as home to Russia's Southern Military District, is targeted frequently by drones.",
      "In the last two months, cellphone internet shutdowns, which officials say are needed to foil Ukrainian drones, have hit dozens of Russian regions \u2014 from those near the fighting to parts of Siberia and even the Far East. Some Wi-Fi outages also have been reported.",
      "Russians contacted by The Associated Press talked about card payments not going through, taxi and ride-sharing apps not working properly, ATMs that sometimes fail.",
      "Experts point to the unprecedented nature of the measures and warn of far-reaching consequences in a country where the Kremlin already has significantly curtailed online freedom.",
      "Such shutdowns in the name of security legitimize them to the public and open the door for authorities abusing the restrictions, said Anastasiya Zhyrmont, policy manager for Eastern Europe and Central Asia at the Access Now digital rights group.",
      "Experts say the trend began in May, when Russia celebrated the 80th anniversary of the defeat of the Nazi Germany in World War II and foreign dignitaries flocked to Moscow for a big military parade.",
      "The capital suffered severe disruptions of cellphone connectivity to the internet for days, and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed those were deliberate restrictions due to regular Ukrainian drone attacks. Asked how long they'd last, he replied, \"This will be done as needed.\u201d",
      "Russia has restricted smartphone connectivity before, with isolated instances during protests, as well as in regions bordering Ukraine.",
      "Shutdowns in the capital, however, sent a signal to authorities across the vast country that it\u2019s a useful tool, said lawyer Sarkis Darbinyan, founder of Russian internet freedom group Roskomsvoboda.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s \"Operation Spiderweb\u201d in early June, in which drones launched from containers on trucks attacked airfields deep inside Russia, made officials all the more eager to take action, Darbinyan said.",
      "\u201cThey got really scared that drones now may appear, like a jack-in-the-box, in any Russian regions,\u201d he told AP.",
      "By mid-July, deliberate shutdowns spread to most of the country, according to Na Svyazi \u2014 Russian for \u201cstaying connected\u201d \u2014 an activist group tracking internet availability.",
      "On Tuesday, the group reported cellphone internet shutdowns in 73 of over 80 regions. In 41 of them, there were reports of broadband network outages as well, while restrictions on broadband internet occurred in six regions, while cellphone connections were fine.",
      "Some regional officials confirmed that cellphone internet was restricted for security reasons. Nizhny Novgorod Gov. Gleb Nikitin said this month the measure will stay in place in the region east of Moscow for \u201cas long as the threat remains.\u201d",
      "Asked Thursday whether such mass shutdowns were justified, Peskov said \u201ceverything that has to do with ensuring the safety of citizens, everything is justified and everything is a priority.\u201d",
      "Russians from affected regions say the outages can last for hours or days; patterns also are hard to discern, with service working in one part of a city but vanishing elsewhere.",
      "In Voronezh, near Ukraine and frequently targeted by drones, one resident said she felt like she was in \u201ca cave\u201d in early July with no cellphone internet or Wi-Fi in her home. The woman, who spoke to AP on condition of anonymity because of security concerns, said she was only able to get online at work the next day.",
      "Cellphone internet in the southwestern city of Samara \"goes out at the most unpredictable moments,\u201d said Natalia, who also spoke on condition that her last name be withheld for safety reasons. Her home Wi-Fi recently also has slowed to a near halt around 11 p.m., staying that way for a few hours, she said.",
      "Connectivity has improved recently in the Siberian city of Omsk, said Viktor Shkurenko, who owns retail stores and other businesses there. But cellphone internet service was out in his office for an entire week. A few of his smaller stores that rely on cellphone networks suffered disruptions, but nothing critical, he said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t feel any super strong discomfort,\" said Grigori Khromov of Nizhny Novgorod, Russia\u2019s fifth-largest city where regular and widespread shutdowns were reported. \"I have an office job and I work either at home or in the office and have either wire internet or Wi-Fi.\u201d",
      "In rural areas, small towns and villages, where cellphone internet often is the only way to get online, the situation was harder to gauge.",
      "Pharmacies in such areas have struggled, Russian media reported and the Independent Pharmacies Association confirmed to AP. Viktoria Presnyakova, head of the association, said in a statement that prescriptions must be logged in special software, but that becomes impossible without an internet connection for weeks.",
      "A social media user in the Belgorod region bordering Ukraine complained on Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov\u2019s social media page that without cellphone internet and a working alarm system, village residents have to bang on a rail to warn neighbors of an attack. The authorities promised to look into improving connectivity in the area.",
      "Authorities elsewhere also announced steps to minimize disruptions by opening Wi-Fi spots. They also are reportedly planning to establish an agency to coordinate the shutdowns, according to Izvestia, a Kremlin-backed newspaper that cited unidentified government sources. Peskov said he was unaware of the plan.",
      "Russian and Ukrainian drones use cellphone internet networks to operate, so shutdowns are one way authorities try to counter the attacks, said Kateryna Stepanenko, a Russia analyst at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War.",
      "But it's also part of the Kremlin's long-term effort to rein in the internet. Authorities have actively censored online content in the last decade, blocking thousands of websites of independent media, opposition groups and human rights organizations.",
      "After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the government blocked major social media like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, as well as encrypted messenger platform Signal and a few other messaging apps.",
      "Access to YouTube \u2014 wildly popular in Russia \u2014 was disrupted last year in what experts called deliberate throttling by the authorities. The Kremlin blamed YouTube owner Google for not properly maintaining its hardware in Russia.",
      "State internet watchdogs routinely block virtual private network services that help circumvent the restrictions, and there are plans to introduce a national messenger app, expected to replace foreign ones.",
      "Along with the shutdowns, these are part of a larger campaign \u201cto establish control over the internet, which is something the Kremlin had failed to do 20 years prior on the same level that China did,\u201d said the ISW's Stepanenko.",
      "Access Now's Zhyrmont says it's \u201cvery disturbing\u201d that Russians have gotten used to living with growing internet restrictions, including shutdowns.",
      "\u201cThis shouldn't be modern reality,\u201d she said.",

      "An advisory board convened by OpenAI says it should continue to be controlled by a nonprofit because the artificial intelligence technology it is developing is \u201ctoo consequential\u201d to be governed by a corporation alone",
      "OpenAI should continue to be controlled by a nonprofit because the artificial intelligence technology it is developing is \u201ctoo consequential\u201d to be governed by a corporation alone.",
      "That is the message from an advisory board convened by OpenAI to give it recommendations about its nonprofit structure \u2014 delivered in a report released Thursday, along with a sweeping vision for democratizing AI and reforming philanthropy.",
      "\u201cWe think it\u2019s too important to entrust to any one sector, the private sector or even the government sector,\u201d said Daniel Zingale, the convener of OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit commission and a former adviser to three California governors. \u201cThe nonprofit model allows for what we call a common sector,\u201d that facilitates democratic participation.",
      "The recommendations are not binding on OpenAI, but the advisory commission, which includes the labor organizer Dolores Huerta, offers a framework that may be used to judge OpenAI in the future, whether or not they adopt it.",
      "In the commission's view, communities that are already feeling the impacts of AI technologies should have input on how they are developed, including how data about them is used. But there are currently few avenues for people to influence tech companies who control much of the development of AI.",
      "OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, started in 2015 as a nonprofit research laboratory and has since incorporated a for-profit company with a valuation that has grown to $300 billion. The company has tried to change its structure since the nonprofit board ousted its CEO Sam Altman in Nov. 2023. He was reinstated days later and continues to lead OpenAI.",
      "It has run into hurdles escaping its nonprofit roots, including scrutiny from the attorney generals in California and Delaware, who have oversight of nonprofits, and a lawsuit by Elon Musk, an early donor to and founder of OpenAI.",
      "Most recently, OpenAI has said it will turn its for-profit company into a public benefit corporation, which must balance the interests of shareholders and its mission. Its nonprofit will hold shares in that new corporation, but OpenAI has not said how much.",
      "Zingale said Huerta told the commission their challenge was to help make sure AI is a blessing and not a curse. To grapple with those stakes, they envision a nonprofit with an expansive mandate to help everyone participate in the development and trajectory of AI.",
      "\u201cThe measure of this nonprofit will be in what it builds, who it includes, and how faithfully it endures to mission and impact,\" they wrote.",
      "The commission toured California communities and solicited feedback online. They heard that many were inspired by OpenAI\u2019s mission to create artificial intelligence to benefit humanity and ensure those benefits are felt widely and evenly.",
      "But, Zingale said many people feel they are in the dark about how it\u2019s happening.",
      "\u201cThey know this is profoundly important what\u2019s happening in this \u2018Age of Intelligence,\u2019 but they want to understand better what it is, how it\u2019s developed, where are the important choices being made and who\u2019s making them?\u201d he said.",
      "Zingale said the commission chose early on not to interact with Altman in any way in order to maintain their independence, though they quote him in their report. However, they did speak with the company\u2019s senior engineers, who they said, \u201centered our space with humility, seriousness, and a genuine desire to understand how their work might translate into democratic legitimacy.\u201d",
      "The commission proposed OpenAI immediately provide significant resources to the nonprofit for use in the public interest. For context, the nonprofit reported $23 million in assets in 2023, the most recent year that its tax filing is available.",
      "The commission recommend focusing on closing gaps in economic opportunity, investing in AI literacy and creating an organization that is accessible to and governed by everyday people.",
      "\u201cFor OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit to fulfill its mandate, it should commit to more than just doing good - it should commit to being known, seen, and shaped by the people it claims to serve,\u201d they wrote.",
      "The commission suggested opening a rapid response fund to help reduce economic strains now. Zingale said they specifically recommended funding theater, art and health.",
      "\u201cWe're trying to make the point that they need to dedicate some of their resources to human to human activities,\u201d he said.",
      "The commission also recommended setting up a requirement that a human lead the nonprofit, which Zingale said is a serious recommendation and \u201ca sign of the times.\"",

      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- Wednesday\u2019s magnitude 7.3 earthquake off Alaska's Aleutian Islands chain struck in a region that has experienced a handful of powerful quakes within the last five years \u2014 including one that shook communities almost exactly two years earlier.",
      "Officials said Thursday they had received no reports of injuries or major damage from the latest event, which triggered a tsunami warning that lasted about an hour before being downgraded and prompted communities along a 700-mile (1,127-km) stretch of Alaska\u2019s southern coast to urge people to move to higher ground. The official maximum wave height at Sand Point, a community 55 miles (88 kilometers) north of the epicenter, was about 3.9 inches (10 centimeters), said Kara Sterling, a lead duty scientist at the National Tsunami Warning Center. It occurred at low tide.",
      "The earthquake struck at 12:37 p.m. local time, prompting the center's tsunami warning.",
      "There are a number of ways people in warning areas can receive notifications, including the sounding of sirens in communities that have them, listening to weather radio or public radio broadcasts, following official accounts on social media, or via push alerts on cellphones. In some places, local officials have relayed warnings door to door, said Jeremy Zidek, a spokesperson with the state's emergency management division.",
      "Public safety departments in King Cove and Unalaska sent alerts urging those in coastal areas or those that could see inundation to seek higher ground.",
      "The warning issued by the center was downgraded to an advisory before being canceled around 2:45 p.m.",
      "Alaska is the most earthquake-prone state in the U.S. and one of the most seismically active regions in the world, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The state experiences a magnitude 7 earthquake almost annually, and the second-largest earthquake ever recorded was centered about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of Anchorage, the agency said. That 1964 magnitude 9.2 earthquake \u2014 and the tsunami it triggered \u2014 killed about 130 people.",
      "The Aleutian arc is no stranger to earthquakes, but the activity in the region where Wednesday's earthquake struck has gotten scientists' attention. The area, within a few hundred miles of the earthquake, has \u201clit up\u201d since 2020, with Wednesday's earthquake marking the fifth exceeding magnitude 7.0 since 2020, said state seismologist Michael West.",
      "\u201cI would not call this an isolated earthquake. It appears to be part of a larger sequence spanning the last several years,\" he said. But West added: \u201cThere's no reason to be alarmist about this.\u201d",
      "Some communities have buildings designated on higher ground as meetup points during tsunami warnings, such as a school, while others might simply urge residents to retreat up a hillside, Zidek said.",
      "\u201cThat area of Alaska, most areas of Alaska, it gets steep real quick,\u201d he said.",
      "Sometimes, the only warning one might have is the shaking ground, Zidek said. \u201cIf it shakes violently for 20 seconds or more, that is your warning sign, and you should head to higher ground if you\u2019re in a coastal area,\u201d he said.",
      "Zidek and West said people should continue to heed warnings. West said he worries about a \u201cburnout effect\u201d among residents in the region, some of whom have evacuated numerous times since 2018 in response to larger earthquakes that have not caused significant damage.",
      "West said he is reminded of a magnitude 8.6 earthquake in 1946 \u2014 west of the location of Wednesday's quake \u2014 that generated a deadly tsunami and led to the creation of a U.S. tsunami warning system. The death toll included more than 150 people in Hawaii, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "\u201cThis area is capable of trans-Pacific tsunamis, and I feel like maybe the best way to stay vigilant ... is maybe to look into our deeper history beyond just the last five years,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "San Jose\u2019s mayor is using AI tools like ChatGPT to streamline city operations and improve services for its 1 million residents",
      "Before the mayor of San Jose, California, arrives at a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a new business, his aides ask ChatGPT to help draft some talking points.",
      "\u201cElected officials do a tremendous amount of public speaking,\u201d said Mayor Matt Mahan, whose recent itinerary has taken him from new restaurant and semiconductor startup openings to a festival of lowriding car culture.",
      "Other politicians might be skittish admitting a chatbot co-wrote their speech or that it helped draft a $5.6 billion budget for the new fiscal year, but Mahan is trying to lead by example, pushing a growing number of the nearly 7,000 government workers running Silicon Valley's biggest city to embrace artificial intelligence technology.",
      "Mahan said adopting AI tools will eliminate drudge work and help the city better serve its roughly 1 million residents.",
      "He\u2019s hardly the only public or private sector executive directing an AI-or-bust strategy, though in some cases, workers have found that the costly technology can add hassles or mistakes.",
      "\u201cThe idea is to try things, be really transparent, look for problems, flag them, share them across different government agencies, and then work with vendors and internal teams to problem solve,\u201d Mahan said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s always bumpy with new technologies.\u201d",
      "By next year, the city intends to have 1,000, or about 15%, of its workers trained to use AI tools for a variety of tasks, including pothole complaint response, bus routing and using vehicle-tracking surveillance cameras to solve crimes.",
      "One of San Jose's early adopters was Andrea Arjona Amador, who leads electric mobility programs at the city\u2019s transportation department. She has already used ChatGPT to secure a $12 million grant for electric vehicle chargers.",
      "Arjona Amador set up a customized \u201cAI agent\u201d to review the correspondence she was receiving about various grant proposals and asked it to help organize the incoming information, including due dates. Then, she had it help draft the 20-page document.",
      "So far, San Jose has spent more than $35,000 to purchase 89 ChatGPT licenses -- at $400 per account -- for city workers to use.",
      "\u201cThe way it used to work, before I started using this, we spent a lot of evenings and weekends trying to get grants to the finish line,\u201d she said. The Trump administration later rescinded the funding, so she pitched a similar proposal to a regional funder not tied to the federal government.",
      "Arjona Amador, who learned Spanish and French before she learned English, also created another customized chatbot to edit the tone and language of her professional writings.",
      "With close relationships to some of the tech industry's biggest players, including San Francisco-based OpenAI and Mountain View-based Google, the mayors of the Bay Area's biggest cities are helping to promote the type of AI adoption that the tech industry is striving for, while also promising guidelines and standards to avoid the technology's harms.",
      "San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie announced a plan Monday to give nearly 30,000 city workers, including nurses and social workers, access to Microsoft\u2019s Copilot chatbot, which is based on the same technology that powers ChatGPT. San Francisco's plan says it comes with \u201crobust privacy and bias safeguards, and clear guidelines to ensure technology enhances \u2014 not replaces \u2014 human judgment.\u201d",
      "San Jose has similar guidelines and hasn't yet reported any major mishaps with its pilot projects. Such problems have attracted attention elsewhere because of the technology's propensity to spew false information, known as hallucinations.",
      "ChatGPT's digital fingerprints were found on an error-filled document published in May by U.S. Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr.'s \"Make America Healthy Again\" commission.",
      "In Fresno, California, a school official was forced to resign after saying she was too trusting of an AI chatbot that fabricated information in a document.",
      "While some government agencies have been secretive about when they turn to chatbots for help, Mahan is open about his ChatGPT-written background memos that he turns to when making speeches.",
      "\u201cHistorically, that would have taken hours of phone calls and reading, and you just never would have been able to get those insights,\" he said. \"You can knock out these tasks at a similar or better level of quality in a lot less time.\u201d",
      "He added, however, that \"you still need a human being in the loop. You can\u2019t just kind of press a couple of buttons and trust the output. You still have to do some independent verification. You have to have logic and common sense and ask questions.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, when OpenAI introduced a new pilot product called Operator, it promised a new kind of tool that went beyond a chatbot's capabilities. Instead of just analyzing documents and producing passages of text, it could also access a computer system and schedule calendars or perform tasks on a person's behalf. Developing and selling such \u201cAI agents\" is now a key focus for the tech industry.",
      "More than an hour's drive east of Silicon Valley, where the Bay Area merges into Central Valley farm country, Jamil Niazi, director of information technology at the city of Stockton, had big visions for what he could do with such an agent.",
      "Perhaps the parks and recreation department could let an AI agent help residents book a public park or swimming pool for a birthday party. Or residents could find out how crowded the pool was before packing their swim clothes.",
      "Six months later, however, after completing a proof-of-concept phase, the city didn't buy a full license for the technology due to the cost.",
      "The market research group Gartner recently predicted that over 40% of \u201cagentic AI\u201d projects will be canceled before the end of 2027, \u201cdue to escalating costs, unclear business value or inadequate risk controls.\u201d",
      "San Jose's mayor remains bullish about the potential for these AI tools to help workers \u201cin the bowels of bureaucracy\u201d to rapidly speed up their digital paperwork.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just an amazing amount of bureaucracy that large organizations have to have,\u201d Mahan said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s finance, accounting, HR or grant writing, those are the kinds of roles where we think our employees can be 20 (to) 50% more productive -- quickly.\u201d",
      "\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014",
      "The Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of AP\u2019s text archives.",

      "For 37 years in a searing California desert, runners from across the globe have embarked on a 135-mile race through one of the hottest places on Earth",
      "DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK, Calif. -- When the running gets hard in this desert dubbed \u201chell on Earth,\u201d Danny Westergaard tells himself: \u201cSlow and steady\u201d or \u201csmooth as butter.\u201d",
      "For 18 years, Westergaard, 66, has braved the scorching summer heat of California\u2019s Death Valley in an ultramarathon billed as the world\u2019s toughest. Last week, 99 runners from across the globe embarked on a grueling 135 mile (217.26 kilometer) competition from the lowest point below sea level of North America to the trailhead of the highest peak in the contiguous U.S. They had 48 hours to do it. Few have completed the competition as many times as Westergaard, though finishing is not a given.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just become like a summer ritual and a family reunion,\" he said. \u201cI feel at home when I\u2019m here. It\u2019s my tribe.\u201d",
      "For the 37th year, the Badwater 135 Ultramarathon challenged athletes to withstand stretches of this dry, searing desert. The race takes place in July, when temperatures have soared into the 130s F (54.44s C). Even as a place of extremes, Death Valley is not immune to global warming. Seven of its hottest summers have occurred in the past 10 years, according to the National Park Service. And if planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions continue at their current pace, more places could experience its broiling temperatures.",
      "Over two days, Westergaard would trek up and down mountain ranges, past sand dunes and salt flats, through quaint towns and vast desertscapes amid temperatures as high as 117 F (47.22 C). He tried to smile throughout, even when he felt miserable.",
      "\u201cIt just lifts you up,\u201d he said of smiling so others smile back.",
      "At 8 p.m., the first wave of runners take off. Westergaard jogs up a ramp into the pale light of dusk. It\u2019s 113 F (45 C), and it feels like a blow dryer to the face.",
      "Leap frogging in a van behind him is his cheer squad and support crew \u2013 Jennifer Drain, his smiley cousin back for the 17th year, and daughters Meagan, who has attended before, and Madison, a first timer. The crew, who playfully call Westergaard \"wiener dog,\u201d are hauling everything he needs: food, ice, water, electrolytes.",
      "This heat can kill. Soaring body temperatures can lead to organ failure and strain the heart, especially for people with heart disease, and cause heat stroke. To prevent that they keep him cool. They spray mist on him and pour ice into his hat and a bandana wrapped around his neck. His drinking water is ice cold.",
      "A few hours in, Meagan asks her dad if he\u2019s peed. \u201cLong stream,\" he responded of his amount of urine. Staying hydrated is critical. As he sweats, he\u2019s losing liquids that can critically stress kidneys if not replenished. Dehydration can cause organs to fail from lack of blood, oxygen and nutrients, leading to seizures and death.",
      "No runners have died doing the competition, but heat-related issues are common, said Megan Dell, the race's medical director. Stomach issues can lead to vomiting and dehydration. Hyponatremia \u2014 which happens when your blood's sodium is too low \u2014 has sent runners to the hospital.",
      "Westergaard has learned to embrace the rollercoaster. One moment he feels like Superman \u2014 the next he could be throwing up on the side of the road, questioning if he\u2019ll make it. \u201cYou just suck it up, just like in life, and get through the lows, and it always gets better.\u201d",
      "The runners dash toward mile 50.8 (81.75 kilometers), the critical cut off point they must get to by 10 a.m. or be eliminated. The sun is peaking over the mountains, casting a warm glow over dune fields. It\u2019s 85 F (29.44 C).",
      "\u201cLiving the dream, ey?\u201d Westergaard said with a smile, his perky strut now a droopy shuffle.",
      "He pours water on his face and arms and munches some watermelon. Madison paces behind him as they crack jokes. \u201cGet er done! Junior wiener in training!\u201d Meagan yelled.",
      "Westergaard makes it to the cut off point before 9 a.m. It\u2019s 90 F (32.2 C).",
      "Mile 56 (90.12 kilometers): After moving for 14 hours straight, Westergaard rests and eats some avocado toast. \u201cGreat! Let\u2019s motor!\u201d he said after 10 minutes sitting on a chair.",
      "Miles later, he begins his descent into \u201cthe oven\u201d that is Panamint Valley, usually the hottest part of the race during the hottest part of the day. It\u2019s 96 F (35.56 C) and the heat sizzles from above and below. Westergaard runs on the white line on the road because it\u2019s cooler. In hotter years, the asphalt got so hot the bottoms of his shoes felt sticky on the ground.",
      "Westergaard trains year round to acclimate to the heat. As he gets older, he doesn't tolerate heat as well and has slowed down. His two-hour sauna sessions are now one, and he runs a few times a week instead of daily.",
      "\u201cI'm just out there longer,\u201d he said, \u201cbut still getting it done.\u201d",
      "Tony Wolf, kinesiology professor at the University of Georgia, said aging adults generally have reduced heart function compared to younger adults. When combined with the cardiovascular demand of exercise and heat stress, it can cause difficulties.",
      "There isn\u2019t much research about how the bodies of fit older adults, including competitive athletes, regulate internal temperature. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a ton of people in their 60s and older who are doing those kinds of events,\u201d said Wolf.",
      "Studies focused on adults before and after a training program found that exercise improved heart function and thermoregulation. That could suggest that the heart and thermoregulation impairments linked to aging are largely mitigated by lifelong fitness, Wolf said.",
      "The runners are spread out now, their flashing lights twinkling in the distance. This night is the toughest for Westergaard as sleep deprivation sets in. He zigzags on the road, barely awake. The runners ahead of him look like they're running toward him.",
      "In past years, his hallucinations have included people luring him to rest on couches that were actually bushes. Another time, he struck up a conversation with a kid skateboarding by him with a dog. And once, he watched for hours as a guy swung off the edge of the crescent moon, waving down at him.",
      "\u201cIt was just clear as day,\u201d Westergaard said of the hallucination.",
      "At 3:10 a.m. at mile 98 (157.72 kilometers), he sleeps for 15 minutes under the moonlight.",
      "\u201cNo one really quite understands\u201d why he does this, said Madison.",
      "At 11:50 a.m. and around mile 123 (197.95 kilometers), Westergaard shuffles through the town of Lone Pine. Mount Whitney, the tallest peak in the continental U.S., soars some 14,500 feet (4,420 meters) into the blue sky.",
      "A crowd claps and cheers as he runs by.",
      "\u201cGo Danny, go!\u201d yelled a man.",
      "It's 92 F (33.33 C) as he approaches the final 4,750 foot (1,447.8 meters) mountain ascent to the finish line. Westergaard is walking at a snail's pace and says he\u2019s falling asleep. But his smile hasn\u2019t waned.",
      "\u201cWe've come a long way,\u201d Westergaard said, Madison pacing behind and spraying him.",
      "\u201cLong way for a burger!\u201d she responded. They giggle while thinking about the veggie burger they'll buy upon finishing.",
      "Then he does, crossing the finish line with his crew at exactly 45 hours and 29 minutes.",
      "It was his most special Badwater 135 race by far, he says misty eyed, having Meagan and Madison at his side.",

      "A coalition of philanthropic funders will spend $1 billion over 15 years to help develop artificial intelligence tools to help spur economic mobility",
      "A coalition of funders, including the Gates Foundation and Ballmer Group, will spend $1 billion over 15 years to help develop artificial intelligence tools for public defenders, parole officers, social workers and others who help Americans in precarious situations.",
      "The funders announced Thursday that they will create a new entity, NextLadder Ventures, to offer grants and investments to nonprofits and for-profits to develop tools for those who often manage huge caseloads with few resources.",
      "\u201cThe solutions that we\u2019re investing in, the hundreds of entrepreneurs that are going to bring forward solutions that incorporate leading edge technologies, are going to do it by coming alongside people who are living through some of the struggles in the economy,\u201d said Brian Hooks, CEO of Stand Together, a nonprofit started by Kansas-based billionaire Charles Koch.",
      "The other funders include hedge fund founder John Overdeck and Valhalla Foundation, which was started by Inuit cofounder Steve Cook and his wife Signe Ostby. Ballmer Group is the philanthropy of former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and his wife Connie. The funders declined to reveal the exact financial commitments made by each of the contributors.",
      "The point of investing in these AI tools is to spur economic mobility, a focus all the funders share, they said. The funders believe there are many ideas for how AI technologies could help match people with resources after a disaster or an eviction, for example, or help a parole officer close out more cases for people who have met all of the criteria but are waiting for the paperwork to be processed.",
      "\u201cAs we traded notes on where we were making investments and where we saw broader gaps in the sector, it was readily apparent that there was a real opportunity to come together as a group of cofunders and cofounders to establish a new kind of investment organization,\u201d said Kevin Bromer, who leads the technology and data strategy at Ballmer Group. He will also serve as a member on NextLadder's board, which will include three independent board members and representatives from the other funders.",
      "NextLadder will be led by Ryan Rippel, who previously directed the Gates Foundation's economic mobility portfolio. The funder group has not yet determined if NextLadder will incorporate as a nonprofit or a for profit organization but said any returns they make from investments will go back into funding new initiatives.",
      "NextLadder will partner with AI company Anthropic, which will offer technical expertise and access to its technologies to the nonprofits and companies it invests in. Anthropic has committed around $1.5 million annually to the partnership, said Elizabeth Kelly, its head of beneficial deployments, which is a team that focuses on giving back to society.",
      "\u201cWe want to hand-hold grantees through their use of Claude with the same care and commitment we provide to our largest enterprise customers,\u201d Kelly said, referencing Anthropic's large language model.",
      "Hooks, of Stand Together, said philanthropy can reduce the riskiness of these types of investments and offer organizations more time to prove out their ideas.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re successful, this will be the first capital to demonstrate what\u2019s possible,\u201d Hooks said.",
      "Researchers like those at the Active Learning Network for Accountability and Performance in humanitarian action have studied some of the risks associated with using AI tools when interacting with sensitive populations or handling high-stakes interactions, for example, in humanitarian contexts.",
      "They recommend assessing whether AI is the best tool to solve the problem and, crucially, if it works reliably and accurately enough in high-risk settings. They also recommend assessing tools for bias, considering privacy protections and weighing the cost of potential dependence on a specific provider.",
      "The National Institute of Standards and Technology also emphasizes that trustworthy AI systems should be accountable to users and that it should be possible to explain or trace how a tool arrived at a certain conclusion or decision.",
      "Hooks emphasized that any AI tools NextLadder invests in will be shaped by the needs and feedback of these frontline workers. Tools that don't work for them, won't succeed, he said. Even with the potential risks of AI tools, he said it's imperative that groups that are struggling to move up the economic ladder have access to new technologies.",
      "\u201cThe idea that we would deprive those who are struggling in our country from the benefits of the leading edge solutions is unacceptable,\u201d Hooks said.",

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The Trump administration revoked federal funding for California's high-speed rail project on Wednesday, intensifying uncertainty about how the state will make good on its long-delayed promise of building a bullet train to shuttle riders between San Francisco and Los Angeles.",
      "The U.S. Transportation Department announced it was pulling back $4 billion in funding for the project, weeks after signaling it would do so. Overall, a little less than a quarter of the project's funding has come from the federal government. The rest has come from the state, mainly through a voter-approved bond and money from its cap-and-trade program.",
      "President Donald Trump and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy both have slammed the project as a \u201ctrain to nowhere.\"",
      "\u201cThe Railroad we were promised still does not exist, and never will,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"This project was Severely Overpriced, Overregulated, and NEVER DELIVERED.\u201d",
      "The loss marks the latest blow to California by the Trump administration, which has blocked a first-in-the-nation rule to phase out the sale of new gas-powered cars, launched investigations into university admission policies and threatened to pull funding over transgender girls being allowed to compete in girls sports.",
      "It also comes as rail project leaders are seeking private investment to help pay for its estimated price tag of more than $100 billion.",
      "Voters first approved the project in 2008 and it was supposed to be operating this decade. But cost estimates have consistently grown and its timeline pushed back.",
      "State officials are now focused on building a 119-mile (192-kilometer) stretch connecting the Central Valley cities of Bakersfield and Merced that is set to be operating by 2033. The California High Speed Rail Authority is slated to release a report this summer to state lawmakers with an updated funding plan and timeline for the project.",
      "Authority officials wrote in a letter earlier this month that the Trump administration made up its mind about revoking funding before thoroughly reviewing the project. They noted that more than 50 structures have already been built, including underpasses, viaducts and bridges to separate the rail line from roadways for safety.",
      "\u201cCanceling these grants without cause isn\u2019t just wrong \u2014 it\u2019s illegal,\u201d authority CEO Ian Choudri said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThese are legally binding agreements, and the Authority has met every obligation, as confirmed by repeated federal reviews, as recently as February 2025.\"",
      "The authority has asked potential private investors to express their interest by the end of the month.",
      "Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state will keep \u201call options on the table\u201d to fight the revocation of federal funds.",
      "\u201cTrump wants to hand China the future and abandon the Central Valley. We won\u2019t let him,\" he said in a statement.",
      "The state has \u201cno viable plan\u201d to complete even the Central Valley segment, said Drew Feeley, acting administrator of the transportation department's Federal Railroad Administration, in a report released last month. He called the project a \u201cstory of broken promises\u201d and a waste of taxpayer dollars.",
      "California Democrats also have criticized project spending. Democratic Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan said at a budget hearing earlier this year that her constituents \u201coverwhelmingly believe\u201d high-speed rail spending \u201chas been irresponsible.\u201d",
      "Newsom plans to extend the state's cap-and-trade program, a key funding source for the project which is set to expire at the end of 2030, through 2045.",
      "The program sets a declining limit on the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions large emitters can release. Those polluters can buy allowances from the state needed to pollute, and about 45% of that money goes into what's known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, according to the Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee, a group of experts that reviews the program.",
      "The fund helps pay for climate and transportation projects, including high-speed rail.",
      "The bullet train project receives 25% of the money from the fund, which ends up being a little less or a little more than $1 billion annually, depending on the year. Newsom in May proposed guaranteeing $1 billion a year for the project from the fund, but lawmakers have not agreed to that.",

      "Cleaning your electronic devices is essential for hygiene and performance",
      "LONDON -- Smartphones, laptops, headphones and other electronic devices are essential for work and play in our daily lives. But all that time spent typing, scrolling or listening also means our devices gradually accumulate grime that needs to be cleaned off.",
      "You might not give much thought to cleaning your devices but there are reasons you should, says Logitech, which makes keyboards, webcams and other computer peripherals.",
      "\u201cRegular cleaning and proper maintenance not only keeps your gadgets looking pristine, and wins you hygiene points, it also helps them perform better and last longer,\u201d the company says. \u201cIn the case of devices like earbuds, the accumulated bacteria and debris may even cause health issues or discomfort.\u201d",
      "Here are some pointers on cleaning your tech:",
      "Always check if the manufacturer has any specific guidelines for cleaning.",
      "Assemble some basic equipment and material for cleaning, which should include a soft and lint-free cleaning cloth, like a microfiber cloth; cotton swabs; a soft-bristled brush like a toothbrush, paintbrush or makeup brush; compressed air and isopropyl alcohol.",
      "Isopropyl, or rubbing alcohol, is a non-toxic cleaning solvent that\u2019s antiseptic and antibacterial. It's popular for cleaning electronics because it doesn\u2019t leave any residue and dries quickly. But you might want to wear gloves to avoid skin irritation. Drip some of it on a cloth instead of pouring it directly onto your device. Also heed some of the more specific warnings below.",
      "Water and mild soap can be useful for cleaning dirty surfaces, but isopropyl alcohol is recommended for cleaning the internals of a device, said Alex Diaz-Kokaisl, senior technical writer at electronics repair company iFixit.",
      "\u201cWhile there isn\u2019t a hard-and-fast rule for cleaning electronics, we generally use high-concentration isopropyl alcohol (more than 90%) because it evaporates quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cThe faster a liquid evaporates, the less likely it is to affect any components that conduct electricity.\u201d",
      "For whatever device you're cleaning, disconnect or power it off first. Remove any cases, plugs, covers and accessories.",
      "When using a computer, the keyboard and mouse are the parts that are touched most often and therefore need the most frequent cleaning. And all those crevices between a keyboard's keys are sure to catch crumbs.",
      "To remove any loose debris, iFixit's official in-house cleaning guide recommends using a can of compressed air. Run the spray back and forth across the keys to blow out any bits. If possible, hold the keyboard upside down so the debris falls out.",
      "If you don\u2019t have compressed air, Logitech suggests using a hair dryer on the cold air setting. Some social media users also recommend a handheld balloon pump.",
      "Next, dampen a cleaning cloth with water and gently wipe down the keyboard and mouse.",
      "Logitech says you can also use rubbing alcohol but recommends you test it first on an inconspicuous spot to make sure it doesn't cause discoloration or scrub the lettering off the keys.",
      "Anti-bacterial baby wipes can also work on devices like a mouse, Diaz-Kokaisl said.",
      "\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be enough liquid to seep through cracks in the shell, and their residue typically evaporates faster than just using soap and water,\u201d he said.",
      "For laptop screens or external monitors, use a dry microfiber cloth to gently wipe away fingerprint smudges.",
      "If there are more stubborn spots \u2014 like food stains or sneezy spatters \u2014 dampen the cloth with distilled water or a 50/50 solution of distilled water and vinegar.",
      "Computer maker Lenovo says the \u201cgentle acidity of vinegar can help break down oils and fingerprints.\u201d Avoid using household glass cleaners, which can contain ammonia that could damage the screen. The same goes for paper towels, which can scratch the screen. HP also warns against using rubbing alcohol.",
      "A lot of people listen to music or podcasts through their earbuds, but that also means they'll need regular cleaning to remove any earwax, natural skin oils or other grungy buildup.",
      "If the earbuds have silicon tips, remove them. Cleaning procedures vary depending on your brand and model. Logitech and Bose recommend using soapy water. But Sony warns against water or wet wipes because they can speed deterioration, and, instead, advises using a dry cloth.",
      "Use a cotton swab to wipe the earbud nozzles clean.",
      "Owners of Apple AirPods need to follow a much more elaborate procedure to clean the mesh. You'll need a child's toothbrush, two small cups, a paper towel, distilled water, as well as micellar water \u2014 typically used as a facial cleanser.",
      "Pour some micellar water into a cup, dip the toothbrush, brush the AirPod's various mesh parts, and then blot them dry with the paper. Repeat twice. Then repeat that procedure but using the distilled water to rinse off the micellar water. Finally, let the AirPods dry for at least two hours.",
      "To clean the rest of the AirPod's body, use a damp cloth. And don't forget about the charging case. Apple recommends brushing out any debris and then wiping with a dry cloth. If needed, dampen it with isopropyl alcohol.",
      "What about over-the-ear headphones? Bose says you should wipe them down at least once a week, especially after working out, to remove any dirt and bacteria hiding in the nooks and crannies. Remove the pads and use a cloth dampened with soapy water to clean them.",
      "Apple has issued specific instructions on its website for cleaning various iPhone models. Samsung has posted similar guidelines for its Galaxy lineup.",
      "They both advise using a soft, lint-free cloth, such as a lens cleaning cloth, to gently wipe the outside of the phone. Apple warns against using any cleaning products, which could erode the oil-repellent coating that most iPhones come with.",
      "Both companies say it\u2019s OK to use disinfectants such as rubbing alcohol to gently clean the exterior, but avoid bleach or hydrogen peroxide.",

      "Astronomers have discovered the earliest seeds of rocky planets forming around a baby sun-like star",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Astronomers have discovered the earliest seeds of rocky planets forming in the gas around a baby sun-like star, providing a precious peek into the dawn of our own solar system.",
      "It\u2019s an unprecedented snapshot of \u201ctime zero,\u201d scientists reported Wednesday, when new worlds begin to gel.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve captured a direct glimpse of the hot region where rocky planets like Earth are born around young protostars,\" said Leiden Observatory\u2019s Melissa McClure from the Netherlands, who led the international research team. \u201cFor the first time, we can conclusively say that the first steps of planet formation are happening right now.\u201d",
      "The observations offer a unique glimpse into the inner workings of an emerging planetary system, said the University of Chicago\u2019s Fred Ciesla, who was not involved in the study appearing in the journal Nature.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the things we\u2019ve been waiting for. Astronomers have been thinking about how planetary systems form for a long period of time,\" Ciesla said. \u201cThere's a rich opportunity here.\u201d",
      "NASA\u2019s Webb Space Telescope and the European Southern Observatory in Chile teamed up to unveil these early nuggets of planetary formation around the young star known as HOPS-315. It\u2019s a yellow dwarf in the making like the sun, yet much younger at 100,000 to 200,000 years old and some 1,370 light-years away. A single light-year is 6 trillion miles.",
      "In a cosmic first, McClure and her team stared deep into the gas disk around the baby star and detected solid specks condensing \u2014 signs of early planet formation. A gap in the outer part of the disk gave allowed them to gaze inside, thanks to the way the star tilts toward Earth.",
      "They detected silicon monoxide gas as well as crystalline silicate minerals, the ingredients for what\u2019s believed to be the first solid materials to form in our solar system more than 4.5 billion years ago. The action is unfolding in a location comparable to the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter containing the leftover building blocks of our solar system\u2019s planets.",
      "The condensing of hot minerals was never detected before around other young stars, \u201cso we didn\u2019t know if it was a universal feature of planet formation or a weird feature of our solar system,\u201d McClure said in an email. \u201cOur study shows that it could be a common process during the earliest stage of planet formation.\u201d",
      "While other research has looked at younger gas disks and, more commonly, mature disks with potential planet wannabes, there\u2019s been no specific evidence for the start of planet formation until now, McClure said.",
      "In a stunning picture taken by the ESO's Alma telescope network, the emerging planetary system resembles a lightning bug glowing against the black void.",
      "It\u2019s impossible to know how many planets might form around HOPS-315. With a gas disk as massive as the sun\u2019s might have been, it could also wind up with eight planets a million or more years from now, according to McClure.",
      "Purdue University\u2019s Merel van \u2019t Hoff, a co-author, is eager to find more budding planetary systems. By casting a wider net, astronomers can look for similarities and determine which processes might be crucial to forming Earth-like worlds.",

      "At Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, a half-dozen workers are making what appear to be gray billiard balls",
      "OAK RIDGE, Tenn. -- Near signs that warn of radioactive risk at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a half-dozen workers from the nuclear power company X-energy are making what appear to be gray billiard balls. Inside, they're packed with thousands of tiny black spheres that each contain a speck of uranium enriched beyond what today\u2019s power plants use.",
      "The United States is chasing a new age of nuclear power that banks on domestic production of reactor fuel like X-energy is making, and though the work at Oak Ridge is unfolding across just 3,000 square feet, X-energy and others are already revving up for big production.",
      "President Donald Trump set a goal of quadrupling domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, signing executive orders in May to speed up development. A new wave of advanced nuclear reactors could be operational around 2030.",
      "But just like cars won\u2019t run without gas, those plants won\u2019t run without fuel. To expand nuclear energy long-term, the nation must maximize its nuclear fuel production, according to Trump.",
      "In Oak Ridge, X-energy has broken ground on a massive, nearly $2 billion campus for a new fuel fabrication facility, the first in the United States in over half a century. The nuclear fuel company Standard Nuclear, also in Oak Ridge, aims to produce metric tons of fuel for advanced reactors. A supplier named Orano is likewise looking to build a multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment facility nearby.",
      "\u201cThis is a unique time,\u201d said Tyler Gerczak, Oak Ridge National Laboratory\u2019s principal investigator for the cooperative with X-energy\u2019s subsidiary TRISO-X. \u201cThe momentum is incredible.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press toured the lab where X-energy is making small amounts of fuel for testing. Anyone beyond a magenta-and-yellow chain that warns of radioactivity must wear gowns, two layers of gloves and radiation monitors. When they leave, they're tested for radioactivity.",
      "X-energy, a Maryland-based company, uses uranium to make so-called TRISO fuel \u2014 inside what's known as \u201cpebbles.\u201d Those are the billiard balls. The Energy Department says it's the most robust nuclear fuel on Earth because the particles cannot melt in a reactor.",
      "At the lab, the first step is making a uranium cocktail that resembles dark yellow lemonade.",
      "Uranium powder, in the form of triuranium octoxide, gets added to nitric acid, said Dan Brown, vice president of fuel development for TRISO-X. Then carbon and an organic solution are added. They have two glass containers set up \u2014 one wears a heated jacket, looking almost like a little sweater, that helps the uranium dissolve into the acid solution. The second cools the acid solution while the carbon source is added, which turns the mix near-black, he said.",
      "At another station, in a long clear tube, the cocktail solidifies into small black spheres with a jellybean-like consistency. Those black balls, about the size of poppyseeds, then travel through machines under temperatures as high as 1,800 degrees Celsius to get protective carbon coatings \u2014 like candy dipping \u2014 that make them look like very tiny BBs.",
      "X-energy uses graphite and other cohesive materials to bind 18,000 kernels together into a larger sphere. That gets coated in a final layer of graphite to seal the final pebble. In the end, it\u2019s strong enough to withstand the weight of an SUV.",
      "The pebbles will eventually give up their energy in the high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor X-energy is developing, with about 220,000 pebbles per reactor, like gumballs in a gumball machine. When they exit the bottom, if energy remains, the pebbles will return to the top for another pass. Each one could be used about six times. X-energy also plans to make fuel products for other advanced reactor designs.",
      "The national laboratory lends X-energy its expertise, research and high-tech equipment for analysis and will evaluate samples, as will some universities. Other samples are archived. Idaho National Laboratory received a batch for its advanced test reactor, Brown said.",
      "Critics of building more nuclear reactors say they\u2019re too expensive and riskier than other low-carbon energy sources.",
      "\u201cWithout a substantial decrease in construction costs, it\u2019s not worth the avoided greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d said David Kemp, a Cato Institute policy analyst.",
      "Kemp said Trump's 25-year quadrupling goal is unrealistic because it would mean building nuclear reactors faster than ever. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two, at a Georgia nuclear plant, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget.",
      "Many next-generation reactors will use high-assay low-enriched uranium. It's fuel that's enriched to a higher level than traditional large nuclear reactors use, allowing the newer reactors to run longer and more efficiently, sit on smaller footprints and produce less waste, according to the Department of Energy.",
      "There\u2019s little of it made in the United States right now.",
      "Only Russia and China currently have the infrastructure to make large amounts of high-assay low-enriched uranium. In the United States, Centrus Energy produced the nation\u2019s first 20 kilograms of high-assay low-enriched uranium in more than 70 years in late 2023, to show it can produce limited quantities for commercial reactors.",
      "A big takeaway from Trump's executive orders is the need to \u201camp up\u201d domestic production of nuclear fuel to reduce dependence on foreign sources and enable in the long term expansion of American nuclear energy, according to the Energy Department.",
      "At the Nuclear Energy Institute trade association, Benjamin Holtzman, director of new nuclear, said he thinks the fuel will be ready for a new generation of U.S. nuclear reactors needed to meet the growing demand for electricity \u2014 if the right actions are taken now.",
      "X-energy CEO J. Clay Sell said he hopes to help solve the fuel problem so it doesn\u2019t hold back new reactor development. The Energy Department has awarded funding to X-energy. Amazon invested in X-energy too, and they\u2019re collaborating to bring more than 5 gigawatts of new U.S. power projects online by 2039.",
      "X-energy is the only one with an application before the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to license a new fabrication facility to transform enriched uranium into fuel products for nuclear reactors. Another applicant has asked to amend an existing license to make fuel for advanced reactors, according to the NRC. About five additional companies have told the NRC they are interested in making fuel for advanced reactors.",
      "X-energy's pilot lab at the National Laboratory started in 2016. The company now has 100 acres in Oak Ridge and growing for its nuclear fuel production complex.",
      "The first factory could be operational by late 2027 or early 2028, capable at full operation of assembling enough fuel orbs to power 11 of its new-age reactors; a second by late 2029, with a capacity four times greater, said TRISO-X President Joel Duling.",
      "\u201cI've been through two or three \u2018nuclear renaissances,\u2019\" Duling said. \u201cThis isn't a renaissance. This is a game-changer.\u201d",

      "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says export controls on advanced chips require companies to adapt",
      "BEIJING -- The head of Nvidia downplayed his role in getting the U.S. government to lift a ban on selling an advanced computer chip in China and said it will take time to ramp up production once orders for the AI-processor come in.",
      "CEO Jensen Huang, speaking Wednesday in the Chinese capital Beijing, was upbeat about the prospects for the H20 chip, which was designed to meet U.S. restrictions on technology exports to China but nonetheless blocked in April.",
      "He met U.S. President Donald Trump before his trip and his company announced this week it had received assurances that sales to China would be approved.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I changed his mind,\u201d Huang told a cluster of journalists, many of whom asked for his autograph or to take selfies with him.",
      "A carefully organized press conference at a luxury hotel descended into a crowd scene when Huang arrived in his trademark leather jacket and started taking questions randomly in his characteristic casual style.",
      "Export controls and tariffs were something companies must adapt to in a world he said was reconfiguring itself. He described his role as informing governments in the U.S. and elsewhere of the nature and unintended consequences of their policies.",
      "The decision to lift the ban on the H20 chip was entirely in the hands of the American and Chinese governments and whatever trade talks they had, he said.",
      "\u201cWe can only influence them, inform them, do our best to provide them with facts,\u201d Huang said. \u201cAnd then beyond that is out of our control.\u201d",
      "Nvidia said in April that sales restrictions on its chip in China on national security grounds would cost the company $5.5 billion. The White House also blocked a chip from Advanced Micro Devices. Both companies say the Commerce Department is now moving forward with license applications to export them to China.",
      "Huang said his company would likely be able to recover some of its losses but it's unclear how much. That will depend on how many H20 orders are received and how quickly Nvidia can meet the demand.",
      "\u201cI think that H20 is going to be very successful here,\u201d he said, noting the chip's memory bandwidth makes it a good fit for the AI models being developed by Chinese companies such as DeepSeek and Alibaba.",
      "Huang also touted the release of a new RTX Pro graphics chip that he said would power the development of humanoid robots. He described robotic systems with teams of robots working alongside people as the next wave in AI.",
      "\u201cBecause there\u2019s so much robotics innovation going on and so much smart factory work being done here and the supply chain is so vast, RTX Pro is perfect,\u201d he said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Some dolphins in Australia have a special technique to flush fish from the seafloor. They hunt with a sponge on their beak, like a clown nose.",
      "Using the sponge to protect from sharp rocks, the dolphins swim with their beaks covered, shoveling through rubble at the bottom of sandy channels and stirring up barred sandperch for a meal.",
      "But this behavior \u2014 passed down through generations \u2014 is trickier than it looks, according to new research published Tuesday in the journal Royal Society Open Science.",
      "Hunting with a sponge on their face interferes with bottlenose dolphins\u2019 finely tuned sense of echolocation, of emitting sounds and listening for echoes to navigate.",
      "\u201cIt has a muffling effect in the way that a mask might,\u201d said co-author Ellen Rose Jacobs, a marine biologist at the University of Aarhus in Denmark. \u201cEverything looks a little bit weird, but you can still learn how to compensate.\"",
      "Jacobs used an underwater microphone to confirm that the \u201csponging\u201d dolphins in Shark Bay, Australia, were still using echolocation clicks to guide them. Then she modeled the extent of the sound wave distortion from the sponges.",
      "For those wild dolphins that have mastered foraging with nose sponges, scientists say it's a very efficient way to catch fish. The wild marine sponges vary from the size of a softball to a cantaloupe.",
      "Sponge hunting is \u201clike hunting when you\u2019re blindfolded \u2014 you\u2019ve got to be very good, very well-trained to pull it off,\" said Mauricio Cantor, a marine biologist at Oregon State University, who was not involved in the study.",

      "The first astronauts in more than 40 years from India, Poland and Hungary are back on Earth",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A private spaceflight featuring the first astronauts in more than 40 years from India, Poland and Hungary came to a close Tuesday with a Pacific splashdown.",
      "Their SpaceX capsule undocked from the I nternational Space Station on Monday and parachuted into the ocean off the Southern California coast, less than 24 hours later.",
      "The crew of four launched nearly three weeks ago on a flight chartered by the Houston company Axiom Space.",
      "Axiom's Peggy Whitson, the most experienced U.S. astronaut, served as commander. Joining her were India's Shubhanshu Shukla, Poland's Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski and Hungary's Tibor Kapu, whose countries paid more than $65 million apiece for the mission.",
      "\u201cThanks for the great ride and safe trip,\u201d Whitson radioed moments after splashdown. Her record now stands at 695 days in space over five missions, longer than any other American or woman.",
      "The visiting astronauts conducted dozens of experiments in orbit while celebrating their heritage. The last time India, Poland and Hungary put anyone in space was during the late 1970s and 1980s, launching with the Soviets. They waved and smiled as they emerged from the capsule, one by one, into the early morning darkness.",
      "It was Axiom\u2019s fourth mission to the orbiting outpost since 2022, part of NASA\u2019s ongoing effort to open up space to more businesses and people. The company is one of several developing their own space stations to replace the current one. NASA plans to abandon the outpost in 2030, after more than 30 years of operation.",

      "Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang says the technology giant has won approval from the Trump administration to sell its advanced H20 computer chips used for artificial intelligence to China",
      "BANGKOK -- Nvidia\u2019s CEO Jensen Huang says the technology giant has won approval from the Trump administration to sell its advanced H20 computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence to China.",
      "The news came in a company blog post late Monday and Huang also spoke about the coup on China\u2019s state-run CGTN television network in remarks shown on X.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. government has assured Nvidia that licenses will be granted, and Nvidia hopes to start deliveries soon,\u201d the post said.",
      "\u201cToday, I'm announcing that the U.S. government has approved for us filing licenses to start shipping H20s,\u201d Huang told reporters in Beijing. He noted that half of the world's AI researchers are in China.",
      "\u201cIt's so innovative and dynamic here in China that it's really important that American companies are able to compete and serve the market here in China,\u201d he said.",
      "Huang recently met with Trump and other U.S. policymakers and this week is in Beijing to attend a supply chain conference and speak with Chinese officials.",
      "The broadcast showed Huang meeting with Ren Hongbin, the head of the China Council for Promotion of International Trade, host of the China International Supply Chain Expo, which Huang was attending. Nvidia is an exhibitor.",
      "Nvidia has profited enormously from rapid adoption of AI, becoming the first company to have its market value surpass $4 trillion last week. However, the trade rivalry between the U.S. and China has been weighing heavily on the industry.",
      "Washington has been tightening controls on exports of advanced technology to China for years, citing concerns that know-how meant for civilian use could be deployed for military purposes. The emergence of China\u2019s DeepSeek AI chatbot in January renewed concerns over how China might use the advanced chips to help develop its own AI capabilities.",
      "In January, before Trump began his second term in office, the administration of President Joe Biden launched a new framework for exporting advanced computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence, an attempt to balance national security concerns about the technology with the economic interests of producers and other countries.",
      "The White House announced in April that it would restrict sales of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips and AMD\u2019s MI308 chips to China.",
      "Nvidia had said the tighter export controls would cost the company an extra $5.5 billion, and Huang and other technology leaders have been lobbying President Donald Trump to reverse the restrictions. They argue that such limits hinder U.S. competition in a leading edge sector in one of the world\u2019s largest markets for technology.",
      "They've also warned that U.S. export controls could end up pushing other countries toward China\u2019s AI technology.",
      "Nvidia's U.S. traded shares slipped 0.5% in afterhours trading Monday, but its shares traded in Frankfurt, Germany, jumped 3.2% early Tuesday.",

      "Major League Baseball is testing automated ball-strike systems in the All-Star Game for the first time",
      "ATLANTA -- Tarik Skubal views the strike zone differently than robot umpires.",
      "\u201cI have this thing where I think everything is a strike until the umpire calls it a ball,\u201d Detroit's AL Cy Young Award winner said ahead of his start for the American League in Tuesday night's All-Star Game.",
      "MLB has been experimenting with the automated ball-strike system in the minor leagues since 2019 and will use it in an All-Star Game for the first time this summer. Each team gets two challenges and retains the challenge if it is successful.",
      "\u201cPitchers think everything is a strike. Then you go back and look at it, and it\u2019s two, three balls off,\u201d Pittsburgh's Paul Skenes, starting his second straight All-Star Game for the National League, said Monday. \u201cWe should not be the ones that are challenging it.\u201d",
      "MLB sets the top of the automated strike zone at 53.5% of a batter's height and the bottom at 27%, basing the decision on the midpoint of the plate, 8 1/2 inches from the front and 8 1/2 inches from the back. That contrasts with the rule book zone called by umpires, which says the zone is a cube.",
      "\u201cI did a few rehabs starts with it. I\u2019m OK with it. I think it works,\u201d said three-time Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers. \u201cAaron Judge and Jose Altuve should have different sized boxes. They've obviously thought about that. As long as that gets figured out, I think it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d",
      "Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred anticipates the system will be considered by the sport's 11-man competition committee, which includes six management representatives.",
      "Many pitchers have gravitated to letting their catchers and managers trigger ball/strike appeals. Teams won 52.2% of their challenges during the spring training test. Batters won exactly 50% of their 596 challenges and the defense 54%, with catchers successful 56% of the time and pitchers 41%.",
      "Hall of Famer Joe Torre, an honorary AL coach, favors the system. After his managing career, he worked for MLB and helped supervised expanded video review in 2014.",
      "\u201cYou couldn\u2019t ignore it with all the technology out there,\u201d he said. \"You couldn't sit and make an excuse for, 'Look at what really happened' the next day.\u201d",
      "Now 84, Torre recalled how his Yankees teams benefitted at least twice from blown calls in the postseason, including one involving the strike zone.",
      "With the 1998 World Series opener tied and the bases loaded with two outs in the seventh inning, Tino Martinez took a 2-2 pitch from San Diego's Mark Langston that appeared to be a strike but was called a ball by Richie Garcia. Martinez hit a grand slam on the next pitch for a 9-5 lead, and the Yankees went on to a four-game sweep.",
      "Asked whether he was happy there was no robot umpire then, Torre grinned and said: \u201cPossibly.\u201d",
      "Then he added without a prompt: \u201cWell, not to mention the home run that Jeter hit.\"",
      "His reference was to Derek Jeter's home run in the 1996 AL Championship Series opener, when 12-year-old fan Jeffrey Maier reached over the wall to snatch the ball above the glove over Baltimore right fielder Tony Tarasco.",

      "Their capsule undocked from the orbiting lab and aimed for a splashdown the next morning in the Pacific off the Southern California coast.",
      "The short, privately financed mission marked the first time in more than 40 years that India, Poland and Hungary saw one of their own rocket into orbit. The three astronauts were accompanied by America\u2019s most experienced space flier, Peggy Whitson, who works for Axiom Space, which chartered the flight. They launched from NASA's Kennedy Space Center on June 25.",

      "\"We will spread the word in our countries that these things are within our reach. These things are possible even for smaller countries like ours,\u201d Kapu said during Sunday\u2019s farewell ceremony, which ended in an emotional group hug.",

      "The policy remains in flux months after \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs tanked markets and unleashed recession forecasts when the president unveiled sweeping levies little more than 100 days ago. Now, as Trump continues to tout the policy, the economy is humming along and Wall Street is responding to each new tariff with a shrug.",
      "A recent round of tariff threats has added a new layer of uncertainty, but the monthslong track record affords economists an opportunity to evaluate what the tariffs have yielded so far.",
      "Analysts who spoke to ABC News credited the tariffs for delivering higher-than-expected tax revenue and helping to elicit some commitments from companies bent on investing in new production in the U.S.",
      "But, some analysts cautioned, those company commitments carry a long time horizon and wiggle room for firms to renege upon the spending as the tariff policy fluctuates. Meanwhile, tariffs have started to push up some prices, risking a bout of inflation that could hurt consumers and disrupt the economy, they said.",
      "Trump has rolled back many of his steepest tariffs over recent months, including a sky-high levy on China, the top source of U.S. imports. In recent days, however, Trump announced plans to slap tariffs as high as 50% on dozens of countries, including 25% tariffs on top U.S. trade partners such as Japan and South Korea.",
      "In all, consumers currently face an effective tariff rate of 20.6%, the highest since 1910, the Yale Budget Lab found this week.",
      "The Trump administration touts tariffs as part of a wider set of \u201cAmerica First economic policies,\u201d which have \u201csparked trillions of dollars in new investment in U.S. manufacturing, technology, and infrastructure,\u201d according to the White House's website.",
      "In theory, levies on imports incentivize firms to build manufacturing in the U.S. as a means of averting the tax burden.",
      "Scores of companies have pledged new investment in the U.S., including tech giants Apple and Nvidia, pharmaceutical companies Merck and Johnson & Johnson as well as automakers Hyundai and Stellantis, the White House says.",
      "\u201cThe whole idea is to encourage reshoring of manufacturing and change the balance of trade. That could all have some positive impact,\u201d Morris Cohen, a professor emeritus of manufacturing and supply chains at Duke University, told ABC News.",
      "Companies face the choice of making costly, long-term investment decisions amid Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again tariff policies, which the White House has altered numerous times since Trump took office, some analysts said.",
      "A pair of court rulings in May thrust some of the tariffs into legal limbo, adding another layer of uncertainty as federal appeals court judges determine whether a major swath of the policies pass legal muster.",
      "\u201cThe companies making promises are trying to politically deal with Trump,\u201d Matias Vernengo, a professor of economics at Bucknell University, told ABC News, adding that he expects many firms will ultimately fall short of their commitments.",
      "\u201cIt would be nice if he announced a tariff policy and stuck to it. But that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening,\u201d Vernengo added.",
      "The Trump administration has rebuked criticism of its tariff approach, saying the flexibility affords White House officials leverage in trade negotiations with countries targeted by the levies.",
      "The tariffs, meanwhile, have yielded a burst of tax revenue as importers to pay the federal government when they bring targeted goods into the U.S. The U.S. recorded about $27 billion in tariff-related tax revenue last month, bringing total payments so far this year to more than $100 billion, Treasury Department data showed.",
      "Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said tariff revenue could exceed $300 billion by the end of 2025, which would amount to nearly 1% of U.S. gross domestic product. That revenue could help ease government deficits, some analysts noted.",
      "\u201cThe tariff revenues are more substantial than I anticipated at the start of the year,\u201d Zandi said, noting that tariff levels had remained higher than he expected.",
      "Still, Zandi voiced skepticism about the staying power of the tax payments.",
      "\u201cIt would not be prudent for lawmakers to count on this revenue in the future, as it is unclear whether the tariffs will remain in place given they may be found to be illegal or future Presidents may decide to lower or eliminate them under executive order,\u201d Zandi said.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. economy so far has defied analysts' fears of a large, tariff-induced price spike. Still, tariffs contributed modestly to the rise of inflation last month, analysts previously told ABC News, citing the price hikes in product categories made up primarily of imports.",
      "Consumer prices rose 2.7% in June compared to a year ago, matching economists' expectations but marking an uptick from a month earlier. Still, the inflation rate clocked in below the 3% recorded in January, the month Trump took office.",
      "The price of toys -- a product dependent almost entirely on imports -- increased six times faster in June than it had just two months prior. Commonly imported products like clothes, furniture and bed linens were also among the goods that jumped in price.",
      "Vernengo, of Bucknell University, said tariffs would likely push up inflation for a temporary period, putting pressure on the Fed to keep interest rates elevated and in turn risk an economic slowdown.",
      "\u201cPrices will go up as Trump imposes tariffs. Then, as tariffs are established and prices adjust themselves, they will stop growing,\u201d Vernengo said. \u201cIt\u2019s the Fed\u2019s reaction that will matter more in my view than the tariffs.\u201d",

    "summary": "Some leading voices in President Trump\u2019s MAGA base who criticized his handling of the Epstein files are now rallying to his defense after a Wall Street Journal story.",
    "story": [
      "Some had been angered by the decision not to release any more Epstein files.",
      "Leading voices in President Donald Trump's MAGA base who had been critical for days of the president and administration's handling of the Epstein files are now rallying to Trump's defense following a story in the Wall Street Journal, and are celebrating the administration's move to release grand jury testimony, potentially cooling the backlash among his supporters.",
      "The administration angered many of Trump's supporters when it announced last week that it would not release any additional files on Jeffrey Epstein, the wealthy financier and convicted sex offender who died by suicide in jail in 2019, after earlier promising to do so.",
      "Prior to joining the administration, Trump boosters like Kash Patel and Dan Bongino had stoked conspiracy theories about an Epstein \"client list\" that allegedly included the names of wealthy Democratic elites. But elevated to leadership positions in the FBI, both Patel and Bongino signed off on a memo stating that no such list existed -- angering some of Trump's most vocal supporters.",
      "That changed on Thursday, when the Wall Street Journal published a letter it alleged Trump had sent Epstein in 2003 for his 50th birthday. ABC News has not been able to confirm the existence of the letter.",
      "Trump, who had been friendly with Epstein for around 15 years before they had a falling out in 2004, denied to the Journal that he had written the letter, and on Friday filed a defamation lawsuit against the paper claiming damages of not less than $10 billion.",
      "Leading Trump supporters rallied to the president's side.",
      "Following the Journal article, MAGA voices who had been some of Trump's most vocal critics over the last week, including Megyn Kelly, Charlie Kirk, Jack Posobiec, Laura Loomer, Benny Johnson and even Elon Musk rushed to defend the president.",
      "Posobiec, a MAGA podcaster who had been one of the loudest voices pushing the Epstein issue, told former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, \"We're so back. Everyone is firing on all cylinders. The MAGA movement is completely united behind this fight.\"",
      "\"We have to be on offensive all the time,\" Bannon told his online audience, saying of Trump, \"They tried to actually destroy him.\"",
      "Trump also announced Thursday that he was asking Attorney General Pam Bondi to \"produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval\" in regard to the Epstein case -- prompting accolades from supporters who had been pushing for the release of more Epstein material.",
      "Johnson, another MAGA podcaster, tweeted \"victory\" in response to the news.",
      "Kirk, on his show, urged his viewers to \"thank President Trump\" for pushing his administration to release the testimony.",
      "\"So for any of you in the audience that were a little uneasy, that were a little anxious, I think it's morally incumbent on you to say thank you President Trump, thank you for stepping up and for doing this,\" Kirk said. \"Thank you President Trump, for fulfilling what you said you were going to do, because he does deserve credit.\"",
      "The Journal story appears to have redirected MAGA supporters' criticism and unified them against a familiar target: the media. But whether the shift in support will hold is unclear. While figures like Kirk and Bannon have framed the grand jury promise as a major win, the release of the testimony itself could take time, as officials must first assess its impact on victims then win the approval of a federal judge.",
      "And because the grand jury transcripts represent only a small fraction of the files on Epstein, it's unclear if the contents will satisfy members of Trump's base who have been demanding the release of all Epstein materials. The last time the administration released Epstein-related files in February, the move sparked further questions and contributed to the backlash the president and his administration are still dealing with today.",
      "For now, though, Kirk said on his show that \"it was very fun to see\" the MAGA base rallying around Trump following the publication of the Journal's story.",
      "Seemingly to underscore the point, Kirk opened his show with a snippet of Joe Cocker's performance of the song \"With a Little Help From My Friends\" -- in an apparent wink and a nod to the story helping to unite the MAGA movement behind the president once again.",

      "A tanker truck crashed into a creek on Washington\u2019s Olympic Peninsula on Friday, spilling fuel into a tributary of a river where salmon runs were recently restored after a decades-long fight to remove its dams.",
      "A spokesperson for Gov. Bob Ferguson's office said the petroleum spill in Indian Creek was the result of an accident on U.S. 101. It was not immediately clear what caused it.",
      "The truck is capable of holding 6,000 gallons of diesel and 4,000 gallons of gasoline, although the exact amount that had entered the river was not known, according to the governor\u2019s office.",
      "\u201cThe truck is actively leaking and crews are working to contain the spill,\u201d the governor\u2019s office statement Friday evening said.",
      "Photos shared by the Washington State Department of Transportation on Facebook show the tanker truck upside down in the creek, while emergency vehicles surround the scene.",
      "\u201cThis spill is nothing short of heartbreaking for local tribes and other Washingtonians who rely on clean, healthy rivers and streams for their food and livelihoods,\u201d Ferguson said in a statement.",
      "He said he is closely monitoring the situation, including its effect on salmon, and plans to visit within the next few days.",
      "Two dams on the Elwha River, which flows out of Olympic National Park into the Strait of Juan de Fuca, were removed more than a decade ago after a long fought battle by the the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe. Removing the dams, which were constructed in the early 1900s, opened about 70 miles (113 kilometers) of habitat for salmon and steelhead.",
      "Biologists have said it will take at least a generation for the river to recover, but within months of the dams being taken down, salmon already started recolonizing sections of the waterway long closed off to them.",
      "The Elwha River is also the main potable water source for Port Angeles. The city announced Friday afternoon that it was temporarily shutting down its water treatment processing operations and asked residents and businesses to limit their use of water.",
      "\u201cThe City\u2019s reservoirs currently have sufficient water supply for the next 18 to 24 hours without interruption to normal service,\u201d the city\u2019s statement said.",
      "The spill and collision closed part of U.S. 101 on Friday, according to the Washington State Department of Transportation. It said it couldn't give an estimate on when it would reopen.",
      "\u201cWe expect this to be an extended closure,\u201d the department wrote in a post on Facebook.",

      "Three members of the arson and explosives unit of the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department were killed Friday in a blast at the department's training facility.",
      "It was not immediately clear what they were doing when the explosion happened in a parking lot at the Biscailuz Training Facility or what caused it. However an early line of investigation is examining whether it may have been a training accident, according to a law enforcement official briefed on the matter who was not authorized to discuss it publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "The detectives who died were part of a team that undergoes in-depth training and responds to more than 1,000 calls a year, according to the Sheriff Robert Luna.",
      "Here's what to know about law enforcement agencies' arson and explosives units:",
      "Depending on the agency, they can be responsible for everything from bomb disposal to search and prevention operations to arson investigations, according to Mark Lomax, former executive director of the National Tactical Officers Association and a retired major for the Pennsylvania State Police.",
      "In bomb disposal actions, team members might respond to a package or box that could contain an explosive device and then use tools like robots or X-ray devices to \u201crender it safe,\u201d Lomax said.",
      "If there is an explosion, members could be sent to investigate, including working to determine the types of materials used to make the bomb, he said. They may also help with search and prevention at big events using bomb sniffing dogs and scanners.",
      "On the fire side of the unit, team members could be responsible for arson investigations, including determining the cause of a fire and whether it was natural or intentional, Lomax said.",
      "Whether or not an agency has such a unit would likely depend on the size of the department and its location.",
      "There are thousands of police departments in the U.S., and the majority of them are under 50 people, according to Lomax. Smaller departments might not have sufficient personnel, money or equipment to have their own explosives team.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, depending on location, they may use the county sheriff\u2019s department in certain locations or the state police in other locations,\u201d Lomax said.",
      "The team from the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department would likely be deployed to smaller cities in the county to help with such incidents as suspicious packages or even to educate the community about what to look out for.",
      "A certified bomb technician would need to have a certification from the FBI, most likely from its Hazardous Devices School in Huntsville, Alabama, Lomax said.",
      "That training includes threat assessment and puts participants in \u201ctrue-to-life training settings,\u201d according to a video on the FBI's website.",
      "For advanced training, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has a national center at the same location, according to Lomax. There is also regional training.",
      "\u201cIt's very dangerous, and therefore it demands higher, more advanced training, more advanced equipment,\" Lomax said.",
      "For arson investigations, officials may go to the National Fire Academy in Maryland or participate in fire investigations training through the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, according to Lomax. There are also local academies that offer more basic arson investigation courses.",
      "The people on these teams likely were already officers, troopers or deputies and then later took the specialized training, Lomax said.",
      "Explosives training involving actual explosive devices can be very dangerous because there can be many unknowns, according to Lomax.",
      "Everything from the amount of moisture in the air that day to how long the material has been on the shelf could impact an exercise.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so many different variables that make that type of training extremely, extremely dangerous and hazardous,\u201d Lomax said.",
      "He referenced a 2022 incident in which five bomb technicians were injured by the detonation of an explosive device during a training exercise in Pennsylvania conducted by the FBI\u2019s Philadelphia field office.",
      "And in 2021, there was a catastrophic explosion in Los Angeles as homemade fireworks were being destroyed by a bomb squad. It injured 17 people and damaged dozens of homes, businesses and vehicles.",

    "story": [
      "Authorities are investigating a Southern California couple after their infant child was taken to a hospital with a traumatic head injury and 21 children were discovered in their custody",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A woman who almost served as a surrogate for a Southern California couple now under investigation by authorities said she backed out after the couple asked her if any of her friends would like to carry a child for them too.",
      "The request as well as conflicting information she was getting left the woman, Esperanza, unnerved and she decided not to sign a surrogacy contract with Silvia Zhang, who offered her $60,000. Esperanza spoke to The Associated Press on the condition that her last name not be used because she has not shared her surrogacy experience publicly.",
      "Zhang, 38, and her husband, Guojun Xuan, 65, are now the target of an investigation by local and federal authorities after their infant child was taken to the hospital with a traumatic head injury in May. Authorities have since taken 21 children from the couple's custody, many of whom were born by surrogate, said Lt. Kollin Cieadlo of the Arcadia Police Department, near Los Angeles.",
      "Surrogacy is an agreement between parties for a woman to become pregnant, typically through an embryo transfer, and deliver a baby for the intended person or couple to raise.",
      "The children range in age from 2 months to 13 years, with most between 1 and 3.",
      "Esperanza is one of at least eight women who say they were aggressively pursued by the couple to serve as surrogates. The women, many of whom were first-time surrogates, say they were given misleading or incomplete information about the couple's family situation and intentions. Some, like Esperanza, did not move forward with carrying a child for the couple. Another who did, Kayla Elliott, is now trying to get custody of a baby she birthed in March for the couple.",
      "Arcadia police say the FBI is involved in the investigation over whether the couple misled surrogates around the country. The FBI has not confirmed its investigation. Elliott said she was interviewed by the FBI at the end of May.",
      "Elliott worked through a business called Mark Surrogacy, according to the contract she signed and shared with the AP. California state records show a company called Mark Surrogacy Investments LLC registered at the company's Arcadia home until this June. Elliot's contract listed an El Monte address for the company. An AP reporter visited that location Thursday and did not find anyone who recognized the names of the couple or Mark Surrogacy.",
      "Zhang did not respond to phone calls and emails seeking comment. Lawyers for Mark Surrogacy did not respond to emails seeking comment, nor did a fertility clinic involved in the embryo transfer.",
      "In social media posts, other women who say they served as surrogates for Zhang and Xuan outlined suspicious actions including the couple not fulfilling payment obligations and weren't present for the children's births. Many women contacted by the AP did not respond or said they would only speak after securing an attorney.",
      "Zhang and Xuan were arrested in May after a hospital reported that their 2-month-old infant had a traumatic head injury, the result of a nanny at the home violently shaking the baby, according to Arcadia police.",
      "Arcadia police did not file charges at the time, in order to finish a full investigation, Cieadlo said, and detectives were looking into possible child abuse charges and anticipated presenting a case in a few weeks.",
      "The couple told police that they \u201cwanted a large family\" and produced what appeared to be legitimate birth certificates, including some from outside California, that list Zhang as the mother of the children, Cieadlo said. Xuan was listed as the father on at least some of the birth certificates, Cieadlo said.",
      "Esperanza's dealings with Zhang began in 2023. She had posted in a Facebook group for people interested in surrogacy and received a message from Zhang.",
      "Zhang said she and her partner already had an 8-year-old daughter in China but were having fertility issues. Zhang said she was working with a surrogate who was already pregnant but that she wanted \u201ctwins,\" so she was pursuing a second surrogate. But Esperanza said things started to feel amiss after Zhang asked if she had any friends who also wanted to be surrogates.",
      "\u201cShe said that she\u2019s a realtor in Arcadia and that\u2019s how she has a lot of money and was able to afford a lot of surrogates at the time,\u201d Esperanza said.",
      "Esperanza backed out of the surrogacy after the lawyer for the couple abruptly hung up on her while discussing the contract. She said the document said the couple would implant two embryos instead of one and the section requiring background information on the couple was cut out. The couple became angry when she decided not to move forward.",
      "Esperanza showed text messages to the AP that showed Zhang offering $3,000 more if she agreed to keep going, and another $2,000 bonus after a fetal heartbeat is detected.",
      "Elliott gave birth to a baby girl in March. She chose to be a surrogate because she \u201creally wanted to give somebody a family.\u201d",
      "The Texas woman began the process when Mark Surrogacy reached out to her directly on Facebook. She signed a contract listing Xuan and Zhang as the intended parents. The contract said Elliott would receive $65,000 in a series of payments by the end of her 16th gestational week.",
      "Elliott became wary when early in the pregnancy she flew to California to meet the couple and only Xuan showed up. As the process went on, Elliott had almost no direct contact with the Xuan and Zhang, which is uncommon in surrogacy. Most of the messaging was through texts and emails with representatives from the agency, who discouraged her from reaching out to Zhang.",
      "\u201cThe agency was always like, \u2018Oh, they\u2019re very busy people,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "When she learned that the couple had at least two other surrogates having babies for them, she was told by the agency \u201cthey just want a big family.\"",
      "Elliott flew to California for the embryo transfer, which was done at Western Fertility Institute in Los Angeles. The clinic declined to comment on the investigation.",
      "Neither parent were there for Elliott's labor or delivery, and only Zhang showed up a few hours after the baby was born. The woman \u201cdidn\u2019t seem very connected with the child ... she kind of barely looked at her,\" Elliott said.",
      "After handing Elliott $2,000 in cash and giving three of her family members in the room $200 each, the woman left with the baby girl.",
      "Now, Elliott wants custody of the girl and says she just hopes all the babies are safe. When the news first broke about the couple, she confronted Zhang on the phone and over text.",
      "In text messages Elliott showed to the AP, Zhang wrote: \u201cAll the babies really important in our life.\u201d",

      "AUSTIN, Texas -- The search for victims of deadly flooding in Texas Hill Country is headed into its third week as officials try to pin down exactly how many people remain missing and lawmakers prepare to discuss authorities' initial response and providing better warning systems.",
      "Flash floods killed at least 135 people in Texas over the Fourth of July holiday weekend, with most deaths along the Guadalupe River in Kerr County, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio. The Hill Country is naturally prone to flash flooding because its dry, dirt-packed soil cannot soak up heavy rain.",
      "The Texas Legislature is scheduled to convene Monday for a special session. Gov. Greg Abbott initially called lawmakers back to the Texas State Capitol in Austin for other reasons, but he and legislative leaders have added flooding-related issues to the agenda.",
      "State officials had been saying about 160 people were unaccounted for after the flooding in Kerr County alone, but they now say about 100 remain missing in Kerr and other counties.",
      "Kerr County officials said the number of missing people decreased as victims were recovered, contact was made with people who were found safe, and some reports were found to be unsubstantiated or falsified. Also, they said, the missing list fluctuates as reports come into a hotline.",
      "The floods laid waste to the Hill Country. Vacation cabins, youth camps campgrounds fill the riverbanks and hills of Kerr County, and Camp Mystic, a century-old Christian summer camp for girls in a low-lying area along the Guadalupe. At least 27 of its campers and counselors died.",
      "Abbott called the special session hoping legislators would pass a measure to regulate a booming business in THC products after he vetoed a bill that would have banned them. And since the flooding, President Donald Trump has told the Republicans who control state government to redraw congressional districts to help the GOP's chances of retaining a U.S. House majority in next year's midterm elections.",
      "Abbott said lawmakers would also review authorities' handling of the flooding and consider improving warning systems for Hill Country residents. Kerr County does not have a warning system because state and local agencies missed opportunities over the past decade to finance one.",
      "Trump and Abbott have pushed back aggressively against questions about how well local authorities responded to forecasts of heavy rain and the first reports of flash flooding. The president called a reporter \u201cevil\u201d for raising such issues and said he thought \u201ceveryone did an incredible job under the circumstances.\u201d Abbott dismissed a question about who was to blame for the deaths as \u201cthe word choice of losers\u201d and used an analogy that began: \u201cEvery football team makes mistakes.\u201d",
      "\"The way winners talk is not to point fingers,\u201d he concluded.",
      "Abbott has designated bills dealing with early warning systems and emergency communications as priorities for the Legislature's special session, scheduled to last 30 days.",
      "The House and Senate have formed special committees on flooding and disaster preparedness, and they're planning a July 31 visit to Kerrville, the seat of hardest-hit Kerr County, to hear comments from residents.",
      "The committees are scheduled to begin with a joint hearing Wednesday to consider the state's response to the fatal floods; planning for floods; infrastructure for managing floods; and communications among first responders.",
      "One bill already introduced by Republican Rep. Don McLaughlin would require the state's top public health official to set building standards for youth camps in 100-year floodplains \u2014 which FEMA defines as a high-risk area with a 1% chance of flooding in any given year.",
      "During a recent news conference, Republican state Rep. Drew Darby, a member of the House's committee, said lawmakers cannot bring back flood victims or undo the flooding.",
      "\u201cBut what we can do is learn from it,\" he said.",

      "A judge is ordering state officials to turn off a death-row inmate's heart-regulating implanted device to avert the risk that it might try to shock him during his execution by lethal injection scheduled for Aug. 5",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Tennessee officials must deactivate a death-row inmate 's implanted heart-regulating device to avert the risk that it might try to shock him during his lethal injection, a judge ruled Friday.",
      "The order by Nashville Chancellor Russell Perkins comes ahead of the Aug. 5 execution of Byron Black. Black's attorneys have said that the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator could shock him in an attempt to restore his heart's normal rhythm after the single dose of pentobarbital, with the potential for multiple rounds of shocks and extreme pain and suffering.",
      "The order requires the state to deactivate the device moments before administering the lethal injection, including having medical or certified technician professionals, plus equipment, on hand. The lower-court judge said the order will not serve to delay the execution, something he said he does not have the authority to do. He also said it doesn't add an undue administrative or logistical burden for the state.",
      "Black\u2019s attorneys say the only surefire way to shut off the device is for a doctor to place a programming device over the implant site, sending it a deactivation command. It is unclear how quickly the state could find a medical professional willing to do the deactivation. Additionally, the state is almost certain to file a quick appeal.",
      "The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is a small, battery-powered electronic instrument that is surgically implanted in someone's chest, usually near the left collarbone. Black's was inserted in May 2024. It serves as a pacemaker and an emergency defibrillator. At a two-day hearing this week, experts offered clashing testimony on how it would act during the execution and what Black could feel if he is shocked.",
      "Attorneys for the state deemed it highly unlikely that the pentobarbital would trigger the device's defibrillating function, and if it did, they say he would be unconscious and unaware, and unable to perceive pain. The state also said the lower-court judge lacked authority to order the device disabled.",
      "Black's attorneys say the state is relying on studies that confuse unawareness with unresponsiveness. The inmate's team says research shows pentobarbital renders people unresponsive and causes them to experience amnesia after they undergo an operation, but it doesn\u2019t make them unaware or unable to feel pain..",
      "Kelley Henry, an attorney for Black, said she is relieved by the ruling.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s horrifying to think about this frail old man being shocked over and over as the device attempts to restore his heart\u2019s rhythm even as the State works to kill him,\u201d Henry said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling averts that torturous outcome.\u201d",
      "A Tennessee attorney general's office spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday evening. Its previous filings say Black is trying to further delay justice for brutal murders.",
      "Black was convicted in the 1988 shooting deaths of girlfriend Angela Clay, 29, and her two daughters, Latoya, 9, and Lakeisha, 6. Prosecutors said Black was in a jealous rage when he shot the three at their home. At the time, Black was on work-release while serving time for shooting and wounding Clay\u2019s estranged husband.",
      "Black has already seen three execution dates come and go, thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic and a pause on executions from Gov. Bill Lee after the Department of Correction was found to not be testing the execution drugs for potency and purity as required. Black's execution would be the second one under a pentobarbital protocol released in December.",
      "Black\u2019s attorneys have previously tried and failed to show that he should not be executed because he is intellectually disabled, and that would violate the state\u2019s Constitution.",
      "The state Supreme Court recently declined to order a hearing over whether he is incompetent to be executed. A U.S. Supreme Court effort remains pending.",
      "Black's legal team has filed a request for the governor to commute his sentence to life in prison. The letter asking for clemency says Black suffered from prenatal alcohol exposure and exposure to toxic lead as a toddler, compounding lifelong cognitive and developmental impairments.",
      "The 69-year-old is now in a wheelchair, suffering from dementia, brain damage, kidney failure, congestive heart failure and other conditions, the clemency letter says.",
      "Additionally, the clemency request says if he had delayed filing his intellectual disability claim, he would have been spared under a 2021 state law.",
      "Black's motion related to his heart device came within a general challenge he and other death row inmates filed against the state\u2019s new execution protocol. The trial isn't until 2026.",

      "The state of New York has agreed to pay $450,000 to settle a lawsuit from an ex-aide to former Gov. Andrew Cuomo who alleged Cuomo sexually harassed and groped her while he was in office",
      "The state of New York agreed Friday to pay $450,000 to settle a lawsuit from an ex-aide to former Gov. Andrew Cuomo who alleged Cuomo sexually harassed and groped her while he was in office.",
      "The former aide, Brittany Commisso, had sued Cuomo and the state, alleging sexual harassment from the then-governor and retaliation against her after reporting the incidents. The allegations were part of a barrage similar misconduct claims that forced Cuomo to resign as governor in 2021.",
      "Commisso's lawyers said the settlement \u201cis a complete vindication of her claims\u201d and that Commisso is \"glad to be able to move forward with her life.\"",
      "The settlement came as Cuomo is in the midst of a so-far bruising political comeback with a run for mayor of New York City. Cuomo lost the Democratic primary to Zohran Mamdani by more than 12 percentage points and this week relaunched his campaign to run in the general election as an independent candidate, beginning a potentially uphill battle in a heavily Democratic city where support is coalescing behind Mamdani.",
      "Cuomo, who has denied wrongdoing, has been dogged by the scandal during his campaign for mayor.",
      "\u201cThe settlement is not a vindication, it is capitulation to avoid the truth,\" Cuomo\u2019s lawyers said Friday in a statement in which they called Commisso\u2019s allegations \u201cfalse.\u201d",
      "The attorneys, Rita Glavin and Theresa Trzaskoma, added that they \u201coppose the dismissal of Ms. Commisso\u2019s lawsuit.\u201d",
      "\u201cUntil the truth is revealed, the lawsuit should not be dismissed,\u201d they said in the statement.",
      "Cuomo resigned as governor after a report from the state attorney general determined that he had sexually harassed at least 11 women, with some alleging unwanted kissing and touching, as well as remarks about their appearances and sex lives.",
      "Commisso filed her lawsuit in late 2023, just before the expiration of the Adult Survivors Act, a special law that created a yearlong suspension of the usual time limit to sue over an alleged sexual assault.",
      "She later filed a criminal complaint accusing Cuomo of groping her but a local district attorney declined to prosecute, citing lack of sufficient evidence.",
      "The Associated Press doesn\u2019t identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they decide to tell their stories publicly, as Commisso has done.",
      "Anthony Hogrebe, a spokesperson for current Gov. Kathy Hochul, said Friday that the state \"is pleased to have settled this matter in a way that allows us to minimize further costs to taxpayers.\u201d",

      "A phone message seeking comment from Sharpe's attorney, David Chesnoff, wasn't immediately returned Friday.",
      "The woman first met Sharpe at a gym in Los Angeles in 2023 when she was 20, and a nearly two-year relationship followed, according to the lawsuit. Sharpe, 57, was accused of raping the woman in October 2024 and in January.",
      "\u201cBoth sides acknowledge a long-term consensual and tumultuous relationship,\u201d Buzbee said. \u201cAfter protracted and respectful negotiations, I\u2019m pleased to announce that we have reached a mutually agreed upon resolution.\u201d",

      "Iowa\u2019s attorney general says she will drop her lawsuit accusing Winneshiek County Sheriff Dan Marx of discouraging cooperation with federal immigration authorities",
      "DES MOINES, Iowa -- Iowa\u2019s attorney general on Friday said she will withdraw her lawsuit accusing a sheriff of discouraging compliance with federal immigration law, ending a monthslong public dispute between the two Republicans days after the sheriff's northeast Iowa constituents rallied in his defense.",
      "Attorney General Brenna Bird sued Winneshiek County Dan Marx in March over his Facebook post saying his department doesn't always need to detain people at the request of federal immigration authorities. Bird sued even though Marx deleted the post and an investigation from her office showed that Marx fully complied with each of the nearly two dozen requests he had received from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hold someone suspected of immigration violations.",
      "Marx had declined to post a conciliatory message the attorney general's office had scripted.",
      "Bird alleged the original post violated state law by impeding and discouraging cooperation with federal immigration officers. The lawsuit jeopardized state funding to the county.",
      "As President Donald Trump took office and initiated his campaign of mass deportations, Marx told constituents on Feb. 4 that he shares some of their \u201cmistrust and many of your concerns with the legitimacy of how these federal agents conduct business\u201d and that requests to hold individuals without a court order are \u201cviolations\u201d of constitutional rights.",
      "At the same time, there was a legislative push in states across the country to support Trump\u2019s immigration efforts and curtail \u201c sanctuary cities \u201d that generally limit cooperation with immigration authorities. The Trump administration had also begun taking legal action against governments that have adopted policies inhibiting ICE arrests and deportations.",
      "Marx said in a statement Friday that he met with Bird in person and explained it was \u201cnever my intent to discourage immigration enforcement.\u201d Marx also thanked his constituents for their patience and \u201coutpouring of support through this situation,\u201d he said.",
      "When Bird visited the county Monday, dozens of people showed up to support Marx and criticize the lawsuit as a bullying tactic, television station KGAN reported.",
      "Bird said Friday she intended to dismiss the case because the county has \u201cnow fully complied.\u201d",
      "\u201cWinneshiek County and Sheriff Marx are in compliance with 27A,\" she said in a statement, referencing the chapter in Iowa code that ensures cities and counties fully comply with federal immigration law. \"They have committed to continue to honor ICE detainers and cooperate with federal immigration authorities.\u201d",
      "Marx\u2019s February post echoed critiques of what are known as ICE \u201cdetainer\u201d requests that ask local or state law enforcement agencies to hold individuals until they can be taken into custody by federal authorities. Marx said those requests often clash with the Constitution's Fourth Amendment, which bars against unreasonable searches and seizures of individuals without a warrant based on probable cause.",
      "If federal agents\u2019 \u201cactions or paperwork are not within constitutional parameters,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthen we will make every effort to block, interfere and interrupt their actions from moving forward.\u201d",

      "The family of Cornelius Taylor, a homeless man killed when a bulldozer crushed his tent during an encampment sweep, has sued Atlanta",
      "ATLANTA -- The family of a homeless man who died after a bulldozer crushed his tent during an encampment sweep sued the city of Atlanta on Friday over his death, calling it \u201ctragic and preventable.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit filed by Cornelius Taylor\u2019s sister and son alleges that city employees failed to look to see if there was anyone inside the tents in the encampment before using a bulldozer to clear it. Taylor, 46, was inside one of the tents and was crushed by the truck when his tent was flattened, the lawsuit says.",
      "City officials had called for the clearing of the encampment in preparation for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. The encampment was blocks away from Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King had preached. An autopsy report later revealed Taylor's pelvic bone had been broken and that he suffered damage to organs and internal bleeding.",
      "\u201cA tent that was occupied by a human being was crushed by this heavy equipment. That\u2019s obviously wrong,\u201d attorney Harold Spence said. \u201cNobody looked inside the tent, and if someone who looked inside had taken 10 seconds to do so, this tragedy could have been averted. And if you don\u2019t know what\u2019s inside, you don\u2019t crush it.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit filed in Fulton County State Court asks for a jury trial and seeks unspecified damages, as well as repayment for medical expenses, funeral costs and legal fees. It was filed against the city and seven unnamed city employees, including the driver of the bulldozer.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last year that cities across the country can enforce bans on homeless camping. But clearings are controversial.",
      "Taylor\u2019s death sparked outrage among local advocates and neighbors at the encampment, who called the city\u2019s policies on clearing encampments deeply inhumane. They said the city faces a dire affordable housing shortage that makes it inevitable that people will end up living on the streets. The family's lawyers described the lawsuit as a call for city leaders to treat homeless people as deserving of \u201crespect and dignity\u201d instead of rushing to clear their communities \u201cas if they were invisible.\u201d",
      "City officials have said they are doing that. Right after Taylor's death, the city put a temporary moratorium on encampment sweeps. With the FIFA World Cup coming to Atlanta next year, the city has since resumed clearing encampments with the controversial goal of eliminating all homelessness in the downtown area before then.",
      "Last week, the city closed the camp where Taylor lived and said officials coordinated with the local nonprofit who leads the city\u2019s homelessness services to offer people living there housing with supportive services.",
      "Lawyers said they were grateful for the city's efforts, but more work is needed. Members of the Justice for Cornelius Taylor Coalition said they are still paying for hotel rooms for eight former encampment residents. Taylor's lawyers and family called on Mayor Andre Dickens' administration cut through red tape such as issues with documents and help the others get housing.",
      "A spokesperson for the city did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday afternoon.",
      "Taylor's sister Darlene Chaney teared up during a Friday news conference where lawyers announced the lawsuit as she re-listened to descriptions of the gruesome injuries her brother suffered.",
      "She said Taylor loved to read everything from science fiction to the Bible. He was eager to leave the encampment to rebuild his life, and stayed positive about his future even as barriers such as getting him an ID slowed that process down, she said. She misses his \u201cannoying\u201d weekly calls \u2014 and said now she only has one brother to annoy her. She misses having two.",

      "The move came shortly after the Justice Department asked a federal court on Friday to unseal grand jury transcripts in Epstein\u2019s sex trafficking case, as the administration seeks to contain the firestorm that erupted after it announced that it would not be releasing additional files from the case, despite previously pledging to do so.",
      "The controversy has created a major fissure between Trump and his loyal base, with some of his most vocal supporters slamming the White House for the way it has handled the case, and questioning why Trump would not want the documents made public.",
      "Trump had promised to sue the Wall Street Journal almost immediately after the paper put a new spotlight on his well-documented relationship with Epstein by publishing an article that described a sexually suggestive letter that the newspaper says bore Trump\u2019s name and was included in a 2003 album compiled for Epstein\u2019s 50th birthday.",
      "Trump denied writing the letter, calling the story \u201cfalse, malicious, and defamatory.\u201d",
      "The suit, filed in filed in federal court in Miami, accuses the paper and its reporters of having \u201cknowingly and recklessly\" published \u201cnumerous false, defamatory, and disparaging statements,\" which, it alleges, caused \u201coverwhelming financial and reputational harm\u201d to the president.",
      "In a post on his Truth Social site, Trump cast the lawsuit as part of his efforts to punish news outlets, including ABC and CBS, which both reached multimillion-dollar settlement deals with the president after he took them to court.",
      "\u201cThis lawsuit is filed not only on behalf of your favorite President, ME, but also in order to continue standing up for ALL Americans who will no longer tolerate the abusive wrongdoings of the Fake News Media,\u201d he wrote.",
      "A spokesperson for Dow Jones, the Journal's publisher, responded Friday night, \u201cWe have full confidence in the rigor and accuracy of our reporting, and will vigorously defend against any lawsuit.\u201d",
      "The letter revealed by The Wall Street Journal was reportedly collected by disgraced British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell as part of a birthday album for Epstein years before the wealthy financier was first arrested in 2006 and subsequently had a falling-out with Trump.",
      "The letter bearing Trump\u2019s name includes text framed by the outline of what appears to be a hand-drawn naked woman and ends with, \u201cHappy Birthday \u2014 and may every day be another wonderful secret,\u201d according to the newspaper.",
      "Trump denied writing the letter and promised to sue. He said he spoke to both to the paper\u2019s owner, Rupert Murdoch, and its top editor, Emma Tucker, before the story was published and told them the letter was \u201cfake.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don\u2019t draw pictures,\u201d the president insisted.",
      "The outlet described the contents of the letter but did not publish a photo showing it entirely or provide details on how it came to learn about it.",
      "In the lawsuit, Trump takes issue with that fact. The defendants, it attests, \u201cfailed to attach the letter, failed to attach the alleged drawing, failed to show proof that President Trump authored or signed any such letter, and failed to explain how this purported letter was obtained.\"",
      "\u201cThe reason for those failures is because no authentic letter or drawing exists,\u201d it goes on to charge, alleging that the \"Defendants concocted this story to malign President Trump\u2019s character and integrity and deceptively portray him in a false light.\u201d",
      "Earlier Friday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche filed motions in a separate federal court urging them to unseal the Epstein transcripts as well as those in the case against Maxwell, who was convicted of luring teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein. Epstein killed himself in 2019 shortly after his arrest while awaiting trial.",
      "The Justice Department's announcement that it would not be making public any more Epstein files enraged parts of Trump's base in part because members of his own administration had hyped the expected release and stoked conspiracies around the well-connected financier.",
      "The Justice Department said in the court filings that it will work with with prosecutors in New York to make appropriate redactions of victim-related information and other personally identifying information before transcripts are released.",
      "\u201cTransparency in this process will not be at the expense of our obligation under the law to protect victims,\" Blanche wrote.",
      "But despite the new push to release the grand jury transcripts, the administration has not announced plans to reverse course and release other evidence in its possession. Attorney General Pam Bondi had hyped the release of more materials after the first Epstein files disclosure in February sparked outrage because it contained no new revelations.",
      "A judge would have to approve the release of the grand jury transcripts, and it's likely to be a lengthy process to decide what can become public and to make redactions to protect sensitive witness and victim information.",

      "CBS parent Paramount insists that this week's decision to cancel Steven Colbert's \u201cLate Show\u201d was strictly financial, and had nothing to do with politics",
      "CBS says its decision to end Stephen Colbert\u2019s late-night comedy show is financial, not political. Yet even with the ample skepticism about that explanation, there's no denying the economics were not working in Colbert's favor.",
      "The network\u2019s bombshell announcement late Thursday that the \u201cLate Show\u201d will end next May takes away President Donald Trump\u2019s most prominent TV critic and the most popular entertainment program in its genre.",
      "The television industry's declining economic health means similar hard calls are already being made with personalities and programming, with others to be faced in the future. For the late-night genre, there are unique factors to consider.",
      "As recently as 2018, broadcast networks took in an estimated $439 million in advertising revenue for its late-night programs, according to the advertising firm Guidelines. Last year, that number dwindled to $220 million.",
      "Late-night TV was a particular draw for young men, considered the hardest-to-get and most valuable demographic for advertisers. Increasingly, these viewers are turning to streaming services, either to watch something else entirely or catch highlights of the late-night shows, which are more difficult for the networks to monetize.",
      "More broadly, the much-predicted takeover of viewers by streaming services is coming to pass. The Nielsen company reported that during the last two months, for the first time ever, more people consumed programming on services like YouTube and Netflix than on ABC, CBS and NBC or any cable network.",
      "Networks and streamers spent roughly $70 billion on entertainment shows and $30 billion for sports rights last year, said Brian Wieser, CEO of Madison & Wall, an advertising consultant and data services firm. Live sports is the most dependable magnet for viewers and costs for its rights are expected to increase 8% a year over the next decade. With television viewership declining in general, it's clear where savings will have to come from.",
      "Wieser said he does not know whether Colbert's show is profitable or not for CBS and parent company Paramount Global, but he knows the direction in which it is headed. \u201cThe economics of television are weak,\u201d he said.",
      "In a statement announcing the cancellation, George Cheeks, Paramount Global's president and chief executive officer, said that \u201cThis is purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night. It is not related in any way to the show\u2019s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.\u201d",
      "Cheeks' problem is that not everyone believes him.",
      "Colbert is a relentless critic of Trump, and earlier this week pointedly criticized Paramount's decision to settle Trump's lawsuit against CBS over a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview with Kamala Harris. He called Paramount's $16 million payment to Trump a \u201cbig fat bribe,\u201d since the company is seeking the administration's approval of its merger with Skydance Media.",
      "On Friday, the Writers Guild of America called for an investigation by New York's attorney general into whether Colbert's cancellation is itself a bribe, \u201csacrificing free speech to curry favor with the Trump administration as the company looks for merger approval.\u201d",
      "CBS' decision made this a pivotal week for the future of television and radio programming. Congress stripped federal funding for PBS and NPR, threatening the future of shows on those outlets.",
      "Journey Gunderson, executive director of the National Comedy Center, called the decision to end Colbert's show the end of an era.",
      "\u201cLate-night television has historically been one of comedy's most audience-accessible platforms \u2014 a place where commentary meets community, night after night,\u201d Gunderson said. \u201cThis isn't just the end of a show. It's the quiet removal of one of the few remaining platforms for daily comedic commentary.",
      "Trump, who has called in the past for CBS to terminate Colbert's contract, celebrated the show's upcoming demise. \u201cI absolutely love that Colbert got fired,\u201d the president wrote on Truth Social. \u201cHis talent was even less than his ratings.\u201d",
      "Some experts questioned whether CBS could have explored other ways to save money on Colbert. NBC, for example, has cut costs by eliminating the band on Seth Meyers' late-night show and curtailing Jimmy Fallon's \u201cTonight\u201d show to four nights a week.",
      "Could CBS have saved more money by cutting off the show immediately, instead of letting it run until next May, which sets up an awkward \u201clame duck\u201d period? Then again, Colbert will keep working until his contract runs out; CBS would have had to keep paying him anyway.",
      "CBS recently cancelled the \u201cAfter Midnight\u201d show that ran after Colbert. But the network had signaled earlier this year that it was prepared to continue that show until host Taylor Tomlinson decided that she wanted to leave, noted Bill Carter, author of \u201cThe Late Shift.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is a very sad day for CBS that they are getting out of the late-night race,\u201d Andy Cohen, host of Bravo's \u201cWatch What Happens Live,\" told The Associated Press. \u201cI mean, they are turning off the lights after the news.\u201d",
      "Colbert, if he wanted to continue past next May, would likely be able to find a streaming service willing to pay him, Wieser said. But the future of late-night comedy on the entertainment networks is genuinely at risk. Trump, in fact, may outlast his fiercest comic critics. Jon Stewart, once a weeknight fixture, works one night a week at \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d for Paramount's Comedy Central, a network that seldom produces much original programming any more.",
      "ABC's Jimmy Kimmel, who was chided on social media by Trump on Friday \u2014 \u201cI hear Jimmy Kimmel is next\u201d \u2014 has a contract that also runs out next year. Kimmel, 57, openly wondered in a Variety interview before signing his latest three-year contract extension how long he wanted to do it. He's hosted his show since 2003.",
      "\u201cI have moments where I go, I cannot do this anymore,\u201d Kimmel told Variety in 2022. \u201cAnd I have moments where I go, what am I gonna do with my life if I'm not doing this anymore?' It's a very complicated thing ... I'm not going to do this forever.\u201d",
      "Colbert, Kimmel and Stewart were all nominated for Emmy awards this week.",

      "Hegseth notified members of Congress from both states this week of the proposal to temporarily house detained immigrants at Camp Atterbury in Indiana, and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey.",
      "President Donald Trump has moved to aggressively detain and deport people in the country illegally, a push that has swept up large numbers of immigrants, including many with no prior criminal records, and forced federal authorities to find places to house them.",
      "Hegseth said the presence of the detainees would not negatively affect the bases' operations or training. Officials have not said when detainees could begin arriving at the facilities or if other military bases are under consideration.",
      "Speaking to reporters outside the White House, Trump's border czar Tom Homan said there are about 60,000 beds currently available for detained immigrants and the goal is to expand to 100,000.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking for any available bed space we can get that meets the detention standards we\u2019re accustomed to,\u201d Homan said Friday. \u201cThe faster we get the beds, the more people we can take off the street.\u201d",
      "Democratic lawmakers from both states and civil rights advocates condemned the idea of housing immigrants at the bases, questioning the impact on military resources and the justification for so many detentions.",
      "\u201cUsing our country\u2019s military to detain and hold undocumented immigrants jeopardizes military preparedness and paves the way for (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) raids in every New Jersey community,\u201d New Jersey's Democratic delegation said in a statement.",
      "Democratic Rep. Andre Carson of Indiana said his questions about detainee conditions have gone unanswered by the Trump administration.",
      "He cited concerns raised about conditions at other facilities and said, \u201cThe fact that ICE has detained so many individuals that they now need to expand detention space in Indiana is disturbing.\u201d",

      "A lawyer for the maker of the video game Call of Duty is arguing that a judge should dismiss a lawsuit brought by families of the victims of the Uvalde, Texas, school shooting",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A lawyer for the maker of the video game Call of Duty argued Friday that a judge should dismiss a lawsuit brought by families of the victims of the Robb Elementary School attack in Uvalde, Texas, saying the contents of the war game are protected by the First Amendment.",
      "The families sued Call of Duty maker Activision and Meta Platforms, which owns Instagram, saying that the companies bear responsibility for promoting products used by the teen gunman.",
      "Three sets of parents who lost children in the shooting were in the audience at the Los Angeles hearing.",
      "Activision lawyer Bethany Kristovich told Superior Court Judge William Highberger that the \u201cFirst Amendment bars their claims, period full stop.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe issues of gun violence are incredibly difficult,\u201d Kristovich said. \u201cThe evidence in this case is not.\u201d",
      "She argued that the case has little chance of prevailing if it continues, because courts have repeatedly held that \u201ccreators of artistic works, whether they be books, music, movies, TV or video games, cannot be held legally liable for the acts of their audience.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit, one of many involving Uvalde families, was filed last year on the second anniversary of one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history. The gunman killed 19 students and two teachers. Officers finally confronted and shot him after waiting more than an hour to enter the fourth-grade classroom.",
      "Kimberly Rubio, whose 10-year-old daughter Lexi was killed in the shooting, was among the parents who came from Texas to Southern California, where Activision is based, for the hearing.",
      "\u201cWe traveled all this way, so we need answers,\u201d Rubio said outside the courthouse. \"It's our hope that the case will move forward so we can get those answers.\"",
      "Another attorney for the families argued during the hearing that Call of Duty exceeds its First Amendment protections by moving into marketing.",
      "\u201cThe basis of our complaint is not the existence of Call of Duty,\" Katie Mesner-Hage told the judge. \"It is using Call of Duty as a platform to market weapons to minors.\u201d",
      "The plaintiffs' lawyers showed contracts and correspondence between executives at Activison and gunmakers whose products, they said, are clearly and exactly depicted in the game despite brand names not appearing.",
      "Mesner-Hage said the documents show that they actually prefer being unlabeled because \u201cIt helps shield them from the implication that they are marketing guns to minors,\u201d while knowing that players will still identify and seek out the weapons.",
      "Kristovich said there is no evidence that the kind of product placement and marketing the plaintiffs are talking about happened in any of the editions of the game the shooter played.",
      "The families have also filed a lawsuit against Daniel Defense, which manufactured the AR-style rifle used in the May 24, 2022, shooting. Koskoff argued that a replica of the rifle clearly appears on a splash page for Call of Duty.",
      "Koskoff, a Connecticut lawyer, also represented families of nine Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims in a lawsuit against gunmaker Remington and got a $73 million lawsuit settlement.",
      "He invoked Sandy Hook several times in his arguments, saying the shooters there and in Uvalde shared the same gaming obsession.",
      "Koskoff said the Uvalde shooter experienced \u201cthe absorption and the loss of self in Call of Duty.\u201d",
      "He said that immersion was so deep that the shooter searched online for how to obtain an armored suit that he didn't know only exists in the game.",
      "Koskoff played a clip from Call of Duty Modern Warfare, the game the shooter played, with a first-person shooter gunning down opponents.",
      "The shots echoed loudly in the courtroom, and several people in the audience slowly shook their heads.",
      "\u201cCall of Duty is in a class of its own,\" Koskoff said.",
      "Kristovich argued for Activision that the game, despite its vast numbers of players, can be tied to only a few of the many U.S. mass shootings.",
      "\u201cThe game is incredibly common. It appears in a scene on \u2018The Office,\u2019\" she said. She added that it is ridiculous to assert that \u201cthis is such a horrible scourge that your honor has to essentially ban it through this lawsuit.\u201d",
      "Highberger told the lawyers he was not leaning in either direction before the hearing. He gave no time frame for when he will rule, but a quick decision is not expected.",
      "The judge did tell the plaintiffs' lawyers that their description of Activision's actions seemed like deliberate malfeasance, where their lawsuit alleges negligence. He said that was the biggest hurdle they needed to clear.",
      "\u201cTheir conduct created a risk of exactly what happened,\u201d Mesner-Hage told him. \u201cAnd we represent the people who are exactly the foreseeable victims of that conduct.\u201d",

      "A Minnesota state senator has been convicted of burglary for breaking into her estranged stepmother\u2019s home",
      "A Minnesota state senator was convicted of burglary Friday for breaking into her estranged stepmother\u2019s home, and faced calls for her immediate resignation from a closely divided chamber where she holds a deciding vote.",
      "After about three hours of deliberations, the jury found Democratic state Sen. Nicole Mitchell, 51, guilty of first-degree burglary and possession of burglary tools. She told police right after her arrest that she went there to search for her father's ashes and other mementos, but tried to back away from that story on the witness stand.",
      "Mitchell displayed little emotion as the verdicts were read.",
      "Democratic Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy was quick to issue a statement saying that Mitchell has told colleagues that she planned to resign if convicted, \u201cand I expect her to follow through on that pledge.\u201d",
      "Republican Senate Minority Leader Mark Johnson reiterated the GOP's long-standing demand for immediate resignation or face expulsion.",
      "Gov. Tim Walz's office said he expects her to resign. But one of Mitchell's attorneys, Dane DeKrey, said in text messages that he didn't know if she would heed the calls. He said they're exploring their options for an appeal.",
      "The Democrat from the St. Paul suburb of Woodbury maintained her innocence and refused to resign since her arrest in the early hours of April 22, 2024, at her stepmother\u2019s home in the northwestern Minnesota city of Detroit Lakes.",
      "Mitchell\u2019s father died in 2023 at the age of 72. He had been married to Mitchell\u2019s stepmother, Carol Mitchell, for nearly 40 years.",
      "The jury saw bodycam video of Mitchell telling police repeatedly after her arrest that she broke into the home because her stepmother refused to give her items of sentimental value from her father, including some of his ashes, photos and a flannel shirt.",
      "The first-term senator was dressed in all-black and had a flashlight covered with a black sock when she was arrested. The video showed her telling police, \u201cClearly, I\u2019m not good at this,\u201d and \u201cI know I did something bad.\u201d",
      "But Mitchell testified Thursday that despite what she told police, she didn\u2019t really intend to take anything. She said she had become increasingly concerned about her stepmother\u2019s worsening memory problems and paranoia, and wanted to check on her well-being. She testified her stepmother was afraid of being put in a nursing home. Mitchell said she thought her stepmom would be less upset to hear she wanted some of her father\u2019s items than to have her competency questioned.",
      "The former broadcast meteorologist and now-retired Air National Guard officer was convicted of one count of first-degree burglary of an occupied dwelling, a felony that carries a mandatory minimum of six months in jail if there's an intent to steal. She was also convicted on a count of possessing burglary tools, a lesser felony without a mandatory minimum.",
      "The judge did not set a sentencing date.",
      "The prosecutor, Becker County Attorney Brian McDonald urged jurors Friday to focus on \u201cthe many lies of Nicole Mitchell\u201d and evaluate her testimony with reason and common sense. And he urged them to review the body camera video showing what she told police after her arrest.",
      "\u201cI submit to you she was telling the truth on April 22nd, 2024. And if you believe that she was telling the truth to the officers, then you know she had the intent to steal. She told you. She told the officers.\u201d",
      "Defense attorney Bruce Ringstrom Jr. told the jury that Mitchell did not steal anything and did not intend to. He conceded that she used poor judgment. He said everybody has told \u201cwhite lies,\u201d and that Mitchell\u2019s goal was to avoid aggravating her stepmother\u2019s distrust even further.",
      "\u201cWe all know the difference between a white lie and a meaningful, damaging one,\u201d Ringstrom said. \u201cThe problem is that this happened in the context of something that was a terrible mess, a mess that Nicole made. But it was a mess.\u201d",
      "Under such difficult circumstances, Ringstrom argued, \u201cNicole\u2019s white lies make perfect sense.\u201d",
      "Mitchell\u2019s rejection of calls for her resignation after her arrest frayed relations between Democrats and Republicans in the narrowly divided state Senate.",
      "Democrats hold only a one-seat majority in the Senate, so they needed her vote. They said she deserved to have the legal process play out.",
      "Republicans periodically tried to kick her out of the chamber but lacked the votes. The Senate can't vote to expel her until it next convenes, and it's not due to meet again until February.",
      "If she resigns, the governor would schedule a special election. His office said it would provide more information soon. Mitchell's district mostly votes Democratic. The Harris-Walz ticket carried it with 61% of the vote last year.",

      "NEW YORK -- A New York City man who stabbed two teenage tourists from Paraguay at Grand Central Terminal on Christmas Day 2023 was sentenced Friday to more than 26 years in prison.",
      "Esteban Esono-Asue, 38, also known as Steven Hutcherson, appeared for sentencing in state court in Manhattan, where a jury convicted him of assault and other charges in June. A judge ordered him to serve 26 to 29 years behind bars.",
      "Prosecutors said Esono-Asue was sitting at a cafe table in Grand Central shortly before 11:30 a.m. when he picked up a fork and scratched a woman's neck. He then took out a knife and stabbed a 16-year-old girl in the back and a 14-year-old girl in the leg, authorities said. He dropped the knife and surrendered to police.",
      "The 16-year-old girl suffered lung and diaphragm injuries. All the victims survived.",
      "\u201cMy thoughts remain with the victims and their loved ones, who continue to navigate the psychological and emotional effects from this horrific attack,\" Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said in a statement. \"New Yorkers, commuters and tourists rely on the transit system daily and deserve to be safe when they travel, and we will hold those accountable who commit acts ... of violence.\u201d",
      "A lawyer for Esono-Asue, Michael Fineman, did not immediately return phone and email messages Friday. The motive for the attack wasn't clear. Witnesses said Esono-Asue made derogatory comments about white people shortly before the assaults, according to the criminal complaint. He had initially been charged with attempted murder and assault as hate crimes.",
      "Earlier in December 2023, Esono-Asue pleaded guilty to an assault charge and was given a conditional discharge after being arrested for threatening a man the month before, according to court records.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The owner of a factory where six workers died last year in flooding from Hurricane Helene won't face charges after a Tennessee Bureau of Investigation found no criminal wrongdoing. First Judicial District Attorney General Steven Finney announced the decision to close the case on Friday, saying no further action will be taken.",
      "The investigation found no evidence that Impact Plastics employees were told they could not leave the factory or that they would be fired if they left, according to a news release from the district attorney. It also found employees had a little more than an hour during which they could have evacuated from the Erwin, Tennessee, industrial park. The conclusion mirrors that of a similar investigation by the Tennessee Occupational Safety and Health Administration that found in April that workers had time to evacuate the premises, albeit by makeshift routes.",
      "A statement from Impact Plastics attorney Stephen Ross Johnson on Friday said company president and founder Gerald O\u2019Connor welcomes the results of the TBI investigation.",
      "\u201cThe true and accurate facts are now known,\u201d the statement reads.",
      "Five employees and one contractor who cleaned the offices once a week were killed on Sept. 27 after they were washed away by floodwaters. They were among 12 people who stuck close to the Impact Plastics building, waiting for the water to recede, after realizing the exit road was already submerged. When the water kept rising, they climbed onto the bed of a semitrailer loaded with giant spools of plastic piping that was parked outside the factory. When floodwaters eventually overwhelmed the truck, six people were able to use the piping for flotation and were later rescued. The other six drowned.",
      "The TOSHA report notes that several Impact Plastics employees did escape the flood. Some were able to drive or walk over an embankment to a nearby highway after workers at a neighboring business dismantled a fence there. Others escaped by driving over a makeshift path onto nearby railroad tracks that an employee at a neighboring business created with a tractor. Still others were able to escape by walking to the railroad tracks, according to that report.",
      "Although the criminal case is being closed, the company still faces a wrongful death lawsuit from the family of Johnny Peterson, and other civil suits are planned.",
      "Attorney Luke Widener, who represents the families of several flood victims, said in a statement that they \u201ccategorically disagree that Impact Plastics employees were given any meaningful opportunity to escape. ...Indeed, if Impact Plastics\u2019 account were true, Bertha Mendoza, Sibrina Barnett, and the others who perished would still be with us.\"",

      "Such an unprecedented step could send the financial markets into a tailspin and over time push up interest rates and weaken the U.S. economy. If investors start to worry the Fed is no longer independent, fewer may buy U.S. bonds, which would push up the interest rate on those bonds and lift borrowing costs more broadly.",
      "Trump has criticized Powell for months because the chair has kept the short-term interest rate the Fed controls at 4.3% this year, after cutting it three times last year. Powell says the Fed wants to see how the economy responds to Trump's sweeping tariffs on imports, which Powell says could push up inflation.",
      "Powell's caution has infuriated Trump, who has demanded the Fed cut borrowing costs to spur the economy and reduce the interest rates the federal government pays on its debt.",
      "Firing the Fed chair would threaten the Fed\u2019s venerated independence, which has long been supported by most economists and Wall Street investors. Here are some questions and answers about the Fed.",

With some of the construction occurring underground and as building materials have soared in price after inflation spiked in 2021 and 2022, the estimated cost has ballooned to about $2.5 billion, from $1.9 trillion.",
      "When asked if the costly rebuilding could be grounds to fire Powell, Trump said recently, \u201cI think it is.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen you spend $2.5 billion on, really, a renovation, I think it\u2019s really disgraceful,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Yet in 2020, The Associated Press has reported, several Trump appointees to a local review commission pushed the Fed to include more marble in the renovation. Yet now White House officials and other critics of the project are pointing to the marble as a sign of extravagance.",

By cutting the short-term interest rate it controls \u2014 which it typically does when the economy falters \u2014 the Fed can make borrowing cheaper and encourage more spending, accelerating growth and hiring. When it raises the rate \u2014 which it does to cool the economy and combat inflation \u2014 it can weaken the economy and cause job losses.",
      "Economists have long preferred independent central banks because they can more easily take unpopular steps to fight inflation, such as raise interest rates, which makes borrowing to buy a home, car, or appliance more expensive.",
      "The importance of an independent Fed was cemented for most economists after the extended inflation spike of the 1970s and early 1980s. Former Fed Chair Arthur Burns has been widely blamed for allowing the painful inflation of that era to accelerate by succumbing to pressure from President Richard Nixon to keep rates low heading into the 1972 election. Nixon feared higher rates would cost him the election, which he won in a landslide.",
      "Paul Volcker was eventually appointed chair of the Fed in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter, and he pushed the Fed's short-term rate to the stunningly high level of nearly 20%. (It is currently 4.3%). The eye-popping rates triggered a sharp recession, pushed unemployment to nearly 11%, and spurred widespread protests.",
      "Yet Volcker didn't flinch. By the mid-1980s, inflation had fallen back into the low single digits. Volcker's willingness to inflict pain on the economy to throttle inflation is seen by most economists as a key example of the value of an independent Fed.",
      "An effort to fire Powell would almost certainly cause stock prices to fall and bond yields to spike higher, pushing up interest rates on government debt and raising borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and credit card debt. The interest rate on the 10-year Treasury is a benchmark for mortgage rates.",
      "Most investors prefer an independent Fed, partly because it typically manages inflation better without being influenced by politics but also because its decisions are more predictable. Fed officials often publicly discuss how they would alter interest rate policies if economic conditions changed.",
      "If the Fed was more swayed by politics, it would be harder for financial markets to anticipate \u2014 or understand \u2014 its decisions.",
      "Well, no. Fed chairs like Powell are appointed by the president to serve four-year terms, and have to be confirmed by the Senate. The president also appoints the six other members of the Fed's governing board, who can serve staggered terms of up to 14 years.",
      "Those appointments can allow a president over time to significantly alter the Fed's policies. Former president Joe Biden appointed five of the current seven members: Powell, Lisa Cook, Philip Jefferson, Adriana Kugler, and Michael Barr. As a result, Trump will have fewer opportunities to make appointments. He will be able to replace Kugler, whose term ends Jan. 31, 2026.",
      "Congress, meanwhile, can set the Fed's goals through legislation. In 1977, for example, Congress gave the Fed a \u201cdual mandate\u201d to keep prices stable and seek maximum employment. The Fed defines stable prices as inflation at 2%.",
      "The 1977 law also requires the Fed chair to testify before the House and Senate twice every year about the economy and interest rate policy.",
      "The Supreme Court earlier this year suggested in a ruling on other independent agencies that a president can't fire the chair of the Fed just because he doesn't like the chair's policy choices. But he may be able to remove him \u201cfor cause,\u201d typically interpreted to mean some kind of wrongdoing or negligence.",
      "It's a likely reason the Trump administration has zeroed in on the building renovation, in hopes it could provide a \u201cfor cause\u201d pretext. Still, Powell would likely fight any attempt to remove him, and the case could wind up at the Supreme Court.",

      "Venezuela has released 10 jailed U.S. citizens and permanent residents in exchange for getting home scores of migrants deported by the United States to El Salvador months ago under the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown",
      "CARACAS, Venezuela -- Venezuela on Friday released 10 jailed U.S. citizens and permanent residents in exchange for getting home scores of migrants deported by the United States to El Salvador months ago under the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, officials said.",
      "The complex, three-country arrangement represents a diplomatic achievement for Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, helps President Donald Trump in his goal of bringing home Americans jailed abroad and lands Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele a swap that he proposed months ago.",
      "\u201cEvery wrongfully detained American in Venezuela is now free and back in our homeland,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement in which he thanked Bukele, a Trump ally.",
      "Bukele said El Salvador had handed over all the Venezuelan nationals in its custody. Maduro described Friday as \u201ca day of blessings and good news for Venezuela.\" He called it \u201cthe perfect day for Venezuela.\u201d",
      "Central to the deal are more than 250 Venezuelan migrants freed by El Salvador, which in March agreed to a $6 million payment from the Trump administration to house them in its notorious prison.",
      "That arrangement drew immediate blowback when Trump invoked an 18th century wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act, to quickly remove the men that his administration had accused of belonging to the violent Tren de Aragua street gang, teeing up a legal fight that reached the U.S. Supreme Court. The administration did not provide evidence to back up those claims.",
      "The Venezuelans had been held in a mega-prison known as the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, which was built to hold alleged gang members in Bukele\u2019s war on the country\u2019s gangs. Human rights groups have documented hundreds of deaths as well as cases of torture inside its walls.",
      "Lawyers have little access to those in the prison, which is heavily guarded, and information has been locked tight, other than heavily produced state propaganda videos showing tattooed men packed behind bars.",
      "Photos and videos released by El Salvador\u2019s government on Friday showed shackled Venezuelans sitting in a fleet of buses and boarding planes surrounded by officers in riot gear. One man looked up and pointed toward the sky as he climbed aboard a plane, while another made an obscene gesture toward police.",
      "After arriving in Venezuela, some of the migrants crossed themselves, cried and hugged one another. They wore face masks and street clothes.",
      "Maduro alleged that some of them were subjected to various forms of abuse at the Salvadoran prison, and one of them even lost a kidney \u201cdue to the beatings he received.\u201d",
      "Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello told reporters the men would undergo medical tests and background checks before they can go home.",
      "In April, Bukele proposed exchanging the Venezuelans for the same number of what he called \u201cpolitical prisoners\u201d held by Maduro. The suggestion provoked a harsh response from Venezuelan authorities, who called his comments \u201ccynical\u201d and referred to Bukele as a \u201cneofascist.\"",
      "The State Department office responsible for negotiating the release of American detainees posted a photo Friday evening of the newly released prisoners smiling for the camera inside an airplane bringing them home, some clutching an unfurled American flag.",
      "Among those released was 37-year-old Lucas Hunter, whose family says he was kidnapped in January by Venezuelan border guards from inside Colombia, where he was vacationing.",
      "\u201cWe cannot wait to see him in person and help him recover from the ordeal,\u201d his younger sister Sophie Hunter said.",
      "Venezuelan authorities detained nearly a dozen U.S. citizens in the second half of 2024 and linked them to alleged plots to destabilize the country.",
      "\u201cWe have prayed for this day for almost a year. My brother is an innocent man who was used as a political pawn by the Maduro regime,\" said a statement from Christian Castenada, whose brother Wilbert, a Navy SEAL, was arrested in his Caracas hotel room last year.",
      "Global Reach, a nonprofit organization that had advocated for his release and that of several other Americans, said Venezuelan officials initially and falsely accused him of being involved in a coup but backed off that claim.",
      "The release of the Venezuelans, meanwhile, is an invaluable win for Maduro as he presses his efforts to assert himself as president despite credible evidence that he lost reelection last year.",
      "Long accused of human rights abuses, Maduro for months has used the migrants' detention in El Salvador to flip the script on the U.S. government, forcing even some of his strongest political opponents to agree with his condemnation of the migrants\u2019 treatment.",
      "Their return will allow Maduro to reaffirm support within his shrinking base, while demonstrating that even if the Trump administration and other nations see him as an illegitimate president, he is still firmly in power.",
      "Just a week ago, the U.S. State Department reiterated its policy of shunning Maduro government officials and recognizing only the National Assembly elected in 2015 as the legitimate government of the country. Signed by Rubio, the cable said U.S. officials are free to meet and have discussions with National Assembly members \u201cbut cannot engage with Maduro regime representatives unless cleared by the Department of State.\u201d",
      "The Americans were among dozens of people, including activists, opposition members and union leaders, that Venezuela\u2019s government took into custody in its brutal campaign to crack down on dissent in the 11 months since Maduro claimed to win reelection.",
      "Besides the U.S., several other Western nations also do not recognize Maduro\u2019s claim to victory. They instead point to tally sheets collected by the opposition coalition showing that its candidate, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, won the July 2024 election by a more than a two-to-one margin.",
      "The dispute over results prompted immediate protests, and the government responded by detaining more than 2,000 people, mostly poor young men. Gonz\u00e1lez fled into exile in Spain to avoid arrest.",
      "More than 7.7 million Venezuelans have migrated since 2013, when its oil-dependent economy came undone and Maduro became president. Most settled in Latin America and the Caribbean, but after the COVID-19 pandemic, many saw the U.S. as their best chance to improve their living conditions.",
      "Despite the U.S. not recognizing Maduro, the two governments have carried out other recent exchanges.",
      "In May, Venezuela freed a U.S. Air Force veteran after about six months in detention. Joseph St. Clair's family has said the language specialist, who served four tours in Afghanistan, had traveled to South America to seek treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "Three months earlier, six other Americans whom the U.S. government considered wrongfully detained in Venezuela were released after Richard Grenell, Trump\u2019s envoy for special missions, met with Maduro at the presidential palace.",
      "Grenell, during the meeting in Caracas, urged Maduro to take back deported migrants who have committed crimes in the U.S. Hundreds of Venezuelans have since been deported to their home country.",
      "Maduro\u2019s government had accused the Trump administration of \u201ckidnapping\u201d the children by placing them in foster care after their parents were deported.",

      "The former chief executive of clothing technology companies was released on $1 million bail after pleading not guilty to charges alleging that she bilked investors of over $300 million since early 2019",
      "NEW YORK -- A former chief executive of two clothing technology companies was released on $1 million bail Friday after pleading not guilty to charges alleging she cheated investors of over $300 million over the past six years.",
      "Christine Hunsicker, 48, of Lafayette, New Jersey, was charged with six counts, including fraud, aggravated identity theft and false statement charges in the indictment in Manhattan federal court.",
      "U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton said in a release that Hunsicker forged documents, fabricated audits and made material misrepresentations about her company's financial condition to defraud investors in CaaStle Inc. and P180.",
      "The indictment said Hunsicker, once portrayed as an on-the-rise fashion entrepreneur, portrayed CaaStle as a high-growth, private company with substantial cash on hand when she knew it faced significant financial distress.",
      "In a statement, defense lawyers Michael Levy and Anna Skotko said prosecutors \u201chave chosen to present to the public an incomplete and very distorted picture in today's indictment,\u201d despite Hunsicker's efforts to be \u201cfully cooperative and transparent\u201d with prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "\u201cThere is much more to this story, and we look forward to telling it,\u201d they said.",
      "Hunsicker did not comment as she left the courthouse with Skotko after entering the not-guilty plea and agreeing to the rules of her $1 million bail, which included not having any contact with former or current investors or employees.",
      "According to the indictment, Hunsicker continued her fraudulent scheme even after the CaaStle board of directors removed her and prohibited her from soliciting investments or taking other actions on the company's behalf.",
      "She \u201cpersisted in her scheme\u201d even after law enforcement agents confronted her over the fraud, the indictment said.",
      "Before the fraud allegations emerged, Hunsicker seemed to be a rising star in the fashion world after she was named to Crain's New York Business \u201c40 under 40\u201d lists, was selected as one of Inc.'s \u201cMost Impressive Women Entrepreneurs\u201d and was recognized by the National Retail Federation as someone shaping the future of retail, the indictment noted.",
      "At a time when the business was in financial distress with limited cash available and significant expenses, CaaStle was valued by Hunsicker at $1.4 billion, the indictment said.",
      "Hunsicker was lying to investors in February 2019 and continued to do so through this March, prosecutors alleged.",
      "They said she fed investors falsely inflated income statements, fake audited financial statements, fictitious bank account records and sham corporate records.",
      "She allegedly told one investor in August 2023 that CaaStle reported an operating profit of nearly $24 million in the second quarter of 2023 when its operating profit that quarter was actually less than $30,000.",
      "The indictment alleged that she carried out the majority of the fraud by bilking CaaStle investors of $275 million before forming P180 last year to infuse CaaStle with cash before its investors could discover her fraud.",
      "Through misrepresentations and omissions, she cheated P180 investors out of about $30 million, the indictment said.",
      "It said CaaStle filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy last month, leaving hundreds of investors holding now-worthless CaaStle shares. Hunsicker was forced to resign from CaaStle's board in December and formally resigned as chief executive in March.",
      "In a related civil filing, the SEC said Hunsicker's \u201cfake financials\u201d supported her narrative that CaaStle was nearing an initial public offering or sale in late 2022 as it enjoyed rapid and steady revenue growth after launching a new monetization model called \u201cClothing-as-a-Service.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn reality, CaaStle's revenues were shrinking, its losses were increasing, and the company was never profitable,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cNot a single existing or prospective CaaStle investor received accurate monthly, quarterly, or annual CaaStle financial statements from Hunsicker.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Felix Baumgartner, the daredevil who made a record-breaking parachute jump from the stratosphere in 2012, died Thursday in a paragliding accident in Italy, a local mayor confirmed. Firefighters who responded to the scene said they found a paraglider that had crashed into the side of a swimming pool in the city of Porto Sant Elpidio, on central Italy's eastern coast.",
      "\"Our community is deeply affected by the tragic disappearance of Felix Baumgartner, a figure of global prominence, a symbol of courage and passion for extreme flight,\" the town's mayor, Massimiliano Ciarpella, said on Facebook. Ciarpella told The Associated Press that the extreme athlete had been in the area on vacation.",
      "Witnesses told The Associated Press they heard a loud boom as the paraglider spun out of control. Mirella Ivanov, 30, told AP she was in the area with her two young children when they saw the paraglider lose control.",
      "\"Everything was normal, then it started to spin like a top,\" Ivanov said Friday. \"It went down and we heard a roar. In fact, I turned around because I thought it crashed on the rocks.\"",
      "Baumgartner, 56, made global headlines in 2012 when he was lifted into the stratosphere, about 24 miles up, in a capsule carried by a helium balloon, and then parachuted down to a landing in New Mexico. During the jump, he broke the record for fastest free fall, descending at about 843.6 mph and becoming the first human to break the sound barrier without the assistance of a vehicle.",
      "Originally from Austria, Baumgartner began skydiving at age 16 and further honed his skills in the Austrian military, according to his personal website. In 1988, he teamed up with Red Bull, which sponsored the stratosphere jump under the Stratos project and many other daring feats.",
      "The training and planning for the 2012 Stratos jump took five years. Among the records Baumgartner would break that day was highest jump, which had been held by Air Force Capt. Joe Kittinger since 1960, when he leapt from an open-air gondola basket that rose to 102,000 feet. Kittinger would go on to train Baumgartner for the record-breaking Stratos jump. (Baumgartner's height record was broken two years later.)",
      "In addition to skydiving, Baumgartner was an accomplished BASE jumper, breaking two records in 1999: highest BASE jump and lowest BASE jump. The low jump, which he took from one of the hands of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, was only 95 feet. The high jump was taken from the 88th floor of the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, although that record has since been broken and is currently held by the late Valery Rozov, who jumped from Cho Oyu in 2016.",
      "Baumgartner was also a helicopter pilot and was part of Red Bull's aerial acrobatics team.",
      "\"Ever since I was a child, I have always wanted to jump out of a plane,\" Baumgartner told Red Bull in an interview after becoming a licensed helicopter pilot.",
      "\"For Red Bull Stratos, we had a very long list of 'what ifs,' in other words eventualities that could happen and how we would deal with them in an emergency. The list kept getting longer and longer. I was only afraid of the things that were not on the list. The things we had not thought of,\" he told Red Bull, adding: \"To this day, I abort missions if the conditions are not right.\"",
      "While Baumgartner's stunts inspired millions, his political views were known to cause controversy. On social media, he mocked climate activists and others who sought to limit the effects of climate change, and voiced opposition to LGBTQ rights, according to the AFP news agency. He also once suggested Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n should receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-immigration policies.",

      "We may receive an affiliate commission from anything you buy from this article.",
      "British-born restaurateur Keith McNally was responsible for the opening of such popular New York City institutions as The Odeon, Balthazar and Pastis. But a 2016 stroke, which caused immobility and affected his speech, led him to attempt suicide two years later.",
      "He's recounted his story in the irreverent memoir\u00a0\"I Regret Almost Everything: A Memoir\"\u00a0(Simon & Schuster).",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Mo Rocca's interview with Keith McNally on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" July 20!",
      "\"I Regret Almost Everything\" by Keith McNally",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "There was a time when everything worked. ...\u00a0 I'd been happily married and the owner of eight successful Manhattan restaurants, including Balthazar in SoHo. In 2004, the New York Times had called me \"The Restaurateur Who Invented Downtown.\" I had everything going for me. And then on November 26, 2016, the clock stopped.",
      "I was living in London. One Saturday morning I coaxed my youngest children, George and Alice, into seeing a Caravaggio exhibition with me at the National Gallery. George was thirteen, Alice eleven. While looking at a painting of Jesus being betrayed by Judas, The Taking of Christ, I sensed my body beginning to show signs of betraying me: a strange metallic tingling started to pinch my fingertips. It was an odd feeling, but as it stopped after five or six seconds, I didn't give it another thought. Soon afterward, to the relief of my children, we left the museum.",
      "Two hours later, when I was back home by myself, the metallic feeling returned. Only this time it was in earnest. Within seconds the horrific tingling shot up my left arm and, like some malignant jellyfish, clasped itself onto my face. Terrified, I phoned Alina, who rushed back with the kids and instantly called an ambulance. George, fists clenched, was panic-stricken as medics examined my convulsing body. Within minutes I was being hoisted into the waiting ambulance. Alina, George and Alice looked on.",
      "I woke up several hours later in Charing Cross Hospital. The first thing the doctor told me was that I'd had a stroke. The second thing was that my brain would never be the same again. Perhaps his bluntness was necessary for legal reasons, but from where I stood\u2014or lay\u2014it was a brutal awakening.",
      "After the doctor left, I tried wriggling my arms and legs to check that I wasn't paralyzed. I wasn't, thank God. To test my memory, I wrote the alphabet on the back of the nurse's chart. I then tried saying the letters aloud, but here there was a problem. The words wouldn't conform to my efforts. They exited my mouth in such a slurred and disorderly way that I sounded like a stage drunk. But this was a small price to pay for my stroke. My first stroke, that is. Because the next day the artillery arrived and gave me such a hammering that in one fell swoop I lost the use of my right hand, right arm and right leg. And my slurred speech, perhaps in fright, went AWOL. Overnight I was confined to a wheelchair and deprived of language.",
      "So much for The Restaurateur Who Invented Downtown.",
      "* * *",
      "I shared a ward with five other men whose ages ranged from forty to eighty. At night, with words inaccessible to me, I'd listen in awe to them talking. Speech suddenly seemed like a divine accomplishment. Even everyday words had an element of poetry to them.",
      "I dreaded the moment when the men would stop talking and I'd be left with my own thoughts. Sleepless, half-paralyzed and unable to speak, I felt buried alive. More than anything, I wished the stroke had killed me.",
      "Bereft of speech and right side unusable, I wondered how my relationship with Alina might change. And with George and Alice also. All children exaggerate their father's strength. Most sense it ebbing away imperceptibly over twenty or so years. Generally, a father's decline appears natural, tolerable even. It wasn't going to be like that for my children.",
      "My new life seemed ungraspable. It existed, but was outside of me.",
      "On my second day in the hospital, Alina arranged for George and Alice to visit. An hour before they were due, I became so ashamed of them seeing me disabled that I canceled the visit. The next day I could hold out no longer.",
      "Hospitals are a great leveler. Like soldiers at war, patients lose all distinctiveness. As they entered the ward, George and Alice failed to recognize me. I was lying at the end of a row of identical beds, assimilating into the world of the sick and dying. Although it had only been three days since I last saw them, they looked years younger. They stood by the door, small eyes darting from one sick man to the next, searching for some identifiable sign of their father. After a few seconds they rushed to my bed.",
      "Alice seemed happy to see me, but George looked angry and said less than usual. He'd behaved in a similar way a year earlier after watching me lose a match in a squash tournament. Back then, I found his anger confusing. Now it made sense.",
      "Alina put on a brave face but was so shell-shocked she said little. I managed to gurgle out a few words, and in between the long silences the heavy breathing of the man in the next bed entered uncomfortably into our space. Alina told the children I was going to regain my voice and would soon be walking out of the hospital.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Jul 2025 18:05:10 -0400",
    "summary": "Lyricists Alan and Marilyn Bergman were among the most successful and prolific partnerships of their time. Frank Sinatra, Michael Jackson, Tony Bennett and many others performed their material.",
    "story": [
      "Oscar-winning lyricist Alan Bergman, who worked with his wife,\u00a0Marilyn, in a partnership that produced hits such as \"The Way We Were,\" \"It Might Be You\" and \"How Do You Keep the Music Playing?,\" has died, his family announced. He was 99.",
      "The family's spokesman, Ken Sunshine, said the legendary lyricist died late Thursday night at his Los Angeles home with his daughter, writer and film producer Julie Bergman, present.",
      "\"Bergman suffered from respiratory issues in recent months, but continued to write songs till the very end,\" Sunshine said in a statement.",
      "The Bergmans married in 1958 and remained together until Marilyn's\u00a0death in 2022. With collaborators ranging from Marvin Hamlisch and Quincy Jones to Michel Legrand and Cy Coleman, they were among the most successful and prolific partnerships of their time, providing words and occasional music for hundreds of songs, including movie themes that became as famous as the films themselves.",
      "Frank Sinatra, Michael Jackson, Tony Bennett and many other artists performed their material, and Barbra Streisand became a frequent collaborator and close friend.",
      "Blending Tin Pan Alley sentiment and contemporary pop, the Bergmans crafted lyrics known by millions, many of whom would not have recognized the writers had they walked right past them. Among their most famous works: the Streisand-Neil Diamond duet \"You Don't Bring Me Flowers,\" the well-named Sinatra favorite \"Nice 'n' Easy\" and the topical themes to the 1970s sitcoms \"Maude\" and \"Good Times.\"",
      "Their film compositions included Ray Charles' \"In the Heat of the Night\" from the movie of the same name, Noel Harrison's \"The Windmills of Your Mind\" from \"The Thomas Crown Affair,\" and Stephen Bishop's \"It Might Be You\" from \"Tootsie.\"",
      "The whole world seemed to sing and cry along to \"The Way We Were,\" an instant favorite recorded by Streisand for the 1973 romantic drama of the same name that co-starred Streisand and Robert Redford. Set to Hamlisch's tender, bittersweet melody, it was essentially a song about itself \u2014 a nostalgic ballad about nostalgia, an indelible ode to the uncertainty of the past, starting with one of history's most famous opening stanzas: \"Memories / light the corners of my mind / misty watercolor memories / of the way we were.\"",
      "\"The Way We Were\" was the top-selling song of 1974 and brought the Bergmans one of their three Oscars, the others coming for \"Windmills of Your Mind\" and the soundtrack to \"Yentl,\" the Streisand-directed movie from 1983. At times, the Academy Awards could be mistaken for a Bergman showcase. In 1983, three of the nominees for best song featured lyrics by the Bergmans, who received 16 nominations in all.",
      "The Bergmans also won two Grammys, four Emmys, were presented numerous lifetime achievement honors and received tributes from individual artists, including Streisand's 2011 album of Bergman songs, \"What Matters Most.\" On \"Lyrically, Alan Bergman,\" Bergman handled the vocals himself. Although best known for their movie work, the Bergmans also wrote the Broadway musical \"Ballroom\" and provided lyrics for the symphony \"Visions of America.\"",
      "Their very lives seemed to rhyme. They didn't meet until they were adults, but were born in the same Brooklyn hospital, four years apart; raised in the same Brooklyn neighborhood, attended the same children's concerts at Carnegie Hall and moved to California in the same year, 1950. They were introduced in Los Angeles while working for the same composer, but at different times of the day. Their actual courtship was in part a story of music. Fred Astaire was Marilyn's favorite singer at the time and Alan Bergman co-wrote a song, \"That Face,\" which Astaire agreed to record. Acetate in hand, Bergman rushed home to tell Marilyn the news, then proposed.",
      "Bergman had wanted to be a songwriter since he was a boy. He majored in music and theater at the University of North Carolina and received a master's from the University of California, Los Angeles, where he befriended Johnny Mercer and became a protege. He and Marilyn at first wrote children's songs together, and broke through commercially in the late 1950s with the calypso hit \"Yellowbird.\" Their friendship with Streisand began soon after, when they visited her backstage during one of her early New York club appearances. \"Do you know how wonderful you are?\" was how Marilyn Bergman greeted the young singer.",
      "The Bergmans worked so closely together that they often found themselves coming up with the same word at the same time. Alan likened their partnership to housework: one washes, one dries, the title of a song they eventually devised for a Hamlisch melody. Bergman was reluctant to name a favorite song, but cited \"A Love Like Ours\" as among their most personal: \"When love like ours arrives / We guard it with our lives / Whatever goes astray / When a rainy day comes around / A love like ours will keep us safe and sound.\"",
      "Alan Bergman is survived by his daughter and granddaughter, Emily Sender, whom Sunshine said just completed a master's degree in global food studies.",

    "story": [
      "Connie Francis, the wholesome pop star of the 1950s and '60s whose hits include \"Pretty Little Baby\" and whose personal life was filled with heartbreak and tragedy, has died, her friend and publicist, Ron Roberts, announced Thursday. She was 87.",
      "\"It is with a heavy heart and extreme sadness that i inform you of the passing of my dear friend Connie Francis last night,\" Roberts said in a statement posted to Facebook at 1:46 a.m. EDT. \"I know that Connie would approve that her fans are among the first to learn of this sad news.\"",
      "In another post Thursday afternoon, Roberts said Francis died Wednesday in a hospital in Pompano Beach, Florida. She had been hospitalized since late June after experiencing hip pain that led to her using a wheelchair and was later determined to be a pelvic fracture. While Francis was being treated in an intensive care unit, it was confirmed on Tuesday that she had pneumonia, Roberts said.",
      "Francis was a top performer of the pre-Beatles era, rarely off the charts from 1957-64. Able to appeal to both young people and adults, she had more than a dozen top 20 hits, starting with \"Who's Sorry Now?\" and including the No. 1 songs \"Don't Break the Heart That Loves You\" and \"The Heart Has a Mind of Its Own.\" Like other teen favorites of her time, she also starred in several films, including \"Where the Boys Are\" and \"Follow the Boys.\"",
      "The dark-haired singer was just 17 when she signed a contract with MGM Records following appearances on several TV variety shows. Her earliest recordings attracted little attention, but then she released her version of \"Who's Sorry Now?\" an old ballad by Ted Snyder, Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby.",
      "It, too, had little success initially until Dick Clark played it on his \"American Bandstand\" show in 1958. Francis followed with such teen hits as \"Stupid Cupid,\" \"Everybody's Somebody's Fool,\" and \"Lipstick on Your Collar.\" Her records became hits worldwide as she re-recorded versions of her original songs in Italian and Spanish among other languages. Her concerts around the country quickly sold out.",
      "Decades after recording \"Pretty Little Baby\" in the 1960s, the song gained popularity on social media in 2025, being featured in videos on TikTok and Instagram. Francis told the New York Times the song went unnoticed when it was originally released.",
      "\"It's a cute song,\" Francis said. \"I couldn't imagine that it has the effect that it has worldwide on people \u2014 it's hard to believe. I wanted something for the B-side of a single and I chose something that wouldn't give my A-side any competition. I don't even know the name of the record that I put it on. But I think it has a ring of innocence in this chaotic time and it connects with people.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a romance bloomed with fellow teen idol Bobby Darin, who had volunteered to write songs for her. But when her father heard rumors that the pair were planning a wedding he stormed into a rehearsal and pulled a gun on Darin, ending their relationship and seeming to set on Francis on a pained and traumatic path.",
      "She chronicled some of it in her autobiography, \"Who's Sorry Now?\"",
      "\"My personal life is a regret from A to Z,\" she told The Associated Press in 1984, the year the book came out. \"I realized I had allowed my father to exert too much influence over me.\"",
      "Her father, George Franconero, was a roofing contractor from New Jersey who played the accordion, and he had his daughter learn the instrument as soon as she began to show an aptitude for music. When she was 4, he began booking singing dates for her, going on to become her manager.",
      "Although her acting career had faded by the mid-1960s, Francis was still popular on the concert circuit when she appeared at the Westbury Music Center in Westbury, New York, in 1974. She had returned to her hotel room and was asleep when a man broke in and raped her at knifepoint. He was never captured.",
      "Francis sued the hotel, alleging its security was faulty, and a jury awarded her $2.5 million in 1976. The two sides then settled out of court for $1,475,000 as an appeal was pending. She said the attack destroyed her marriage and put her through years of emotional turmoil.",

      "He wrote spy novels, westerns and speculative fiction under a variety of pseudonyms and, at the behest of his agent, added Cruz to his name when his 1977 thriller \"Nightwing\" was published. He became an international name with 1981's \"Gorky Park,\" the story of a triple murder in Moscow, and the Russian detective, Arkady Renko, who risks his life to solve it. Rich in mood and gripping in narrative, the book starred a protagonist who stood at odds with his mother country and the political apparatus consuming it.",
      "An international blockbuster, it inspired a film starring William Hurt. But the Soviets were not amused; Smith was blacklisted from the U.S.S.R. \"I could not get back in at that point. I was persona non grata,\" he said.",

I mean, you're up there alone, nobody's there, and sometimes you kind of swivel round just to see if anybody showed up, and no one ever shows up; it's just you.

    "story": [
      "A mosaic panel on travertine slabs, depicting an erotic theme from the Roman era, was returned to the archaeological park of Pompeii on Tuesday, after being stolen by a Nazi German captain during World War II.",
      "The mosaic depicts a pair of lovers in a state of undress. A male figure is lounging on a bed or couch, while a female figure is standing, facing away from the viewer.",
      "The artwork was repatriated from Germany through diplomatic channels, arranged by the Italian Consulate in Stuttgart, Germany, after having been returned from the heirs of the last owner, a deceased German citizen.",
      "The owner had received the mosaic as a gift from a Wehrmacht captain, assigned to the military supply chain in Italy during the war.",
      "The mosaic \u2014 dating between mid- to last century B.C. and the first century \u2014 is considered a work of \"extraordinary cultural interest,\" experts said. It may have decorated the floor of a bedroom, the Archaeological Park of Pompeii said in a news release.",
      "\"It is the moment when the theme of domestic love becomes an artistic subject,\" said Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the Archaeological Park of Pompeii and co-author of an essay dedicated to the returned work. \"While the Hellenistic period, from the fourth to the first century B.C., exulted the passion of mythological and heroic figures, now we see a new theme.\"",
      "The heirs of the mosaic's last owner in Germany contacted the Carabinieri unit in Rome that's dedicated to protecting cultural heritage, which was in charge of the investigation, asking for information on how to return the mosaic to the Italian state. Authorities carried out the necessary checks to establish its authenticity and provenance, and then worked to repatriate the mosaic in September 2023.",
      "The collaboration with the Archaeological Park of Pompeii was also key, as it made it possible to trace it to near the Mount Vesuvius volcano, despite the scarcity of data on the original context of its discovery, the Carabinieri said.",
      "The panel was then assigned to the Archaeological Park of Pompeii where, suitably catalogued, it will be protected and available for educational and research purposes. Photos show the tile on display, behind a glass cover. A small crowd gathered to look at and photograph the piece.",
      "\"Today's return is like healing an open wound,\" Zuchtriegel said, adding that the mosaic allows to reconstruct the story of that period, the first century A.D., before Pompeii was destroyed by the Vesuvius eruption in A.D. 79.",
      "The park's director also highlighted how the return by the heirs of its owner signals an important change in \"mentality,\" as \"the sense of possession (of stolen art) becomes a heavy burden.\"",
      "\"We see that often in the many letters we receive from people who may have stolen just a stone, to bring home a piece of Pompeii,\" Zuchtriegel said.",
      "Photos posted on social media by the Archaeological Park of Pompeii show the mosaic being handed over by police and later being put on display.",
      "Zuchtriegel recalled the so-called \"Pompeii curse,\" which according to a popular superstition hits whoever steals artifacts in Pompeii.",
      "The world-known legend suggests that those who steal finds from the ancient city of Pompeii will experience bad luck or misfortune. That has been fueled over the years by several tourists who return stolen items, claiming they brought them bad luck and caused tragic events.",

      "An off-duty Alaska Airlines pilot indicted for trying to shut off a passenger jet's engines mid-flight in 2023 recalled the scary moment he slipped out of reality after eating \"magic mushrooms.\"",
      "Former airline captain Joseph Emerson said he takes full responsibility for the night in October 2023 that changed his life.",
      "\"I had no intention of crashing an actual airplane. I wanted to wake up. I was convinced I wasn't going home to my wife and kids,\" he said in an interview that aired on \"CBS Mornings\" on Thursday.",
      "At the time, Emerson said he had been grieving the death of his best friend and first turned to alcohol before experimenting with the psychedelic drug. Two days after trying so-called 'magic mushrooms' for the first time, he boarded Alaska Air Flight 2059 as a passenger from Everett, Washington, to San Francisco. It was a full flight, with 83 other passengers and crew on board, so he was given the cockpit jump seat behind the pilot and first officer.",
      "\"Most consequential three seconds of my life\"",
      "Suddenly, he said he felt a sense of \"all-out panic and fear\" on the plane as the drugs altered his perception of reality.",
      "\"You're not going home. You need to wake up. That's when I acted. I pulled the handles that were in front of my face,\" Emerson recalled thinking as he pulled the handles that cut off fuel to the engines in the event of a fire.",
      "While in the apparent dissociative state, Emerson said he didn't realize the serious consequences of his actions.",
      "\"I mean, in the dream, in that dissociative state, I thought they were going to wake me up. It didn't wake me up, right? I was in reality. I know that now. You know, it's the most consequential three seconds of my life,\" Emerson said.",
      "The flight was diverted and landed safely in Portland, Oregon, where Emerson was arrested. He's set to be arraigned next month on a federal charge of interfering with a flight crew, and faces a host of state charges including 83 misdemeanor counts of recklessly endangering another person and one felony count of first-degree endangering aircraft.",
      "The case reignited the conversation about barriers facing pilots when it comes to their mental health.",
      "Pilots' mental health",
      "Disclosing mental health issues can lead to a pilot being grounded by the Federal Aviation Administration, putting their ability to work at risk for an extended period of time, possibly lasting years. A 2022 study published in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine estimated 56% of pilots avoid seeking medical care due to fear of losing their certification to fly.",
      "\"I came to an understanding, or a misunderstanding, that I needed to be perfect on paper. I needed to show up and appear perfect, no matter what else was going on for me,\" Emerson said.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board has since held a first of its kind pilot mental health forum to review existing pilot mental health rules. The FAA also launched a review of policies \u2013 both calling for changes to address barriers to care.",
      "\"We need to have a system that allows people to be more forthcoming and to have treatment for issues that shouldn't keep you out of the cockpit,\" then-FAA Administrator Michael Whitaker said months after the incident, in December 2023.",
      "The FAA review committee made 24 recommendations.",
      "Illinois Rep. Sean Casten and Minnesota Rep. Pete Stauber are leading an effort in Congress to enact reforms within two years, introducing the bipartisan\u00a0Mental Health in Aviation Act\u00a0to help pilots and air traffic controllers get access to mental health care and hire additional medical examiners.",
      "\"The goal really simply is to make our skies safer and make our pilots safer. That's it,\" Casten told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "The bill would also require the FAA to annually review and update the process related to mental health-related special issuance of medical certificates to pilots and air traffic controllers, set aside 13.74 million dollars a year for the next three years to hire additional certified Aviation Medical Examiners, and authorize a three year $4.5 million dollar public information campaign aimed at destigmatizing mental health care among pilots and air traffic controllers.",
      "\"Our pilots and air traffic controllers are not going to lose their job when they ask for help. We in this country must recognize that that's strength. And they're not to be punished. We're going to help them, process them, and get them back into cockpits,\" Stauber added.",
      "The bill maintains the FAA's rigorous process for determining a pilot is safe to resume flying but aims to cut red tape and increase transparency. It has unanimously passed the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee last month and has the backing of the largest pilot unions. The bill has advanced to the House of Representatives for consideration. The FAA declined to comment on the bill.",
      "Emerson says he's been sober since the incident. He and his wife have started a nonprofit, Clear Skies Ahead, aimed at improving pilot health and wellness.",

    "summary": "Arkansas State Sen. Bryan King has been trying to repeal a 2011 mandate that added fluoride to most public drinking water.",
    "story": [
      "Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont this week signed legislation requiring the state to keep fluoride at existing levels. But Florida and Utah have banned adding fluoride to drinking water, and other states may follow, as the decades-old practice of adding it to public drinking is facing renewed attacks, including from the federal government.",
      "Arkansas state Sen. Bryan King, a cattle and poultry farmer in Fayetteville, told CBS News he has \"concerns\" about adding fluoride to water.",
      "Since 2011, when the state mandated most public drinking water to include fluoride,  King has thrown his anti-fluoride voice behind a handful of bills seeking to repeal that mandate.",
      "Fluoride is a natural mineral. It strengthens teeth and fights dental decay. It's been added to the U.S.'s public drinking supply since the 1940s.",
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rated fluoride as one of the top ten public health achievements of the 20th century.",
      "And according to\u00a0the American Dental Association, \"70 years of research, thousands of studies and the experience of more than 210 million Americans tell us that water fluoridation is effective in preventing cavities and is safe for children and adults.\"",
      "\"If that's the case, they need to individually go out to each water district and sell it to the people there, and let them make their own water decisions,\" King said.",
      "At least 19 states have considered legislation to remove, ban or make fluoride optional in public drinking water this year. One of fluoride's most prominent critics is Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "In the latest skirmish over science, fluoride opponents argue that at high levels, it can lead to kidney and liver damage and lower IQs in children.",
      "The National Institutes of Health's toxicology program in 2024\u00a0determined\u00a0\"with moderate confidence\" that there is a link between high levels of fluoride exposure and lower IQs in children. That conclusion was based on studies involving fluoride levels of about twice the recommended limit for drinking water.",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics has\u00a0questioned\u00a0the validity of the NIH's report, noting it had \"important limitations,\" including the high fluoride levels, and that other reviews have come to different conclusions about fluoride's risks and benefits.",
      "The EPA in 2011\u00a0lowered\u00a0the recommended limit for fluoride in water to cut down on fluorosis \u2014 when spots appear on kids' teeth \u2014 and in the wake of a 2006\u00a0report\u00a0from the National Academy of Sciences that found a lifetime of overconsumption of fluoride can lead to weakened, brittle bones and teeth.",
      "At Arkansas' Fort Smith water system, Lance McAvoy, who oversees the system, told CBS News it's monitored 24/7.",

    "summary": "President Trump signed the country's first major legislation aimed at regulating cryptocurrency on Friday, hailing \"the exciting new frontier\" for the technology.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump signed a landmark bill to regulate cryptocurrency on Friday, hailing the \"exciting new frontier\" for the technology one day after the bill passed the House.",
      "The legislation, called the GENIUS Act, is the first major law governing digital currency, and establishes a regulatory framework for the $250 billion stablecoin market. Stablecoins are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency since their value is pegged to other assets, like the dollar. The bill passed the House on Thursday with the support of 206 Republicans and 102 Democrats.",
      "\"We worked hard. It's a very important act, the GENIUS Act. They named it after me,\" the president joked in the East Room of the White House. \"I want to thank you. This is a hell of an act.\"",
      "Members of Congress and top executives from Robinhood, Tether, Gemini and other crypto and financial firms were in attendance for the signing ceremony.",
      "The fate of the GENIUS Act was in question earlier this week when a dozen conservatives stymied a procedural vote. A compromise was ultimately reached, and the holdouts allowed the legislation to proceed. The president on Friday suggested that he spoke to the holdouts individually on the phone to persuade them, after House Speaker Mike Johnson told him there were a dozen Republicans opposing the bill.",
      "\"The good news is, I call up, 'Hello, Jim, how are you?' 'Sir, you have my vote.' Boom. 'Sir, you have my vote.' I really just, they just want a little love,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, it's always the same 12 people.\"",
      "David Sacks, the venture capitalist-turned Mr. Trump's AI and crypto czar, said the president \"stepped in and saved this bill.\" Mr. Trump also said Vice President JD Vance had been on the phone late at night, helping push the legislation through.",
      "What is the GENIUS Act?",
      "The GENIUS Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) establishes guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins. The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "With the GENIUS Act signed into law, banks, nonbanks and credit unions can dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "\"Just as I promised last year, the GENIUS Act creates a clear and simple regulatory framework to establish and unleash the immense promise of dollar-backed stablecoins,\" Mr. Trump said. \"This could be, perhaps, the greatest revolution in financial technology since the birth of the Internet itself. A lot of people are saying that.\"",
      "The president said the GENIUS Act provides banks and other financial institutions a framework for issuing crypto assets backed \"one-for-one\" with real U.S. dollars and Treasury bills, \"strengthening the dollar\" and allowing the entire U.S. financial system to be eligible for a \"21st-century upgrade.\"",
      "Lawmakers also approved two other cryptocurrency bills, capping what Republicans dubbed \"Crypto Week\" in Congress. The Clarity Act will regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act prevents the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans. The legislation is seen by the Trump administration and the crypto community as a way of bringing digital currency into the mainstream financial system.",
      "\"Let me say, the entire crypto community, for years, you were mocked and dismissed and counted out,\" the president said. \"You were counted out as little as a year and a half ago. But this signing is a massive validation.\"",
      "The Trump family's crypto investments have increased their wealth in recent months as the administration alters its regulatory approach to digital currency. The White House has insisted there is no conflict of interest, and the president's assets are in a trust managed by his children. Key crypto figures who were present Friday, including Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, backed Mr. Trump's campaign last year.",
      "The president on Friday also touted his decision to pardon Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the internet marketplace Silk Road who was sentenced to life in prison in 2015.",
      "The GENIUS Act wasn't the only bill that had House Republicans wringing their hands this week. The chamber also approved a request from the president to claw back about $9 billion in funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting in a late-night vote, signing off on changes the Senate made to the bill, known as a rescissions package, earlier this week.",
      "Passage of the funding cuts was held up this week over Democratic efforts to force the release of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Ultimately, the package passed the House along party lines, with two Republicans joining Democrats to vote against it. The bill claws back about $8 billion for foreign assistance efforts, including by the the U.S. Agency for International Development, and about $1 billion for public radio and television stations. The president is expected to sign it soon.",
      "\"REPUBLICANS HAVE TRIED DOING THIS FOR 40 YEARS, AND FAILED\u2026.BUT NO MORE,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, referring to cutting funding to the corporation that oversees federal funds for NPR and PBS. \"THIS IS BIG!!!\"",
      "Friday's signing ceremony for the GENIUS Act took place against the backdrop of increased focus on the Epstein case. On Thursday evening, Mr. Trump ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury material related to Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died in federal custody in 2019. Mr. Trump has faced increasing pressure to disclose more information about the case after the Justice Department said no further documents would be released following a review of the evidence.",
      "\"Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!\"",
      "Bondi said the Justice Department is \"ready to move the court tomorrow to unseal the grand jury transcripts.\" A judge will make the final call on whether the material can be made public, and the process could take weeks or months.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Jul 2025 20:12:32 -0400",
    "summary": "Consumers face both rising premiums and falling subsidies next year in Obamacare plans.",
    "story": [
      "Most of the 24 million people in Affordable Care Act health plans face a potential one-two punch next year \u2014 double-digit premium increases along with a sharp drop in the federal subsidies that most consumers depend on to buy the coverage, also known as Obamacare.",
      "Insurers want higher premiums to cover the usual culprits \u2014 rising medical and labor costs and usage \u2014 but are tacking on extra percentage point increases in their 2026 rate proposals to cover effects of policy changes advanced by the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress. One key factor built into their filings with state insurance departments: uncertainty over whether Congress allows more generous, COVID-era ACA tax subsidies to expire at the end of December.",
      "\"The out-of-pocket change for individuals will be immense, and many won't actually be able to make ends meet and pay premiums, so they will go uninsured,\" said JoAnn Volk, co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.",
      "Especially if the higher subsidies expire, insurance premiums will be among the first financial pains felt by health care consumers after policy priorities put forward by President Trump and the GOP. Many other changes \u2014 such as additional paperwork requirements and spending cuts to Medicaid \u2014 won't occur for at least another year. But spiking ACA premiums, as the nation heads into key midterm elections, invites political pushback. Some on Capitol Hill are exploring ways to temper the subsidy reductions.",
      "\"I am hearing on both sides \u2014 more from Republicans, but from both the House and Senate\" \u2014 that they are looking for levers they can pull, said Pennsylvania-based insurance broker Joshua Brooker, who follows legislative actions as part of his job and sits on several insurance advisory groups.",
      "In initial filings, insurers nationally are seeking a median rate increase \u2014 meaning half of the proposed increases are lower and half higher \u2014 of 15%, according to an analysis for the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker covering 19 states and the District of Columbia. KFF is a national health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "That's up sharply from the last few years. For the 2025 plan year, for example, KFF found that the median proposed increase was 7%.",
      "Health insurers \"are doing everything in their power to shield consumers from the rising costs of care and the uncertainty in the market driven by recent policy changes,\" wrote Chris Bond, a spokesperson for AHIP, the industry's lobbying group. The emailed response also called on lawmakers \"to take action to extend the health care tax credits to prevent skyrocketing cost increases for millions of Americans in 2026.\"",
      "Neither the White House nor the Department of Health and Human Services responded to requests for comment.",
      "These are initial numbers and insurance commissioners in some states may alter requests before approval.",
      "Still, \"it's the biggest increase we've seen in over five years,\" said analysis co-author Cynthia Cox, a KFF vice president and director of its Program on the ACA.",
      "Premiums will vary based on where consumers live, the type of plan they choose, and their insurer.",
      "For example, Maryland insurers have requested increases ranging from 8.1% to 18.7% for the upcoming plan year, according to an analysis of a smaller set of insurers by Georgetown University researchers. A much larger swing is seen in New York, where one carrier is asking for less than a 1% increase, while another wants 66%. Maryland rate filings indicated the average statewide increase would shrink to 7.9% from 17.1% \u2014 if the ACA's enhanced tax credits are extended.",
      "Most insurers are asking for 10% to 20% increases, the KFF report says, with several factors driving those increases. For instance, insurers say underlying medical costs \u2014 including the use of expensive obesity drugs \u2014 will add about 8% to premiums for next year. And most insurers are also adding 4% above what they would have charged had the enhanced tax credits been renewed.",
      "But rising premiums are just part of the picture.",
      "A bigger potential change for consumers' pocketbooks hinges on whether Congress decides to extend more generous tax credits first put in place during President Joe Biden's term as part of the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021, then extended through the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.",
      "Those laws raised the subsidy amounts people could receive based on their household income and local premium costs and removed a cap that had barred higher earners from even partial subsidy assistance. Higher earners could still qualify for some subsidy but first had to chip in 8.5% of their household income toward the premiums.",
      "Across the board, but especially among lower-income policyholders, bigger subsidies helped fuel record enrollment in ACA plans.",
      "But they're also costly.",
      "A permanent extension could cost $335 billion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Such an extension was left out of the policy law Mr. Trump signed on July 4 that he called the \"One Big, Beautiful Bill.\" Without action, the extra subsidies will expire at the end of this year, after which the tax credits will revert to less generous pre-pandemic levels.",
      "That means two things: Most enrollees will be on the hook to pay a larger share of their premiums as assistance from federal tax credits declines. Secondly, people whose household income exceeds four times the federal poverty level \u2014 $84,600 for a couple or $128,600 for a family of four this year \u2014 won't get any subsidies at all.",
      "If the subsidies expire, policy experts estimate, the average amount people pay for coverage could rise by an average of more than 75%. In some states, ACA premiums could double.",
      "\"There will be sticker shock,\" said Josh Schultz, strategic engagement manager at Softheon, a New York consulting firm that provides enrollment, billing, and other services to about 200 health insurers, many of which are bracing for enrollment losses.",
      "And enrollment could fall sharply. The Wakely Consulting Group estimates that the combination of expiring tax credits, the Trump law's new paperwork, and other requirements will result in ACA enrollment dropping by as much as 57%.",
      "According to KFF, insurers added premium increases of around 4% just to cover the expiration of the enhanced tax credits, which they fear will lead to lower enrollment. That would further raise costs, insurers say, because people who are less healthy are more likely to grit their teeth and reenroll, leaving insurers with a smaller, but sicker, pool of members.",
      "Less common in the filings submitted so far, but noticeable, are increases pegged to Trump administration tariffs, Cox said.",
      "\"What they are assuming is tariffs will drive drug costs up significantly, with some saying that can have around a 3-percentage-point increase\" in premiums as a result, she said.",
      "Consumers will learn their new premium prices only late in the fall, or when open enrollment for the ACA begins on Nov. 1 and they can start shopping around.",
      "Congress could still act, and discussions are ongoing, said insurance broker Brooker.",
      "Some lawmakers, he said, are consulting with the CBO about the fiscal and coverage effects of various scenarios that don't extend the subsidies as they currently exist but may offer a middle ground. One possibility involves allowing subsidies for families earning as much as five or six times the poverty level, he said.",
      "But any such effort will draw pushback.",
      "Some conservative think tanks, such as the Paragon Health Institute, say the more generous subsides led people to fudge their incomes to qualify and led to other types of fraud, such as brokers signing people up for ACA plans without authorization.",
      "But others note that many consumers \u2014 Democratic and Republican \u2014 have come to rely on the additional assistance. Not extending it could be risky politically. In 2024, 56% of ACA enrollees lived in Republican congressional districts, and 76% were in states won by Mr. Trump.",
      "Allowing the enhanced subsidies to expire could also reshape the market.",
      "Brooker said some people may drop coverage. Others will shift to plans with lower premiums but higher deductibles. One provision of Mr. Trump's new tax law allows people enrolled in either \"bronze\" or \"catastrophic\"-level ACA plans, which are usually the cheapest, to qualify for health savings accounts, which allow people to set aside money, tax-free, to cover health care costs.",
      "\"Naturally, if rates do start going up the way we anticipate, there will be a migration to lower-cost options,\" Brooker said.",

      "The fee applies to visitors who come to the U.S. on nonimmigrant visas, such as foreign students attending American universities or workers who receive temporary work visas such as\u00a0the H-1B, which is often used by companies to hire foreign engineers or other skilled workers.",
      "In 2023, the U.S. issued more than 10 million nonimmigrant visas, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the U.S. State Department.",
      "Visa holders subjected to the fee may later be reimbursed as long as they comply with their visa's restrictions, such as leaving the U.S. within five days of the visa's expiration, according to the new law. However, the law doesn't specify how visa holders may apply for reimbursement of the fee, nor how the fee will be collected.",
      "\"The visa integrity fee requires cross-agency coordination before implementation,\" a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill provides the necessary policies and resources to restore integrity in our nation's immigration system,\" it added.",

      "Steward accuses its founder Ralph de la Torre and three others\u00a0 \u2014 Michael Callum, James Karam, and Sanjay Shetty \u2014 of defrauding the company of more than $245 million.",
      "\"Through their greed and bad faith misconduct, [these former insiders] operated Steward with the aim of enriching themselves at the expense of the Company, its creditors, and the patients and communities that Steward served,\" the new filing alleges. \"These insiders pilfered Steward's assets for their own material gain, while leaving the Company and its hospitals perpetually undercapitalized and insolvent.\"",
      "Once the nation's largest for-profit hospital chain, Steward operated hospitals in Massachusetts, Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania and other states. CBS News found that de la Torre pushed for the company's expansion. By working with a real estate investment firm, Medical Properties Trust, de la Torre helped purchase new medical properties, sell off the real estate, and force the hospitals into costly lease-back arrangements.",
      "A CBS News investigation that spanned nearly two years documented allegations of\u00a0 how private equity investors and de la Torre followed this formula, extracting hundreds of millions of dollars in dividends from the real estate sales, while health care workers and patients struggled to get the life-saving supplies they needed as a result.",
      "Records reviewed by CBS News showed Steward hospitals around the country left a trail of unpaid bills, at times risking a shortage of potentially life-saving supplies. That included a case in a Massachusetts hospital where medical staff says a device that could have stopped the bleeding in a new mother's liver was repossessed by the manufacturer weeks earlier. After being transferred to another hospital, the young woman died just hours after giving birth to her first daughter.",
      "Last August, after filing for bankruptcy, the company sold off six Massachusetts hospitals. The sale of the final two facilities in the state left about 1,200 workers jobless, according to state officials. In a 2024 interview with CBS News, Massachusetts Gov.

      "At the time of the patient's death, a spokesperson for Steward told CBS News company executives always put patients first and said they \"deny that any other considerations were placed ahead of that guiding principle.\"",

      "De la Torre also defended the company's actions.",
      "\"Steward Health Care has done everything in its power to operate successfully in a highly challenging health care environment,\" de la Torre said in a company statement in 2024.",

      "In January 2021, de la Torre allegedly took a $111 million dividend payout while the company was struggling financially. The former CEO also pocketed $81.5 million according to the complaint. The court filing also lists the former executives who benefited: Callum, who as vice president for physician services at Steward received $10.3 million. Shetty, then-president of Steward Health Care System received $1.8 million and Karam, who remains a member of Steward's board, received $728,456.",
      "The complaint also claims Steward Health Care International, the international arm of Steward that's majority-owned by de la Torre, received $4.3 million of the dividend payout.",
      "Later that year, Steward claims de la Torre overpaid by $200 million for five Miami-based hospitals acquired from Tenet Healthcare Corporation. The complaint alleges the former CEO pushed for the $1.1 billion deal based on his \"personal desire to build a hospital empire in the Miami area, rather than on any independent financial analysis.\"",
      "According to the complaint, de la Torre then sold assets related to Steward's Medicare Advantage business to a company called CareMax in 2022.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Jul 2025 15:30:29 -0400",
    "summary": "Backers of the Genius Act, a potentially landmark bill that could help \"stablecoins\" go mainstream, say it would greatly speed electronic payments.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Friday is signing the Genius Act, the first major federal law governing cryptocurrencies.",
      "The law establishes federal regulations for \"stablecoins,\" which are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency because their value is pegged to fixed assets, like the dollar.",
      "The Genius Act passed in the House on Thursday by a 308-122 vote after being approved\u00a0in the Senate\u00a0last month with broad bipartisan support. The measure is part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.",
      "\"For the first time in history, Congress has passed bipartisan digital assets legislation through both the Senate and the House. The Genius Act marks a major milestone in securing America's leadership in payments innovation while protecting consumers and strengthening our national security,\" South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a statement Thursday following the bill's passage by Congress.",
      "The Genius Act, which is sponsored by Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, has two Democratic co-sponsors \u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland \u2014 and two Republican co-sponsors \u2014 South Carolina's Sen. Tim Scott and Wyoming's Sen. Cynthia Lummis.",
      "Here's what to know about stablecoin and how the Genius Act could affect its use.",
      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backed the passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What will the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) established guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",
      "The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "With the Genius Act passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get \"depegged\" from its underlying asset if that asset's value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity, according to S&P Global Ratings.",
      "In 2023, for example, the failure of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins \u2014 the USDC and DAI \u2014 to depeg.",
      "Stablecoins are also subject \"to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity,\" according to S&P Global.",
      "Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?",
      "As the Genius Act awaited approval from Congress, some of the nation's largest banks were already considering how they could integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.",
      "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, is already developing its digital currency capabilities in an attempt to expand revenue and attract clients, she added.",
      "\"We are closely monitoring developments in the legislative and regulatory space on coin issuance and evaluating how to best to support our clients' needs through our existing 24/7 products like [Citi Token Services], in addition to exploring options around issuing our own external token or coin and working with existing providers,\" Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships & innovation for Citi's Services business, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, also plans to use stablecoin, CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts in an earnings call on Tuesday.",
      "Outside of the banking world, companies like Walmart and Amazon are also exploring the idea of issuing their own stablecoins, Sam Mcingvale, head of product at blockchain technology company Optimism, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email on Tuesday.",
      "\"If new stablecoin legislation is passed, we expect it to open the floodgates even further,\" he said.",
      "What is Trump's position?",
      "Congress' approval of the Genius Act aligns with Mr. Trump's\u00a0commitment in March to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "At a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last year, Mr. Trump\u00a0also said\u00a0it would be his administration's policy to \"keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has taken other actions that point to his interest in cryptocurrency. In January, shortly before taking office, he and his wife Melania Trump launched their own meme coins, a highly volatile type of crypto whose value derives from their online popularity.",
      "The president on Tuesdy\u00a0posted\u00a0his support for the Genius Act on Truth Social.",
      "\"The Genius Act is going to put our Great Nation lightyears ahead of China, Europe and all others, who are trying endlessly to catch up, but they just can't do it,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "The price of bitcoin was up 1.40% on Thursday, rising to $120,584.80; etherium's price rose 3.41% to $3,486.86.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Jul 2025 15:30:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Content promoting extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery is available to young TikTok users, breaching the social media platform's policies.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were easily found with a simple search on TikTok and available to a user under the age of 18, in violation of the platform's own policies, CBS News has found.",
      "CBS News created a TikTok account for a hypothetical 15-year-old female user in the United States and found that, at the very least, hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were searchable and watchable on the platform using the account.",
      "Once the CBS News account interacted with a handful of these videos, similar content was then recommended to the account on TikTok's \"For You\" feed.",
      "Searchable videos ranged from content with captions such as, \"nothing feels better than an empty stomach,\" to \"what I eat in a day\" videos promoting restrictive, 500-calorie-per-day diets. Guidelines published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health suggest that girls between the ages of 14 and 18 ingest between 1,800 and 2,400 calories per day.",
      "Many of the videos promoted thin body types as aspirational targets and included the hashtag \"harsh motivation\" to push extreme weight loss advice.",
      "Some of those videos included messages or slogans such as \"skinny is a status symbol\" and \"every time you say no to food, you say yes to skinny.\"",
      "TikTok's community guidelines say the platform only allows users over the age of 18 to see content promoting restrictive, low-calorie diets, including videos promoting medications for weight loss or idealizing certain body types. The Chinese-owned platform also says it bans users under the age of 18 from viewing videos that promote cosmetic surgery without warning of the risks, such as before-and-after images, videos of surgical procedures, and messages discussing elective cosmetic surgery.",
      "But CBS News found a range of videos by entering basic search terms on the platform, such as \"skinny,\" \"thin,\" and \"low cal,\" that promoted thin bodies as ideal, while also pushing harmful weight management behaviors. One such video showed an image of a scale with a weight of 39.9 kg (88 pounds) alongside a caption saying \"weight loss\" and the hashtag \"ed,\" which is a common abbreviation for \"eating disorder.\"",
      "Another graphic video with the caption \"ana gives you wings\" showed a series of models with protruding collar bones and spines. The term \"ana\" is an abbreviation for the eating disorder anorexia.",
      "Responding to CBS News' research, a TikTok spokesperson said Thursday that it was \"based on a very limited sample size and does not reflect the experience of the vast majority of our community.\"",
      "\"TikTok does not allow content that promotes disordered eating or extreme weight loss behaviours, and we work with health experts to provide in-app support resources where needed,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The spokesperson pointed to a study published in May by the University of Southern California, which found that a majority of the eating disorder content on TikTok is discussion among users about recovery from such conditions.",
      "The same study noted, however, the platform's \"dual role in both challenging harmful cultural norms and potentially perpetuating them,\" regarding body image perceptions and eating disorders.",
      "\"We know that this isn't a one-off error on TikTok's part and that children are coming across this content on a scale,\" said Gareth Hill, a spokesperson for the Molly Russell foundation, a charity in the United Kingdom that works to prevent young people from committing self-harm.",
      "\"The question for TikTok is, if this is not representative, then why has this account [created by CBS News], which is a child's account, been shown this content in the first place, and then why is it continuing to get recommended to it?\"",
      "CBS News also found a wide variety of videos available to the under-18 user promoting the weight loss drug Ozempic and various forms of cosmetic surgery. That included videos that showed up on the recommended \"For You\" feed, which promotes cosmetic surgeries such as rhinoplasty, breast augmentation, and liposuction.",
      "In one case, a user talking about their waist reduction surgery included a voiceover saying: \"I would rather die hot than live ugly.\"",
      "A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment specifically on CBS News' findings regarding cosmetic surgeries being promoted to underage users.",
      "TikTok says it has taken a range of measures over the past several months to address criticism regarding the availability of extreme weight loss content on the platform. In early June, the platform suspended search results for the viral hashtag #SkinnyTok, after drawing criticism from health experts and European regulators. The hashtag had been associated primarily with videos promoting extreme weight loss, calorie restriction and negative body talk, often presented as wellness advice.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson also told CBS News on Thursday that searches for words or phrases such as #Anorexia would lead users to relevant assistance, including localized eating disorder helplines, where they can access further information and support.",
      "\"I think we're understanding more and more about how this content shows up and so even when you ban a particular hashtag, for example, it's not long until something similar jumps up in its place,\" Doreen Marshall, who leads the American nonprofit National Eating Disorders Association [NEDA], told CBS News.",
      "\"This is going to be an evolving landscape both for creating content guidelines, but also for the platforms themselves and, you know, while some progress has been made, there's clearly more that can be done,\" Marshall said.",
      "TikTok is not the only social media platform that has faced criticism for the accessibility of extreme weight loss content.",
      "In 2022, 60 Minutes reported on a leaked internal document from Meta that showed the company was aware, through its own research, of content on its Instagram platform promoting extreme weight loss and fueling eating disorders in young people.",
      "At the time, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, declined 60 Minutes' request for an interview but its global head of safety, Antigone Davis, said, \"We want teens to be safe online\" and that Instagram doesn't \"allow content promoting self-harm or eating disorders.\"",
      "Last year, 60 Minutes reported that the Google-owned YouTube video platform, which is hugely popular among teenagers, was also serving up extreme weight loss and eating disorder content to children.",

    "summary": "President Trump floated the idea of firing Jerome Powell \u2014 whom he first appointed Federal Reserve chair \u2014 earlier this week, after years of on-and-off criticism over interest rates.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump asked about the idea of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in a meeting with lawmakers this week, CBS News has reported, a legally untested move that follows years of on-and-off criticism of the Fed leader leveled by Mr. Trump.",
      "The president's gripes with his handpicked Fed chair \u2014 whom he has called a \"numbskull,\" a \"Trump Hater\" and a \"stubborn mule\" \u2014 have largely focused on the central bank's decision to keep interest rates relatively high so far this year, part of an inflation-fighting campaign. Mr. Trump has also taken aim at Powell's handling of a Federal Reserve office renovation project.",
      "Mr. Trump asked a group of House Republicans if he should fire Powell during a Tuesday night Oval Office meeting, sources told CBS News earlier this week. The president told reporters a day later it's \"highly unlikely\" he'll fire Powell, though he confirmed he spoke to lawmakers about \"the concept of firing him,\" and \"almost all of them said I should.\"",
      "Who is Jerome Powell, and who appointed him?",
      "Powell is the chair of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors.",
      "Powell was first nominated as Fed chair by Mr. Trump during his first term, replacing Obama appointee Janet Yellen, and the Senate confirmed him in an 84-13 vote. Former President Joe Biden nominated him to a second term, keeping him in office until May 2026.",
      "\"He's strong, he's committed, he's smart,\" Mr. Trump said in a speech announcing his decision to nominate Powell in 2017, praising Powell's reputation as a \"consensus-builder.\"",
      "Last month, though, Mr. Trump said he initially nominated Powell because he \"listened to someone that I shouldn't have listened to, and Biden shouldn't have reappointed him.\"",
      "Before becoming chair, Powell had served on the central bank's Board of Governors since 2012, when he was initially nominated by former President Barack Obama.",
      "Powell has switched between government and private-sector jobs for much of his career. He worked in investment banking in the 1980s and 1990s, interrupted by a stint as former President George H.W. Bush's undersecretary of the Treasury. For almost 20 years starting in the 1990s, he was a partner at the Carlyle Group investment firm, according to his Fed biography.",
      "A Georgetown-educated lawyer, Powell does not have a Ph.D. in economics, unlike some other former Fed chairs.",
      "Does Jerome Powell have a designated term length?",
      "Federal Reserve chairs serve for four-year terms, so Powell's stint as chair will end in May 2026.",
      "Members of the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors, however, serve for 14 years, and Powell's term as a board member ends in January 2028. Yellen resigned from the board after her term as Fed chair ended, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has encouraged Powell to follow suit, though Powell's plans are unclear.",
      "The chair and board members are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "What does the Federal Reserve do?",
      "The Federal Reserve is the United States' central bank. Made up of 12 regional Federal Reserve banks and a D.C.-based Board of Governors, its responsibilities include regulating the U.S. banking system, serving as a \"lender of last resort\" to banks and running an instant payment system.",
      "But one of the Federal Reserve's highest-profile responsibilities is its role in setting monetary policy. Through its 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, which includes Powell, the Fed works independently of elected officials to influence the supply of money in the U.S. economy and the interest rates at which it's lent out, with an eye toward keeping unemployment low and prices stable.",
      "Those two goals \u2014 maximizing employment and minimizing inflation \u2014 are known as the Fed's \"dual mandate.\" But they're in conflict with each other. If the Fed lowers interest rates, it can boost economic growth, but it also runs the risk of overheating the economy and pushing up inflation. And if interest rates are hiked, inflation tends to cool off, but the economy slows down.",
      "The interest rate that the Fed targets is called the Federal Funds Rate, which is what banks charge to lend money to each other overnight. But other interest rates \u2014 from mortgage rates to yields for U.S. government bonds \u2014 tend to follow closely with the Federal Funds Rate, so the Fed's decisions impact borrowing costs for average American consumers and businesses.",
      "Picking the right balance isn't easy, and the Fed often faces criticism for its choices.",
      "Under Powell, the Fed dropped its target interest rate to near 0% at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, with the goal of averting an economic catastrophe. But after the economy recovered and inflation soared, the central bank in 2023 hiked interest rates to their highest point in decades, aiming to get inflation under control. The Fed has taken a cautious path since then, cutting rates slightly last year as inflation fell but keeping them steady so far this year.",
      "Last month, the Fed's rate-setting committee said it may cut rates later this year, but there are concerns that inflation \u2014 which is still above the Fed's 2%-per-year target \u2014 could worsen. Powell has also suggested the Fed is concerned Mr. Trump's tariffs could increase inflation.",
      "\"For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,\" Powell said last month.",
      "Why is Trump unhappy with the Fed and Jerome Powell?",
      "Mr. Trump is unhappy with the Fed's decision to leave rates stable. For months, the president has pushed the central bank to slash rates immediately, calling Powell \"Mr. Too Late.\"",
      "The president argued last month that inflation is already low enough to start cutting rates.",
      "\"If he was concerned about Inflation or anything else, then all he has to do is bring the Rate down, so we can benefit on Interest Costs, and raise it in the future when and if these 'other elements' happen (which I doubt they will!),\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "He's not the first president to criticize the Fed for high interest rates, which make everything from car loans to mortgages more expensive and can put a damper on the economic growth that tends to make or break presidents' popularity. But Mr. Trump has been unusually vocal.",
      "In a mid-June post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump called Powell a \"Total and Complete Moron\" and urged the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee to \"override\" him. While Powell is just one of 12 votes on the committee, the chair traditionally has an outsize role in its decisions. The last few decisions to leave interest rates stable have been unanimous.",
      "Mr. Trump had similar issues with Powell during his first term, saying during an earlier interest rate-hiking campaign in 2018 that he was \"not even a little bit happy with my selection\" of Powell. When the Fed cut rates in 2020, Mr. Trump called Powell his \"most improved player.\"",
      "Meanwhile, members of the Trump administration have pressured Powell over a yearslong renovation to the Fed's headquarters complex. In a letter to the central banker, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought called some of the features \"ostentatious,\" and alleged that Powell may have misled Congress about the project's scope or made changes to the plans without getting permission from the right federal bodies.",
      "Mr. Trump has also criticized Powell over the renovations. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he's \"highly unlikely\" to fire Powell \"unless he has to leave for fraud.\" At other points, Mr. Trump has suggested Powell should resign over the project.",
      "Powell said last year he would not resign as chair if asked to do so.",
      "Powell defended the Fed's handling of the project in a letter to Vought and denied allegations that it was overly lavish, saying the Fed has \"taken great care to ensure the project is carefully overseen.\" He also said the project has been \"subject to budget approval\" by board members annually. Powell added the Fed has only \"made a small number of design changes to scale back or eliminate certain elements,\" so no further government review is needed.",
      "The Fed typically operates with a high degree of independence over its own budget, and legally has the power to buy and remodel office spaces in Washington, D.C., as it sees fit.",
      "Is the Fed independent from the rest of the government? And can Trump fire Powell?",
      "The structure of the Fed \u2014 with board members and chairs who serve across multiple administrations \u2014 allows it to make decisions without direct input from politicians.",
      "Whether the president can fire Powell before his term ends is legally untested. Federal law says members of the Federal Reserve board can only be removed by the president before their terms end \"for cause,\" and the Supreme Court found in 1935 that Congress is allowed to limit the grounds on which the president can fire members of independent federal boards.",
      "In May, the high court did allow Mr. Trump to fire members of federal labor boards, but it exempted the Federal Reserve, which it called a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "Any attempt to fire Powell before his term ends could also roil financial markets, analysts and lawmakers from both parties have warned. Mr. Trump acknowledged this risk Wednesday, telling Just The News in an interview, \"They say it would disrupt the market if I did.\"",
      "At some points in the Federal Reserve's 112-year history, including during World War II, the central bank has been more beholden to the needs of the Treasury. But the Fed has operated more independently since 1951, when a public disagreement between the Fed and the Truman administration led the Treasury to agree to let the central bank set interest rates on its own.",
      "There's nothing preventing the president from publicly expressing his views about the Fed, though, as several of Mr. Trump's predecessors have. During his campaign last year, Mr. Trump said he should have \"at least [a] say\" in the moves made by the central bank.",
      "\"In my case, I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve, or the chairman,\" Mr. Trump said in an August 2024 press briefing.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in April that Mr. Trump \"has the right to express his displeasure with the Fed, and he has the right to say he believes interest rates should be lower.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Jul 2025 21:09:00 -0400",
    "summary": "FDA regulators said Juul's studies show its e-cigarettes are less harmful for adult smokers, who can benefit from switching completely to vaping.",
    "story": [
      "Vaping brand Juul is allowed to keep its electronic cigarettes on the market, the Food and Drug Administration announced Thursday.",
      "FDA regulators said Juul's studies show its e-cigarettes are less harmful for adult smokers, who can benefit from switching completely to vaping.",
      "The decision comes after the brand has struggled for years after being widely blamed for sparking the teen vaping trend.",
      "The FDA decision applies to both tobacco- and menthol-flavored versions of the reusable product, which works with nicotine-filled cartridges sold in two different strengths. Juul previously discontinued several fruit and candy flavors that helped drive its popularity but were favored by teens.",
      "Juul will be one of only two U.S. companies authorized to sell menthol-flavored vapes, which many adults prefer to tobacco flavor.",
      "\"This is an important milestone for the company and I think we made a scientifically sound case for the role that menthol can play in e-vapor,\" Juul CEO K.C. Crosthwaite told The Associated Press.",
      "Critic calls decision \"a big step in the wrong direction\"",
      "Parents, politicians and anti-tobacco groups are certain to oppose the FDA's decision. They have argued for years that Juul products should be permanently banned due to their role in triggering a yearslong spike in underage vaping.",
      "\"It is a big step in the wrong direction to authorize sales of the product that was responsible for this public health crisis in the first place,\" Yolonda Richardson, CEO of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said in a statement.",
      "Juul was once valued at more than $13 billion, and its small, sleek e-cigarettes revolutionized the image and technology of the vaping industry. But the company has since been forced to slash hundreds of jobs and pay billions to settle lawsuits over its role in the rise of youth vaping.",
      "The FDA had ordered the company to remove its products from the market in June 2022. But then the agency abruptly reversed course days later and agreed to reopen its scientific review of Juul's application after the company pushed back in court.",
      "At the time, the FDA had raised concerns over \"potentially harmful chemicals\" in Juul's e-cigarettes and \"insufficient and conflicting data\" it said the company had submitted.",
      "Juul said regulators had overlooked thousands of pages of scientific data critical to its submission.",
      "Authorized, not endorsed by the FDA",
      "Thursday's announcement is not an approval or endorsement, and the FDA reiterated that people who do not smoke should not use Juul or any other e-cigarettes. The FDA determination indicates that smokers who switch completely to Juul can reduce their exposure to deadly carcinogens and other chemicals found in traditional cigarettes.",
      "The FDA decision applies to Juul's original system, which is now roughly a decade old. Crosthwaite said the company hopes to win authorization for its next-generation device and is also considering applying to the FDA for more flavors.",
      "\"It's critically important that American adults who use tobacco have regulated options,\" Crosthwaite said.",
      "In recent years, the FDA has authorized a handful of e-cigarettes to help adult smokers cut back on cigarettes. Juul's main competitors, Vuse and Njoy, each previously received FDA permission to remain on the market. Njoy sells the only other menthol-flavored e-cigarettes authorized by the FDA.",
      "To meet FDA requirements, companies must show that their products benefit public health. In practice, that means proving that adult smokers who use them are likely to quit or reduce their smoking, while teens are unlikely to get hooked on them.",
      "Juul's journey, from launch to lawsuits",
      "The brainchild of two Stanford University students, Juul launched in 2015 and within two years rocketed to the top of the vaping market.",
      "Juul quickly outpaced older brands with its high-nicotine, fruity-flavored cartridges, sold in mango, mint and creme brul\u00e9e. The company's small, discrete devices provided a more potent, user-friendly alternative to older, bulkier devices.",
      "But the company's rise was fueled by underage use, and e-cigarettes quickly became ubiquitous in U.S. schools. In 2019, the company was pressured into halting all advertising and eliminating most of its flavors, leaving only tobacco and menthol-flavored options.",
      "By then, the company was already the target of multiple investigations and lawsuits by federal, state and local officials, as well as class-action attorneys.",
      "In 2022, the company paid $1.7 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits brought by families of Juul users, school districts, city governments and Native American tribes. The company separately agreed to pay $1.1 billion to settle lawsuits or investigations from most U.S. states.",
      "Juul is no longer the top-selling e-cigarette brand and now trails Vuse, which is sold by tobacco giant Reynolds American, which also makes Camel and Newport cigarettes.",
      "Teens have shifted away from Juul amid a wider drop in vaping, according to the latest federal figures. The FDA reported last year that teen vaping dropped to a 10-year low, after stepped-up enforcement against unauthorized brands imported from China, such as Elf Bar.",
      "Unlike Juul, disposable e-cigarettes like Elf Bar still come in fruit and candy flavors, despite efforts by regulators to block their use.",

    "summary": "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggested that changes might be coming to the rules limiting liquids in carry on-bags.",
    "story": [
      "Air travelers may soon see another change when passing through security checkpoints at airports, with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggesting there may be changes to current TSA restrictions on liquids in carry-on bags.",
      "The potential change in policies around carrying liquids on flights comes after Noem on July 8 said passengers at airports no longer have to remove their shoes during regular TSA security checks. That change went into effect immediately.",
      "Speaking at a conference hosted Wednesday by publication The Hill, Noem said she's questioning \"everything TSA does\" and spoke of possible changes to the amount of liquids travelers can tote in their carry-on baggage. Under current TSA guidance, travelers can carry liquids in travel-sized containers of 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) or less per item in their carry-on bag.",
      "\"The liquids, I'm questioning. So that may be the next big announcement is what size your liquids need to be,\" Noem said. \"We have put in place in TSA a multilayered screening process that allows us to change some of how we do security and screening so it's still as safe.\"",
      "She gave no details about precisely what those changes might be or how quickly travelers could expect to see them.",
      "Travelers generally must empty or throw away their water bottles before going through a TSA checkpoint, or else pack containers with more than 3.4 ounces of liquid in their checked baggage. There are exceptions for medications and baby formula.",
      "The TSA has been exploring the liquids issue for years, former TSA Administrator John Pistole told CBS News' Kris Van Cleave earlier this month. The TSA has been installing new computed tomography, or CT, checkpoint scanners at airports, which generates a 3-D image of a bag's content and which can automatically detect other potential security hazards.",
      "When were liquids restricted on planes?",
      "The rules for liquids on flights were a response to a 2006 incident in which authorities foiled a plot to used liquid explosives smuggled aboard carry-on luggage to blow up planes.",
      "Ever since the guidelines were adopted, TSA checkpoints have been the scene of travelers quickly guzzling water, digging through luggage to find and discard a too-large tube of hair gel, and chucking jars of everything from jam to coffee that didn't meet the size requirement.",
      "The regulations also triggered myriad discussions \u2014 sometimes arguments \u2014 over what constitutes a liquid. Yogurt? Peanut butter? Jam and jelly? All are currently restricted to containers no bigger than 3.4 ounces as detailed on an extensive list that TSA maintains on its website titled \"What can I bring?\"",
      "Noem also laid out her vision for the future of airport travel during the talk Wednesday.",
      "\"Hopefully, the future of an airport, where I'm looking to go is that you walk in the door with your carry-on suitcase, you walk through a scanner and go right to your plane,\" she said. \"It takes you one minute.\"",

      "\"The President is extremely troubled by your management of the Federal Reserve System,\" Office of Management and Budget Chair Russell Vought wrote in a July 10 letter.",
      "The letter came after months of criticism from Mr. Trump over the Fed's decision not to slash interest rates. Economists say lowering rates may accelerate economic growth, but it also runs the risk of causing inflation to spike. That has led the Fed's interest rate-setting committee \u2014 which Powell chairs \u2014 to keep rates steady so far this year after cutting rates slightly last year.",
      "Mr. Trump has called on Powell to resign from his post, and last month, the president called Powell a \"numbskull\" over his interest rate decisions and said \"maybe\" he'll try to fire Powell \u2014 though federal law states the Fed chair can only be fired \"for cause,\" which typically refers to firings due to specific misconduct or performance issues. In the past, Mr. Trump had said he doesn't plan on trying to fire Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends next year.",

    "summary": "The GENIUS Act is the first major crypto legislation ever passed by Congress.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House on Thursday passed a landmark piece of legislation to regulate cryptocurrency after its fate appeared in limbo when right-wing Republicans staged a rebellion that brought the floor to a standstill.",
      "The bill, known as the\u00a0GENIUS Act, is the first major crypto legislation ever passed by Congress. It now heads to President Trump's desk.",
      "It passed in a bipartisan vote of 308 to 122, with 206 Republicans and 102 Democrats supporting it.",
      "On Tuesday, a dozen conservatives sank a procedural vote to advance three crypto bills, including the GENIUS Act, which establishes a regulatory framework for the $250 billion market for\u00a0stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, abruptly canceled the remaining floor votes and the holdouts went to the White House to meet Mr. Trump, who later announced that they \"have all agreed\" to fall in line.",
      "But drama unfolded during Wednesday's procedural vote when a few holdouts initially voted against moving forward before dropping their opposition, which was short-lived. The next procedural vote to set up debate on the spate of bills was held open for nearly 10 hours as the holdouts sought to merge a broader market structure bill with legislation to ban a central bank digital currency.",
      "Republican Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, who leads the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said holdouts had made a deal with Mr. Trump to package the two digital asset measures.",
      "The plan ran into opposition from those who wrote the legislation and upended what House Republicans had termed \"crypto week.\"",
      "House Republicans had originally wanted the GENIUS Act to be married with the CLARITY Act, a broader bill that would set rules for when a digital asset is considered a commodity or security. Combining the crypto bills would have sent the legislation back to the Senate and slowed the process. Mr. Trump had pressed Congress to quickly pass the GENIUS Act as a standalone bill, saying it would make the U.S. a leader in digital assets.",
      "This week, conservatives pushed to tie the CLARITY Act with the controversial Anti-Central Bank Digital Currency Surveillance State Act, which would prohibit the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency. Conservatives said the Senate's stablecoin bill and the broader market structure legislation were insufficient because it would allow for a central bank digital currency, which they opposed.",
      "\"We feel like we need to be dealing with all this at once,\" said Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, who helped stall the bill.",
      "A deal was ultimately made late Wednesday to\u00a0tie the ban on a central bank digital currency with the must-pass annual defense reauthorization bill, and holdouts again flipped their votes to allow the legislative process to move on.",
      "The Senate\u00a0approved the bipartisan stablecoin bill last month after experiencing hiccups caused by a Democratic revolt over concerns about the Trump family's business ventures involving crypto and the potential that they could make the president vulnerable to foreign influence.",
      "The Trump family's crypto investments have increased their wealth by billions\u00a0of dollars in recent months as the administration continues to loosen the federal government's regulatory approach to the digital currency industry as a whole. The White House has denied that there are any conflicts of interest and said Mr. Trump's assets are in a trust managed by his children.",
      "Democratic critics were also worried that the legislation did not contain strong enough provisions to protect consumers, the financial system and national security.",
      "It's faced similar criticism from House Democrats.",
      "\"By passing this bill, Congress will be telling the world that Congress is OK with corruption, OK with foreign companies buying influence,\" Rep. Maxine Waters of California, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, said Thursday.",
      "Democrats who back the legislation have argued that regulations are long overdue, even if the measure is imperfect.",
      "\"The question is, do you want some rules of the road or no rules of the road?\" Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey said during floor debate.",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Jul 2025 11:56:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump threatens to raise tariffs, claiming the European Union won't buy U.S. cars or food \u2014 but 2024 trade data shows otherwise.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. and European Union have just weeks to reach a new trade deal before President Trump plans to impose a 30% tariff on most imports from the 27 EU member countries starting Aug. 1.",
      "The EU negotiates trade policy as a single entity and was the U.S.'s top goods trading partner in 2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. In 2024, the U.S. imported around $606 billion in goods from the EU and exported around $370 billion worth of products to it.",
      "EU leaders have warned they're prepared to impose higher tariffs on hundreds of U.S. imports unless a deal can be reached in the coming weeks. Economists say the dispute could drive up consumer prices on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "Mr. Trump has defended tariffs as necessary to protect American workers, pointing to the trade imbalance on goods and higher EU tariffs as evidence the bloc has treated the U.S unfairly for years.",
      "The president has also repeatedly said the European Union does not buy American cars or agricultural products. However, trade data from 2024 shows that's inaccurate. While the U.S. has imported more cars and agricultural products from Europe in recent years than it exports there, the EU remains a significant market for these American products.",
      "Here's a breakdown of the data.",
      "EU is the U.S.'s fourth largest buyer of agricultural products",
      "President Trump has repeatedly suggested Europe does not buy agricultural goods from U.S. farmers and producers.",
      "\"The European Union is, in many ways, nastier than China, OK?,\" President Trump said at an event May 12. \"They sell us their agricultural products. We sell them virtually none. They don't take our products.\"",
      "But according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the EU was the fourth-largest buyer of American agricultural products in 2024, purchasing a record $12.8 billion in these goods. Top exports to the EU included oilseeds like sunflower and sesame seeds, nuts and processed nut products like peanut butter, and soybeans.",
      "By comparison, the U.S. imported $36 billion in agricultural products from the EU in 2024 \u2014 buying billions of dollars worth of European wine, animal products, and grains and feeds.",
      "The White House has not responded to a request for clarification on the president's claim.",
      "Before Mr. Trump raised tariffs to a baseline of 10% in April, the EU maintained a higher average tariff on foreign agricultural products than the United States. In 2023, the EU average tariff on foreign agricultural goods was 10.8%, compared to the U.S. rate of 5%.",
      "Certain American food products are also less available in Europe because of consumer preferences and regulations, as the EU bans some American food products that contain certain additives they have deemed unsafe for human consumption.",
      "EU buys more than 160,000 American vehicles each year",
      "Another frequent target of President Trump's criticism is the EU's trade imbalance on cars.",
      "\"They sell us 13 million cars. We sell them none,\" Mr. Trump claimed at an event in May.",
      "It is true that the United States imports far more European vehicles than the number of American-made vehicles it exports to the EU, but the EU does buy some American cars.",
      "In 2024, the EU imported about 165,000 American vehicles, valued at roughly $8.8 billion at current exchange rates, according to a report by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. By comparison, the same data shows the U.S. imported about 750,000 vehicles from the EU in 2024, worth $43 billion.",
      "A post shared by CBS News Confirmed (@cbsnewsconfirmed)",
      "Both trading partners have long imposed tariffs on foreign vehicles. The EU charges a 10% tariff on U.S. passenger cars, while the U.S. charged 2.5% on EU passenger cars until Mr. Trump raised the tariff on all foreign vehicles to 25%. The U.S. has also maintained a 25% tariff on EU pickup trucks since the 1960s.",
      "Apart from tariffs, industry analysts say U.S. cars are less competitive in the EU market for a number of other reasons, including that the member nations tend to have higher fuel economy standards, higher gas costs, and their buyers tend to prefer smaller cars.",
      "Other major products include pharmaceuticals and crude oil",
      "Though Mr. Trump often focuses on cars, they're not the biggest sector. Biological products and medication are actually the top commodities the U.S. imports from the EU, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. This is driven partly by some American pharmaceutical companies maintaining manufacturing facilities in EU countries with lower corporate tax rates like Ireland.",
      "In recent weeks, President Trump has floated tariff rates as high as 200% on foreign-made pharmaceuticals unless companies onshore manufacturing to the U.S.",
      "On the export side, the top U.S. exports to the EU include oil and natural gas, airplanes, and immunological products like blood plasma.",
      "Over the weekend, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said the EU still hopes to reach a new agreement with the U.S.",
      "\"We have always been clear that we prefer a negotiated solution,\" von der Leyen said, adding, \"We will continue to prepare countermeasures so we are fully prepared.\"",

      "The back-to-school season may seem at least a month away on the calendar, but for a majority of American families, it's already begun.",
      "Two-thirds of back-to-school shoppers have already started buying clothing and supplies ahead of the new school year \u2014 a 55% increase on the level of early purchases last year.",
      "That's according to a new\u00a0survey from the National Retail Federation (NRF), which indicates that students and their parents are getting an early start on shopping this year, hunting for deals as they navigate\u00a0economic uncertainty. More than half of consumers surveyed, 51%, cited concerns over tariffs as the reason why they were starting school shopping earlier this year.",
      "\"Consumers are being mindful of the potential impacts of tariffs and inflation on back-to-school items, and have turned to early shopping, discount stores and summer sales for savings on school essentials,\" Katherine Cullen, NRF vice president of industry and consumer insights, said in a statement.",
      "The price of school supplies and books has already reached an all-time high, data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis\u00a0shows. However, consumers worry that the cost of items could go up even more once the full brunt of President Trump's tariffs take effect.",
      "Mr. Trump recently announced on Truth Social that he would\u00a0place steep tariffs\u00a0on over 20 countries, starting on Aug. 1. The levies could directly impact the cost of apparel and other\u00a0back-to-school items\u00a0like electronics that are imported from abroad.",
      "In its report, the NRF predicts families will spend a total of $128.2 billion on supplies this year, up from $125.4 billion last year. The increase, however, reflects an increase in the number of consumers shopping for back-to-school supplies, and not individual spending, which is expected to be lower this year.",
      "Families with students in kindergarten through high school plan to spend an average of $858.07 on school-related items this year, down from $874.68 in 2024, according to the study. College students and their parents also plan to spend less this year \u2014 an average of $1,325.85, down from $1,364.75 in 2024.",
      "Four in five shoppers said they were planning their shopping around July back-to-school sales to maximize their budgets, the NRF report found.",
      "Retailers focus on sales",
      "With inflation and tariffs top of mind for many consumers, stores are already promoting back-to-school discounts to lure shoppers.",
      "\"As shoppers look for the best deals on clothes, notebooks and other school-related items, retailers are highly focused on affordability and making the shopping experience as seamless as possible,\" NRF's Cullen said.",
      "Amazon, Target and Walmart\u00a0are each offering back-to-school summer sales to entice customers. Amazon last week completed its four-day Prime Day event, which offered thousands of\u00a0deals on everything from backpacks to dorm furnishings to laptops.",

      "The ruling, issued Friday by Judge Sean Jordan of the U.S. District Court of Texas' Eastern District, orders that the rule be vacated because of the court's finding that the CFPB exceeded its authority under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. After the CFPB issued the rule in January, the Cornerstone Credit Union League and the Consumer Data Industry Association, a trade group for the credit reporting industry, had filed a lawsuit to halt it.",
      "The court's decision could impact the roughly 15 million people who carry a total of about $49 billion in medical debt on their credit reports, a burden that can influence whether lenders decide whether to extend loans like mortgages or auto loans to consumers. At the time when the CFPB issued the rule, the agency noted that medical debt is a poor predictor of whether a consumer will make good on other types of loans.",
      "\"It doesn't show whether they are likely to pay their mortgage or other debts because there are a lot of inaccuracies and they have a lot of disputes,\" Julie Margetta Morgan, former associate director of research, monitoring and regulations at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The CFPB's rule had been hailed by consumer advocates for helping to protect consumers who can get tangled up in complicated issues around medical debt, such as problems with insurance reimbursements, denials and other snafus.",
      "\"By pulling back on this rule, the court has eliminated the CFPB's ability to provide that kind of relief to people and give this certainty that they can work with their health care provider to make sure the bills they are paying are accurate, without being hounded by a debt collector,\" added Margetta Morgan, who currently serves as the president of The Century Foundation, a left-leaning policy think tank.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "What does the ruling say about medical debt and credit reports?",
      "Jordan ruled that the \"medical debt rule exceeds the [CFBP]'s statutory authority by violating the plain text\" of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or FCRA, a 1970 law that oversees credit reporting.",
      "\"The rule exceeded the CFPB's statutory authority because FCRA explicitly allows credit reporting agencies to report, and creditors to obtain and use, information about medical debt that is properly coded to obscure the name of the provider and the nature of the services provided,\" Dan Smith, CEO of the Consumer Data Industry Association, said in a July 11\u00a0statement.",
      "Had the CFPB rule gone into effect?",
      "No, the rule hadn't yet gone into effect, according to Jordan's ruling.",
      "While the rule was slated to take effect about 60 days after it was published, the CFPB asked for a three-month delay after the Trump administration put new leadership at its helm, the decision noted. That request was granted by the court as the lawsuit to block the rule moved forward.",
      "Could the court decision be appealed?",
      "It's unclear. While the CFPB could appeal in theory, the agency is now essentially in a state of limbo.",
      "In February, President Trump appointed White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought as acting director of the CFPB. Days after his appointment, Vought issued a memo to CFPB staff that directed employees not to issue any proposed or formal rules, stop pending investigations and not open new investigations, among other actions.",
      "What steps are available to consumers with medical debt?",
      "According to the CFPB, 20% of Americans has at least one medical debt collection account on their credit reports, while and over half of the collections on credit reports are for medical debt.",
      "In some states, consumers can rely on government protections to help them with medical debt and their credit reports, Morgan noted. Colorado and New York both enacted laws in 2023 that provide some protections for consumers who have medical debt, for instance.",
      "And last year, Experian, Equifax and TransUnion, the three national credit reporting agencies, said that they were removing medical collections debt under $500 from U.S. consumer credit reports.",
      "\"From my experience reading these accounts from consumers, there are a lot of flaws in our medical billing and reporting system, and it lands in the consumer's lap and they are supposed to try to figure out how to deal with it,\" Morgan said. \"I would make sure the bills you receive are accurate,\" as well as check whether your insurer is paying the correct amount, she added.",

    "summary": "The tax and spending bill signed into law by President Trump on July 4 includes a limited tax break for car buyers.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of car buyers in the U.S. could soon get some tax relief thanks to a provision in the so-called \"big, beautiful bill\" that was signed into law on July 4 by President Trump.",
      "The idea of giving a tax break for auto purchasers was first floated by Mr. Trump while on the campaign trail in October, when he promised that such a measure would \"make car ownership dramatically more affordable for millions and millions of working American families.\"",
      "That promise has now materialized as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, with the new tax break taking effect for car purchases starting in 2025. But the deduction also has income limitations that narrow the number of Americans who can claim it, while used car buyers and vehicle leasers do not benefit.",
      "Still, car buyers who have bought a new vehicle this year or are planning to do so in the next four years may get some tax relief when they file their 2025 tax returns. The deduction will expire in 2028, which means car buyers can only take advantage of the benefit for four tax years.",
      "At the same time, the One Big Beautiful Act eliminates the federal tax credit for electric vehicles after Sept. 30. The tax break, which provides a $7,500 for new EVs and a $4,000 credit for used EVs, is credited with helping make electric vehicles more affordable for many buyers.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "How much is the new auto loan deduction?",
      "The new tax cuts and spending law enables car buyers to deduct up to $10,000 in \"qualified passenger vehicle loan interest during a given taxable year,\" beginning with 2025 purchases.",
      "While that's similar to the mortgage interest deduction available to homeowners, there is one major difference: Car buyers will be able to itemize their auto loan interest even if they take the standard deduction. By comparison, the mortgage interest deduction is only available to taxpayers who itemize.",
      "Which vehicles qualify for the deduction?",
      "The tax break applies to the purchase of new cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds (referred to as light vehicles). Used cars don't qualify.",
      "To qualify for the deduction, a vehicle also must be assembled in the U.S., which further limits the tax break.",
      "The deduction also only applies to vehicles purchased for personal use, not for fleets or commercial purposes. And it excludes autos that are leased, which represent about one-quarter of all auto sales in the U.S., according to Experian.",
      "What are the income limits for the auto loan deduction?",
      "The full break can only be claimed by single taxpayers with a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) of $100,000 or less or married couples with a MAGI of $200,000 or less.",
      "Modified adjusted gross income is your adjusted gross income, which can be found on line 11 of your 1040 tax return, with some items like savings bond interest added back in, according to the IRS.",
      "Under the new law, the auto loan deduction shrinks for people with MAGIs above those thresholds, with the amount reduced by $200 for each $1,000 in income above those levels. The deduction is completely phased out for single filers earning above $150,000 and married couples with incomes above $250,000.",
      "How many Americans will qualify for the car loan deduction?",
      "An estimated 3.5 million new vehicle loans could be eligible for the tax break this year if purchasing patterns stay the same and after excluding commercial vehicles and customers above the income cutoff, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.",
      "About 60% of the 15.9 million new light vehicles sold last year were financed with auto loans, according to Cox data.",
      "How much will the car loan deduction save on my taxes?",
      "That depends on the size of your auto loan and whether you fall below the income thresholds for the new tax break, but the typical car buyer could save hundreds per year on their taxes.",
      "The average new vehicle loan is about $44,000 financed over six years. Interest rates vary by customer, so the savings will, too. In general, the tax deduction will decline after the initial year because interest payments on loans are front-loaded, while principal payments grow on the back end.",
      "Car buyers who qualify for an auto loan rate of about 6.5%, typically available to consumers with high credit scores, could deduct $3,000 in the first year of owning their car and about $1,800 per year after that for the remainder of the loan,\u00a0according to the American Financial Services Association, a consumer credit industry trade group.",
      "Deductions reduce a filer's taxable income, which helps lower their tax burden. For instance, someone in the 22% tax bracket could save $660 on their taxes by claiming a $3,000 auto loan deduction.",
      "At a 9.3% interest rate \u2014 typical of people with subprime credit scores \u2014 an average new vehicle buyer could save about $2,200 on taxes over four years, Smoke said.",

    "story": [
      "The Environmental Protection Agency announced Friday afternoon that it is eliminating its scientific division, known as the Office of Research and Development.",
      "The move to shutter the ORD comes one day after the agency said it was undergoing a reorganization involving several other EPA divisions.",
      "ORD conducts critical research to \"safeguard human health and ecosystems from environmental pollutants,\" according to its website. More than 1,500 employees, including scientists and researchers, are dispersed across the country at 11 different locations, but the bulk are based at the EPA's headquarters in Washington, D.C., and at a large scientific facility in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.",
      "Eliminating the office will bring $748.8 million in savings, according to a news release from the agency.",
      "The EPA had 16,155 employees back in January 2025, but following voluntary retirements, dismissals, and other reduction in force (RIF) actions, it is now down to 12,488 employees, the agency said in its release Friday, a reduction of about 22% of its staff. The staffing cuts include 3,201 employees who took the Trump administration's so-called \"Fork in the Road\" deferred resignation program, as well as those who took early retirement.",
      "\"Under President Trump's leadership, EPA has taken a close look at our operations to ensure the agency is better equipped than ever to deliver on our core mission of protecting human health and the environment while Powering the Great American Comeback,\" EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement Friday. \"This reduction in force will ensure we can better fulfill that mission while being responsible stewards of your hard-earned tax dollars.\"",
      "It was anticipated that ORD would be impacted, according to earlier documents that outlined the agency's RIF plans. Back in March, the documents indicated that somewhere between 50% to 75% of ORD employees would not be retained, the majority of them leading scientists in their field of research.",
      "A source inside ORD told CBS News Friday that employees found out about the reduction in force via the press release that was sent out to the public, and has not received any formal communication from the agency about what will happen next.",
      "\"A friend texted me the press release,\" the source told CBS News, \"that is how I found out.\"",
      "According to the source, most employees are anxiously checking their email, waiting to see if they'll be reassigned to another program office, or impacted by the reduction.",
      "Some ORD employees have already received notification that they have been reassigned, while most wait to learn their fate. In May, ORD employees were told they would be contacted by other programs inside the agency to discuss potential, lateral moves. But according to the source, it now appears that impacted individuals won't get much of a choice: either take the reassignment if one is offered, or leave the agency.",
      "\"I don't think I can stay in the U.S.,\" one source told CBS News, \"there are no jobs here.\"",
      "Because of cuts to the federal workforce and cuts to scientific research, there are very few scientific positions available in the U.S., and some are now contemplating work abroad.",
      "\"Today's cuts dismantle one of the world's most respected environmental health research organizations,\" said Jennifer Orme-Zavaleta, former EPA principal deputy assistant administrator for science, in a statement. \"EPA's science office has long been recognized internationally for advancing public health protections through rigorous science. Reducing its workforce under the guise of cost savings is both misleading and dangerous. This does not save taxpayers money; it simply shifts costs to hospitals, families and communities left to bear the health and economic consequences of increased pollution and weakened oversight. The people of this country are not well served by these actions. They are left more vulnerable.\"",
      "The ORD's research touches on a range of issues from PFAS, often referred to as \"forever chemicals,\" to water-bourne diseases, soot in the air, and environmental factors that contribute to childhood asthma, Orme-Zavaleta said.",
      "It is made up of six major research program offices, per its website, that include Air, Climate, and Energy, Chemical Safety for Sustainability, Health and Environmental Risk Assessment, Homeland Security, Safe and Sustainable Water Resources and Sustainable and Healthy Communities.",
      "It also includes four major research labs including the Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure (CCTE), the Center for Environmental Measurement and Modeling (CEMM), the Center for Environmental Solutions and Emergency Response (CESER) and the Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment (CPHEA).",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Friday filed a libel lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal's publisher and its leader, Rupert Murdoch, after the paper published a story on what it called a \"bawdy\" birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein that the paper alleged was signed by Mr. Trump.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of Florida, seeks at least $10 billion in damages. It alleges the paper's claims were \"false, defamatory, unsubstantiated, and disparaging,\" and accuses the Journal of \"clear journalistic failures.\"",
      "The paper claimed the letter, from the early 2000s, featured Mr. Trump's signature as well as a birthday message and a drawing of a nude woman. According to the Journal's report, it was collected in a book along with letters from other friends and acquaintances to mark Epstein's 50th birthday in 2003. The president has denied the report, calling the letter a \"FAKE.\"",
      "The president has previously acknowledged he crossed paths with Epstein years ago, but has said they had a \"falling out.\"",
      "The suit names the Journal's publisher, Dow Jones & Company, along with its parent company, News Corporation. Also named in the lawsuit as defendants are Wall Street Journal reporters Joseph Palazzolo and Khadeeja Safdar, the bylines on the Epstein story, as well as Murdoch and Dow Jones CEO Robert Thomson.",
      "In a Truth Social post, Mr. Trump referred to it as a \"POWERHOUSE Lawsuit\" and a \"historic legal action.\"",
      "A Dow Jones spokesperson said in a statement: \"We have full confidence in the rigor and accuracy of our reporting, and will vigorously defend against any lawsuit.\"",
      "Defamation lawsuits face a high bar to success in U.S. courts. Typically, for a public figure to win a defamation suit, they need to demonstrate not only that false claims were made about them, but also that the defendant acted with \"actual malice,\" meaning that they knew the claims were false or acted with reckless disregard for the truth.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.",
      "Facing pressure to disclose more details on Epstein, who died in his jail cell in 2019 while facing sex trafficking charges, Mr. Trump on Thursday ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury testimony related to Epstein. The Justice Department late Friday filed a motion to unseal that grand jury testimony.",
      "Epstein was investigated by federal authorities in Florida in the 2000s, which ended in a non-prosecution agreement and a guilty plea on state prostitution charges, and he was later charged with child sex trafficking in Manhattan in 2019. The government also secured a conviction against Epstein's co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell. It investigated the circumstances of Epstein's death in federal custody, which was deemed a suicide.",
      "The order from Mr. Trump comes after the Justice Department and FBI released a memo stating that Epstein did not have an incriminating \"client list,\" did not try to blackmail any prominent figures, and died by suicide. The memo drew backlash from across the political spectrum, including from some fervent Trump backers, in part because Bondi and other administration figures had promised to release information on Epstein.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump signed a landmark bill to regulate cryptocurrency on Friday, hailing the \"exciting new frontier\" for the technology one day after the bill passed the House.",
      "The legislation, called the GENIUS Act, is the first major law governing digital currency, and establishes a regulatory framework for the $250 billion stablecoin market. Stablecoins are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency since their value is pegged to other assets, like the dollar. The bill passed the House on Thursday with the support of 206 Republicans and 102 Democrats.",
      "\"We worked hard. It's a very important act, the GENIUS Act. They named it after me,\" the president joked in the East Room of the White House. \"I want to thank you. This is a hell of an act.\"",
      "Members of Congress and top executives from Robinhood, Tether, Gemini and other crypto and financial firms were in attendance for the signing ceremony.",
      "The fate of the GENIUS Act was in question earlier this week when a dozen conservatives stymied a procedural vote. A compromise was ultimately reached, and the holdouts allowed the legislation to proceed. The president on Friday suggested that he spoke to the holdouts individually on the phone to persuade them, after House Speaker Mike Johnson told him there were a dozen Republicans opposing the bill.",
      "\"The good news is, I call up, 'Hello, Jim, how are you?' 'Sir, you have my vote.' Boom. 'Sir, you have my vote.' I really just, they just want a little love,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, it's always the same 12 people.\"",
      "David Sacks, the venture capitalist-turned Mr. Trump's AI and crypto czar, said the president \"stepped in and saved this bill.\" Mr. Trump also said Vice President JD Vance had been on the phone late at night, helping push the legislation through.",
      "What is the GENIUS Act?",
      "The GENIUS Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) establishes guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins. The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "With the GENIUS Act signed into law, banks, nonbanks and credit unions can dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "\"Just as I promised last year, the GENIUS Act creates a clear and simple regulatory framework to establish and unleash the immense promise of dollar-backed stablecoins,\" Mr. Trump said. \"This could be, perhaps, the greatest revolution in financial technology since the birth of the Internet itself. A lot of people are saying that.\"",
      "The president said the GENIUS Act provides banks and other financial institutions a framework for issuing crypto assets backed \"one-for-one\" with real U.S. dollars and Treasury bills, \"strengthening the dollar\" and allowing the entire U.S. financial system to be eligible for a \"21st-century upgrade.\"",
      "Lawmakers also approved two other cryptocurrency bills, capping what Republicans dubbed \"Crypto Week\" in Congress. The Clarity Act will regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act prevents the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans. The legislation is seen by the Trump administration and the crypto community as a way of bringing digital currency into the mainstream financial system.",
      "\"Let me say, the entire crypto community, for years, you were mocked and dismissed and counted out,\" the president said. \"You were counted out as little as a year and a half ago. But this signing is a massive validation.\"",
      "The Trump family's crypto investments have increased their wealth in recent months as the administration alters its regulatory approach to digital currency. The White House has insisted there is no conflict of interest, and the president's assets are in a trust managed by his children. Key crypto figures who were present Friday, including Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, backed Mr. Trump's campaign last year.",
      "The president on Friday also touted his decision to pardon Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the internet marketplace Silk Road who was sentenced to life in prison in 2015.",
      "The GENIUS Act wasn't the only bill that had House Republicans wringing their hands this week. The chamber also approved a request from the president to claw back about $9 billion in funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting in a late-night vote, signing off on changes the Senate made to the bill, known as a rescissions package, earlier this week.",
      "Passage of the funding cuts was held up this week over Democratic efforts to force the release of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Ultimately, the package passed the House along party lines, with two Republicans joining Democrats to vote against it. The bill claws back about $8 billion for foreign assistance efforts, including by the the U.S. Agency for International Development, and about $1 billion for public radio and television stations. The president is expected to sign it soon.",
      "\"REPUBLICANS HAVE TRIED DOING THIS FOR 40 YEARS, AND FAILED\u2026.BUT NO MORE,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, referring to cutting funding to the corporation that oversees federal funds for NPR and PBS. \"THIS IS BIG!!!\"",
      "Friday's signing ceremony for the GENIUS Act took place against the backdrop of increased focus on the Epstein case. On Thursday evening, Mr. Trump ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury material related to Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died in federal custody in 2019. Mr. Trump has faced increasing pressure to disclose more information about the case after the Justice Department said no further documents would be released following a review of the evidence.",
      "\"Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!\"",

      "He also confirmed ICE plans to use data from government programs like Medicaid to locate immigrants suspected of living in the U.S. illegally, including those with criminal histories.",
      "Pressed on concerns about masked ICE officers and the possibility that imposters could exploit the practice by posing as immigration agents, Lyons said, \"That's one of our biggest concerns. And I've said it publicly before, I'm not a proponent of the masks.\"",
      "\"However, if that's a tool that the men and women of ICE to keep themselves and their family safe, then I will allow it,\" Lyons said during his first television network sit-down interview at ICE headquarters in Washington. \"I do kind of push back on the criticism that they don't identify themselves.\"",

      "More of the interview with Lyons will air on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, July 20, at 10:30 a.m. ET.",
      "Lyons cited the increase in attacks faced by agents at ICE, the agency at the center of President Trump's promise of carrying out the largest deportation operation in American history.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has said attacks against ICE officials have increased by more than 800% this year compared to the same time period in 2024. Numerous instances of violence directed at ICE agents and facilities have occurred in recent weeks, including an armed attack against a detention center in Texas earlier this month that has led to more than a dozen arrests.",
      "Lyons agreed the increase in attacks faced by ICE agents could be partially attributed to the dramatic expansion in immigration arrests under the second Trump administration, acknowledging that the agency is \"more visible in the community.\"",
      "But he argued his agents are being forced to go into communities more often to arrest individuals living in the U.S. illegally, including those with criminal records, because more cities and states have adopted \"sanctuary\" policies that limit local law enforcement cooperation with ICE. Those policies lead many jurisdictions to refrain from notifying ICE when they release inmates who are also in the U.S. illegally.",
      "\"So you are seeing us out more, and I think there is more of a tension,\" Lyons added. \"The immigration mission is one of the forefront of this administration, so it is a lot of scrutiny and publicity to it.\"",
      "Lyons says Medicaid data will be used to \"locate\" those in the U.S. illegally",
      "CBS News also asked Lyons about a report from the Associated Press that an inter-agency agreement had granted ICE access to the personal information of millions of Medicaid enrollees, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers and data on patients' race and ethnicity.",
      "Lyons said ICE is \"working with all of our other federal partners to try to gain intelligence, to locate these individuals that have been ordered deported by a judge or have been released from a sanctuary jurisdiction like we talked about. That is what ICE is using that data for.\"",
      "He cited the \"many\" so-called \"got-ways\" who entered the U.S. illegally without getting caught under the Biden administration and \"just totally disappeared off the grid.\"",
      "Lyons suggested ICE would use different datasets, including from the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services, to locate the \"worst of the worst\" and those ordered deported from the U.S.",

      "\"We have prayed for this day for almost a year. My brother is an innocent man who was used as a political pawn by the Maduro regime,\" Castaneda's family said in a statement. The family said he had suffered several traumatic brain injuries during his 18 years in the Navy that \"impaired his judgment and risk mitigation\" and \"led him to make a bad decision to travel to Venezuela.\"",
      "The U.S. has warned Americans against traveling to Venezuela or near its borders, citing the risks of wrongful detention.",
      "\"Until today, more Americans were wrongfully held in Venezuela than any other country in the world,\" Rubio said in a statement that credited \"President Trump's leadership and commitment to the American people.\"",
      "\"Every wrongfully detained American in Venezuela is now free and back in our homeland,\" Rubio added.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in Venezuela posted a photo of the freed Americans with U.S. diplomat John McNamara.",
      "As part of the deal, the Venezuelan government also released dozens of people who were described as Venezuelan political prisoners and detainees, a senior administration official said.",

      "The Trump administration deported more than 200 male Venezuelan citizens to El Salvador in March, accusing them of being part of the transnational gang Tren De Aragua. Mr. Trump invoked an 18th-century wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act, to order officials to quickly deport many of the Venezuelan migrants, deeming them a threat to the U.S. The Salvadoran government has held many of the detainees in a supermax prison called the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.",
      "In May, the Supreme Court extended a pause on deportations of Venezuelan migrants detained in northern Texas while they challenge their removals under the wartime law.",
      "Some of the families of the Venezuelan deportees have denied that they have gang connections, and a \"60 Minutes\" investigation in April found that most of the detainees did not have criminal convictions.",
      "The Venezuelan government confirmed Friday's swap, saying in a statement it \"has achieved the release of the 252 Venezuelan citizens who remained kidnapped and subjected to forced disappearance in a concentration camp, known as CECOT, in the Republic of El Salvador.\"",
      "Officials describe \"down-to-the-wire\" deal",
      "A senior administration official said the deal with El Salvador and Venezuela was \"essentially down to the wire.\" The flight carrying the detainees took off from Venezuela at around 3:40 p.m. ET and left Venezuelan airspace at around 3:55 p.m. The official alleged the Venezuelan government took \"one last stand\" by briefly delaying Friday's swap as a \"power flex.\"",
      "The prisoner swap was arranged as Venezuela faces intense U.S. sanctions that limit the country's once-lucrative oil industry, and came one day after the Trump administration imposed sanctions on six leaders and affiliates of Tren de Aragua.

    "summary": "The Justice Department on Friday formally asked a federal judge to unseal transcripts from grand jury proceedings involving convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department on Friday formally asked a federal judge to unseal transcripts from grand jury proceedings involving convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "The filing from federal prosecutors comes a day after President Trump said he asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of \"any and all pertinent grand jury testimony, subject to court approval.\" Bondi said the Justice Department would ask the federal court in Manhattan on Friday to make public the grand jury transcripts.",
      "The Justice Department filed a request to unseal grand jury transcripts related to Epstein's 2019 child sex trafficking charges in New York, which ended when Epstein died in custody later that year. It also petitioned for the release of grand jury transcripts in the case against Ghislaine Maxwell, who in 2021 was convicted of conspiring with Epstein, and said it will ask a South Florida court to release transcripts. Epstein was initially investigated by federal authorities in Florida in the 2000s, which ended in a federal non-prosecution agreement and a guilty plea on state prostitution charges.",
      "The judges overseeing the cases will be the final decision-makers as to whether and how much of the grand jury documents can be released. If the judges do grant the government's requests to unseal the material, it's unlikely to be immediately available, and it could be weeks or months before the records are unsealed. Federal rules typically require matters before a grand jury to be kept secret.",
      "In its filings Friday, the Justice Department said it will work to redact \"victim-related information and other personal identifying information.\" It argued the releases are justified \"as a matter of public interest.\"",
      "The White House has spent the past week dealing with the fallout from a Justice Department and FBI memo that concluded Epstein did not have a \"client list\" and confirmed that he died by suicide. The memo, which detailed the findings of a review of Epstein's case, also said there was no \"credible evidence\" that the disgraced financier blackmailed prominent people.",
      "The Justice Department and FBI wrote that they would not release any additional information about Epstein's case, and said the review did not uncover evidence that would lead to an investigation into uncharged third parties.",
      "In Friday's court petitions, the department said \"there has been extensive public interest in the basis for the Memorandum's conclusions,\" and \"transparency to the American public is of the utmost importance to this Administration.\"",
      "Transcripts of the grand jury proceedings likely do not constitute the entirety of the evidence that the FBI and Justice Department collected in their investigation into Epstein. A list released by the Justice Department in February shows investigators gathered financial records, travel logs, photographs, data from phones and computers, and blueprints of property Epstein owned. It's unknown how much of that underlying material was presented to the grand jury, and whether it would be included in a release.",
      "Thousands of pages of documents have already been made public through court records in other lawsuits and public records requests.",
      "The memo earlier this month sparked immense backlash against Mr. Trump and Bondi from his supporters, many of whom were skeptical of the Justice Department's claim that there was nothing else to be released. Bondi had pledged to release files related to Epstein and suggested in a February interview with Fox News that a \"client list\" was \"sitting on my desk right now to review.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later said Bondi was referring to \"all of the paper in relation to Jeffrey Epstein's crimes.\"",
      "Still, Laura Loomer, an ardent defender of Mr. Trump, called for Bondi to be fired, and even House Speaker Mike Johnson told a conservative podcaster that \"we should put everything out there and let the people decide.\" He later tried to downplay any division between him and the president.",
      "Mr. Trump has tried to blunt the outrage and claimed his backers have been duped by Democrats who deliberately stirred up the interest in Epstein.",
      "\"[A]ll these people want to talk about, with strong prodding by the Fake News and the success starved Dems, is the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax,\" the president wrote Wednesday on Truth Social. \"Let these weaklings continue forward and do the Democrats work, don't even think about talking of our incredible and unprecedented success, because I don't want their support anymore!\"",
      "But many of Mr. Trump's supporters, as well as administration officials like Vice President JD Vance, FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino, had suggested for years that Democrats were deliberately trying to conceal information about Epstein and his alleged list of clients.",
      "The Justice Department in February distributed binders to 15 right-wing social media influencers at the White House that were labeled \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1.\" But the influencers said they contained documents that were already in the public domain.",
      "Epstein was arrested in Florida in 2006 and pleaded guilty to two state prostitution charges in 2008. Then, in 2019, a federal grand jury indicted him on one count of sex trafficking of minors and one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors.",
      "Federal prosecutors alleged that Epstein sexually exploited and abused dozens of underage girls from 2002 through 2005, and worked with others who set up sexual encounters with victims at Epstein's residences in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "Epstein and Mr. Trump were friends for years, running in the same social circles in New York and Florida from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. On Thursday, the president lashed out at a story in the Wall Street Journal that chronicled the pair's relationship, which the president has said ended before Epstein's first arrest in 2006. The Journal reported that Mr. Trump signed a \"bawdy\" letter to Epstein in the early 2000s to mark his 50th birthday that said, in part, \"may every day be another wonderful secret.\" Mr. Trump called the letter \"fake\" and said he would sue the Journal, its parent company and media mogul Rupert Murdoch over the story.",
      "Epstein died by suicide while in custody at a Manhattan correctional facility while awaiting trial. The Justice Department's inspector general investigated Epstein's death and agreed with a medical examiner's determination that he died by suicide.",
      "Ghislaine Maxwell, an associate of Epstein's, was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. She is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Jul 2025 15:30:29 -0400",
    "summary": "Backers of the Genius Act, a potentially landmark bill that could help \"stablecoins\" go mainstream, say it would greatly speed electronic payments.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Friday is signing the Genius Act, the first major federal law governing cryptocurrencies.",
      "The law establishes federal regulations for \"stablecoins,\" which are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency because their value is pegged to fixed assets, like the dollar.",
      "The Genius Act passed in the House on Thursday by a 308-122 vote after being approved\u00a0in the Senate\u00a0last month with broad bipartisan support. The measure is part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.",
      "\"For the first time in history, Congress has passed bipartisan digital assets legislation through both the Senate and the House. The Genius Act marks a major milestone in securing America's leadership in payments innovation while protecting consumers and strengthening our national security,\" South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a statement Thursday following the bill's passage by Congress.",
      "The Genius Act, which is sponsored by Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, has two Democratic co-sponsors \u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland \u2014 and two Republican co-sponsors \u2014 South Carolina's Sen. Tim Scott and Wyoming's Sen. Cynthia Lummis.",
      "Here's what to know about stablecoin and how the Genius Act could affect its use.",
      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backed the passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What will the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) established guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",
      "The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "With the Genius Act passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get \"depegged\" from its underlying asset if that asset's value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity, according to S&P Global Ratings.",
      "In 2023, for example, the failure of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins \u2014 the USDC and DAI \u2014 to depeg.",
      "Stablecoins are also subject \"to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity,\" according to S&P Global.",
      "Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?",
      "As the Genius Act awaited approval from Congress, some of the nation's largest banks were already considering how they could integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.",
      "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, is already developing its digital currency capabilities in an attempt to expand revenue and attract clients, she added.",
      "\"We are closely monitoring developments in the legislative and regulatory space on coin issuance and evaluating how to best to support our clients' needs through our existing 24/7 products like [Citi Token Services], in addition to exploring options around issuing our own external token or coin and working with existing providers,\" Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships & innovation for Citi's Services business, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, also plans to use stablecoin, CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts in an earnings call on Tuesday.",
      "Outside of the banking world, companies like Walmart and Amazon are also exploring the idea of issuing their own stablecoins, Sam Mcingvale, head of product at blockchain technology company Optimism, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email on Tuesday.",
      "\"If new stablecoin legislation is passed, we expect it to open the floodgates even further,\" he said.",
      "What is Trump's position?",
      "Congress' approval of the Genius Act aligns with Mr. Trump's\u00a0commitment in March to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "At a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last year, Mr. Trump\u00a0also said\u00a0it would be his administration's policy to \"keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has taken other actions that point to his interest in cryptocurrency. In January, shortly before taking office, he and his wife Melania Trump launched their own meme coins, a highly volatile type of crypto whose value derives from their online popularity.",
      "The president on Tuesdy\u00a0posted\u00a0his support for the Genius Act on Truth Social.",
      "\"The Genius Act is going to put our Great Nation lightyears ahead of China, Europe and all others, who are trying endlessly to catch up, but they just can't do it,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "The price of bitcoin was up 1.40% on Thursday, rising to $120,584.80; etherium's price rose 3.41% to $3,486.86.",
      "Shares of Coinbase, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency exchange, rose 3.2% on Thursday, to close at $410.75.",

      "Trump administration's push to reopen Alcatraz",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Justice told CBS News that Bondi and Burgum were visiting Alcatraz to receive a briefing on the facility and the surrounding island. They were also directing staff to collaborate on the necessary planning to rehabilitate and reopen the facility, the spokesperson said.",
      "In an interview on Fox News, Bondi spoke about Alcatraz's potential to once again hold prisoners.",
      "\"Alcatraz could hold the worst of the worst. It could hold middle-class violent prisoners, it could hold illegal aliens, it could hold anything,\" said Bondi. \"This is a terrific facility, needs a lot of work, but no one has been known to escape from Alcatraz and survive.\"",
      "In May, Mr. Trump announced on his Truth Social platform that he was directing the Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Justice, the FBI, and Homeland Security to \"reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ, to house America's most ruthless and violent Offenders.\"",
      "Following the announcement, Bureau of Prisons Director William K. Marshall III said in a statement that his agency would \"vigorously pursue all avenues to support and implement the President's agenda\" and that he ordered \"an immediate assessment to determine our needs and the next steps.\"",
      "Alcatraz's history as federal penitentiary",
      "The former Army fortress and military prison was turned into a federal penitentiary in 1934 and housed the country's most infamous criminals, such as Al Capone and \"Machine Gun\" Kelly. However, most of the inmates were not notorious gangsters but prisoners who refused to conform to the rules of other federal institutions.",
      "The prison was said to be escape-proof because of the strong bay currents and cold waters surrounding it. The Bureau of Prisons says\u00a0of the 36 men involved in 14 separate escape attempts, 23 were caught, six were shot and killed during their escape, and two drowned, leaving five others as either successfully escaped or presumed drowned.",
      "The penitentiary was closed in 1963 due to the high operating costs and deteriorating facilities. In 1972, Alcatraz was designated part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area\u00a0under the National Park Service, and the following year it opened to the public as a historic site and tourist attraction. The site\u00a0has undergone multiple restoration efforts to improve visitor facilities and preserve historic structures and natural habitats around the island.",
      "Alcatraz a money-maker for federal government, San Francisco",
      "Alcatraz currently receives about 1.6 million visitors from around the world every year, according to the Park Service. Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi lambasted the Trump administration's plans\u00a0to reopen Alcatraz as a prison, which would put an end to the approximately $60 million in annual revenue that tourism brings to the National Park Service. The city of San Francisco benefits indirectly through spending at hotels, restaurants, shops, and local tourism businesses.",
      "\"With stiff competition, the planned announcement to reopen Alcatraz as a federal penitentiary is the Trump Administration's stupidest initiative yet,\" said Pelosi in a prepared statement. \"It should concern us all that clearly the only intellectual resources the Administration has drawn upon for this foolish notion are decades-old fictional Hollywood movies.\"",
      "San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie had no plans to meet with either Bondi or Burgum, according to his office. He issued a statement criticizing the Trump administration's plans for Alcatraz.",
      "\"There's no realistic plan to make Alcatraz reopen as anything other than the wonderful tourist attraction that it currently is,\" Lurie said. \"If the federal government wants to spend billions of dollars, I want them to spend it on clean and safe streets and San Francisco's economic recovery. Alcatraz draws millions of visitors a year, tens of millions of dollars in economic activity, and that is benefiting San Francisco's recovery. We're on the rise and that's what I'm focused on.\"",
      "It's estimated that reopening Alcatraz as a prison would cost hundreds of millions of dollars upfront and up to $100 million a year in operating costs. When the penitentiary was closed in 1963, the annual operating costs were more than three times that of any other federal prison, according to the Bureau of Prisons.",

    "story": [
      "An ongoing purge of federal prosecutors from the Justice Department has impacted the criminal case against a Florida businessman accused of fleecing children with special needs.",
      "The latest wave of firings included the prosecutor who was helping lead the criminal case against\u00a0Leo Govoni, whose scheme allegedly bilked approximately $100 million from a fund to help people with disabilities. Michael Gordon, who also handled a series of U.S. Capitol riot prosecutions, was among several prosecutors fired in recent weeks, CBS News has learned. Gordon had recently taken over formal duties for prosecuting Govoni's case in Florida.",
      "Critics have accused the Trump administration of seeking political retribution for the U.S. Capitol insurrection cases by firing prosecutors, investigators and at least one administrator who worked on the cases. The Justice Department also fired investigators and prosecutors who helped former Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigation of President Trump's alleged mishandling of classified records and efforts to overturn the 2020 election.",
      "More than 20 total firings have been confirmed by CBS News. The Justice Department has not commented on the firings.",
      "Gordon's dismissal risks complicating the timeline for the Govoni case. Rep. Kathy Castor, a Florida Democrat, is urging the Justice Department to reverse course and rehire Gordon.",
      "Castor said in a statement, \"The victims of Govoni's alleged fraud number in the thousands\u2014each with painful and personal stories. Mr. Gordon's removal places this case, and their hope for accountability, in jeopardy.\"",
      "Govoni is accused of being part of a scheme to embezzle money from an organization that was established to help manage money for people with special needs. The Justice Department said earlier this year,\u00a0 \"The defendants conspired to use the funds of special needs clients as a personal piggy bank, stealing $100 million dollars meant for the most vulnerable members of our society to enrich themselves.\"",
      "Amparo Perales, a mother whose son Javier has needed care for cortical blindness and severe encephalitis, said her family lost $2 million in the scheme. Perales told CBS News she was \"shocked\" by Gordon's firing.",
      "\"These victims already have difficult lives and futures. A delay in the legal process is detrimental to the well being of the victims,\" Perales said.",
      "Rebekah Bowman of Florida, whose son, Kienen Freeman, suffers from a severe seizure disorder, said she lost more than $1 million in funds for her son because of Govoni's alleged scheme.",
      "\"It took long enough to get him arrested. People have been through a lot and don't want any more delays,\" Bowman said.",
      "Govoni was charged with conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud, money laundering conspiracy and multiple counts of fraud. He has not yet entered a plea, and an arraignment is scheduled for Thursday. Govoni's lawyers asked for him to be released pre-trial, noting he has \"no prior criminal history\" and describing him as a \"67-year-old in poor physical health.\" CBS News has reached out to his attorney for comment.",
      "An accountant for Govoni's company was also charged as part of the alleged conspiracy, and a not-guilty plea was entered in his case.",
      "Prosecutors said Govoni founded the Center for Special Needs Trust Administration in 2000 and helped manage approximately $200 million in funds and more than 2,000 special needs trusts.",
      "Prosecutors alleged Govoni used the organization's accounts as a \"slush fund.\" Federal investigators said Govoni used the money to \"purchase real estate, travel via private jet, fund a brewery, make deposits into his personal bank accounts, and pay personal debts.\"",
      "In a series of letters filed with the federal court in Tampa last month, one parent of a person with special needs wrote, \"I wish you could look into the eyes of my son and the many other medically needy victims and tell them that you're going to do the right thing and keep that man behind bars where he belongs.\"",
      "Another parent wrote, \"Please do not let this horrible criminal out of jail. He is clever and surely has money hidden and plans to go into hiding if released. All his victims have breathed a sigh of relief when we heard he was finally arrested. The first relief any of us have felt since this has happened.\"",
      "Another victim wrote, \"Who steals from victimized children in foster care? The disabled? The most vulnerable amongst us? Someone who has no conscience, compassion, or mercy.\"",
      "Gordon is listed in court records as a Tampa-based prosecutor for the Justice Department. Like many federal prosecutors, he brought cases related to the Jan. 6 riots \u2014 which was the largest criminal investigation in U.S. history, with more than 1,500 defendants. Hours after Mr. Trump returned to office in January, he pardoned almost everybody convicted in the riot and ordered the Justice Department to drop charges against any remaining defendants.",
      "Gordon had a role in prosecuting one of the best-known Jan. 6 defendants, Ray Epps, who was at the center of conspiracy theories claiming \u2014 without any evidence \u2014 he was a government-planted agitator. Epps pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct on restricted grounds and was sentenced to probation.",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment on Gordon's firing and its possible impact on Govoni's prosecution. Gordon did not offer a comment to CBS News.",
      "Many of the prosecutors who were fired were identified by a \"weaponization working group\" set up by the Trump administration to review Biden-era law enforcement policies, CBS News previously reported. Other prosecutors who handled Jan. 6 cases resigned their posts with the Justice Department, ahead of the recent firings.",
      "Greg Rosen, who was the chief of the agency's Capitol Siege section, departed last month. In a June 3 interview with CBS News, Rosen criticized the initial wave of firings.",
      "\"To see those talented prosecutors be marginalized or removed from office is an affront to the independence of the department,\" Rosen said.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Jul 2025 10:03:30 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump late Thursday ordered the Justice Department to seek the release of grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump late Thursday ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein\u00a0as his administration faces pressure to disclose more details on the late sex offender.",
      "\"Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. \"This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!\"",
      "Bondi wrote in a post on X minutes later, \"we are ready to move the court tomorrow to unseal the grand jury transcripts.\"",
      "A judge will need to make the final decision on whether material can be released, which could take some time and is unlikely to be immediate.",
      "It's unclear what material the Trump administration will ask to be released. It's not clear how much of the Epstein-related material in the government's possession is grand jury testimony.",
      "Epstein was investigated by federal authorities in Florida in the 2000s, which ended in a non-prosecution agreement and a guilty plea on state prostitution charges, and he was later charged with child sex trafficking in Manhattan in 2019. The government also secured a conviction against Epstein's co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell. It investigated the circumstances of Epstein's death in federal custody, which was deemed a suicide.",
      "The order from Mr. Trump comes after the Justice Department and FBI released a memo stating that Epstein did not have an incriminating \"client list,\" did not try to blackmail any prominent figures, and died by suicide. The memo drew backlash from across the political spectrum, including from some fervent Trump backers, in part because Bondi and other administration figures had promised to release information on Epstein.",
      "The government is generally required to keep grand jury materials secret, and it's common for not all material that is shown to a grand jury \u2014 which meets before a person is criminally indicted \u2014 to emerge during a criminal case.",
      "A request of this kind by the government is unusual, says Mitchell Epner, a partner at the New York law firm Kudman Trachten Aloe Posner, and a former federal prosecutor.",
      "\"I've been in and around federal criminal cases for over 30 years. I've never heard of this before,\" he told CBS News.",
      "While the scope of the government's request is still unknown, Epner says it could encompass an \"enormous quantity of data.\" Mr. Trump said the government would seek the release of grand jury testimony, which Epner noted may include exhibits that witnesses testified about before a grand jury.",
      "\"I would not bet against there being anything, from the most interesting thing in the world to the least interesting thing in the world, in that material,\" said Epner, who told CBS News he believes calls for more information to be disclosed in the Epstein case are warranted.",
      "Epner joked: \"If we were to find out the location of the corpse of Jimmy Hoffa, I would not be surprised.\"",
      "Material likely will not be released immediately, according to Epner, who said, \"weeks would be moving very quickly, months is likely.\" Under court rules, grand jury material is typically only released under certain circumstances, often when it's needed for some other investigation. The government's grounds for release in this case aren't clear.",
      "In this case, both associates and alleged victims of Epstein's may oppose some disclosures.",
      "\"I would not be surprised if a number of people came forward under pseudonyms to object to the release of grand jury material related to them,\" Epner said. \"I also would not be surprised if some of the victims\u2026came forward and said, 'Yes, we do want things to be revealed.'\"",
      "Trump administration faces Epstein fallout",
      "Last week's memo on Epstein reignited years of questions \u2014 and conspiracy theories \u2014 on the disgraced financier, including speculation about the circumstances of Epstein's death in custody, and about whether the federal government was concealing information to shield some of Epstein's famous friends.",
      "Bondi had pledged to release files related to Epstein, and suggested in a Fox News interview in February a \"client list\" was \"sitting on my desk right now to review.\" (She later said she meant generally that material on Epstein was sitting on her desk.)",
      "In late February, the Justice Department distributed binders to over a dozen right-wing social media influencers labeled \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1,\" though the influencers later said many of the materials were already in the public domain.",
      "Some Republicans and vocal Trump supporters were dissatisfied with last week's memo, in some cases calling for more disclosures or the appointment of a special prosecutor to look into the Epstein case \u2014 which White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president does not support.",
      "Mr. Trump, for his part, has scolded some Republicans for buying into what he called the \"the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax,\" calling them \"stupid people\" and \"weaklings\" who are \"do[ing] the Democrats work.\"",
      "Shortly before pushing for the release of grand jury testimony, the president on Thursday denied a Wall Street Journal report on what the newspaper described as a \"bawdy\" birthday letter to Epstein \u2014 featuring a drawing of a nude woman \u2014 that the paper claimed was signed by Mr. Trump in the early 2000s. Mr. Trump and Epstein had crossed paths for years, though Mr. Trump says they had a \"falling out.\"",
      "Mr. Trump called the letter a \"FAKE\" and threatened to sue the Journal, as well as its parent company News Corp and leader Rupert Murdoch.",
      "\"These are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don't draw pictures,\" he said.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Jul 2025 06:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump has said he wants a \"simple redrawing\" of Texas' congressional map where Republicans pick up five seats.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Texas Legislature is set to convene Monday for a special session where it will attempt to redraw the state's congressional map to boost President Trump and his allies' efforts to maintain the GOP's grip on the U.S. House in next year's midterm elections.",
      "The state's decision to recraft the boundaries of House districts comes midway through the decade and several years after its GOP-controlled Legislature adopted a redistricting plan in the wake of the 2020 Census.",
      "Under that plan, Republicans hold 25 of the state's 38 congressional seats, while Democrats control 12. (The death of Rep. Sylvester Turner, a Democrat, has left one seat open.)",
      "But with Republicans holding a razor-thin majority in the House, and the risk the GOP could lose control of the chamber in the 2026 midterms, a reshaping of the congressional districts could give Mr. Trump's party an edge heading into next year's elections.",
      "Mr. Trump's political team had been pushing Texas GOP leaders to look into redrawing the state's congressional map, The New York Times reported last month. Gov. Greg Abbott confirmed the Legislature would undertake the effort, among 17 other agenda items, when it meets.",
      "\"I don't think this has anything to do with Texas \u2014 this has to do with Trump,\" said Joshua Blank, the research director of the Texas Politics Project. \"This has nothing to do with the internal dynamics of the state, the political trajectory of the state. This is purely about this election cycle and one person's benefit.\"",
      "How did we get here?",
      "States undergo the redistricting process after every 10-year census, when voting lines are redrawn to account for population changes. After the 2020 Census, Texas crafted a new congressional map to include two new districts, bringing its total number of House seats to 38.",
      "The maps drawn by the GOP-led Texas Legislature aimed to protect Republican seats in Congress and the statehouse. Democrats flipped two congressional districts and 12 state House seats in the 2018 midterms.",
      "\"In 2021, they spent a lot of time and effort making sure they had the best maps possible with the primary goal to ensure that the Republican majority was rock solid,\" said Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University. \"And they created 24 of 38 districts where there is no way, shape or form that a Republican is losing those districts, absent some type of murder indictment or a serial adulterer, etc.\"",
      "But the final version of the congressional map was met with criticism, and it has been challenged in court. Among the issues raised by voting rights groups is that 95% of Texas' growth has been driven by non-White voters, but the map crafted in 2021 created more majority-White districts.",
      "A three-judge panel in El Paso is currently considering a consolidated challenge to the map brought by voting rights groups, Latino voters and lawmakers. The plaintiffs argue that the new lines violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. A trial ended in June.",
      "Texas has a part-time Legislature, which meets for 140 days every two years. The governor has the power to call special sessions to cover specific topics, and the special sessions constitutionally cannot last longer than 30 days. The governor can, however, call as many special sessions as he deems necessary. After the 88th legislative session in 2023, Abbott called four special sessions that stretched into December.",
      "Redistricting is one of 18 topics that Abbott has asked the Legislature to address. Four of those topics include disaster relief for the Central Texas floods and improving the state's warning system.",
      "\"I'm not convinced that the goal is to pass everything, but ultimately, Abbott gets the credit for trying, and the Legislature will get the credit for what it can accomplish, but it'll also get the blame for what it fails to do,\" Blank said.",
      "Although the Democrats could leave the state to deny Republicans a quorum, like they did in 2021 to protest a voting bill, it's unlikely they would do so if it meant holding up flood relief.",
      "Where does Trump and his administration come into play?",
      "Texas has conducted two congressional elections under the 2021 map. But earlier this month, the Justice Department sent Abbott a letter alleging that some of the districts were racial gerrymanders that violate the Constitution's 14th Amendment.",
      "Harmeet Dhillon, who heads the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, specifically pinpointed four districts \u2014 the 9th, 18th, 29th and 33rd \u2014 that she said constitute \"coalition districts\" that should be redrawn. All three are currently represented by Democrats, and Turner, who died in March, represented the fourth.",
      "Coalition districts are those that bring two or more racial minorities together to make up a majority of the population, and where voters from these groups vote together to elect their preferred candidate.",
      "In her letter, Dhillon wrote that the state had to \"immediately\" rectify the alleged racial gerrymanders, and if it chose not to, it was at risk of legal action by the attorney general.",
      "\"The congressional districts at issue are nothing more than vestiges of an unconstitutional racially based gerrymandering past, which must be abandoned, and must now be corrected by Texas,\" she wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump appears to be on board with the recrafting of Texas' voting boundaries. Before leaving the White House on Tuesday, the president said he is looking for a \"simple redrawing\" where Republicans pick up five seats.",
      "\"Texas would be the biggest one,\" he said.",
      "But during the trial in the case involving the congressional map, state officials repeatedly said they were motivated not by race when they drew the district lines, but instead driven by politics. State Sen. Joan Huffman, a Republican who led the 2021 Senate Redistricting Committee, testified that the congressional map was \"drawn blind to race\" and \"racial data was not considered at all during the drawing of the maps,\" according to court records.",
      "\"There is no legal justification for doing this. It sort of walks and talks and quacks like a political move,\" said Michael Li, a redistricting expert at New York University's Brennan Center for Justice. \"The problem is that it's really difficult to get more seats in Texas without heavily undermining the political power of communities of color.\"",
      "In claims of racial gerrymandering, those challenging a map have to show that race predominated for how the lines were drawn.",
      "\"This can't be a racial gerrymander if they didn't consider race,\" Li said. \"This is a textbook, easy it's-not-a-racial-gerrymander. \u2026 If you didn't consider race, it can't be a racial gerrymander.\"",
      "Has Texas drawn new maps in the middle of the decade before?",
      "A divided Texas Legislature drew up a congressional map in 2001, but two years later, in a plan engineered by then-U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay and Texas House Speaker Tom Craddick, Republicans wanted to redraw the lines to make the most of the growing GOP majority in the state.",
      "Fifty-one Democrats in the state House fled to Oklahoma for four days, denying the Republicans the quorum they needed to bring the redistricting plan to the floor and letting the clock run out on the regular session. Then-Gov. Rick Perry called the Legislature back for a special session, but state Senate Democrats left the state to deny a quorum.",
      "Although the Democrats remained out of state for more than a month, they couldn't stop the maps from eventually passing, and Republicans ultimately picked up five seats. The Supreme Court upheld the congressional districts in 2018.",
      "But former Democratic Rep. Mark Strama, who ran for office after that round of redistricting, warned the effort did have some downsides for Republicans. The drama was covered nationally, and Strama himself flipped a Central Texas district in 2005.",
      "\"Voters were mad at both sides,\" Strama said. \"They hate all these political shenanigans. But there's no question voters hate this.\"",
      "While Texas has redrawn the lines of congressional districts in the middle of a decade before, Li said the current situation is far from normal.",
      "\"Outside of litigation, it is extremely rare,\" he said. \"And it's exceptionally rare \u2014 in fact, I can't think of another circumstance, where a party drew the map, and then that same party redrew the map. Where there are mid-decade redistrictings, it's usually because political control changes hands.\"",
      "Could this plan backfire?",
      "While Democrats have not won statewide office in Texas since 1994, the best year Democrats have had at the ballot in the past two decades was in 2018. In that midterm election, former Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke came within three points of GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, and Democrats flipped two congressional seats and 12 state House seats.",
      "Republicans have managed to quell those gains and, as Jones noted, the 2024 election was a high point for the party. But the dynamics of the 2026 election could mirror those in 2018, when Democrats ran aggressive campaigns targeting Mr. Trump and retook the House. Any changes to the congressional map might not be enough to stem Democratic gains this time around.",
      "\"If Republicans do engage, do go all out and try with the goal of flipping, say three, four, even five seats as President Trump says \u2014 it's far more likely Republicans see a net loss than a net gain,\" Jones said.",
      "Plus, any map adopted by the GOP-led Legislature and approved by Abbott is likely to be swiftly met with lawsuits. If a federal court blocks its use, the new district lines may not even be in place for the 2026 midterms.",
      "\"President Trump is talking about five more seats out of Texas, and the only way you get five more seats out of Texas is if you seriously undermine the political power and the political voice of communities of color,\" Li said. \"And that is a Texas-sized lawsuit with potentially huge ramifications.\"",
      "Li said the redrawing of political bounds to give Republicans a leg up in the 2026 midterm elections is not only a legally risky move, but could be politically perilous too.",
      "\"The essence of trying to get more seats is that you have to spread your voters out more if you're a Republican,\" he said. \"So you have a bunch more districts that you're not winning by 65 or 70%. You're going to have a bunch of districts that you're winning by 52, 53% and in a state that is changing as fast as Texas, that's growing as fast as Texas, that's changing demographically as fast as Texas. By 2030, these districts could look and perform very differently.\"",
      "The 2020 Census showed that people of color accounted for 95% of Texas' population growth over the prior decade. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau released last year also showed that the number of Asian Americans in Texas grew by nearly 92,000 people, while there were more than 91,000 new Black residents in the state.",
      "\"When you gerrymander, you're making a bet that you know what the politics of the future will look like,\" Li said. \"There are many places where you can safely bet on what the politics of the future will look like in the country. Texas is not one of those places. It's just changing too fast.\"",
      "Republicans have made big gains in South Texas' Rio Grande Valley, once considered a Democratic stronghold. But even with those GOP gains \u2014 and running on the maps drawn in 2021\u00a0 \u2014 two of the three seats remained Democratic in 2024.",
      "\"People talk about the Rio Grande Valley as if it's somehow indicative of Texas,\" said Blank of the Texas Politics Project. \"It's less than 3.5% of the total statewide vote, and it's incredibly economically depressed and it's overwhelmingly Hispanic. It's not really indicative of any part of the state, it's indicative of its region of the country that happens to share a border with Mexico.\"",
      "What can Democrats do?",
      "Democrats on Capitol Hill and in the states have lambasted Republicans for pushing to redraw congressional district lines to hold onto power in the House.",
      "\"Elected officials should earn the support of voters they hope to represent,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters Tuesday. \"Republicans want a country where politicians choose their voters, not the other way around. It reeks of desperation, and we're going to do everything that we can in Texas and beyond to respond.\"",
      "Jeffries said the reason for the special session in Texas is to \"try to steal the midterm elections by rigging\" the state's congressional map.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, meanwhile, has suggested that Democrats mount their own partisan gerrymander. California has 52 congressional districts, and Democrats represent 43 of them.",
      "\"There are *currently* 9 Republicans in the California Congressional Delegation. Just thought folks might like to know that fun fact,\" he wrote on X\u00a0on Tuesday.",
      "During an appearance on the podcast \"Pod Save America,\" Newsom accused Republicans of trying to \"rig the game\" because they're concerned about maintaining control of the House next year.",
      "California voters approved a constitutional amendment in 2010 that handed over the task of crafting congressional and state legislative districts to an independent commission. But Newsom suggested there are still two paths that could lead to a new congressional map: calling a special session of the California Legislature to put a measure on the ballot for a special election that would clear the way for new House district lines; or having the state Legislature create a new map under the idea that it's coming mid-decade and not after the census.",
      "\"It ups the stakes of the redistricting war, with the acknowledgment that Democrats have a limited hand to play,\" Li said of Texas' decision to draw new congressional lines.",
      "Just 15 states have Democratic trifectas, where they control the state legislature and the governorship. Two of those states, Colorado and Michigan, leave the drawing of political voting lines to independent commissions like California does. Republicans are in full control in 23 states.",
      "Plus, in other states where Democrats control the legislature and governor's mansions, the congressional delegations already heavily skew Democratic. In Illinois, for example, Democrats hold 14 of its 17 House seats. Maryland's eight-member congressional delegation contains just one Republican.",

      "The bill targets roughly $8 billion for foreign assistance programs, including the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID. The package also includes about $1 billion in funding cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports public radio and television stations, including NPR and PBS.",

      "\"REPUBLICANS HAVE TRIED DOING THIS FOR 40 YEARS, AND FAILED\u2026.BUT NO MORE,\" he wrote. \"THIS IS BIG!!!\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters early Friday he's \"delighted to send that over to the president's desk for signature, and he'll sign that quickly.\"",
      "Before the floor vote, the package had to get through the House Rules Committee, where there was heated debate on Democrats' demands for a vote on an Epstein-related measure. All but one Republican on the committee voted against similar amendments when they were first presented earlier this week, further fueling criticism from those who want documents on Epstein released.",
      "The controversy has divided Mr. Trump's base since his administration\u00a0released a memo earlier this month saying that Epstein had no \"client list\" and died by suicide in 2019. Some Republicans have pushed for more disclosures in the Epstein case, though Mr. Trump has\u00a0called the controversy a \"hoax.\"",

      "\"There's no daylight between the president and House Republicans on transparency, and he's been very clear that he wants all credible information, credible evidence, to be turned over to the people, so that the people can decide. We trust the American people and their judgment.\"",
      "Democrats wanted a vote on a bipartisan measure introduced by Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California that would force the Justice Department to release Epstein-related files within 30 days.",
      "Instead, Republicans voted against the effort and offered a resolution that carries no legal weight to make the files public.",
      "Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the House Rules Committee, noted that there would be no recourse if the Trump administration did not comply with the non-binding resolution.",
      "\"This resolution they're offering is a cover vote and I'll be surprised if they even bring it to the floor,\" McGovern said.",
      "Republican Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, the committee chair, said it would be up to the majority leader whether the resolution receives a floor vote.",
      "As the committee debated the release of the files, Mr. Trump announced that he asked Attorney General Pam Bondi \"to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval.\" The request came after the Wall Street Journal published a letter Mr. Trump allegedly wrote to Epstein for his birthday in 2003, which the president called \"fake.\"",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries would not say Thursday afternoon whether he planned to delay a final vote past the deadline by exercising his right under House rules to speak for as long as he'd like, a power he used to make a record-breaking speech earlier this month.",
      "\"I expect that I will speak longer than a minute,\" the New York Democrat quipped.",
      "Jeffries ended up speaking for about 15 minutes.",
      "Senate passed bill early Thursday after criticism",
      "After an hourslong vote series, the Senate narrowly passed an amended version of Mr. Trump's rescissions request earlier Thursday, sending it to the House, which approved a larger package of cuts last month.",
      "The Senate version is about $400 million smaller than last month's House version, after the Trump administration agreed not to cut funding for a global AIDS prevention program to alleviate some of the concerns of Republican dissenters.",
      "Some senators also worried about the implications of PBS and NPR cuts for rural areas, where many residents depend on public radio stations for emergency alerts. The administration promised to find funding elsewhere to alleviate the cuts to the rural stations to win over critics.",
      "In a statement, the president of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting said the decision to eliminate its federal funding will force many local public radio stations to shut down and have \"profound, lasting, negative consequences for every American.\"",
      "Though all but two Republican senators ended up supporting final passage, some said they had reservations about doing so, especially because they had not received details from the administration about how the broader cuts would impact specific programs.",
      "\"I suspect we're going to find out there are some things that we're going to regret,\" Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said Wednesday before voting for the package.",
      "Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska both criticized Congress, saying it was undermining its budget oversight role by ceding to the White House's, and arguing that any funding cuts should be sorted out during the annual appropriations process.

    "summary": "President Trump floated the idea of firing Jerome Powell \u2014 whom he first appointed Federal Reserve chair \u2014 earlier this week, after years of on-and-off criticism over interest rates.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump asked about the idea of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in a meeting with lawmakers this week, CBS News has reported, a legally untested move that follows years of on-and-off criticism of the Fed leader leveled by Mr. Trump.",
      "The president's gripes with his handpicked Fed chair \u2014 whom he has called a \"numbskull,\" a \"Trump Hater\" and a \"stubborn mule\" \u2014 have largely focused on the central bank's decision to keep interest rates relatively high so far this year, part of an inflation-fighting campaign. Mr. Trump has also taken aim at Powell's handling of a Federal Reserve office renovation project.",
      "Mr. Trump asked a group of House Republicans if he should fire Powell during a Tuesday night Oval Office meeting, sources told CBS News earlier this week. The president told reporters a day later it's \"highly unlikely\" he'll fire Powell, though he confirmed he spoke to lawmakers about \"the concept of firing him,\" and \"almost all of them said I should.\"",
      "Who is Jerome Powell, and who appointed him?",
      "Powell is the chair of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors.",
      "Powell was first nominated as Fed chair by Mr. Trump during his first term, replacing Obama appointee Janet Yellen, and the Senate confirmed him in an 84-13 vote. Former President Joe Biden nominated him to a second term, keeping him in office until May 2026.",
      "\"He's strong, he's committed, he's smart,\" Mr. Trump said in a speech announcing his decision to nominate Powell in 2017, praising Powell's reputation as a \"consensus-builder.\"",
      "Last month, though, Mr. Trump said he initially nominated Powell because he \"listened to someone that I shouldn't have listened to, and Biden shouldn't have reappointed him.\"",
      "Before becoming chair, Powell had served on the central bank's Board of Governors since 2012, when he was initially nominated by former President Barack Obama.",
      "Powell has switched between government and private-sector jobs for much of his career. He worked in investment banking in the 1980s and 1990s, interrupted by a stint as former President George H.W. Bush's undersecretary of the Treasury. For almost 20 years starting in the 1990s, he was a partner at the Carlyle Group investment firm, according to his Fed biography.",
      "A Georgetown-educated lawyer, Powell does not have a Ph.D. in economics, unlike some other former Fed chairs.",
      "Does Jerome Powell have a designated term length?",
      "Federal Reserve chairs serve for four-year terms, so Powell's stint as chair will end in May 2026.",
      "Members of the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors, however, serve for 14 years, and Powell's term as a board member ends in January 2028. Yellen resigned from the board after her term as Fed chair ended, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has encouraged Powell to follow suit, though Powell's plans are unclear.",
      "The chair and board members are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "What does the Federal Reserve do?",
      "The Federal Reserve is the United States' central bank. Made up of 12 regional Federal Reserve banks and a D.C.-based Board of Governors, its responsibilities include regulating the U.S. banking system, serving as a \"lender of last resort\" to banks and running an instant payment system.",
      "But one of the Federal Reserve's highest-profile responsibilities is its role in setting monetary policy. Through its 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, which includes Powell, the Fed works independently of elected officials to influence the supply of money in the U.S. economy and the interest rates at which it's lent out, with an eye toward keeping unemployment low and prices stable.",
      "Those two goals \u2014 maximizing employment and minimizing inflation \u2014 are known as the Fed's \"dual mandate.\" But they're in conflict with each other. If the Fed lowers interest rates, it can boost economic growth, but it also runs the risk of overheating the economy and pushing up inflation. And if interest rates are hiked, inflation tends to cool off, but the economy slows down.",
      "The interest rate that the Fed targets is called the Federal Funds Rate, which is what banks charge to lend money to each other overnight. But other interest rates \u2014 from mortgage rates to yields for U.S. government bonds \u2014 tend to follow closely with the Federal Funds Rate, so the Fed's decisions impact borrowing costs for average American consumers and businesses.",
      "Picking the right balance isn't easy, and the Fed often faces criticism for its choices.",
      "Under Powell, the Fed dropped its target interest rate to near 0% at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, with the goal of averting an economic catastrophe. But after the economy recovered and inflation soared, the central bank in 2023 hiked interest rates to their highest point in decades, aiming to get inflation under control. The Fed has taken a cautious path since then, cutting rates slightly last year as inflation fell but keeping them steady so far this year.",
      "Last month, the Fed's rate-setting committee said it may cut rates later this year, but there are concerns that inflation \u2014 which is still above the Fed's 2%-per-year target \u2014 could worsen. Powell has also suggested the Fed is concerned Mr. Trump's tariffs could increase inflation.",
      "\"For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,\" Powell said last month.",
      "Why is Trump unhappy with the Fed and Jerome Powell?",
      "Mr. Trump is unhappy with the Fed's decision to leave rates stable. For months, the president has pushed the central bank to slash rates immediately, calling Powell \"Mr. Too Late.\"",
      "The president argued last month that inflation is already low enough to start cutting rates.",
      "\"If he was concerned about Inflation or anything else, then all he has to do is bring the Rate down, so we can benefit on Interest Costs, and raise it in the future when and if these 'other elements' happen (which I doubt they will!),\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "He's not the first president to criticize the Fed for high interest rates, which make everything from car loans to mortgages more expensive and can put a damper on the economic growth that tends to make or break presidents' popularity. But Mr. Trump has been unusually vocal.",
      "In a mid-June post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump called Powell a \"Total and Complete Moron\" and urged the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee to \"override\" him. While Powell is just one of 12 votes on the committee, the chair traditionally has an outsize role in its decisions. The last few decisions to leave interest rates stable have been unanimous.",
      "Mr. Trump had similar issues with Powell during his first term, saying during an earlier interest rate-hiking campaign in 2018 that he was \"not even a little bit happy with my selection\" of Powell. When the Fed cut rates in 2020, Mr. Trump called Powell his \"most improved player.\"",
      "Meanwhile, members of the Trump administration have pressured Powell over a yearslong renovation to the Fed's headquarters complex. In a letter to the central banker, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought called some of the features \"ostentatious,\" and alleged that Powell may have misled Congress about the project's scope or made changes to the plans without getting permission from the right federal bodies.",
      "Mr. Trump has also criticized Powell over the renovations. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he's \"highly unlikely\" to fire Powell \"unless he has to leave for fraud.\" At other points, Mr. Trump has suggested Powell should resign over the project.",
      "Powell said last year he would not resign as chair if asked to do so.",
      "Powell defended the Fed's handling of the project in a letter to Vought and denied allegations that it was overly lavish, saying the Fed has \"taken great care to ensure the project is carefully overseen.\" He also said the project has been \"subject to budget approval\" by board members annually. Powell added the Fed has only \"made a small number of design changes to scale back or eliminate certain elements,\" so no further government review is needed.",
      "The Fed typically operates with a high degree of independence over its own budget, and legally has the power to buy and remodel office spaces in Washington, D.C., as it sees fit.",
      "Is the Fed independent from the rest of the government? And can Trump fire Powell?",
      "The structure of the Fed \u2014 with board members and chairs who serve across multiple administrations \u2014 allows it to make decisions without direct input from politicians.",
      "Whether the president can fire Powell before his term ends is legally untested. Federal law says members of the Federal Reserve board can only be removed by the president before their terms end \"for cause,\" and the Supreme Court found in 1935 that Congress is allowed to limit the grounds on which the president can fire members of independent federal boards.",
      "In May, the high court did allow Mr. Trump to fire members of federal labor boards, but it exempted the Federal Reserve, which it called a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "Any attempt to fire Powell before his term ends could also roil financial markets, analysts and lawmakers from both parties have warned. Mr. Trump acknowledged this risk Wednesday, telling Just The News in an interview, \"They say it would disrupt the market if I did.\"",
      "At some points in the Federal Reserve's 112-year history, including during World War II, the central bank has been more beholden to the needs of the Treasury. But the Fed has operated more independently since 1951, when a public disagreement between the Fed and the Truman administration led the Treasury to agree to let the central bank set interest rates on its own.",
      "There's nothing preventing the president from publicly expressing his views about the Fed, though, as several of Mr. Trump's predecessors have. During his campaign last year, Mr. Trump said he should have \"at least [a] say\" in the moves made by the central bank.",
      "\"In my case, I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve, or the chairman,\" Mr. Trump said in an August 2024 press briefing.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in April that Mr. Trump \"has the right to express his displeasure with the Fed, and he has the right to say he believes interest rates should be lower.\"",

    "summary": "States allege the Trump administration illegally ended FEMA's BRIC program, halting billions in disaster mitigation funding and putting storm-prone communities at risk.",
    "story": [
      "A group of 20 states sued the Trump administration on Wednesday seeking to block what they say was an illegal termination of a program that provided federal funding for natural disaster mitigation projects.",
      "\"By unilaterally shutting down FEMA's flagship pre-disaster mitigation program, Defendants have acted unlawfully and violated core separation of power principles,\" the lawsuit alleges, arguing that the executive branch doesn't have the authority to shut down the program funded by Congress.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts, targets Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and acting Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator David Richardson for their role in shutting down FEMA's Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, also known as BRIC, program earlier this year. The lawsuit argues the power to make such a decision falls to Congress.",
      "Before it was halted in April, the BRIC program helped fund local infrastructure projects like stormwater control systems and relocating or elevating buildings in flood-prone areas.",
      "\"Projects that have been in development for years, and in which communities have invested millions of dollars for planning, permitting, and environmental review are now threatened,\" the lawsuit states. \"And in the meantime, Americans across the country face a higher risk of harm from natural disasters.\"",
      "A CBS News investigation last month revealed that the recent BRIC funding cuts have disproportionately affected counties that supported Mr. Trump in the 2024 election. Two-thirds of the counties losing funding voted for Mr. Trump. The elimination of the BRIC program will especially deprive vulnerable communities across the Southeast, the CBS News data analysis found.",
      "The lawsuit calls the impact of the BRIC program's shutdown \"devastating\" and says it will force communities across the country to delay, scale back or cancel hundreds of mitigation projects because of their inability to access their already-approved federal dollars.",
      "Alongside the lawsuit, the states also filed a request for a preliminary injunction asking the court to temporarily block the federal government from reallocating FEMA funds designated for disaster preparedness, arguing states will suffer irreversible damage if the funds are spent before the court rules.",
      "In an April press release announcing the cuts, which has since been removed from the FEMA website, the disaster response agency said the BRIC program was \"wasteful\" and had become more concerned with \"political agendas than helping Americans recover from natural disasters.\"",
      "The multibillion-dollar BRIC program was established in 2018 under the first Trump administration.",
      "\"Resiliency is a priority for DHS, but over the last four years the Biden Administration used the BRIC program as a piggy bank for its green new deal agenda,\" a FEMA spokesperson told CBS News on Thursday. \"We will make sure we do right by the taxpayers by bringing integrity to all our spending. If these States take issue with that, we will see them in court.\"",
      "The states suing are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin. Most have Democratic state leadership and have filed other lawsuits challenging Trump administration actions. North Carolina was ravaged by mudslides and flash flooding last fall after Hurricane Helene made landfall in late September.",
      "The lawsuit comes as FEMA in recent weeks has faced scrutiny about its response to floods in Texas that killed more than 130 people, including at least 37 children. It also comes just days after heavy rains and flooding inundated communities in states ranging from New York and New Jersey to New Mexico.",

      "The EU negotiates trade policy as a single entity and was the U.S.'s top goods trading partner in 2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. In 2024, the U.S. imported around $606 billion in goods from the EU and exported around $370 billion worth of products to it.",
      "EU leaders have warned they're prepared to impose higher tariffs on hundreds of U.S. imports unless a deal can be reached in the coming weeks. Economists say the dispute could drive up consumer prices on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "Mr. Trump has defended tariffs as necessary to protect American workers, pointing to the trade imbalance on goods and higher EU tariffs as evidence the bloc has treated the U.S unfairly for years.",
      "The president has also repeatedly said the European Union does not buy American cars or agricultural products. However, trade data from 2024 shows that's inaccurate. While the U.S. has imported more cars and agricultural products from Europe in recent years than it exports there, the EU remains a significant market for these American products.",
      "Here's a breakdown of the data.",
      "EU is the U.S.'s fourth largest buyer of agricultural products",
      "President Trump has repeatedly suggested Europe does not buy agricultural goods from U.S. farmers and producers.",
      "\"The European Union is, in many ways, nastier than China, OK?,\" President Trump said at an event May 12. \"They sell us their agricultural products. We sell them virtually none. They don't take our products.\"",
      "But according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the EU was the fourth-largest buyer of American agricultural products in 2024, purchasing a record $12.8 billion in these goods. Top exports to the EU included oilseeds like sunflower and sesame seeds, nuts and processed nut products like peanut butter, and soybeans.",
      "By comparison, the U.S. imported $36 billion in agricultural products from the EU in 2024 \u2014 buying billions of dollars worth of European wine, animal products, and grains and feeds.",
      "The White House has not responded to a request for clarification on the president's claim.",
      "Before Mr. Trump raised tariffs to a baseline of 10% in April, the EU maintained a higher average tariff on foreign agricultural products than the United States. In 2023, the EU average tariff on foreign agricultural goods was 10.8%, compared to the U.S. rate of 5%.",
      "Certain American food products are also less available in Europe because of consumer preferences and regulations, as the EU bans some American food products that contain certain additives they have deemed unsafe for human consumption.",
      "EU buys more than 160,000 American vehicles each year",
      "Another frequent target of President Trump's criticism is the EU's trade imbalance on cars.",
      "\"They sell us 13 million cars. We sell them none,\" Mr. Trump claimed at an event in May.",
      "It is true that the United States imports far more European vehicles than the number of American-made vehicles it exports to the EU, but the EU does buy some American cars.",
      "In 2024, the EU imported about 165,000 American vehicles, valued at roughly $8.8 billion at current exchange rates, according to a report by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. By comparison, the same data shows the U.S. imported about 750,000 vehicles from the EU in 2024, worth $43 billion.",
      "A post shared by CBS News Confirmed (@cbsnewsconfirmed)",
      "Both trading partners have long imposed tariffs on foreign vehicles. The EU charges a 10% tariff on U.S. passenger cars, while the U.S. charged 2.5% on EU passenger cars until Mr. Trump raised the tariff on all foreign vehicles to 25%. The U.S. has also maintained a 25% tariff on EU pickup trucks since the 1960s.",
      "Apart from tariffs, industry analysts say U.S. cars are less competitive in the EU market for a number of other reasons, including that the member nations tend to have higher fuel economy standards, higher gas costs, and their buyers tend to prefer smaller cars.",
      "Other major products include pharmaceuticals and crude oil",
      "Though Mr. Trump often focuses on cars, they're not the biggest sector. Biological products and medication are actually the top commodities the U.S. imports from the EU, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. This is driven partly by some American pharmaceutical companies maintaining manufacturing facilities in EU countries with lower corporate tax rates like Ireland.",
      "In recent weeks, President Trump has floated tariff rates as high as 200% on foreign-made pharmaceuticals unless companies onshore manufacturing to the U.S.",
      "On the export side, the top U.S. exports to the EU include oil and natural gas, airplanes, and immunological products like blood plasma.",
      "Over the weekend, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said the EU still hopes to reach a new agreement with the U.S.",

      "In a post on Truth Social on Wednesday morning, the president compared the uproar over the Justice Department's handling of the so-called Epstein files to past controversies, like the investigation into his 2016 campaign's possible ties to Russia and Hunter Biden's laptop.",
      "\"[T]hese Scams and Hoaxes are all the Democrats are good at - It's all they have - They are no good at governing, no good at policy, and no good at picking winning candidates,\" he wrote. \"Also, unlike Republicans, they stick together like glue. Their new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax, and my PAST supporters have bought into this 'bullshit,' hook, line, and sinker.\"",
      "He continued: \"I have had more success in 6 months than perhaps any President in our Country's history, and all these people want to talk about, with strong prodding by the Fake News and the success starved Dems, is the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax. Let these weaklings continue forward and do the Democrats work, don't even think about talking of our incredible and unprecedented success, because I don't want their support anymore!\"",
      "In a meeting at the White House later in the morning, the president reiterated his statement, telling reporters \"they're wasting their time with a guy who obviously had some very serious problems, who died three, four years ago.\"",

      "The current controversy began last week, when the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review of the evidence against Epstein, a well-connected financier who was convicted of sex trafficking and died in federal custody in 2019. The department said the review found no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein had blackmailed prominent figures.",
      "The memo was met with anger from many of Mr. Trump's supporters, who have long called for more transparency about the Epstein files, which they believe might implicate other powerful figures in Epstein's crimes.",
      "The review also exposed internal divisions within the administration itself. FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino clashed with Attorney General Pam Bondi over the Justice Department's handling of the case, and prominent conservatives have called for Bondi to be fired or resign over her decision to withhold any additional files. The president has defended Bondi's work on the case, telling reporters on Tuesday that she has \"handled it very well.\"",
      "Prominent Democrats have pressured their GOP colleagues to push for more transparency from the administration, so far unsuccessfully. Two procedural maneuvers in the House that would have required the administration to reveal more evidence about the Epstein case failed to overcome GOP opposition earlier this week.",
      "But Mr. Trump's supporters in conservative media and his fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill are continuing to call for the administration to release more of what the government knows about the Epstein case. House Speaker Mike Johnson, Mr. Trump's closest congressional ally, told conservative podcast host Benny Johnson that he is \"for transparency\" in an interview on Tuesday.",
      "\"It's a very delicate subject, but you should put everything out there, let the people decide it,\" the speaker said. \"Pam Bondi needs to come forward and explain it to the American people. Let's get this thing resolved.\"",
      "Other Republicans have called on Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former partner who is serving a 20-year prison sentence on charges related to sex trafficking, to testify before Congress.

      "His remarks come as President Trump has taken a sharply different tone. In the Oval Office on Wednesday, Mr. Trump dismissed the scrutiny surrounding Epstein's associates as politically motivated. \"It's a big hoax,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's started by Democrats. It's been run by the Democrats for four years.\" He claimed the matter was being pushed by \"some stupid Republicans\" doing Democrats' work.",
      "In a Truth Social post earlier in the day, Mr. Trump wrote that the \"Jeffrey Epstein Hoax\" is being used by \"past supporters\" who had been \"conned by the Lunatic Left\" and declared, \"I don't want their support anymore.\"",

      "Pence, however, noted that economic challenges \"don't flow as much to the Fed as they do to the policies of the administration,\" and drew a contrast with how tariffs were handled during the first Trump term. \"We used tariffs and the threat of tariffs to bring down trade barriers and to open up markets,\" he said.",

The site was once home to an ice cream parlor called Mi\u015b, which operated there since 1962 but has since moved to a new location.

He appears to have been about 40 years old when he died, anthropologist Dr. Aleksandra Pud\u0142o said in an article published on Gda\u0144sk's official website. The knight appears to have been between about 5'6\" and 5'10\" tall, researchers said. Pud\u0142o said the skull and bones of the skeleton were very well-preserved. Gda\u0144sk's website noted that the skull is in worse shape than the other bones.",
      "It's not clear who the knight may have served, according to Gda\u0144sk's official website. The city was captured by a German Catholic military order called the Teutonic Knights in the early 13th century. It's also unclear if the burial predates or postdates the event, researchers said. The knight may have also served the Sobies\u0142aw dynasty, which ruled Gda\u0144sk during the 11th and 12th century.",
      "More research will be conducted on the skeleton and the tombstone, as well as other relics found during the dig. Researchers have found several other notable tombstones, though the knight's appears to be the most impressive. The tombstone will be examined with 3D software, and archaeologists will likely attempt a detailed reconstruction of the artifact. Pud\u0142o said that the skeleton of the knight will undergo a \"thorough examination,\"\u00a0 and the results of that may be available as early as next year.",

      "Miami \u2014 Marine scientists in Miami are hoping to restore Florida's coral reef by taking coral from Honduras and crossbreeding\u00a0it.",
      "Warming ocean waters have had a devastating impact on the coral reefs of the Sunshine State. Efforts are underway to save the third-largest barrier reef system in the world, including the use of\u00a0lab-grown corals and the\u00a0removal of healthy corals, but scientists are now trying a method that they say has never been done before.",
      "\"It's the first time ever in the world that an international cross of corals from different countries have been permitted for outplanting on wild reefs,\" Dr. Andrew Baker, a marine biologist at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel  School of Marine Science, told CBS News on a boat ride near Miami.",
      "There are dozens of stony coral species along Florida's 350 miles of reefs, from the Florida Keys up to the St. Lucie Inlet. Two of them are listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, according to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, one of which is the Elkhorn coral.",
      "The Elkhorn species helps form the skeleton of a healthy reef, but according to Baker, more than 95% of the Elkhorn coral off Florida has been wiped out by a combination of factors, including rising temperatures fueled by climate change, increased coastal development and disease outbreaks",
      "\"Over the last 50 years or so, we've lost more of these Elkhorn corals, culminating in 2023 when we had this really warm summer,\" Baker said. \"And in order for that population to recover, it was determined that we need more diversity from outside the Florida population.\"",
      "So, scientists and conservationists started looking off the Caribbean coast in Honduras, specifically Tela Bay, where Elkhorn coral live in \"the kind of conditions where corals have to be really tough to survive,\" Baker said.",
      "To crossbreed the Elkhorns, scientists with Tela Marine, a Honduras-based aquarium and marine research center, carefully plucked coral from the reef in Honduras. Permits were then needed to transport the coral fragments into the U.S.",
      "Once they arrived in Florida, scientists with the University of Miami and the Florida Aquarium in Tampa worked to create the \"Flonduran\" Elkhorn, as it was nicknamed by Baker.",
      "Earlier this month, the crossbred species were planted for the first time in Florida, underneath protective umbrellas to deter predators.",
      "\"And if these corals can live through the next marine heat wave, then that is critical for our coastal protection on the coast of Florida,\" said Keri O'Neil, the director of coral conservation at the Florida Aquarium.",
      "With robust and healthy corals, South Florida's coastal communities are better protected from flooding because the reefs help break up hurricane-fueled waves. The planting of the first Flondurans is just the start of what's needed to rebuild.",
      "\"We need to now scale this up and be out planting hundreds of thousands of baby corals all throughout the reef,\" Baker said. \"And there are ways to do that, but we've got to gear up and get going.\"",

      "The event is considered the best meteor shower of the year, according to NASA, and is also the most popular.",
      "When is the 2025 Perseid meteor shower?",

      "The meteor shower is expected to peak from Aug. 12-13, although moonlight will impact meteor visibility. The moon will be 84% full during the peak.",
      "Where and how to view the Perseids",

      "\"The Perseids are one of the most plentiful showers with about 50 to 100 meteors seen per hour,\" NASA says. \"They occur with warm summer nighttime weather allowing sky watchers to comfortably view them.\"",
      "Perseids often leave long \"wakes\" of color and light when they move through Earth's atmosphere. NASA notes they are also known for their fireballs.",
      "\"Fireballs are larger explosions of light and color that can persist longer than an average meteor streak,\" the space agency says. \"This is due to the fact that fireballs originate from larger particles of cometary material. Fireballs are also brighter.\"",
      "What causes the Perseids meteor shower?",
      "The meteor shower occurs when Earth passes through an area of space debris left by a comet coming around the sun. Debris interacts with Earth's atmosphere and disintegrates, resulting in colorful lines in the sky, according to NASA and the American Meteor Society.",
      "\"The pieces of space debris that interact with our atmosphere to create the Perseids originate from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle,\" which last visited the inner solar system in 1992, NASA says.",

    "published": "Sun, 13 Jul 2025 10:45:51 -0400",
    "summary": "Barbara Rae-Venter never anticipated that her genealogy hobby would lead to the capture of one of California's most notorious criminals, the Golden State Killer. Her pioneering use of genetic genealogy has since helped solve numerous cold cases.",
    "story": [
      "Barbara Rae-Venter, a 76-year-old patent attorney living in Marina, California, thought she'd spend her retirement leisurely playing tennis, traveling, and indulging in her favorite pastime: researching her ancestry and building a family tree. It didn't quite work out that way. For Rae-Venter, something she started as a hobby led to capturing one of the most notorious criminals in California.",
      "Seven years ago, Rae-Venter, using her genetic research skills, tracked down a fugitive in California who had eluded capture for more than three decades, and remarkably, she did it without ever leaving her home.",
      "The fugitive was the Golden State Killer. In April 2018, the FBI and California law enforcement made headlines with a stunning announcement: \"We found the needle in the haystack, and it was right here in Sacramento.\"",
      "Since 1974, investigators had sought the man responsible for at least 13 murders and more than 50 rapes in the state of California. But it wasn't until Rae-Venter joined the investigation that they learned his name: Joseph James DeAngelo. \"It's not that I'm so very special,\" said Rae-Venter. \"It's just I happened to be in the right place at the right time.\"",
      "Using DNA left by DeAngelo at a crime scene, Rae-Venter identified him by using a technique now known as investigative genetic genealogy. \"It's just basically doing the same as you would do if you're doing family history research, and augmenting that with DNA to make sure that the relatives that you find are really related to you,\" she said.",
      "Her crime-solving career began quite by accident. Rae-Venter, who also has a Ph.D. in biology, was volunteering as a search angel \u2013 a person who helps adoptees find their biological parents. \"It's such a fundamental desire,\" she said. \"They're just so focused. They just so want to know where they came from.\"",
      "A Living Jane Doe",
      "In 2015, Rae-Venter responded to an email sent by Peter Headley, then a veteran investigator with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, and fell into her first mystery. Headley was trying to uncover the true identity of a woman in her 30s who had been kidnapped as a child. \"She really wanted to know who she was,\" said Headley, referring to her as a living Jane Doe. \"She's alive, but we have no idea who she is,\" he said.",
      "That living \"Jane Doe\" went by the name of Lisa Jenson. At five years old, she had been abandoned at an RV park by a man called Gordon Jenson. \"It turned out she had been kidnapped by the suspect, and he just told everyone that he was her father,\" Headley said.",
      "Later, detectives learned that Gordon Jenson was just one of many aliases used by Terry Rasmussen, a notorious serial killer, who died in prison in 2010 without ever revealing who Lisa really was.",
      "Lisa Jenson did not know who her mother was, or if she had any sisters or brothers. Headley said that Lisa had heard about genetic genealogy and wondered if that could lead her to her real family: \"I said, 'Okay, let's try it.' So, opened an account for her, got her in Ancestry, and we had some distant matches, and I'm like, this might just work.\"",
      "But this was new territory for Headley, so he emailed DNA Adoption for help and found Barbara Rae-Venter. Asked why she agreed to collaborate, Rae-Venter replied, \"It was a puzzle!\"",
      "She began the laborious process of building family trees to find Lisa's real family, which involved more than just looking at DNA: \"The DNA is just the jump-off point. You're doing census records, you're doing birth, death and marriage records. My favorite is probably Facebook. I've actually built trees from the amount of stuff people have put in their Facebook pages.\"",
      "Headley helped by coaxing distant relatives to take DNA tests. \"People were skeptical, thought it was a scam,\" he said. \"One lady thought I was going to clone her.\"",
      "And DNA tests are expensive. Headley and Rae-Venter reached into their own pockets to help subsidize the costs.",
      "I asked, \"So, you're not only not getting paid to do this work, you're actually paying for these tests?\"",
      "\"We probably each spent a couple of thousand dollars on kits,\" Rae-Venter said.",
      "It took nearly a year, but in 2016, the DNA trail led to New Hampshire, and the case of a missing young mother, Denise Beaudin. She and her infant daughter had vanished from her home, along with a man named Bob Evans, which turned out to be yet another alias of that serial killer, Terry Rasmussen",
      "Investigators believe Rasmussen killed Denise and kidnapped her little girl. For the first time, Lisa Jenson was about to learn her real name: Dawn Beaudin.",
      "Headley said, \"I called Lisa up and I asked her if she wanted to know her real name, we had figured it out. And she just got real quiet, and very quietly said yes.\"",
      "Lisa has asked for privacy, but, in a phone call told Rae-Venter that she could finally move on in her life, including getting married.",
      "\"She just said it didn't feel right when she didn't really know who she was or where she'd come from,\" said Rae-Venter. \"And now that she knew that, she felt comfortable now going forward and getting married. I just thought that was so special.\"",
      "Building the Family Tree of a Killer",
      "It was one of the first times that genetic genealogy was used to solve a criminal case \u2013 and word spread fast. In 2017, Rae-Venter got a call: Could she use the same technique to find the Golden State Killer? At the time, there were six full-time investigators and three FBI agents on the case, and they couldn't find him. Rae-Venter thought the DNA would tell her who he was. \"I was absolutely certain of that,\" she said.",
      "Investigators provided a DNA profile left at a California crime scene, and Rae-Venter uploaded it to GED Match and Family Tree DNA. This time, she was building the family tree of a killer.",
      "Sixty-three days later, she said, \"I'm sitting there at three in the morning all by my little lonesome staring at my computer. I know who you are: You're Joseph DeAngelo.\"",
      "I asked, \"At that moment, were you the only person in the world who knew who the Golden State Killer was?\"",
      "\"Besides him? Probably,\" Rae-Venter replied.",
      "It was an astonishing breakthrough. But Rae-Venter's word was not enough to make an arrest. \"I'm providing an investigative lead. You still need some old-fashioned detective work,\" she said.",
      "So investigators got to work getting a DNA sample from DeAngelo himself to confirm he was the right guy. Within days, the brutal killer who had evaded law enforcement for decades was finally behind bars.",
      "In 2020, DeAngelo was sentenced to 13 consecutive life sentences. After DeAngelo was locked away, Rae-Venter decided that it was time to share her incredible story in a book, \"I Know Who You Are.\" She has been profiled in The New York Times, and appeared on Time Magazine's list of the most influential people.",
      "And she's come out of retirement. Her group, Firebird Forensics, works with law enforcement agencies nationwide to solve cases using genetic genealogy, and has solved approximately 60 cases. She even travels around the country teaching others her technique.",
      "In 2023 she described the process of using genetic genealogy as \"very addictive, because you know you're hot on the trail and you just know if you just keep going a little bit longer, you're going to find the connections you're looking for.\"",
      "But her line of work has also raised concerns about privacy. More than 53 million people have already uploaded their DNA profiles to public databases. Should police be able to use that information to track down the users' criminal relatives? \"Well, unfortunately, I think that horse left the barn a long time ago,\" Rae-Venter  said.",
      "And the trade-off may be worth it, says Rae-Venter and others, if it means getting killers and rapists off the streets. Michael O'Malley, the prosecuting attorney in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, said, \"There was a lot of light bulbs going off across the country saying, 'What great technology! How do we bring it to our community to solve violent crimes?'\"",
      "Watch Part Two of Erin Moriarty's report:",
      "Who is John Doe #147?",
      "O'Malley is a witness to a sad statistic in this country: more and more serious crimes are going unsolved. \"I get violent crime reports that come across my desk every day, and only a fraction of those are solved,\" he said.",
      "In 2020, O'Malley's office set up the G.O.L.D. Unit, a team of prosecutors who use the latest forensic tools to find criminals and get them off the streets. It's run by supervising assistant prosecuting attorney Mary Weston. \"We review cases, mostly sexual assaults and homicides at this time, that can be re-investigated using perhaps updated technologies,\" she said.",
      "Among them, cases involving sexual predators, like John Doe #147. \"That's all we knew him as,\" said Weston.",
      "On a hot afternoon in August 1997, a man grabbed a nine-year-old boy in the woods behind a school in the Cleveland suburbs, and sexually assaulted him.",
      "The nine-year-old victim is now a thirty-seven-year old man, who asked us to call him \"Michael,\" and not show his face. Describing the years since the assault, he said, \"It's just been a lot of ups-and-downs, you know? I had doubts, thinking, 'Would I ever, would we ever find the guy?'",
      "\"I remember running to my dad, him taking me to the hospital,\" Michael said. \"But the most I could remember is my mom. She was just crying hysterically on the front porch, just blaming herself, and the neighbors are trying to calm her down.\"",
      "Investigators knew little about the predator back in 1997, according to O'Malley: \"The young boy gave a description, roughly, of his age, and his body build. But really that was it,\" he said.",
      "There was DNA left on the child's clothing. In 2003, a profile was submitted to the federal database (known as CODIS), which contains DNA profiles of convicted offenders. There was no match. So, investigators had a DNA profile, but not a name to go with it.",
      "\"I was crushed,\" said Michael. \"I think, my only hope is just gone. He's gonna actually get away with it.\"",
      "To stop the statute of limitations for rape from running out, \"John Doe #147\" was indicted, but with no leads, the case went cold. Weston said, \"At the time, you know, we were at a loss. What are we gonna do for this boy? He's not a boy anymore, but what can we do to try to help solve his case?\"",
      "Michael said he was scared that the predator might find him again: \"Oh, yeah, I always thought, 'Could this guy be watching?' And he threatened to kill me if I had told anybody about the horrible incident.\"",
      "But in 2018, Michael \u2013 and the rest of the world \u2013 watched the Golden State Killer case play out on TV. \"And it was like a lightbulb lit above my head,\" he said. \"I'm like, 'Oh, there's another way.'\"",
      "The capture of notorious serial killer James James   DeAngelo introduced the world to investigative genetic genealogy. Could that same technique help solve Michael's case? Investigators would need a more complete profile of the rapist's DNA. But again, there was a hitch: when investigators went looking for the rape kit from Michael's case, they discovered that it had been destroyed.",
      "\"I'm not your victim anymore\"",
      "But investigators didn't give up, and got a stroke of luck when a key piece of evidence was discovered at the county's crime laboratory: an original tube used for testing that could have some leftover DNA. \"I was very, very excited,\" said Weston. \"But then there's the waiting. Is it gonna be enough? And then, 'Are you gonna be able to work with this very tiny amount of DNA?' It's nine nanograms.\"",
      "Astoundingly, it was enough, and in March 2022, they turned to someone familiar: Barbara Rae-Venter, the genealogist who tracked down the Golden State Killer. \"If I had faith in anybody to do it, it was her,\" said Weston. \"She had solved a few cases for us already, and I knew this case was in good hands.\"",
      "It took two months. Rae-Venter came up with a list of suspects, all brothers. Ohio investigators then were able to narrow that list down to just one, and asked Michael to view a photo lineup. \"Immediately, you know, my heart started pounding,\" he said. \"I started getting clammy and sweaty, sorta like a flashback, you know, to when I seen him standing there in the woods.\"",
      "The man he recognized was Dennis Gribble, an Ohio resident with a long history of sex crimes. It was all investigators needed to get a search warrant. Days later, they appeared on Gribble's doorstep to get a DNA sample, telling him, \"Please open your mouth.\"",
      "What was his reaction? \"He was stunned, but he complied,\" O'Malley said. \"And we took it back to our lab and confirmed that he was the individual who sexually assaulted Michael back in 1997.\"",
      "And that's how, in May 2023, John Doe #147, now identified as Dennis Gribble, appeared in an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs in a Cleveland courtroom. Michael was there. He looked at Gribble (\"I was just disgusted\"), and read an impact statement to the court: \"I have learned to be a better person and a father than the monster you are and will always be.\"",
      "Michael said, \"I wanted to show him he didn't get the best of me. I'm not your victim anymore. I'm not somebody you prey on anymore.\"",
      "Gribble, now 75, pleaded guilty to one count of rape, and is currently serving 10 years in prison.",
      "With a federal grant to help cover the costs of testing, the G.O.L.D. Unit has now helped solve 13 rape cases in the Cleveland area, with Barbara Rae-Venter's help. Yet, neither O'Malley nor Weston has ever met Rae-Venter. \"We Zoom!\" Weston laughed.",
      "I asked, \"Is that a little odd, that you're working with this investigator who really never leaves her dining room table? That's where she does all her investigations.\"",
      "\"I hope she never leaves it again!\" O'Malley laughed.",
      "The technique that Rae-Venter used to track down Dennis Gribble has been used to identify other elusive criminals, including Bryan Kohberger, who earlier this month pleaded guilty to killing four University of Idaho students in 2022.",
      "O'Malley says he believes genetic genealogy will someday solve less serious offenses as well. \"Right now, it's still a very expensive tool, and it takes a lot of time,\" he said. \"But I do see it expanding in the future.\"",
      "Still, as the field expands, so have privacy concerns. Some states have set limits, although there are no national laws restricting the use of genetic genealogy by law enforcement.",
      "And for victims like Michael, the benefits outweigh the risks. Genetic genealogy was his only chance for justice. \"It was a needle in a haystack,\" he said. \"The guy would have got away scot-free. Had it not been for DNA and genealogy, I would have never been here today. We wouldn't even be talking about it.\"",

    "story": [
      "Astronomers have, for the first time, discovered the moment when planets started to form around a sun-like baby star, scientists reported Wednesday.",
      "The specks of planet-forming material are emerging around HOPS-315, a protostar or baby star located 1,300 light-years away from us. One light year is approximately 5.88 trillion miles.",
      "While astronomers have seen discs of gas and dust around protostars before, they've never before identified a new planetary system at such an early stage. Minerals in the system around HOPS-315 are just starting to form.",
      "\"We're seeing a system that looks like what our Solar System looked like when it was just beginning to form,\" study co-author Merel van 't Hoff, a professor at Purdue University, said in a news release from the European Southern Observatory (ESO).",
      "The observatory paired up with NASA's Webb Space Telescope to identify the minerals forming the new solar system. Researchers turned to data from our own solar system to determine that these minerals show the start of a new system. In Earth's solar system, the first solid materials to form can now be found inside ancient meteorites. Those ancient meteorites contain a mineral called silicon monoxide, which only forms at extremely high temperatures, like those near a young star.",
      "Scientists were able to identify the formation of silicon monoxide around HOPS-315, which they said tells them they've caught the development of a solar system at an early stage.",
      "\"This is the first time this early stage of planet-building has ever been observed outside our own Solar System,\" the Planetary Society wrote in a social media post about the discovery.",
      "The discovery marks \"the birth of the seeds of the planets,\" study co-author Edwin Bergin, a professor at the University of Michigan, told CBS News. The silicate-mineral rich material around HOPS-315 will make planets after another million years or so.",

      "NWA 16788, the largest piece of Mars on Earth, was expected to fetch between $2 million and $4 million during the auction\u00a0in New York City, according to Sotheby's. The final price was $5,296,000, which includes the hammer price, premiums and local taxes, according to the auction house. Sotheby's has not publicly identified the buyer.",
      "Pieces of Mars found on Earth are rare. According to the auction house, just 400 of the more than 77,000 officially recognized meteorites found on Earth \u2014 or about 0.6% \u2014 are from Mars. The meteorite represents approximately 6.5% of all Martian material currently known on Earth.",
      "Meteorites come from meteors, space rocks that enter Earth's atmosphere. Most meteors burn up as they fall toward Earth, but the ones that survive the trip through Earth's atmosphere are considered meteorites. The chunk of Martian rock that was auctioned off by Sotheby's was likely dislodged from the planet by an asteroid strike.",
      "NWA 16788 traveled 140 million miles through space before it crashed in the Sahara Desert, where it was found in Niger's remote Agadez Region in 2023, according to Sotheby's.",
      "\"The odds of this getting from there to here are astronomically small,\" Cassandra Hatton, Sotheby's vice chairman of science and natural history, said in an auction house video.",
      "The meteorite weighs just over 54 pounds, which makes it the largest meteorite from Mars, but not the largest meteorite ever found. According to NASA, a meteorite originally weighing over 100 tons once fell to Namibia.",
      "It's believed that NWA 16788 is a \"relative newcomer here on Earth, having fallen from outer space rather recently,\" Sotheby's said in its auction listing. The meteorite was on public view at Sotheby's New York galleries ahead of the auction on Wednesday.",

      "The event is considered the best meteor shower of the year, according to NASA, and is also the most popular.",
      "When is the 2025 Perseid meteor shower?",
      "The shower begins on Thursday, July 17, and will continue for several weeks, until at least Aug. 23, according to NASA and the\u00a0American Meteor Society, a nonprofit organization.",
      "The meteor shower is expected to peak from Aug. 12-13, although moonlight will impact meteor visibility. The moon will be 84% full during the peak.",
      "Where and how to view the Perseids",

      "\"The Perseids are one of the most plentiful showers with about 50 to 100 meteors seen per hour,\" NASA says. \"They occur with warm summer nighttime weather allowing sky watchers to comfortably view them.\"",
      "Perseids often leave long \"wakes\" of color and light when they move through Earth's atmosphere. NASA notes they are also known for their fireballs.",
      "\"Fireballs are larger explosions of light and color that can persist longer than an average meteor streak,\" the space agency says. \"This is due to the fact that fireballs originate from larger particles of cometary material. Fireballs are also brighter.\"",
      "What causes the Perseids meteor shower?",
      "The meteor shower occurs when Earth passes through an area of space debris left by a comet coming around the sun. Debris interacts with Earth's atmosphere and disintegrates, resulting in colorful lines in the sky, according to NASA and the American Meteor Society.",
      "\"The pieces of space debris that interact with our atmosphere to create the Perseids originate from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle,\" which last visited the inner solar system in 1992, NASA says.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists say they detected the largest-ever merger of two black holes, forming one that is 225 times the mass of the sun, adding that the new discovery \"pushes the limits of\" how astronomers understand how black holes are created.",
      "Two black holes combined to make the massive one, according to the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, an international group that uses gravitational waves to detect black hole mergers and who identified the event. Gravitational waves occur when there are minute distortions in spacetime, caused by events like black hole mergers, the group said in a news release.",
      "One of the black holes was about 103 times the mass of the sun. The other was about 137 times it. These large black holes may have been formed by even earlier mergers, Mark Hannam, a professor at Cardiff University and member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, said in the release.",
      "Even within the merger, the black holes are rapidly spinning, scientists said. Their rotation speed is about 400,000 times Earth's rotation speed, the collaboration said in a graphic. They are moving at about 80% to 90% of the maximum possible speed.",
      "\"The black holes appear to be spinning very rapidly \u2014 near the limit allowed by Einstein's theory of general relativity,\" said Dr. Charlie Hoy, a gravitational-wave astrophysicist, LIGO member and postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Portsmouth, in the news release. \"That makes the signal difficult to model and interpret.\"",
      "The massive black hole has been dubbed GW231123. Its unusual size and behavior is challenging scientists' understanding of black hole formation, Hannam said. Previously, the largest known black hole that came from a merger was about 140 times the mass of the sun.",
      "GW231123's discovery is also opening doors for new avenues of research, astronomers said. The behavior and size of the black hole \"pushes the limits of\" current theoretical models and existing gravitational-wave detection technology, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration said.",
      "\"It will take years for the community to fully unravel this intricate signal pattern and all its implications,\" Dr. Gregorio Carullo, a LIGO member and an assistant professor at the University of Birmingham's Institute for Gravitational Wave Astronomy, said in a statement. \"Despite the most likely explanation remaining a black hole merger, more complex scenarios could be the key to deciphering its unexpected features. Exciting times ahead!\"",

      "More information about GW231123 and other black holes discovered by the collaboration will be presented this month at the 24th International Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation (GR24) and the 16th Edoardo Amaldi Conference on Gravitational Waves, two conferences presented jointly in Glasgow, Scotland.

    "published": "Fri, 18 Jul 2025 15:30:29 -0400",
    "summary": "Backers of the Genius Act, a potentially landmark bill that could help \"stablecoins\" go mainstream, say it would greatly speed electronic payments.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Friday is signing the Genius Act, the first major federal law governing cryptocurrencies.",
      "The law establishes federal regulations for \"stablecoins,\" which are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency because their value is pegged to fixed assets, like the dollar.",
      "The Genius Act passed in the House on Thursday by a 308-122 vote after being approved\u00a0in the Senate\u00a0last month with broad bipartisan support. The measure is part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.",
      "\"For the first time in history, Congress has passed bipartisan digital assets legislation through both the Senate and the House. The Genius Act marks a major milestone in securing America's leadership in payments innovation while protecting consumers and strengthening our national security,\" South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a statement Thursday following the bill's passage by Congress.",
      "The Genius Act, which is sponsored by Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, has two Democratic co-sponsors \u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland \u2014 and two Republican co-sponsors \u2014 South Carolina's Sen. Tim Scott and Wyoming's Sen. Cynthia Lummis.",
      "Here's what to know about stablecoin and how the Genius Act could affect its use.",
      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backed the passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What will the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) established guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",
      "The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "With the Genius Act passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get \"depegged\" from its underlying asset if that asset's value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity, according to S&P Global Ratings.",
      "In 2023, for example, the failure of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins \u2014 the USDC and DAI \u2014 to depeg.",
      "Stablecoins are also subject \"to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity,\" according to S&P Global.",
      "Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?",
      "As the Genius Act awaited approval from Congress, some of the nation's largest banks were already considering how they could integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.",
      "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, is already developing its digital currency capabilities in an attempt to expand revenue and attract clients, she added.",
      "\"We are closely monitoring developments in the legislative and regulatory space on coin issuance and evaluating how to best to support our clients' needs through our existing 24/7 products like [Citi Token Services], in addition to exploring options around issuing our own external token or coin and working with existing providers,\" Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships & innovation for Citi's Services business, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, also plans to use stablecoin, CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts in an earnings call on Tuesday.",
      "Outside of the banking world, companies like Walmart and Amazon are also exploring the idea of issuing their own stablecoins, Sam Mcingvale, head of product at blockchain technology company Optimism, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email on Tuesday.",
      "\"If new stablecoin legislation is passed, we expect it to open the floodgates even further,\" he said.",
      "What is Trump's position?",
      "Congress' approval of the Genius Act aligns with Mr. Trump's\u00a0commitment in March to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "At a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last year, Mr. Trump\u00a0also said\u00a0it would be his administration's policy to \"keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has taken other actions that point to his interest in cryptocurrency. In January, shortly before taking office, he and his wife Melania Trump launched their own meme coins, a highly volatile type of crypto whose value derives from their online popularity.",

    "story": [
      "Hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were easily found with a simple search on TikTok and available to a user under the age of 18, in violation of the platform's own policies, CBS News has found.",
      "CBS News created a TikTok account for a hypothetical 15-year-old female user in the United States and found that, at the very least, hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were searchable and watchable on the platform using the account.",
      "Once the CBS News account interacted with a handful of these videos, similar content was then recommended to the account on TikTok's \"For You\" feed.",
      "Searchable videos ranged from content with captions such as, \"nothing feels better than an empty stomach,\" to \"what I eat in a day\" videos promoting restrictive, 500-calorie-per-day diets. Guidelines published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health suggest that girls between the ages of 14 and 18 ingest between 1,800 and 2,400 calories per day.",
      "Many of the videos promoted thin body types as aspirational targets and included the hashtag \"harsh motivation\" to push extreme weight loss advice.",
      "Some of those videos included messages or slogans such as \"skinny is a status symbol\" and \"every time you say no to food, you say yes to skinny.\"",
      "TikTok's community guidelines say the platform only allows users over the age of 18 to see content promoting restrictive, low-calorie diets, including videos promoting medications for weight loss or idealizing certain body types. The Chinese-owned platform also says it bans users under the age of 18 from viewing videos that promote cosmetic surgery without warning of the risks, such as before-and-after images, videos of surgical procedures, and messages discussing elective cosmetic surgery.",
      "But CBS News found a range of videos by entering basic search terms on the platform, such as \"skinny,\" \"thin,\" and \"low cal,\" that promoted thin bodies as ideal, while also pushing harmful weight management behaviors. One such video showed an image of a scale with a weight of 39.9 kg (88 pounds) alongside a caption saying \"weight loss\" and the hashtag \"ed,\" which is a common abbreviation for \"eating disorder.\"",
      "Another graphic video with the caption \"ana gives you wings\" showed a series of models with protruding collar bones and spines. The term \"ana\" is an abbreviation for the eating disorder anorexia.",
      "Responding to CBS News' research, a TikTok spokesperson said Thursday that it was \"based on a very limited sample size and does not reflect the experience of the vast majority of our community.\"",
      "\"TikTok does not allow content that promotes disordered eating or extreme weight loss behaviours, and we work with health experts to provide in-app support resources where needed,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The spokesperson pointed to a study published in May by the University of Southern California, which found that a majority of the eating disorder content on TikTok is discussion among users about recovery from such conditions.",
      "The same study noted, however, the platform's \"dual role in both challenging harmful cultural norms and potentially perpetuating them,\" regarding body image perceptions and eating disorders.",
      "\"We know that this isn't a one-off error on TikTok's part and that children are coming across this content on a scale,\" said Gareth Hill, a spokesperson for the Molly Russell foundation, a charity in the United Kingdom that works to prevent young people from committing self-harm.",
      "\"The question for TikTok is, if this is not representative, then why has this account [created by CBS News], which is a child's account, been shown this content in the first place, and then why is it continuing to get recommended to it?\"",
      "CBS News also found a wide variety of videos available to the under-18 user promoting the weight loss drug Ozempic and various forms of cosmetic surgery. That included videos that showed up on the recommended \"For You\" feed, which promotes cosmetic surgeries such as rhinoplasty, breast augmentation, and liposuction.",
      "In one case, a user talking about their waist reduction surgery included a voiceover saying: \"I would rather die hot than live ugly.\"",
      "A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment specifically on CBS News' findings regarding cosmetic surgeries being promoted to underage users.",
      "TikTok says it has taken a range of measures over the past several months to address criticism regarding the availability of extreme weight loss content on the platform. In early June, the platform suspended search results for the viral hashtag #SkinnyTok, after drawing criticism from health experts and European regulators. The hashtag had been associated primarily with videos promoting extreme weight loss, calorie restriction and negative body talk, often presented as wellness advice.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson also told CBS News on Thursday that searches for words or phrases such as #Anorexia would lead users to relevant assistance, including localized eating disorder helplines, where they can access further information and support.",
      "\"I think we're understanding more and more about how this content shows up and so even when you ban a particular hashtag, for example, it's not long until something similar jumps up in its place,\" Doreen Marshall, who leads the American nonprofit National Eating Disorders Association [NEDA], told CBS News.",
      "\"This is going to be an evolving landscape both for creating content guidelines, but also for the platforms themselves and, you know, while some progress has been made, there's clearly more that can be done,\" Marshall said.",
      "TikTok is not the only social media platform that has faced criticism for the accessibility of extreme weight loss content.",
      "In 2022, 60 Minutes reported on a leaked internal document from Meta that showed the company was aware, through its own research, of content on its Instagram platform promoting extreme weight loss and fueling eating disorders in young people.",
      "At the time, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, declined 60 Minutes' request for an interview but its global head of safety, Antigone Davis, said, \"We want teens to be safe online\" and that Instagram doesn't \"allow content promoting self-harm or eating disorders.\"",
      "Last year, 60 Minutes reported that the Google-owned YouTube video platform, which is hugely popular among teenagers, was also serving up extreme weight loss and eating disorder content to children.",

      "\"We're back in Pittsburgh to announce the largest package of investments in the history of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,\" Mr. Trump said on Tuesday.",
      "Among the projects will be the construction of data centers to help provide the enormous amounts of energy needed to power AI, and an energy innovation center to train workers in the Pittsburgh region in energy and AI jobs.",
      "The event was hosted by Republican U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick, who said the Pittsburgh region is uniquely positioned to marry its technological know-how with its vast energy resources in natural gas and nuclear to create a new AI economy. He said the investments will bring \"tens of thousands of jobs\" to Pennsylvania.",

      "\"We strongly condemn the abhorrent antisemitic and racist content, and the account has since been secured,\" it said. \"These posts in no way reflect the values of Sesame Workshop or Sesame Street, and no one at the organization was involved.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Sesame Workshop, which is the nonprofit organization behind \"Sesame Street,\" had said on Monday that Elmo's X account was \"briefly compromised\" on Sunday \"by an unknown hacker who posted disgusting messages, including antisemitic and racist posts.\"",
      "The spokesperson said the social media account, which is verified and has more than 600,000 followers, has since been secured.",
      "The posts contained slurs against Jews and commentary about President Trump and Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender who killed himself in prison in 2019 as he faced federal sex trafficking charges. The posts were removed Sunday afternoon, shortly after appearing on the platform.",
      "Epstein's case has been back in the news after the Justice Department and FBI released a report saying their review had found no evidence of a long-rumored \"client list,\" and that security video confirms no one entered the cell area before Epstein's death. The findings sparked a furor among some Trump supporters after right-wing media figures spent years promoting the idea of a cover-up or conspiracy.",

      "Musk unveils Grok 4 update a day after xAI chatbot made antisemitic remarks",
      "This amounts to an accidental case study in how AI systems embed their creators' values, with Musk's unfiltered public presence making visible what other companies typically obscure.",
      "What is Grok?",
      "Grok is an AI chatbot with \"a\u00a0twist\u00a0of humor and a dash of rebellion\" developed by xAI, which also owns the X social media platform.",
      "The first version of Grok launched in 2023. Independent evaluations suggest the latest model, Grok 4,\u00a0outpaces\u00a0competitors on \"intelligence\" tests. The chatbot is available standalone\u00a0and\u00a0on X.",
      "xAI\u00a0states\u00a0\"AI's knowledge should be all-encompassing and as far-reaching as possible.\" Musk has previously positioned\u00a0Grok\u00a0as a truth-telling alternative to chatbots accused of being \"woke\" by right-wing commentators.",
      "But beyond the latest Nazism scandal, Grok has made headlines for\u00a0generating\u00a0threats of sexual violence,\u00a0bringing\u00a0up \"white genocide\" in South Africa, and making insulting statements about politicians. The latter led to its ban in\u00a0Turkey.",
      "So how do developers imbue an AI with such values and shape chatbot behaviour? Today's chatbots are built using large language models (LLMs), which offer several levers developers can lean on.",
      "What makes an AI \"behave\" this way?",
      "Pre-training",
      "First, developers curate the data used during pre-training \u2013 the first step in building a chatbot. This involves not just filtering unwanted content, but also emphasising desired material.",
      "GPT-3 was shown Wikipedia up to six times more than other datasets as OpenAI considered it higher quality. Grok is trained on various sources, including posts from X, which might explain why Grok has been reported to\u00a0check\u00a0Elon Musk's opinion on controversial topics.",
      "Musk has shared that xAI\u00a0curates\u00a0Grok's training data, for example to improve legal knowledge and to remove LLM-generated content for quality control. He also appealed to the X community for difficult \"galaxy brain\" problems and facts that are \"politically incorrect, but nonetheless factually true\".",
      "We don't know if these data were used, or what quality-control measures were applied.",
      "Fine-tuning",
      "The second step, fine-tuning, adjusts LLM behaviour using feedback. Developers create detailed manuals outlining their preferred ethical stances, which either human reviewers or AI systems then use as a rubric to evaluate and improve the chatbot's responses, effectively coding these values into the machine.",
      "A Business Insider\u00a0investigation\u00a0revealed xAI's instructions to human  \"AI tutors\" instructed them to look for \"woke ideology\" and \"cancel culture\". While the onboarding documents said Grok shouldn't \"impose an opinion that confirms or denies a user's bias\", they also stated it should avoid responses that claim both sides of a debate have merit when they do not.",
      "System prompts",
      "The system prompt \u2013 instructions provided before every conversation \u2013 guides behaviour once the model is deployed.",
      "To its credit, xAI publishes Grok's system prompts. Its instructions to \"assume subjective viewpoints sourced from the media are biased\" and \"not shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect, as long as they are well substantiated\" were likely key factors in the latest controversy.",
      "These prompts are being updated daily at the time of writing, and their evolution is a fascinating case study in itself.",
      "Guardrails",
      "Finally, developers can also add guardrails \u2013 filters that block certain requests or responses. OpenAI claims it doesn't permit ChatGPT \"to generate hateful, harassing, violent or adult content\". Meanwhile, the Chinese model DeepSeek censors discussion of Tianamen Square.",
      "Ad-hoc testing when writing this article suggests Grok is much less restrained in this regard than competitor products.",
      "The transparency paradox",
      "Grok's Nazi controversy highlights a deeper ethical issue: Would we prefer AI companies to be explicitly ideological and honest about it, or maintain the fiction of neutrality while secretly embedding their values?",
      "Every major AI system reflects its creator's worldview \u2013 from Microsoft Copilot's risk-averse corporate perspective to Anthropic Claude's safety-focused ethos. The difference is transparency.",
      "Musk's public statements make it easy to trace Grok's behaviours back to Musk's stated beliefs about \"woke ideology\" and media bias. Meanwhile, when other platforms misfire spectacularly, we're left guessing whether this reflects leadership views, corporate risk aversion, regulatory pressure, or accident.",
      "This feels familiar. Grok resembles Microsoft's 2016 hate-speech-spouting Tay chatbot, also trained on Twitter data and set loose on Twitter before being shut down.",
      "But there's a crucial difference. Tay's racism emerged from user manipulation and poor safeguards \u2013 an unintended consequence. Grok's behaviour appears to stem at least partially from its design.",
      "The real lesson from Grok is about honesty in AI development. As these systems become more powerful and widespread (Grok support in Tesla vehicles was just\u00a0announced), the question isn't whether AI will reflect human values. It's whether companies will be transparent about whose values they're encoding and why.",
      "Musk's approach is simultaneously more honest (we can see his influence) and more deceptive (claiming objectivity while programming subjectivity) than his competitors.",
      "In an industry built on the myth of neutral algorithms, Grok reveals what's been true all along: there's no such thing as unbiased AI \u2013 only AI whose biases we can see with varying degrees of clarity.",

    "summary": "As AI barrels into the workplace, job search firms like Indeed and Glassdoor are replacing workers with the technology.",
    "story": [
      "Indeed and Glassdoor, the job search and employee review firms, are slashing a total of roughly 1,300 jobs as their parent company, Japan's Recruit Holdings, embraces artificial intelligence.",
      "In an email to employees Thursday, Recruit Holdings CEO Hisayuki \"Deko\" Idekoba said that \"AI is changing the world\" and that the company must adapt accordingly. The layoffs represent about 6% of Recruit Holdings' HR technology workforce.",
      "The cuts will target the companies' research and development, as well as \"people & sustainability,\" teams in the U.S., but other areas and regions will also be affected, according to Recruit Holdings. The company will send notices to employees who are losing their jobs on Thursday.",
      "The move reflects Recruit Holdings' focus on using AI to transform how job-seekers look for work and how employers handle recruitment. As part of that effort, the company will fold Glassdoor operations into Indeed, the company told CBS MoneyWatch. Glassdoor CEO Christian Sutherland-Wong is stepping down.",
      "\"[W]hen we think about HR industry, which is $300 billion-plus industry, but it includes like 60% or 65% of human labor manual cost. It's very difficult to find that big industry with such a high percentage of human labor manual cost,\" Idekoba said in May at a JPMorgan Chase technology conference. \"And so what we believe is, basically, how can we simplify hiring with using AI and technology and data to reduce manual work. That's what we are focusing on.\"",
      "He added that about one-third of the company's new programming code is written by AI, and that he expects that figure to jump to one-half. \"It's going to be 50% pretty soon,\" he said.",
      "The layoffs come as corporate leaders tout AI's capabilities, while some experts warn that the technology could lead to job losses. Speaking in June at the the Aspen Ideas Festival, for example, Ford CEO Jim Farley said AI is likely to replace half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ai-dating-assistants-rizz-keepler-hinge-grindr/",
    "published": "Sun, 13 Jul 2025 14:24:22 -0400",
    "summary": "People are turning to AI dating assistants for help in crafting wittier, more conversational messages to attract romantic partners on apps.",
    "story": [
      "While online dating apps makes searching for love more convenient, finding that special person is as difficult as ever. A cute photo and simple \"hello\" may not be enough to help you break through the noise, which is why many of those feeling stuck on what to say are turning to artificial intelligence for assistance.",
      "According to a study\u00a0on singles in America released last month by dating app Match.com and The Kinsey Institute at Indiana University, 1 in 4 singles \u2014 and nearly half of Gen Z \u2014 use AI to up their dating game. That's a 333% increase from a year ago.",
      "\"People are turning to AI for literally any use case you could imagine,\" said Kasley Killam, a social health and human connection expert. \"And so it's inevitable that people are going to turn to AI for dating coaching.\"",
      "Capitalizing on the trend are AI dating assistants, which coach people on what to say, what tone to strike and how to keep the conversation flowing if it hits a lull. For individuals who feel writing isn't their strong suit, the technology can be a real confidence booster.",
      "Advice on what to say",
      "Roman Khaves, founder of a dating assistant app called Rizz \u2014 which is Gen Z-speak for \"charisma\" \u2014 said the service provides around-the-clock, objective advice for people who can't afford a human dating coach or are unable to reach their friends in a pinch.",
      "\"It'll never sleep on you,\" Khaves told CBS MoneyWatch, describing the app as an \"AI wingwoman or AI wingman in your pocket.\"",
      "Rizz works by letting users upload screenshots of their conversations from dating apps or social media. Rizz then suggests a reply using generative AI. The more you use Rizz, the more it understands what type of replies you tend to like or feel comfortable with. That trains the AI model to improve over time.",
      "Rizz has a user base of roughly 10 million, according to Khaves, and is composed of 65% men and 35% women, largely within the 18-to-25 age range.",
      "Another service, called Keepler, a dating-optimization app, has a feature that helps people navigate the dreaded practice known as \"ghosting,\" or when someone abruptly cuts off communication with someone without providing any explanation.",
      "One reason people ghost others is that they don't know the best way to let someone down easy, Keepler co-founder and CEO Rachel Abramowitz, told CBS MoneyWatch. Keepler's defense against ghosting is Keri, the app's in-house relationship guide.",
      "\"What we've built is a way to put in your raw, unedited feedback to Keri. Keri will rewrite it for you, and then you can send it to somebody,\" Abramowitz said.",
      "For those who have been ghosted, Keepler also allows users to request feedback from their vanishing date directly through the app, or have Keri help them write a message to send on their own.",
      "Abramowitz emphasizes that the app isn't aimed at providing therapy, but rather is there to offer support. With Keri, \"It really does feel like you have someone who is objective, who is on your side, who has no ulterior motives and really wants you to help reach your goals,\" she said.",
      "Last-gen dating apps are also getting into the AI game. Hinge and Grindr, two of the most popular dating apps, are taking steps to integrate AI into their platforms. In January, for example, Hinge introduced Prompt Feedback, an AI feature that provides users with immediate feedback on their profiles as they enter information.",
      "AI icebreaker",
      "The growing popularity of AI dating assistants gives rise to questions over authenticity as more users rely on the technology to convey their thoughts and feelings.",
      "One 36-year old Rizz user, who asked to remain anonymous to protect his privacy, told CBS MoneyWatch he could see why some people might find using AI to communicate disingenuous, but said he sees the tech simply as a way to stand out from the crowd.",
      "He also acknowledged that some of his dates appeared skeptical after he revealed to them that he was getting behind-the-scenes coaching from Rizz. But he still thinks the service is helpful as a conversation starter.",
      "\"For me personally, it's good for just initiating conversation, getting someone's attention, and then being able to just be myself after that,\" he said.",
      "Killam, the social health and human connection expert, said she thinks AI dating tools can be useful as long as people don't misrepresent who they are or lean on them too much.",
      "\"The risk is when we use AI as a substitute for human connection, rather than a supplement to it,\" she said.",
      "The Associated  Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Israeli troops opened fire Saturday toward crowds of Palestinians seeking food from distribution hubs run by a\u00a0U.S.-, Israeli-backed group\u00a0in southern Gaza, killing at least 32 people, according to witnesses and hospital officials.",
      "The two incidents occurred near hubs operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. In other violence, two Palestinians were killed in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza City, health officials said.",
      "The GHF\u00a0launched operations in late May\u00a0with backing from the U.S. and Israel. The two governments are seeking to replace the traditional U.N.-led aid distribution system in Gaza, saying that Hamas militants siphon off supplies. The U.N. denies the allegation.",
      "While the GHF says it has distributed millions of meals to hungry Palestinians, local health officials and witnesses say that hundreds of people have been\u00a0killed by Israeli army fire\u00a0as they try to reach the distribution hubs.",
      "The army, which is not at the sites but secures them from a distance, says it only fires warning shots if crowds get too close to its forces.",
      "The GHF, which employs private armed guards, says there have been no deadly shootings at its sites, though this week, 20 people were killed at one of its locations, most of them in a stampede. The group accused Hamas agitators of causing a panic, but gave no evidence to back the claim.",
      "In a statement, the GHF said there were no incidents at or near its sites. It said the reported Israeli shootings occurred far from the sites and hours before they opened. \"We have repeatedly warned aid seekers not to travel to our sites overnight and early morning hours,\" it said.",
      "The Israeli military said it had fired \"warning shots\" near Rafah after a group of suspects approached troops and ignored calls to keep their distance. It said it was investigating reports of casualties, but noted the incident occurred overnight when the distribution site was closed.",
      "'Indiscriminate fire'",
      "Most of Saturday's deaths occurred as Palestinians massed in the Teina area, around two miles away from a GHF aid distribution center east of the city of Khan Younis.",
      "Mahmoud Mokeimar, an eyewitness, said he was walking with masses of people \u2014 mostly young men \u2014 toward the food hub. Troops fired warning shots as the crowds advanced, before opening fire toward the marching people.",

He said an airstrike hit a tent in a camp sheltering displaced families in the courtyard of the Development Ministry. There were no further details on the target of the strike.",

      "President Trump on Friday filed a libel lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal's publisher and its leader, Rupert Murdoch, after the paper published a story on what it called a \"bawdy\" birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein that the paper alleged was signed by Mr. Trump.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of Florida, seeks at least $10 billion in damages. It alleges the paper's claims were \"false, defamatory, unsubstantiated, and disparaging,\" and accuses the Journal of \"clear journalistic failures.\"",
      "The paper claimed the letter, from the early 2000s, featured Mr. Trump's signature as well as a birthday message and a drawing of a nude woman. According to the Journal's report, it was collected in a book along with letters from other friends and acquaintances to mark Epstein's 50th birthday in 2003. The president has denied the report, calling the letter a \"FAKE.\"",
      "The president has previously acknowledged he crossed paths with Epstein years ago, but has said they had a \"falling out.\"",
      "The suit names the Journal's publisher, Dow Jones & Company, along with its parent company, News Corporation. Also named in the lawsuit as defendants are Wall Street Journal reporters Joseph Palazzolo and Khadeeja Safdar, the bylines on the Epstein story, as well as Murdoch and Dow Jones CEO Robert Thomson.",
      "In a Truth Social post, Mr. Trump referred to it as a \"POWERHOUSE Lawsuit\" and a \"historic legal action.\"",
      "A Dow Jones spokesperson said in a statement: \"We have full confidence in the rigor and accuracy of our reporting, and will vigorously defend against any lawsuit.\"",
      "Defamation lawsuits face a high bar to success in U.S. courts. Typically, for a public figure to win a defamation suit, they need to demonstrate not only that false claims were made about them, but also that the defendant acted with \"actual malice,\" meaning that they knew the claims were false or acted with reckless disregard for the truth.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.",
      "Facing pressure to disclose more details on Epstein, who died in his jail cell in 2019 while facing sex trafficking charges, Mr. Trump on Thursday ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury testimony related to Epstein. The Justice Department late Friday filed a motion to unseal that grand jury testimony.",
      "Epstein was investigated by federal authorities in Florida in the 2000s, which ended in a non-prosecution agreement and a guilty plea on state prostitution charges, and he was later charged with child sex trafficking in Manhattan in 2019. The government also secured a conviction against Epstein's co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell. It investigated the circumstances of Epstein's death in federal custody, which was deemed a suicide.",
      "The order from Mr. Trump comes after the Justice Department and FBI released a memo stating that Epstein did not have an incriminating \"client list,\" did not try to blackmail any prominent figures, and died by suicide. The memo drew backlash from across the political spectrum, including from some fervent Trump backers, in part because Bondi and other administration figures had promised to release information on Epstein.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump signed a landmark bill to regulate cryptocurrency on Friday, hailing the \"exciting new frontier\" for the technology one day after the bill passed the House.",
      "The legislation, called the GENIUS Act, is the first major law governing digital currency, and establishes a regulatory framework for the $250 billion stablecoin market. Stablecoins are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency since their value is pegged to other assets, like the dollar. The bill passed the House on Thursday with the support of 206 Republicans and 102 Democrats.",
      "\"We worked hard. It's a very important act, the GENIUS Act. They named it after me,\" the president joked in the East Room of the White House. \"I want to thank you. This is a hell of an act.\"",
      "Members of Congress and top executives from Robinhood, Tether, Gemini and other crypto and financial firms were in attendance for the signing ceremony.",
      "The fate of the GENIUS Act was in question earlier this week when a dozen conservatives stymied a procedural vote. A compromise was ultimately reached, and the holdouts allowed the legislation to proceed. The president on Friday suggested that he spoke to the holdouts individually on the phone to persuade them, after House Speaker Mike Johnson told him there were a dozen Republicans opposing the bill.",
      "\"The good news is, I call up, 'Hello, Jim, how are you?' 'Sir, you have my vote.' Boom. 'Sir, you have my vote.' I really just, they just want a little love,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, it's always the same 12 people.\"",
      "David Sacks, the venture capitalist-turned Mr. Trump's AI and crypto czar, said the president \"stepped in and saved this bill.\" Mr. Trump also said Vice President JD Vance had been on the phone late at night, helping push the legislation through.",
      "What is the GENIUS Act?",
      "The GENIUS Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) establishes guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins. The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "With the GENIUS Act signed into law, banks, nonbanks and credit unions can dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "\"Just as I promised last year, the GENIUS Act creates a clear and simple regulatory framework to establish and unleash the immense promise of dollar-backed stablecoins,\" Mr. Trump said. \"This could be, perhaps, the greatest revolution in financial technology since the birth of the Internet itself. A lot of people are saying that.\"",
      "The president said the GENIUS Act provides banks and other financial institutions a framework for issuing crypto assets backed \"one-for-one\" with real U.S. dollars and Treasury bills, \"strengthening the dollar\" and allowing the entire U.S. financial system to be eligible for a \"21st-century upgrade.\"",
      "Lawmakers also approved two other cryptocurrency bills, capping what Republicans dubbed \"Crypto Week\" in Congress. The Clarity Act will regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act prevents the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans. The legislation is seen by the Trump administration and the crypto community as a way of bringing digital currency into the mainstream financial system.",
      "\"Let me say, the entire crypto community, for years, you were mocked and dismissed and counted out,\" the president said. \"You were counted out as little as a year and a half ago. But this signing is a massive validation.\"",
      "The Trump family's crypto investments have increased their wealth in recent months as the administration alters its regulatory approach to digital currency. The White House has insisted there is no conflict of interest, and the president's assets are in a trust managed by his children. Key crypto figures who were present Friday, including Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, backed Mr. Trump's campaign last year.",
      "The president on Friday also touted his decision to pardon Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the internet marketplace Silk Road who was sentenced to life in prison in 2015.",
      "The GENIUS Act wasn't the only bill that had House Republicans wringing their hands this week. The chamber also approved a request from the president to claw back about $9 billion in funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting in a late-night vote, signing off on changes the Senate made to the bill, known as a rescissions package, earlier this week.",
      "Passage of the funding cuts was held up this week over Democratic efforts to force the release of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Ultimately, the package passed the House along party lines, with two Republicans joining Democrats to vote against it. The bill claws back about $8 billion for foreign assistance efforts, including by the the U.S. Agency for International Development, and about $1 billion for public radio and television stations. The president is expected to sign it soon.",
      "\"REPUBLICANS HAVE TRIED DOING THIS FOR 40 YEARS, AND FAILED\u2026.BUT NO MORE,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, referring to cutting funding to the corporation that oversees federal funds for NPR and PBS. \"THIS IS BIG!!!\"",
      "Friday's signing ceremony for the GENIUS Act took place against the backdrop of increased focus on the Epstein case. On Thursday evening, Mr. Trump ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury material related to Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died in federal custody in 2019. Mr. Trump has faced increasing pressure to disclose more information about the case after the Justice Department said no further documents would be released following a review of the evidence.",
      "\"Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!\"",
      "Bondi said the Justice Department is \"ready to move the court tomorrow to unseal the grand jury transcripts.\" A judge will make the final call on whether the material can be made public, and the process could take weeks or months.",

      "He also confirmed ICE plans to use data from government programs like Medicaid to locate immigrants suspected of living in the U.S. illegally, including those with criminal histories.",
      "Pressed on concerns about masked ICE officers and the possibility that imposters could exploit the practice by posing as immigration agents, Lyons said, \"That's one of our biggest concerns. And I've said it publicly before, I'm not a proponent of the masks.\"",
      "\"However, if that's a tool that the men and women of ICE to keep themselves and their family safe, then I will allow it,\" Lyons said during his first television network sit-down interview at ICE headquarters in Washington. \"I do kind of push back on the criticism that they don't identify themselves.\"",
      "Asked if he will allow ICE personnel to wear masks, Lyons said, \"I will.\"",
      "More of the interview with Lyons will air on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, July 20, at 10:30 a.m. ET.",
      "Lyons cited the increase in attacks faced by agents at ICE, the agency at the center of President Trump's promise of carrying out the largest deportation operation in American history.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has said attacks against ICE officials have increased by more than 800% this year compared to the same time period in 2024. Numerous instances of violence directed at ICE agents and facilities have occurred in recent weeks, including an armed attack against a detention center in Texas earlier this month that has led to more than a dozen arrests.",
      "Lyons agreed the increase in attacks faced by ICE agents could be partially attributed to the dramatic expansion in immigration arrests under the second Trump administration, acknowledging that the agency is \"more visible in the community.\"",
      "But he argued his agents are being forced to go into communities more often to arrest individuals living in the U.S. illegally, including those with criminal records, because more cities and states have adopted \"sanctuary\" policies that limit local law enforcement cooperation with ICE. Those policies lead many jurisdictions to refrain from notifying ICE when they release inmates who are also in the U.S. illegally.",
      "\"So you are seeing us out more, and I think there is more of a tension,\" Lyons added. \"The immigration mission is one of the forefront of this administration, so it is a lot of scrutiny and publicity to it.\"",
      "Lyons says Medicaid data will be used to \"locate\" those in the U.S. illegally",
      "CBS News also asked Lyons about a report from the Associated Press that an inter-agency agreement had granted ICE access to the personal information of millions of Medicaid enrollees, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers and data on patients' race and ethnicity.",
      "Lyons said ICE is \"working with all of our other federal partners to try to gain intelligence, to locate these individuals that have been ordered deported by a judge or have been released from a sanctuary jurisdiction like we talked about. That is what ICE is using that data for.\"",
      "He cited the \"many\" so-called \"got-ways\" who entered the U.S. illegally without getting caught under the Biden administration and \"just totally disappeared off the grid.\"",
      "Lyons suggested ICE would use different datasets, including from the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services, to locate the \"worst of the worst\" and those ordered deported from the U.S.",

    "summary": "Americans are starting back-to-school shopping earlier this year out of concern over tariffs, according to a new study.",
    "story": [
      "The back-to-school season may seem at least a month away on the calendar, but for a majority of American families, it's already begun.",
      "Two-thirds of back-to-school shoppers have already started buying clothing and supplies ahead of the new school year \u2014 a 55% increase on the level of early purchases last year.",
      "That's according to a new\u00a0survey from the National Retail Federation (NRF), which indicates that students and their parents are getting an early start on shopping this year, hunting for deals as they navigate\u00a0economic uncertainty. More than half of consumers surveyed, 51%, cited concerns over tariffs as the reason why they were starting school shopping earlier this year.",
      "\"Consumers are being mindful of the potential impacts of tariffs and inflation on back-to-school items, and have turned to early shopping, discount stores and summer sales for savings on school essentials,\" Katherine Cullen, NRF vice president of industry and consumer insights, said in a statement.",
      "The price of school supplies and books has already reached an all-time high, data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis\u00a0shows. However, consumers worry that the cost of items could go up even more once the full brunt of President Trump's tariffs take effect.",
      "Mr. Trump recently announced on Truth Social that he would\u00a0place steep tariffs\u00a0on over 20 countries, starting on Aug. 1. The levies could directly impact the cost of apparel and other\u00a0back-to-school items\u00a0like electronics that are imported from abroad.",
      "In its report, the NRF predicts families will spend a total of $128.2 billion on supplies this year, up from $125.4 billion last year. The increase, however, reflects an increase in the number of consumers shopping for back-to-school supplies, and not individual spending, which is expected to be lower this year.",
      "Families with students in kindergarten through high school plan to spend an average of $858.07 on school-related items this year, down from $874.68 in 2024, according to the study. College students and their parents also plan to spend less this year \u2014 an average of $1,325.85, down from $1,364.75 in 2024.",
      "Four in five shoppers said they were planning their shopping around July back-to-school sales to maximize their budgets, the NRF report found.",
      "Retailers focus on sales",
      "With inflation and tariffs top of mind for many consumers, stores are already promoting back-to-school discounts to lure shoppers.",
      "\"As shoppers look for the best deals on clothes, notebooks and other school-related items, retailers are highly focused on affordability and making the shopping experience as seamless as possible,\" NRF's Cullen said.",
      "Amazon, Target and Walmart\u00a0are each offering back-to-school summer sales to entice customers. Amazon last week completed its four-day Prime Day event, which offered thousands of\u00a0deals on everything from backpacks to dorm furnishings to laptops.",
      "Walmart on Tuesday\u00a0announced\u00a0lower prices on 14 of the most popular back-to-school supplies compared with last year. A survey by the retail giant found that 70% of its customers said they planned to spend more time this year searching for discounts.",
      "\"Regardless of income, families want to ensure their students are set up for success,\" said Phil Rist, executive vice president of strategy at analytics firm Prosper, said in a statement. \"They are cutting back in other areas, using buy now, pay later or buying used or refurbished items to have everything they need for the school year.\"",

    "summary": "The ruling targets a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule that would have removed medical debt from 15 million credit reports.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge has blocked a rule issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in January that would have removed unpaid medical debt from the credit reports of about 15 million consumers.",
      "The ruling, issued Friday by Judge Sean Jordan of the U.S. District Court of Texas' Eastern District, orders that the rule be vacated because of the court's finding that the CFPB exceeded its authority under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. After the CFPB issued the rule in January, the Cornerstone Credit Union League and the Consumer Data Industry Association, a trade group for the credit reporting industry, had filed a lawsuit to halt it.",
      "The court's decision could impact the roughly 15 million people who carry a total of about $49 billion in medical debt on their credit reports, a burden that can influence whether lenders decide whether to extend loans like mortgages or auto loans to consumers. At the time when the CFPB issued the rule, the agency noted that medical debt is a poor predictor of whether a consumer will make good on other types of loans.",
      "\"It doesn't show whether they are likely to pay their mortgage or other debts because there are a lot of inaccuracies and they have a lot of disputes,\" Julie Margetta Morgan, former associate director of research, monitoring and regulations at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The CFPB's rule had been hailed by consumer advocates for helping to protect consumers who can get tangled up in complicated issues around medical debt, such as problems with insurance reimbursements, denials and other snafus.",
      "\"By pulling back on this rule, the court has eliminated the CFPB's ability to provide that kind of relief to people and give this certainty that they can work with their health care provider to make sure the bills they are paying are accurate, without being hounded by a debt collector,\" added Margetta Morgan, who currently serves as the president of The Century Foundation, a left-leaning policy think tank.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "What does the ruling say about medical debt and credit reports?",
      "Jordan ruled that the \"medical debt rule exceeds the [CFBP]'s statutory authority by violating the plain text\" of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or FCRA, a 1970 law that oversees credit reporting.",
      "\"The rule exceeded the CFPB's statutory authority because FCRA explicitly allows credit reporting agencies to report, and creditors to obtain and use, information about medical debt that is properly coded to obscure the name of the provider and the nature of the services provided,\" Dan Smith, CEO of the Consumer Data Industry Association, said in a July 11\u00a0statement.",
      "Had the CFPB rule gone into effect?",
      "No, the rule hadn't yet gone into effect, according to Jordan's ruling.",
      "While the rule was slated to take effect about 60 days after it was published, the CFPB asked for a three-month delay after the Trump administration put new leadership at its helm, the decision noted. That request was granted by the court as the lawsuit to block the rule moved forward.",
      "Could the court decision be appealed?",
      "It's unclear. While the CFPB could appeal in theory, the agency is now essentially in a state of limbo.",
      "In February, President Trump appointed White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought as acting director of the CFPB. Days after his appointment, Vought issued a memo to CFPB staff that directed employees not to issue any proposed or formal rules, stop pending investigations and not open new investigations, among other actions.",
      "What steps are available to consumers with medical debt?",
      "According to the CFPB, 20% of Americans has at least one medical debt collection account on their credit reports, while and over half of the collections on credit reports are for medical debt.",
      "In some states, consumers can rely on government protections to help them with medical debt and their credit reports, Morgan noted. Colorado and New York both enacted laws in 2023 that provide some protections for consumers who have medical debt, for instance.",
      "And last year, Experian, Equifax and TransUnion, the three national credit reporting agencies, said that they were removing medical collections debt under $500 from U.S. consumer credit reports.",
      "\"From my experience reading these accounts from consumers, there are a lot of flaws in our medical billing and reporting system, and it lands in the consumer's lap and they are supposed to try to figure out how to deal with it,\" Morgan said. \"I would make sure the bills you receive are accurate,\" as well as check whether your insurer is paying the correct amount, she added.",

    "published": "Mon, 14 Jul 2025 16:47:33 -0400",
    "summary": "The tax and spending bill signed into law by President Trump on July 4 includes a limited tax break for car buyers.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of car buyers in the U.S. could soon get some tax relief thanks to a provision in the so-called \"big, beautiful bill\" that was signed into law on July 4 by President Trump.",
      "The idea of giving a tax break for auto purchasers was first floated by Mr. Trump while on the campaign trail in October, when he promised that such a measure would \"make car ownership dramatically more affordable for millions and millions of working American families.\"",
      "That promise has now materialized as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, with the new tax break taking effect for car purchases starting in 2025. But the deduction also has income limitations that narrow the number of Americans who can claim it, while used car buyers and vehicle leasers do not benefit.",
      "Still, car buyers who have bought a new vehicle this year or are planning to do so in the next four years may get some tax relief when they file their 2025 tax returns. The deduction will expire in 2028, which means car buyers can only take advantage of the benefit for four tax years.",
      "At the same time, the One Big Beautiful Act eliminates the federal tax credit for electric vehicles after Sept. 30. The tax break, which provides a $7,500 for new EVs and a $4,000 credit for used EVs, is credited with helping make electric vehicles more affordable for many buyers.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "How much is the new auto loan deduction?",
      "The new tax cuts and spending law enables car buyers to deduct up to $10,000 in \"qualified passenger vehicle loan interest during a given taxable year,\" beginning with 2025 purchases.",
      "While that's similar to the mortgage interest deduction available to homeowners, there is one major difference: Car buyers will be able to itemize their auto loan interest even if they take the standard deduction. By comparison, the mortgage interest deduction is only available to taxpayers who itemize.",
      "Which vehicles qualify for the deduction?",
      "The tax break applies to the purchase of new cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds (referred to as light vehicles). Used cars don't qualify.",
      "To qualify for the deduction, a vehicle also must be assembled in the U.S., which further limits the tax break.",
      "The deduction also only applies to vehicles purchased for personal use, not for fleets or commercial purposes. And it excludes autos that are leased, which represent about one-quarter of all auto sales in the U.S., according to Experian.",
      "What are the income limits for the auto loan deduction?",
      "The full break can only be claimed by single taxpayers with a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) of $100,000 or less or married couples with a MAGI of $200,000 or less.",
      "Modified adjusted gross income is your adjusted gross income, which can be found on line 11 of your 1040 tax return, with some items like savings bond interest added back in, according to the IRS.",
      "Under the new law, the auto loan deduction shrinks for people with MAGIs above those thresholds, with the amount reduced by $200 for each $1,000 in income above those levels. The deduction is completely phased out for single filers earning above $150,000 and married couples with incomes above $250,000.",
      "How many Americans will qualify for the car loan deduction?",
      "An estimated 3.5 million new vehicle loans could be eligible for the tax break this year if purchasing patterns stay the same and after excluding commercial vehicles and customers above the income cutoff, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.",
      "About 60% of the 15.9 million new light vehicles sold last year were financed with auto loans, according to Cox data.",
      "How much will the car loan deduction save on my taxes?",
      "That depends on the size of your auto loan and whether you fall below the income thresholds for the new tax break, but the typical car buyer could save hundreds per year on their taxes.",
      "The average new vehicle loan is about $44,000 financed over six years. Interest rates vary by customer, so the savings will, too. In general, the tax deduction will decline after the initial year because interest payments on loans are front-loaded, while principal payments grow on the back end.",
      "Car buyers who qualify for an auto loan rate of about 6.5%, typically available to consumers with high credit scores, could deduct $3,000 in the first year of owning their car and about $1,800 per year after that for the remainder of the loan,\u00a0according to the American Financial Services Association, a consumer credit industry trade group.",
      "Deductions reduce a filer's taxable income, which helps lower their tax burden. For instance, someone in the 22% tax bracket could save $660 on their taxes by claiming a $3,000 auto loan deduction.",
      "At a 9.3% interest rate \u2014 typical of people with subprime credit scores \u2014 an average new vehicle buyer could save about $2,200 on taxes over four years, Smoke said.",

      "The two incidents occurred near hubs operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. In other violence, two Palestinians were killed in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza City, health officials said.",
      "The GHF\u00a0launched operations in late May\u00a0with backing from the U.S. and Israel. The two governments are seeking to replace the traditional U.N.-led aid distribution system in Gaza, saying that Hamas militants siphon off supplies. The U.N. denies the allegation.",
      "While the GHF says it has distributed millions of meals to hungry Palestinians, local health officials and witnesses say that hundreds of people have been\u00a0killed by Israeli army fire\u00a0as they try to reach the distribution hubs.",
      "The army, which is not at the sites but secures them from a distance, says it only fires warning shots if crowds get too close to its forces.",
      "The GHF, which employs private armed guards, says there have been no deadly shootings at its sites, though this week, 20 people were killed at one of its locations, most of them in a stampede. The group accused Hamas agitators of causing a panic, but gave no evidence to back the claim.",
      "In a statement, the GHF said there were no incidents at or near its sites. It said the reported Israeli shootings occurred far from the sites and hours before they opened. \"We have repeatedly warned aid seekers not to travel to our sites overnight and early morning hours,\" it said.",
      "The Israeli military said it had fired \"warning shots\" near Rafah after a group of suspects approached troops and ignored calls to keep their distance. It said it was investigating reports of casualties, but noted the incident occurred overnight when the distribution site was closed.",
      "'Indiscriminate fire'",
      "Most of Saturday's deaths occurred as Palestinians massed in the Teina area, around two miles away from a GHF aid distribution center east of the city of Khan Younis.",
      "Mahmoud Mokeimar, an eyewitness, said he was walking with masses of people \u2014 mostly young men \u2014 toward the food hub. Troops fired warning shots as the crowds advanced, before opening fire toward the marching people.",
      "\"It was a massacre \u2026 the occupation opened fire at us indiscriminately,\" he said. He said he managed to flee but saw at least three motionless bodies lying on the ground, and many other wounded fleeing.",
      "Akram Aker, another witness, said troops fired machine guns mounted on tanks and drones. He said the shooting happened between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m.",
      "\"They encircled us and started firing directly at us,\" he said. He said he saw many casualties lying on the ground.",

      "\"We shouted: 'food, food,' but they didn't talk to us. They just opened fire,\" she said.",

      "\"He went to bring food from the failed US, Zionist aid to feed us,\" the father of six said, pleading for the Jordanian government to help evacuate them from the Palestinian enclave.",
      "The Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis said it received 25 bodies, along with dozens wounded.",
      "Seven other people, including one woman, were killed in the Shakoush area, hundreds of meters (yards) north of another GHF hub in Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah, the hospital said. The toll was also confirmed by the health ministry.",
      "Dr. Mohamed Saker, the head of Nasser's nursing department, said it received 70 wounded people. He told The Associated Press that most of the casualties were shot in their heads and chests, and that some were placed in the already overwhelmed intensive care unit.",
      "\"The situation is difficult and tragic,\" he said, adding that the facility lacks badly needed medical supplies to treat the daily flow of casualties.",
      "Meanwhile, Fares Awad, head of the Health Ministry's ambulance and emergency service in northern Gaza, confirmed the two deaths in Gaza City. He said an airstrike hit a tent in a camp sheltering displaced families in the courtyard of the Development Ministry. There were no further details on the target of the strike.",
      "The Israeli army said it had struck some 90 targets throughout Gaza over the past day and that it had killed militants and targeted \"terror infrastructure\" in northern Gaza and Gaza City.",
      "Humanitarian crisis",
      "Gaza's more than 2 million Palestinians are living through a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, and the territory is teetering on the edge of famine, according to food security experts.",
      "Distribution at the GHF sites has often been chaotic. Boxes of food are left stacked on the ground inside the centers and, once opened, crowds charge in to grab whatever they can, according to witnesses and videos released by GHF itself.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Jul 2025 21:07:04 -0400",
    "summary": "Felix Baumgartner made global headlines in 2012 when he jumped from the stratosphere and parachuted down to a landing in New Mexico.",
    "story": [
      "Felix Baumgartner, the daredevil who made a record-breaking parachute jump from the stratosphere in 2012, died Thursday in a paragliding accident in Italy, a local mayor confirmed. Firefighters who responded to the scene said they found a paraglider that had crashed into the side of a swimming pool in the city of Porto Sant Elpidio, on central Italy's eastern coast.",
      "\"Our community is deeply affected by the tragic disappearance of Felix Baumgartner, a figure of global prominence, a symbol of courage and passion for extreme flight,\" the town's mayor, Massimiliano Ciarpella, said on Facebook. Ciarpella told The Associated Press that the extreme athlete had been in the area on vacation.",
      "Witnesses told The Associated Press they heard a loud boom as the paraglider spun out of control. Mirella Ivanov, 30, told AP she was in the area with her two young children when they saw the paraglider lose control.",
      "\"Everything was normal, then it started to spin like a top,\" Ivanov said Friday. \"It went down and we heard a roar. In fact, I turned around because I thought it crashed on the rocks.\"",
      "Baumgartner, 56, made global headlines in 2012 when he was lifted into the stratosphere, about 24 miles up, in a capsule carried by a helium balloon, and then parachuted down to a landing in New Mexico. During the jump, he broke the record for fastest free fall, descending at about 843.6 mph and becoming the first human to break the sound barrier without the assistance of a vehicle.",
      "Originally from Austria, Baumgartner began skydiving at age 16 and further honed his skills in the Austrian military, according to his personal website. In 1988, he teamed up with Red Bull, which sponsored the stratosphere jump under the Stratos project and many other daring feats.",
      "The training and planning for the 2012 Stratos jump took five years. Among the records Baumgartner would break that day was highest jump, which had been held by Air Force Capt. Joe Kittinger since 1960, when he leapt from an open-air gondola basket that rose to 102,000 feet. Kittinger would go on to train Baumgartner for the record-breaking Stratos jump. (Baumgartner's height record was broken two years later.)",
      "In addition to skydiving, Baumgartner was an accomplished BASE jumper, breaking two records in 1999: highest BASE jump and lowest BASE jump. The low jump, which he took from one of the hands of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, was only 95 feet. The high jump was taken from the 88th floor of the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, although that record has since been broken and is currently held by the late Valery Rozov, who jumped from Cho Oyu in 2016.",
      "Baumgartner was also a helicopter pilot and was part of Red Bull's aerial acrobatics team.",
      "\"Ever since I was a child, I have always wanted to jump out of a plane,\" Baumgartner told Red Bull in an interview after becoming a licensed helicopter pilot.",
      "\"For Red Bull Stratos, we had a very long list of 'what ifs,' in other words eventualities that could happen and how we would deal with them in an emergency. The list kept getting longer and longer. I was only afraid of the things that were not on the list. The things we had not thought of,\" he told Red Bull, adding: \"To this day, I abort missions if the conditions are not right.\"",
      "While Baumgartner's stunts inspired millions, his political views were known to cause controversy. On social media, he mocked climate activists and others who sought to limit the effects of climate change, and voiced opposition to LGBTQ rights, according to the AFP news agency. He also once suggested Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n should receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-immigration policies.",

      "The U.S. has warned Americans against traveling to Venezuela or near its borders, citing the risks of wrongful detention.",
      "\"Until today, more Americans were wrongfully held in Venezuela than any other country in the world,\" Rubio said in a statement that credited \"President Trump's leadership and commitment to the American people.\"",
      "\"Every wrongfully detained American in Venezuela is now free and back in our homeland,\" Rubio added.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in Venezuela posted a photo of the freed Americans with U.S. diplomat John McNamara.",
      "As part of the deal, the Venezuelan government also released dozens of people who were described as Venezuelan political prisoners and detainees, a senior administration official said.",

      "The Trump administration deported more than 200 male Venezuelan citizens to El Salvador in March, accusing them of being part of the transnational gang Tren De Aragua. Mr. Trump invoked an 18th-century wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act, to order officials to quickly deport many of the Venezuelan migrants, deeming them a threat to the U.S. The Salvadoran government has held many of the detainees in a supermax prison called the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.",
      "In May, the Supreme Court extended a pause on deportations of Venezuelan migrants detained in northern Texas while they challenge their removals under the wartime law.",
      "Some of the families of the Venezuelan deportees have denied that they have gang connections, and a \"60 Minutes\" investigation in April found that most of the detainees did not have criminal convictions.",
      "The Venezuelan government confirmed Friday's swap, saying in a statement it \"has achieved the release of the 252 Venezuelan citizens who remained kidnapped and subjected to forced disappearance in a concentration camp, known as CECOT, in the Republic of El Salvador.\"",
      "Officials describe \"down-to-the-wire\" deal",
      "A senior administration official said the deal with El Salvador and Venezuela was \"essentially down to the wire.\" The flight carrying the detainees took off from Venezuela at around 3:40 p.m. ET and left Venezuelan airspace at around 3:55 p.m. The official alleged the Venezuelan government took \"one last stand\" by briefly delaying Friday's swap as a \"power flex.\"",
      "The prisoner swap was arranged as Venezuela faces intense U.S. sanctions that limit the country's once-lucrative oil industry, and came one day after the Trump administration imposed sanctions on six leaders and affiliates of Tren de Aragua.

    "summary": "Content promoting extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery is available to young TikTok users, breaching the social media platform's policies.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were easily found with a simple search on TikTok and available to a user under the age of 18, in violation of the platform's own policies, CBS News has found.",
      "CBS News created a TikTok account for a hypothetical 15-year-old female user in the United States and found that, at the very least, hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were searchable and watchable on the platform using the account.",
      "Once the CBS News account interacted with a handful of these videos, similar content was then recommended to the account on TikTok's \"For You\" feed.",
      "Searchable videos ranged from content with captions such as, \"nothing feels better than an empty stomach,\" to \"what I eat in a day\" videos promoting restrictive, 500-calorie-per-day diets. Guidelines published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health suggest that girls between the ages of 14 and 18 ingest between 1,800 and 2,400 calories per day.",
      "Many of the videos promoted thin body types as aspirational targets and included the hashtag \"harsh motivation\" to push extreme weight loss advice.",
      "Some of those videos included messages or slogans such as \"skinny is a status symbol\" and \"every time you say no to food, you say yes to skinny.\"",
      "TikTok's community guidelines say the platform only allows users over the age of 18 to see content promoting restrictive, low-calorie diets, including videos promoting medications for weight loss or idealizing certain body types. The Chinese-owned platform also says it bans users under the age of 18 from viewing videos that promote cosmetic surgery without warning of the risks, such as before-and-after images, videos of surgical procedures, and messages discussing elective cosmetic surgery.",
      "But CBS News found a range of videos by entering basic search terms on the platform, such as \"skinny,\" \"thin,\" and \"low cal,\" that promoted thin bodies as ideal, while also pushing harmful weight management behaviors. One such video showed an image of a scale with a weight of 39.9 kg (88 pounds) alongside a caption saying \"weight loss\" and the hashtag \"ed,\" which is a common abbreviation for \"eating disorder.\"",
      "Another graphic video with the caption \"ana gives you wings\" showed a series of models with protruding collar bones and spines. The term \"ana\" is an abbreviation for the eating disorder anorexia.",
      "Responding to CBS News' research, a TikTok spokesperson said Thursday that it was \"based on a very limited sample size and does not reflect the experience of the vast majority of our community.\"",
      "\"TikTok does not allow content that promotes disordered eating or extreme weight loss behaviours, and we work with health experts to provide in-app support resources where needed,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The spokesperson pointed to a study published in May by the University of Southern California, which found that a majority of the eating disorder content on TikTok is discussion among users about recovery from such conditions.",
      "The same study noted, however, the platform's \"dual role in both challenging harmful cultural norms and potentially perpetuating them,\" regarding body image perceptions and eating disorders.",
      "\"We know that this isn't a one-off error on TikTok's part and that children are coming across this content on a scale,\" said Gareth Hill, a spokesperson for the Molly Russell foundation, a charity in the United Kingdom that works to prevent young people from committing self-harm.",
      "\"The question for TikTok is, if this is not representative, then why has this account [created by CBS News], which is a child's account, been shown this content in the first place, and then why is it continuing to get recommended to it?\"",
      "CBS News also found a wide variety of videos available to the under-18 user promoting the weight loss drug Ozempic and various forms of cosmetic surgery. That included videos that showed up on the recommended \"For You\" feed, which promotes cosmetic surgeries such as rhinoplasty, breast augmentation, and liposuction.",
      "In one case, a user talking about their waist reduction surgery included a voiceover saying: \"I would rather die hot than live ugly.\"",
      "A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment specifically on CBS News' findings regarding cosmetic surgeries being promoted to underage users.",
      "TikTok says it has taken a range of measures over the past several months to address criticism regarding the availability of extreme weight loss content on the platform. In early June, the platform suspended search results for the viral hashtag #SkinnyTok, after drawing criticism from health experts and European regulators. The hashtag had been associated primarily with videos promoting extreme weight loss, calorie restriction and negative body talk, often presented as wellness advice.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson also told CBS News on Thursday that searches for words or phrases such as #Anorexia would lead users to relevant assistance, including localized eating disorder helplines, where they can access further information and support.",
      "\"I think we're understanding more and more about how this content shows up and so even when you ban a particular hashtag, for example, it's not long until something similar jumps up in its place,\" Doreen Marshall, who leads the American nonprofit National Eating Disorders Association [NEDA], told CBS News.",
      "\"This is going to be an evolving landscape both for creating content guidelines, but also for the platforms themselves and, you know, while some progress has been made, there's clearly more that can be done,\" Marshall said.",
      "TikTok is not the only social media platform that has faced criticism for the accessibility of extreme weight loss content.",
      "In 2022, 60 Minutes reported on a leaked internal document from Meta that showed the company was aware, through its own research, of content on its Instagram platform promoting extreme weight loss and fueling eating disorders in young people.",
      "At the time, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, declined 60 Minutes' request for an interview but its global head of safety, Antigone Davis, said, \"We want teens to be safe online\" and that Instagram doesn't \"allow content promoting self-harm or eating disorders.\"",
      "Last year, 60 Minutes reported that the Google-owned YouTube video platform, which is hugely popular among teenagers, was also serving up extreme weight loss and eating disorder content to children.",

    "story": [
      "It is one of history's most intriguing \"murders\" \u2014 the mysterious disappearance over five centuries ago of two young princes from the Tower of London.",
      "Nearly 200 years after they disappeared, two small skeletons were found in a wooden box at the historic tower and reburied at Westminster Abbey.",
      "The remains were believed, but never proved, to be those of the two brothers \u2014 heir to the throne Edward, 12, and Richard, 9, the sons of King Edward IV of England, who were reputedly murdered at the behest of their uncle, Richard Duke of Gloucester.",
      "William Shakespeare later immortalized him in Richard III as a scheming hunchback who did away with his royal nephews so he could take the crown himself, sealing his reputation as a child killer.",
      "Now British author Philippa Langley, who helped unearth Richard's body from a central England parking lot in 2012, has claimed that the princes \u2014 far from being killed \u2014 actually survived.",
      "The elder prince, Edward, was heir to the throne at the time of his disappearance and would have ruled as King Edward V of England.",
      "Langley decided to delve into the mystery after coming to believe that the conventional narrative in which Richard had the young princes killed smacked of \"history being written by the victors.\"",
      "She was finally spurred into action after reading an article about Richard's reburial at Leicester Cathedral in 2015 which questioned whether the nation should honor a \"child killer.\"",
      "\"I think I'd always realized that the story sort of developed during the reign of the Tudors,\" she said, adding that it was then \"repeated and repeated over time\" until it became \"truth and fact.\"",
      "Historical \"whodunnit\"",
      "The last English king to die in battle, Richard ruled from 1483 until his brutal death at the Battle of Bosworth near Leicester in 1485, aged 32.",
      "Bosworth was the last major conflict in the Wars of the Roses and changed the course of English history because the Tudor dynasty of Henry VII captured the crown from Richard's Plantagenets.",
      "Langley attributes the accepted story that Richard had the boys murdered to King Henry VII, a \"very, very intelligent individual, but suspicious and highly paranoid.\"",
      "\"He had a massive spy network working for him. And he was able to completely control the narrative,\" she said, adding that Richard ended up \"covered in Tudor mud.\"",
      "Taking a cold case review approach to the historical \"whodunnit,\" Langley says she assembled a group of investigative specialists, including police and lawyers, to advise her.",
      "\"They said: 'Look, if you haven't got any confirmed, identified bodies, then it has to be a missing persons investigation and you have to follow that methodology.' They said: 'You have to actively look for evidence,'\" Langley said. \"That's when it really started to get interesting.\"",
      "Langley put out an appeal for volunteers to scour archives and was inundated with offers of help from people ranging from ordinary citizens to medieval historians.",
      "The result was the decade-long Missing Princes Project, which she says unearthed a significant amount of information pointing to the survival of both young princes.",
      "\"History's greatest cold case\"",
      "Langley now believes that it is up to Richard's detractors to disprove the survival thesis, which she outlines in the new book \"The Princes in the Tower: How History's Greatest Cold Case Was Solved.\"",
      "\"The onus is now on them to find the evidence that the boys died,\" she said. \"They cannot say Richard III murdered the princes in the tower any more because we found numerous proofs of life everywhere.\"",
      "Key to Langley's conviction that both boys survived are documents discovered supporting a rebellion by \"Edward IV's son.\"",
      "During the rebellion in 1487, Lambert Simnel, a pretender to the throne who came forward after Richard's death, was crowned in Dublin.",
      "According to fresh references found by the project, the boy was \"called\" or said to be \"a son of King Edward,\" which she believes points to Simnel being the elder prince, son of Edward IV.",
      "The reaction to Langley's research has been mixed.",
      "Michael Dobson, director and a professor of Shakespeare studies at the University of Birmingham's Shakespeare Institute, expressed skepticism.",
      "\"Given the ways of dynastic monarchy, I think Richard would have been taking a very big risk in leaving those princes alive,\" he said. \"The chances of their having accidentally gone missing while incarcerated on his orders in the Tower of London seem pretty remote.\"",
      "Langley, a mother of two, initially became interested in Richard III in 1998 after reading a biography that questioned the Shakespearean portrayal of him, the BBC reported.",
      "She authored the book\u00a0\"The Lost King: The Search for Richard III,\"\u00a0co-written with Michael Jones, which chronicles her search for Richard III's lost remains.",

      "\"Bibi Netanyahu is not a terrorist,\" she said, using a common nickname for the Israeli leader. \"He's a good man with a heart and wants good for his country.\"",
      "The Siegels have become two of Israel's most prominent former hostages, using their freedom to remind the world often of the 50 people still believed to be held captive in Gaza. Netanyahu said earlier this month that 20 of those hostages are still thought to be alive.",
      "The Siegels lived in the progressive-leaning kibbutz Kfar Aza, less than two miles from the Gaza border in southern Israel. Many residents in the area have a history of supporting the peace movement and coexistence with Palestinians.",
      "Keith Siegel has been adamant during indirect Israel-Hamas negotiations, which the U.S. is helping to broker along with Qatar and Egypt, that a new deal \"must be signed.\"",
      "\"I am alive because of President Trump's efforts that secured an agreement, and also the cooperation and the efforts of my government and the mediating countries,\" he told CBS News. \"We are home. We are alive because of agreements that were signed, and another agreement must be signed to get all of the 50 back home as soon as possible.\"",
      "Among the ideas being debated is a controversial proposal floated by Israel's far-right defense minister to move all of Gaza's roughly 2 million residents into a compact, \"humanitarian city\" along the Palestinian territory's southern border with Egypt, from which they would not be permitted to leave.",
      "Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, a fierce critic of the Netanyahu government, has drawn parallels to the Nazi horrors perpetrated against Jewish people during WWII, slamming the idea of what he said would be \"a concentration camp\" for Palestinians.",
      "The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health said Friday that more than 58,000 people had been killed in the war. The steadily rising death toll \u2014 which cannot be independently verified as Israel does not permit foreign journalists into Gaza \u2014 has led to accusations of a genocide being carried out.",
      "Aviva Siegel, asked if she believed the term was fair to use in relation to Israel's actions in the Gaza Strip, said \"Hamas is responsible\" for everything happening in Gaza, adding: \"They need to release the hostages and let the people free.\"",
      "She told CBS News she often sends text messages to President Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, and that she believes he is doing his best to get the remaining hostages home.",
      "The Seigels said their next planned overseas trip is to the U.S., to meet with Witkoff and hopefully, Aviva said, with Mr. Trump. She said she loved former President Joe Biden and also wanted to thank him for helping to secure her release during his administration, but added that she believes Mr. Trump may be able to wield even greater influence over matters in the Middle East.",

    "summary": "Monsoon season has brought powerful storms to eastern India, with at least 33 people killed by lightning strikes this week alone.",
    "story": [
      "New Delhi \u2014 At least 33 people were killed and dozens injured by lightning strikes in the eastern Indian state of Bihar this week, officials said Friday. The deaths occurred as powerful storms and monsoon rains battered the state.",
      "Most of the deaths were reported on Wednesday and Thursday, when intense storms hit at least 10 districts in Bihar. Most of the victims were agricultural workers, including an elderly man killed by a lightning strike in the Nalanda district while he was out with grazing cattle. Two women were seriously injured in the same place and were being treated for burns.",
      "The state government has urged residents to take precautions, including remaining indoors during bad weather. Nitish Kumar, Bihar's Chief Minister, announced government compensation of 4 million Indian rupees (about $4,600) for the families of those killed.",
      "The storms and lightning are likely to continue, as monsoon rains are expected to continue for weeks in the region. India's Meteorological Department has predicted light to heavy rainfall in most parts of the southern and northeastern parts of Bihar until at least July 24.",
      "Lightning strikes are common during monsoon season in north and eastern India. More than 2,500 people in India are struck by lightning every year, according to government data. In Bihar alone, at least 243 people were killed by lightning strikes last year, and 275 died in 2023. In November 2023, lightning strikes during unseasonal rainfall killed 24 people in the western Indian state of Gujarat.",
      "A typical lightning strike packs around 300 million volts of electricity, which is capable of causing instant death or severe burn injuries. Scientists say climate change is leading to increased lightning activity and more intense storms. Rising land and sea surface temperatures mean there is more heat energy to fuel the thunderstorms that causes lightning.",
      "A study by scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, said lightning strikes in the U.S. could increase by 12% for every degree Celsius rise in average temperature. One person was killed and over a dozen others were injured after being struck by lightning in Jackson Township, New Jersey on Wednesday.",
      "India's east and northeast region is also prone to annual flooding that has killed dozens of people and displace hundreds of thousands during monsoon season. The seasonal rains wreaked havoc in southern India last year, too. In July 2024, massive landslides sparked by monsoon rains killed at least 158 people in the southern state of Kerala.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee said Tuesday that he had \"asked Israel to aggressively investigate the murder\" of Saif Musallet, a Palestinian American national who was visiting family in the Israeli-occupied West Bank when \"he was beaten to death.\"",
      "\"There must be accountability for this criminal and terrorist act,\" Huckabee said in a social media post. \"Saif was just 20 yrs old.\"",
      "The family of Musallet, whose full name was Saifullah Kamel Musallet, told CBS News on Saturday that he was beaten to death on Friday by Israeli settlers in the West Bank.",
      "In a statement, they said he was killed in a confrontation with settlers while trying to protect his family's land in the town of Sinjil, north of Ramallah, and that the settlers had surrounded him for more than three hours, blocking an ambulance and paramedics from reaching him.",
      "The family's statement said his younger brother carried him to an ambulance after the group cleared, but that Musallet died before he was able to reach the hospital.",
      "He had been due to return to his home in Tampa, Florida, this week, his relatives said.",
      "Musallet's killing comes amid an\u00a0increase in violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, a spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Thameen Al-Kheetan, said Tuesday.",
      "\"Israeli settlers and security forces have intensified their\u00a0killings, attacks and harassment of Palestinians\u00a0in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, in the past weeks,\" Al-Kheetan said.",
      "He said that \"during the first half of 2025, there have been 757 settler attacks that resulted in Palestinian casualties or property damage \u2014 a 13 per cent increase on the same period in 2024.\"",
      "\"Israel must immediately stop these killings, harassment and home demolitions across the occupied Palestinian territory,\" Al-Kheetan said. \"As the occupying power, Israel must take all feasible measures to ensure public order and safety in the West Bank. It is under the obligation to protect Palestinians from settler attacks and to end the unlawful use of force by its security forces. There must be thorough, independent and transparent investigations into all killings and all other alleged violations of international law. Those responsible must be held to account.\"",
      "The Israel Defense Forces told CBS News on Wednesday that immediately \"following the incident, a joint investigation was launched by the Israel Police and the Military Police Criminal Investigation Division.\"",
      "On Thursday, a U.S. State Department spokesperson offered condolences to the family and said it was providing consular assistance. The spokesperson said Israeli authorities had announced the arrest of six people in connection with the incident, but neither the IDF nor Israeli police replied to CBS News' questions about the investigation, and there was no confirmation from Israeli authorities of any arrests. Israeli media reported soon after the incident that six people were detained but later released.",
      "On Friday, a spokesperson for the Israeli police said the police and the IDF were \"currently carrying out a joint investigation regarding the death of a Palestinian-American citizen, alleged to have occurred following a confrontation near Sinjil.\"",
      "The statement said at the time of the incident, \"security forces restored order and made arrests on both sides.\"",
      "\"Although no official report was filed regarding a homicide at the time the claim surfaced, and no access to the body was granted to allow for proper forensic examination or collection of critical evidence, the police and IDF have nonetheless launched a proactive investigation to clarify the circumstances surrounding the circulating allegations. If criminal actions are found to have occurred, accountability will be pursued in accordance with the law,\" the police spokesperson said.",
      "Musallet's family said they had not been informed of any arrests related to his killing.",
      "Last week, the Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) called on President Trump to hold Israel accountable for Musallet's death and \"put America first.\"",
      "\"This murder is only the latest killing of an American citizen by illegal Israeli settlers or soldiers,\" CAIR-Florida Executive Director Imam Abdullah Jaber said in a statement. \"Every other murder of an American citizen has gone unpunished by the American government, which is why the Israeli government keeps wantonly killing American Palestinians and, of course, other Palestinians. If President Trump will not even put America first when Israel murders American citizens, then this is truly an Israel First administration.\"",
      "Other U.S. citizens who have been killed in the Israel-occupied West Bank include Al Jazeera journalist\u00a0Shireen Abu Akleh, who died in 2022, and activist\u00a0Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, who was killed last year. Both were allegedly killed by Israeli forces, and the Israeli military has said it is investigating, but nobody has been held accountable for either of their deaths to date.",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Jul 2025 09:01:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The voting age in the U.K. will drop from 18 to 16 by the next national election in a bid to increase democratic participation, the government says.",
    "story": [
      "London\u00a0\u2014 Britain will lower the voting age from 18 to 16 by the next national election as part of measures to increase democratic participation, the government announced Thursday. The center-left Labour Party pledged before it was elected in July 2024 to lower the voting age for elections to Britain's Parliament. Scotland and Wales already let 16- and 17-year-olds vote in local and regional elections.",
      "Britain will join a short list of countries where the voting age is 16, including Austria, Brazil and Ecuador. A handful of European Union countries, including Belgium, Germany and Malta, allow 16-year-olds to vote in elections to the European Parliament, but not their national legislatures.",
      "The move comes alongside wider reforms that include tightening campaign finance rules to stop shell companies with unclear ownership from donating to political parties. Democracy Minister Rushanara Ali said the change would strengthen safeguards against foreign interference in British politics. There will also be tougher sentences for people convicted of intimidating political candidates.",
      "Additionally, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government said it will introduce automatic voter registration and allow voters to use bank cards as a form of identification at polling stations.",
      "The previous Conservative government introduced a requirement for voters to show photo identification in 2022, a measure it said would combat fraud. Critics argued it could disenfranchise millions of voters, particularly the young, the poor and members of ethnic minorities. The law ironically caught out the man who had helped to usher it onto the books, when former Prime Minister Boris Johnson was turned away from his local polling station last year after forgetting to bring his photo ID.",
      "Britain's elections watchdog agency, the Electoral Commission, estimates that about 750,000 people did not vote in last year's election because they lacked ID.",
      "Turnout in the 2024 election was 59.7%, the lowest level in more than two decades.",
      "Harry Quilter-Pinner, head of left-leaning think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research, said the changes were \"the biggest reform to our electoral system since 1969,\" when the voting age was lowered to 18 from 21.",
      "The changes must be approved by Parliament, but Starmer's Labour Party currently holds an overwhelming majority of the seats, so it is likely to pass easily. The next national election must be held by 2029, but it could, theoretically, be called before that by the government.",
      "\"For too long, public trust in our democracy has been damaged and faith in our institutions has been allowed to decline,\" Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said. \"We are taking action to break down barriers to participation that will ensure more people have the opportunity to engage in U.K. democracy.\"",
      "Stuart Fox, a politics lecturer at the University of Exeter who has studied youth voting, said it's \"far from clear\" whether lowering the voting age actually increases youth engagement.",
      "\"It is right to help young people be heard,\" he said. \"But there are other measures which are more effective at getting young people to vote - particularly those from the poorest backgrounds who are by far the least likely to vote \u2014 such as beefing up the citizenship curriculum or expanding the provision of volunteering programs in schools.\"",

      "\"I was probably on him for six months just saying, \u2018John, you should consider maybe not smoking as much,'\" Smith shared. \"One day, he finally told me, \u2018I\u2019ve realized that it\u2019s not good for you and I shouldn\u2019t be doing it.\u2019 He never smoked after that.\u2019\"",

He just didn\u2019t want the public \"to make a fuss.\"",
      "\"In our 20 years of playing tennis together, I knew the sound of John\u2019s laugh, his forehand grunts, and his labored breathing,\" Smith wrote. \"Toward the end, his breathing became increasingly difficult.

So, he was by himself on that day. I remember he picked me and my wife up, and we went to this restaurant. We were the first people there and the last to leave.\"",
      "\"John was the funniest I\u2019ve ever seen him,\" Smith reflected. \"He went on and on, told stories about different people that he had on the show\u2026 We just laughed so hard. Our stomachs were sore from laughing\u2026 At one point, I said, \u2018I got to go to bed,\u2019 and John was like, \u2018Oh no, Howard, I want to tell you this other story.\u2019 And it kept going.\"",

It's like he didn't want us to leave without hearing him first. At the end of the night, he drives us up to our house, gets out of the car. He gave both my wife Jane and me a kiss and a hug. Then he tells us, \u2018I love you.\u2019 John was not standoffish, but I'd never seen him do anything like that.\"",

      "\"I think he knew he was dying, but didn\u2019t want us to worry,\" said Smith quietly, fighting back tears. \"But at that moment, he just wanted to remember the good times. He wanted to tell us how much we meant to him. He wanted to give us the best of himself.\"",

Then he went to Russia and learned Russian so he could talk to people there. He would use this telescope at his house to look up at the stars.

      "Jane's Addiction is taking their feud to court.",
      "On Wednesday, guitarist Dave Navarro, along with bandmates Eric Avery and Stephen Perkins, filed a $10 million lawsuit against frontman Perry Farrell, accusing him of assault and battery after an onstage altercation in September 2024. The same day, Farrell filed a countersuit, alleging a \"yearslong bullying campaign\" against him by the other band members.",
      "The singer claimed he was blindsided by the other members' decision to cancel the remaining 15 shows of the tour and break up following the 2024 incident.",

      "Dave Navarro is suing his Jane's Addiction bandmate Perry Farrell for assault and battery.\u00a0 (Getty)",
      "Farrell claimed Navarro, Avery and Perkins are to blame for the escalating tensions and violence that erupted during the band\u2019s tour.",
      "\"Navarro, Avery and Perkins apparently decided,\" the lawsuit stated, \"that Jane\u2019s Addiction\u2019s decades of success should be jettisoned in pursuit of a yearslong bullying campaign against Farrell involving harassing him onstage during performances, including, among other tactics, trying to undermine him by playing their instruments at a high volume so that he could not hear himself sing.\"",
      "Farrell alleged that Navarro and Avery actually assaulted him, turning the stage into a toxic environment, and said the situation went from hostile to defamatory when the other members of the band publicly accused him of struggling with mental health issues in the aftermath of the altercation.",
      "Meanwhile, Navarro sued Farrell for assault and battery following an incident that took place mid-concert during a stop on the band's reunion tour last September.",
      "In court documents obtained by Fox News Digital, Navarro, Avery and Perkins accused Farrell of assaulting Navarro both on stage and backstage on Sept. 13, 2024. They stated that they suffered financial losses after the incident led to the cancellation of the tour and their planned album.",
      "The guitarist filed the lawsuit against the band's frontman after an onstage incident last September.\u00a0 (Kieran Frost/Redferns)",
      "According to the documents, they claimed that they \"were forced to bring this action\" after Farrell \"ruthlessly assaulted Navarro onstage, mid-show, during the Jane\u2019s Addiction 33-date North American reunion tour.\"",
      "\"As if the pain and humiliation of the onstage attack were not enough, Farrell continued his unhinged barrage of punches backstage (collectively, the 'Attack'),\" the lawsuit continued. \"The Attack, which was virally viewed by millions of people worldwide, was brutal and unprovoked. It quickly forced the termination of the show and eventually the entire Tour.\"",
      "During the Sept. 13 concert, videos taken by fans showed Farrell approaching Navarro, seemingly upset. He shoved Navarro with his shoulder, then advanced on him. Navarro held him back with a forearm to his chest, but Farrell threw a punch before one of the band's techs intervened.",
      "The incident marked a \"terminal inflection point\" for Jane's Addiction, the documents continued, which was formed by Perry, Navarro, Avery and Perkins in 1985.",
      "The 2024 reunion tour marked the first time that the band's four original members had performed together since 2010. According to court documents, the reunion tour had sold over 100,000 tickets before its 15 remaining dates were canceled on Sept. 16, 2024, three days after the incident at the show in Boston, Massachusetts.",
      "The altercation took place during a 2024 reunion tour that included the band's original four members.\u00a0 (Etty Lau Farrell Instagram)",
      "Jane's Addiction announced the tour's cancellation in a statement that read in part, \"Due to a continuing pattern of behavior and the mental health difficulties of our singer Perry Farrell, we have come to the conclusion that we have no choice but to discontinue the current US tour. Our concern for his personal health and safety as well as our own has left us no alternative. We hope that he will find the help he needs.\"",
      "Per the lawsuit, Farrell issued a statement in a since-deleted Instagram post on the day of the tour's cancellation.",
      "\"This weekend has been incredibly difficult and after having the time and space to reflect, it is only right that I apologize to my bandmates, especially Dave Navarro, fans, family and friends for my actions during Friday\u2019s show. Unfortunately, my breaking point resulted in inexcusable behavior, and I take full accountability for how I chose to handle the situation,\" he wrote, according to the documents.",
      "At the time, Farrell shared a matching statement with Fox News Digital.",
      "According to the lawsuit, the band's new album was also derailed as a result of the incident. Per the documents, Jane's Addiction had completed two songs including \"Imminent Redemption\" and \"True Love,\" both of which were released as singles, for the planned 12-track record.",
      "LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS",
      "\"It is now impossible, as a result of the conduct by Defendant set forth above (and through no fault of Plaintiffs), for the Band to complete a 12-track album,\" the documents read.",
      "In addition to assault and battery, Navarro joined Avery and Perkins in suing Farrell for intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract and indemnity and contribution.",
      "Dave Navarro, Stephen Perkins, Perry Farrell, and Eric Avery of Jane's Addiction are pictured in 2008.\u00a0 (John Shearer/WireImage)",
      "In a statement to Fox News Digital, Navarro's attorney, Christopher Frost, said, \"In 2024 the four 'original' members of Jane\u2019s Addiction came together, against all odds, with a new tour and new music. Persuaded by Perry Farrell to revive the legendary configuration of the band, Dave Navarro, Eric Avery, and Stephen Perkins had high hopes that they could capture the pure spirit of the band\u2019s early days and build on it.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER",
      "\"Initially they did, in the studio and onstage,\" Frost continued. \"But, as our lawsuit explains, they did so with a fourth bandmate who was by turns unwilling or unable to perform to a reasonable standard and who repeatedly threatened to derail the tour.",
      "\"Ultimately, with the attack on Dave Navarro seen around the world, Perry Farrell abruptly and unilaterally ended all the plans for a Jane\u2019s Addiction revival. He also left his bandmates holding the bag for an unfulfilled tour and record deal, as our lawsuit explains in detail. Dave, Eric, and Stephen never wanted it to come to this. But they have been wronged, want the accurate story told, and they deserve a resolution.\"",
      "Navarro, Perkins and Avery are suing Farrell for $10 million in damages.\u00a0 (Kieran Frost/Redferns)",
      "Meanwhile, a representative for Farrell shared a statement with People which read, \"This is yet another clear example of the group uniting to isolate and bully frontman Perry Farrell. The timing of this baseless lawsuit is no coincidence \u2014 it was filed only after they caught wind of legal action coming from our side.\"",

    "summary": "Mental health experts discuss the hidden toll of the Texas floods that victims will face long after emergency crews leave. Dr. Sabrina Browne shares warning signs with parents.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Sabrina Browne, a Texas-based psychiatrist, explains what flood survivors might experience and how to know when it's time to get professional help.",
      "As rescue crews and volunteers work to clean up after the tragic flooding that violently swept through central Texas over the July 4 weekend, others are looking to help survivors and victims\u2019 loved ones mentally recover. Dallas-based pediatric psychiatrist and assistant professor at UT Southwestern Medical Center Dr. Sabrina Browne spoke with Fox News Digital about what survivors and those close to victims could be grappling with.",
      "\"Tragedies like this, in a very literal sense, hit close to home, right? It\u2019s one thing when you see things playing out on TV, but when it happens in your community, it really affects your life on every level,\" Browne told Fox News Digital. \"The reality for these families is that once the camera crews are gone and once the aid organizations are packing up, they\u2019re still going to be living with the repercussions of this.\"",
      "There are several possible reactions people may have in the wake of a tragedy, like the recent flooding. According to Browne, one of the most common reactions is a loss of a \"feeling of safety\" and a \"sense of stability.\"",
      "\"You take for granted that you're gonna wake up in the morning, go about your day, you're going to come home to your house, right? And all of those things. And so they lose that sense of stability,\" Browne said.",

      "TEXAS FLOOD SURVIVORS LOOK FOR GOD IN THE FACE OF TRAGEDY",
      "She added that along with this loss of stability, some people can experience anxiety, worry or even fear that another disaster is around the corner. The mental health professional also mentioned that flood survivors could experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and even survivor\u2019s guilt.",
      "Browne has unique experience in helping Texas families through tragedy, having supported families in the wake of the 2022 Uvalde school shooting, in which 19 children and two teachers were killed at Robb Elementary School.",
      "Like the case of the Uvalde shooting, many of the flood victims in Texas were children. Browne spoke to the differences in treating adults versus children, emphasizing that \"kids aren\u2019t just little adults.\"",
      "\"When we talk about kids, that's a wide spectrum of ages and developmental levels,\" Browne said. \"A child who is 12 is going to be having a different experience than a child who\u2019s seven, right? Because they\u2019re more mature, they cognitively can understand things.\"",
      "Beyond their ability to understand what has happened, this could be a child\u2019s first time dealing with disaster and death.",
      "\"Oftentimes, kids are encountering [death] in the setting of losing a grandparent or someone where it feels removed from them. But when they're seeing their peers, other kids in camp, when school starts back up, starting school and seeing maybe their friends aren't there, that brings it to a very real level so that now they're having to wrap their heads around, what does that mean? And then they're also struggling with, is this something that could happen to me? And so that can add another layer.\"",

      "\"If we notice that, you know, they're, they are not sleeping, they don't want to eat, they don\u2019t want to play, right? Those big shifts, that is a sign of we need to get them in to see somebody for more support,\" Browne said.",

      "Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., is demanding an investigation into Belmont University after leaked recordings of a university faculty member admitting the school has maintained its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives but \"just change[d] on how we talk about it\" despite federal directives to end the programs deemed by many to be discriminatory.",
      "In undercover recordings, the same official can be heard admitting the school also enrolls illegal immigrants and hides that information from external entities, which Ogles suggested could violate state law against knowingly harboring illegal aliens for profit.",
      "\"Belmont University claims to be a Christian institution grounded in Biblical principles, but its administration is injecting anti-gospel DEI ideology into its curriculum,\" Ogles told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"President Trump has rightly demanded that colleges and universities dismantle the DEI cartel or lose federal funding. Belmont officials, however, have been caught on camera bragging about their \u2018clever\u2019 scheme to rebrand DEI and continue pushing the same radical agenda under a new name.\"",

      "Tennessee GOP Rep. Andy Ogles is calling for an investigation into Belmont University after an undercover recording showed a school official admitting the university was continuing DEI using new terminology to prevent backlash.\u00a0 (Getty Images)",
      "Belmont is just one of the latest schools to come under fire for allegedly trying to skirt federal funding repercussions by re-branding DEI programs and policies. An investigation in April by conservative parental rights group Defending Education found that despite the president's executive directives, there are still 383 \"currently active\" DEI offices and programs with 243 universities maintaining institution-wide DEI offices or programming.",
      "In addition to tracking those DEI offices and programs that are still active, the group's investigation also highlighted dozens of universities that have taken steps to rebrand or reorganize their DEI efforts as opposed to shutting them down like others have done.",
      "Ogles pointed to Belmont's Office of Hope, Unity and Belonging (HUB), which engulfed the university's DEI efforts in 2022, as an example of how the school has rebranded its DEI efforts.",
      "\"The HUB is hope, unity and belonging. That's DEI. Let's be real,\" Jozef Lukey, Belmont's assistant director of student success and flourishing, said in an undercover recording cited by Ogles. \"We always try to just adapt to what's happening around us.

One professor allegedly shared a mandatory form for faculty members requesting to revise or propose a new course, which requires a \"Diversity Impact Statement\" outlining how the course supports \"historically underrepresented populations.\"",
      "Another source, according to Ogles' office, shared screenshots of an email chain showing Belmont intends to keep its faculty DEI committee for the next academic year.",
      "Belmont has insisted attempts to portray the school as having a \"shadow operation\" are wholly inaccurate.",
      "\"We are deeply saddened that these videos portray Belmont as having a 'shadow operation,' as nothing could be further from the truth. It\u2019s also disappointing that Rep. Ogles and others perceive such an approach as being representative of Belmont University\u2019s character and values,\" the university told local outlet Fox 17.",
      "UNEARTHED CHAT SHEDS LIGHT ON COZY TIES BETWEEN JUDGES, CLIMATE ACTIVISTS, RAISING ETHICAL CONCERNS",

The email included references to counseling services for people who may be feeling uncomfortable as a result of the allegations the school is facing.",

      "\"We definitely have to navigate very carefully and just cautiously just because we just don't ever know, especially with like the ICE raids that are happening in the city that impacts our campus,\" Lukey was caught saying in the undercover recording.",
      "\"We do have undocumented students here. Yeah. Oh, yeah. We don't communicate to anybody externally who's undocumented, who isn't. And, so, like, yes, we know who it is. Faculty don't really know. How could they? Unless it's indicated in the system somewhere.\"",
      "According to Ogles, such a move could potentially violate Tennesee's Senate Bill 392, which was passed recently and criminalizes 501(c)(3) institutions, known colloquially as nonprofits, for harboring illegal aliens for profit."

      "Airfields face a constant battle with wildlife. Birds, rabbits and even deer can wander onto runways, creating dangerous situations for aircraft and crews. Birds are the biggest threat. When sucked into engines or hitting windscreens, they can cause catastrophic damage. In fact, the threat is so serious that the U.S. Civil Air Administration once built a \"chicken gun\" to fire bird carcasses at planes to test their resilience.",

      "How robot coyotes work to scare off birds and animals",
      "Enter the robot coyote. The ERDC, in partnership with wildlife biologists Stephen Hammond and Jacob Jung and the USDA National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC), has spent five years developing these unique machines. The idea is simple. Most animals instinctively avoid coyotes, so why not use that fear to keep them away from airfields?",
      "The first prototypes, Coyote Rovers, started as Boston Dynamics Spot robots. However, these proved too slow to scare off wildlife. The team switched to four-wheeled Traxxas X-Maxx motorized cars, which can reach speeds of 20 mph. Each vehicle carries a plastic coyote dummy, blending just the right amount of realism and intimidation, all for about $3,000 each.",

These early trials showed promise. The robot coyotes successfully deterred birds and other animals, helping to keep runways clear and safe.",
      "But the ERDC isn't stopping there. The goal is to make these robot coyotes even smarter.

      "16 BILLION PASSWORDS LEAKED IN MASSIVE DATA BREACH",
      "A phone with a Google Drive app on the homescreen (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Security: Strong protections, but user vigilance needed",
      "Google Drive employs robust security measures, including 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for data at rest and in transit. Additionally, users can enable two-factor authentication and manage sharing permissions to protect their files. However, like all cloud services, Google Drive is not immune to security threats.",
      "Phishing attacks targeting Google accounts remain common, and attackers may exploit weak passwords or compromised credentials. Furthermore, some third-party integrations request extensive permissions, which could be misused if not carefully managed. While Google has experienced security incidents in the past, such as the 2018 Google+ data breach, these have not directly impacted Google Drive. It's important to note that most major cloud storage providers face similar risks, and Google provides tools to help users mitigate them.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "To stay safe, you should regularly audit account access, and use strong passwords. By taking these steps, you can significantly reduce your exposure to security risks.",
      "Privacy: Automated scanning and user control",
      "Google Drive scans files for malware and policy violations using automated systems. While this process helps protect users, some privacy-focused individuals may feel uneasy knowing that their files are subject to automated review. Google is transparent about these practices and states that no human reviews your content unless required by law.",
      "If you require higher levels of privacy, you can use additional client-side encryption before uploading files to Google Drive. This ensures that only you hold the decryption keys, further protecting your sensitive information.",
      "Google Drive share settings (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Internet dependency: Plan for offline access",
      "Like most cloud storage solutions, Google Drive relies on an internet connection to sync and access files. However, you can make files available offline using Google Drive's desktop app or by enabling offline mode in your browser. Planning ahead ensures you can access important documents even during internet outages or while traveling.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Upload limits: Consider your backup needs",
      "Google Drive imposes a daily upload limit of 750 GB per user. If you need to back up large amounts of data, you may find this limit restrictive, as uploads will pause once you reach the cap and resume the next day. While some competitors may not have explicit daily limits, they often enforce fair use policies or bandwidth restrictions. Be sure to compare providers based on your specific backup needs.",
      "Illustration of devices uploading data to Google Drive in the cloud (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Not a dedicated backup solution, but still useful",
      "It's important to recognize that Google Drive is primarily designed for file storage and synchronization, not as a comprehensive backup tool. It lacks some advanced backup features, such as scheduled backups, full system image recovery, and granular file versioning for all file types. However, you can enhance its capabilities by using third-party backup software that integrates with Google Drive, allowing for more automated and reliable backups.",
      "An image of remote servers (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Is Google Drive right for you?",

By understanding its strengths and potential risks, and by taking proactive security measures, you can use Google Drive safely and effectively.",
      "If you need advanced backup features or require strict privacy controls, consider supplementing Google Drive with specialized backup software or exploring\u00a0alternative cloud storage providers. Ultimately, the best solution depends on your unique requirements and how you choose to manage your data.",

      "After that, dockside testing begins. The habitat is placed in water beside a dock for gradual submersion, which makes it easy to test for water-tightness and electrical safety.",
      "Finally, the team conducts full underwater testing. In this phase, Vanguard operates on the seafloor and receives air, power, water, and communications from the surface. This final step offers key feedback on how people live and work in the habitat, helping DEEP improve Vanguard and design the larger Sentinel system.",
      "Vanguard underwater habitat test schedule. (Deep)",

      "Data review by humans:\u00a0Conversations with Gemini may be reviewed and annotated by human reviewers for quality control and AI training purposes. Even if your activity is deleted, data reviewed by humans can be retained for up to three years, and this data is disconnected from your Google Account before review. Avoid sharing confidential or sensitive information in Gemini chats, as Google explicitly advises against it.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "While some users may welcome this change, if you value control and transparency over your data, limiting its access is the best option. Unfortunately, Google's guidance on the subject is murky, and you can\u2019t fully disable Gemini on Android unless you root your Android phone.

      "What if the answer to cleaner energy was right out on the waves? A new green energy system is set to change how we capture clean power, and it all starts with the ocean. French startup Seaturns has designed technology that taps into the natural motion of the sea. Their water pendulum turbines are built to last, require little maintenance, and turn rolling waves into electricity. Unlike other renewable options, ocean waves offer a steady, often predictable source of power.",

      "Water pendulum turbine. (Seaturns)",
      "How renewable wave energy works using a water pendulum system",
      "Here's how the water pendulum wave converter works. These large, yellow, floating cylinders pitch back and forth with each passing wave. Inside, the motion causes a column of water to swing like a pendulum, compressing air between two chambers and driving a turbine that generates electricity. This constant back-and-forth movement happens entirely within the hull, protecting components from corrosive saltwater and turbulent seas.",
      "Unlike older wave converters that rely on exposed mechanical parts, Seaturns' design is simple, reliable, and self-contained. Backed by organizations such as Bpifrance, Horizon Europe, and marine research institute Ifremer, the project has drawn support from across France's public and private sectors.",
      "Water pendulum turbines. (Seaturns)",
      "Renewable wave energy turbine passes open-sea testing",
      "Seaturns recently completed 18 months of successful offshore testing using a prototype built near Brest, France. Built at quarter-scale, the test demonstrated the system's durability and energy efficiency under harsh marine conditions. This confirms the power-producing concept as a promising alternative to traditional energy technologies.",
      "Historically, ocean power projects have struggled due to their complexity, cost, and vulnerability to damage. Seaturns' design addresses these weaknesses head-on. A water pendulum is driven by the horizontal motion of wave surges, allowing it to function efficiently even in shallower waters where wave height is limited. This enables performance in shallower depths, bringing the system closer to shore. Its compact size, modular construction, and simplified deployment process make it attractive for coastal cities, offshore industries, and island communities alike.",
      "And unlike wind or solar power, which can fluctuate with weather and daylight, wave converters can generate energy more consistently, though typically at lower output levels, even when skies are cloudy or winds are still.",
      "Water pendulum turbine. (Seaturns)",
      "Low-maintenance renewable wave energy designed to last",
      "Wave energy offers enormous untapped potential. According to some estimates, global oceans could theoretically produce more than 2 terawatts of renewable electricity using wave technology. That's enough to power a significant portion of national grids, potentially up to a third of the United States' energy demand, if fully harnessed, though real-world output would depend on many local and technical factors. Harnessing even part of Alaska's extensive coastline could significantly reduce fossil fuel reliance in remote communities.",
      "Recent academic studies have highlighted the promise of pendulum-based wave energy converters. Their ability to deliver direct mechanical-to-electrical conversion, combined with structural simplicity, makes them a viable path forward for clean ocean power.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Some people point out that wave energy still has its hurdles, like dealing with inconsistent wave patterns and currently lower power output compared to wind or solar farms. Even so, the Seaturns system could be a real breakthrough. Its tough design, simple upkeep, and environmental benefits make it a strong contender for future energy grids. As we keep searching for reliable and sustainable power, wave energy is starting to stand out. Now, the big question is whether creative ideas like water pendulums can help make wave power a key player in the global shift to clean energy.",

      "AI chatbots are quickly becoming the primary way people interact with the internet. Instead of browsing through a list of links, you can now get direct answers to your questions. However, these tools often provide information that is completely inaccurate, and in the context of security, that can be dangerous. In fact, cybersecurity researchers are warning that hackers have started exploiting flaws in these chatbots to carry out AI phishing attacks.",
      "Specifically, when people use AI tools to search for login pages, especially for banking and tech platforms, the tools return incorrect links. And once you click that link, you might get directed to fake websites. These sites can then be used to steal personal information or login credentials.",

      "What you need to know about AI phishing attacks",
      "Researchers at Netcraft recently ran a test on the GPT-4.1 family of models, which is also used by Microsoft's Bing AI and AI search engine Perplexity. They asked where to log in to fifty different brands across banking, retail, and tech.",
      "Out of 131 unique links the chatbot returned, only about two-thirds were correct. Around 30 percent of the links pointed to unregistered or inactive domains. Another five percent led to unrelated websites. In total, more than one-third of the responses linked to pages not owned by the actual companies. This means someone looking for a login link could easily end up on a fake or unsafe site.",
      "If attackers register those unclaimed domains, they can create convincing phishing pages and wait. Since the AI-supplied answer often sounds official, users are more likely to trust it without double-checking.",
      "Wikipedia page showing ChatGPT description on a smartphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "AI phishing attacks are already happening: Real-world example",
      "In one recent case, a user asked Perplexity AI for the Wells Fargo login page. The top result wasn't the official Wells Fargo site; it was a phishing page hosted on Google Sites. The fake site closely mimicked the real design and prompted users to enter personal information. Although the correct site was listed further down, many people would not notice or think to verify the link.",
      "The problem in this case wasn't specific to Perplexity's underlying model. It stemmed from Google Sites abuse and a lack of vetting in the search results surfaced by the tool. Still, the result was the same: a trusted AI platform inadvertently directed someone to a fake financial website.",
      "Smaller banks and regional credit unions face even higher risks. These institutions are less likely to appear in AI training data or be accurately indexed on the web. As a result, AI tools are more prone to guessing or fabricating links when asked about them, raising the risk of exposing users to unsafe destinations.",

      "AI chatbots often sound confident even when they are wrong. If a chatbot tells you where to log in, do not click the link right away. Instead, go directly to the website by typing its URL manually or using a trusted bookmark.",
      "AI-generated phishing links often use lookalike domains. Check for subtle misspellings, extra words, or unusual endings like \".site\" or \".info\" instead of \".com\". If it feels even slightly off, do not proceed.",
      "Even if your login credentials get stolen, 2FA adds an extra layer of security. Choose app-based authenticators like Google Authenticator or Authy instead of SMS-based codes when available.",
      "If you need to access your bank or tech account, avoid searching for it or asking a chatbot. Use your browser\u2019s bookmarks or enter the official URL directly. AI and search engines can sometimes surface phishing pages by mistake.",
      "If a chatbot or AI tool gives you a dangerous or fake link, report it. Many platforms allow user feedback. This helps AI systems learn and reduces future risks for others.",
      "Modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, and Edge now include phishing and malware protection. Enable these features and keep everything updated..",
      "If you want extra protection, the best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Think twice before clicking on \"unsubscribe\" links in unfamiliar or suspicious emails. Some of these links are used in phishing attacks to confirm your email address or trick you into handing over personal information. If you're unsure, it's safer to use Gmail's built-in tools instead.",
      "For Android devices, Google Play Protect offers built-in malware protection and can automatically remove known threats. However, it is important to note that Google Play Protect may not be enough. Historically, it isn't 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android devices. That's why it's important to add a trusted antivirus app.",

    "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/tech/why-you-should-think-twice-before-joining-power-saver-program",
    "published": "Mon, 14 Jul 2025 15:00:42 -0400",
    "summary": "Despite the benefits, residential power saver programs come with several potential drawbacks and concerns that have been raised by both customers and experts.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News senior national correspondent William La Jeunesse reports on proposed changes to California's electric bills on 'Special Report.'",
      "Power saver programs are utility-sponsored demand response initiatives that help reduce electricity usage during periods of peak demand. These programs typically target central air conditioners (AC) and heat pumps, since cooling equipment drives spikes in summer energy demand. In exchange for incentives such as bill credits or rebates, participating homeowners allow the utility to temporarily adjust or cycle their HVAC systems on hot days.",
      "But it\u2019s not all that straightforward. I recently received an email from Leah, an HVAC professional based in Rio Rancho, New Mexico.",
      "\"I would like to see an article about the push for Smart Thermostats, and the convergence of the utilities' attempts to control air conditioning usage to conserve energy.\"",
      "He pointed to a growing push for smart thermostats and what he sees as an effort by utilities to take more control over air conditioning use, all under the banner of energy conservation.",
      "Let\u2019s discuss the power saver programs in detail, including their pros, cons and everything else you need to know.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide - free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM/NEWSLETTER",
      "A smart thermostat (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How power saver programs control your AC",
      "Most residential power saver programs function by temporarily reducing air conditioner usage at participating homes during peak periods (usually summer afternoons). In most cases, the utility installs a control device on the outdoor AC unit\u2019s compressor. During a peak event, a radio signal from the utility will cycle the compressor off and on at set intervals. Legacy programs like Xcel Energy\u2019s Saver\u2019s Switch use this method.",
      "Another method utilities use is controlling thermostats. You\u2019re asked to enroll your Wi-Fi smart thermostat in a bring-your-own-thermostat program. During a demand response event, the utility or program operator remotely raises the thermostat setpoint for a few hours. This causes the AC to run less. Most of these programs allow you to override the change via the thermostat or app; however, emergency events may temporarily disable this option.",
      "Benefits of joining a power saver program",
      "Power saver programs provide several benefits for both participating consumers and the wider community. First, there are bill savings and incentives. Participants receive direct financial rewards, ranging from annual bill credits of up to $40 to up-front enrollment bonuses of $25-$100.",
      "These programs also result in collective demand reduction during peak times, helping prevent grid overloads and blackouts. By coordinating energy reductions across thousands of homes, utilities can avoid firing up expensive peaker plants or purchasing high-priced electricity on the open market.",
      "Reducing peak demand can also help avoid turning on older, more polluting fossil-fuel generators. That means fewer CO\u2082 emissions and lower air pollution on the hottest days, when health risks are already high.",
      "A smart thermostat\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Drawbacks and risks of power saver programs",
      "Despite the benefits, residential power saver programs come with several potential drawbacks and concerns that have been raised by both customers and experts.",
      "\"In New Mexico, where I live and work, our electric utility, PNM, offers a 'Power Saver' program. Customers can opt in to have a box mounted to their condenser, which disrupts the signal between the furnace and the condenser during peak consumption hours, effectively shutting it down,\" Leah tells me.",
      "\"It\u2019s not great for the condenser, and we often get calls from customers who don\u2019t fully understand what they signed up for and are confused when their AC stops working. Now, there\u2019s a push to gain access to Wi-Fi-enabled thermostats to achieve the same goal. They want to control our ACs.\"",
      "Understandably, many people are uncomfortable with utilities taking over their cooling systems, especially in extreme heat. Take the 2022 incident with Xcel Energy in Colorado. During an energy emergency, 22,000 smart thermostat users were temporarily locked out of adjusting their ACs. Many had never experienced a no-override event before and were understandably frustrated. While rare, these incidents raise valid concerns about control and consent.",
      "There are also technical concerns. Frequent short cycling of AC compressors can lead to increased wear and tear. Every startup strains the compressor motor, and repeated on-off cycles within a short period may reduce efficiency or shorten the unit's lifespan, although this depends on the system and the frequency of the events.",
      "HOW 432 ROBOTS ARE RELOCATING A 7,500-TON HISTORIC BUILDING",
      "Smart thermostats and utility control: What to know",
      "Some people enrolled in thermostat adjustment programs without realizing it. This leads to confusion and frustration when their air conditioning is unexpectedly limited. Often, this happens because smart thermostats come with default opt-in settings or vague incentive language that can be confusing.",
      "In Texas in 2021, many residents saw their smart thermostats rise above 78\u00b0F during an ERCOT conservation alert. They later found out they had unknowingly agreed to let utilities make temperature adjustments.",
      "Privacy and security concerns with smart thermostats",
      "These programs also raise important data privacy concerns. Wi-Fi-enabled thermostats collect and transmit sensitive information, including occupancy patterns, temperature preferences and when a home is likely unoccupied.",
      "Cybersecurity is another issue. Like any internet-connected device, smart thermostats can be vulnerable to hacking or malicious remote commands. So far, no major breaches have impacted AC demand programs, but privacy advocates say the risks are real and growing.",

      "7 things to do if you're considering power saver programs",
      "Whether you're thinking about signing up or are already enrolled, these steps will help you stay in control, protect your comfort and avoid unwanted surprises:",
      "Before you join any power saver or thermostat program, read the terms completely. Ensure you understand the extent of the utility's control, whether you can override changes and how frequently adjustments may occur. Always choose manual enrollment during smart home app setup instead of letting it enroll you automatically.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Use a Wi-Fi thermostat that makes it easy to override changes during demand response events. Many models let you opt out temporarily or permanently through the app or the device itself. Learn how to do this before a peak event occurs, so you're not caught off guard.",

      "Every tattoo starts with a single black dot. That tiny mark is the base for every design, no matter how complex. And now, thanks to a new AI tattoo machine, that dot is more perfect than ever. Welcome to the future of tattooing.",

      "AI tattoo machine (Blackdot)",
      "What is the Blackdot AI tattoo machine and how does it work?",
      "Blackdot is not just a new tool. It's a complete reimagining of how tattoos are created. This device doesn't look like a traditional tattoo machine. It's a sleek, robotic arm powered by artificial intelligence. It uses computer vision, lasers and a microscope to apply ink with surgical precision. The dots it places are about the size of a human hair. Blackdot is currently in studios like Bang Bang in New York City. It's designed to create ultra-detailed tattoos quickly, cleanly and with less pain than traditional methods. And yes, it still uses real needles and real ink. But the way it works is totally different.",
      "How the AI tattoo machine applies ink with precision",
      "Once a human operator starts the process, the machine scans your skin. It then gets to work, placing ink with incredible accuracy. It's quiet. It's steady. And according to early users, it hurts a lot less. That's because the machine goes shallower into the skin than a human artist might. This avoids nerve endings that normally cause pain during a tattoo.",
      "Once a human operator starts the process, the machine scans your skin. It then gets to work, placing ink with incredible accuracy. (Blackdot)",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Why tattoo clients might prefer an AI tattoo machine",
      "Let's say you want a custom tattoo from an artist across the country. Normally, you'd need to travel, book months in advance, and hope the artist is available. With Blackdot, you can get that same artwork in your city, without ever meeting the artist in person. The machine can handle everything from ultra-sharp lettering to lifelike portraits. It can even replicate a child's handwriting or a piece of original art down to the tiniest detail. And if you're nervous about pain or needles, this machine might make you more comfortable than a traditional tattoo shop.",
      "How tattoo artists can benefit from AI tattoo machines",
      "Blackdot isn't trying to replace tattoo artists. It's trying to give them more options. Artists can license their work to be used by the machine. They control how many times a design can be tattooed. They approve the final work. And they get paid quickly. This opens up tattooing to painters, illustrators, digital artists, photographers and more. You no longer have to be a tattoo artist to get your work on someone's skin.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Why some tattoo artists push back against AI tattoo machines",
      "Of course, not everyone is excited about this change. Some tattoo artists feel like a machine doesn't belong in an industry built on human connection and trust. They say machines can't replace the experience that comes from years of working with different skin types and guiding clients through the emotional side of getting a tattoo. They also worry about losing jobs, or about AI removing the \"soul\" of a hand-drawn tattoo.",
      "Some tattoo artists are exploring AI tattoo machines with curiosity",
      "At the same time, some artists are curious. A few have even tried tattooing side-by-side with the machine to see how it compares. One artist described it like watching a dinosaur stare at a meteor; he didn't think it would take over, but he knew it would change things. And in some cases, artists say the machine handles tedious jobs like fine lettering better than they can.",
      "The future of AI tattoo machines in salons, studios, and beyond",
      "Blackdot has big plans. It's not just focused on tattoo shops. The company wants to put machines in permanent makeup studios, high-end salons, barbershops and fashion stores. It also launched something called the Blackdot Gallery, where people can buy digital tattoo art that can be turned into real tattoos. You can even trade and collect tattoos the way you might trade digital art or collectibles.",
      "The machine goes shallower into the skin than a human artist might. This avoids nerve endings that normally cause pain during a tattoo. (Blackdot)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The AI tattoo machine isn't here to erase tradition. It's here to expand it. It offers new ways to create, new ways to connect, and a more comfortable experience for people who have always wanted a tattoo but held back. But it also raises big questions about what we value in a tattoo. Is it the art itself, or the artist behind it?",

      "Using millimeter wave (mmWave) imaging, the same type of signal used in Wi-Fi, the researchers developed a system called mmNorm. There\u2019s nothing normal about this superpower. This technology allows robots to scan containers and generate accurate 3D models of the objects inside by analyzing how signals bounce back from hidden surfaces.",

      "A robotic arm scans a sealed box using mmWave radar to detect objects inside\u00a0 (MIT)",
      "How robots detect damage inside boxes using mmWave imaging",
      "Millimeter waves are particularly effective at penetrating materials such as cardboard, plastic and even interior walls. When these waves hit an object inside a box, they reflect. The mmNorm system captures these reflections and feeds them into an algorithm that estimates the shape and direction of the surface of the hidden item.",
      "Unlike traditional radar systems, mmNorm accounts for a challenging property called specularity, which refers to the way radio waves bounce off shiny or angled surfaces, much like a mirror. By estimating the surface normal (the direction a surface is facing), the system's accuracy improves dramatically. The method combines reflections from multiple antennas that \"vote\" on the surface normal direction based on signal strength, improving the accuracy of the 3D reconstruction.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The technology powering robots that detect damage inside boxes",
      "What makes mmNorm different is its clever use of physics. Instead of ignoring reflections that bounce away from the radar (as most systems do), it captures them to infer the shape and orientation of hidden surfaces. Lead author Laura Dodds explained that the system doesn't just track where a signal comes from. It also analyzes the direction the surface is facing. To do this, the MIT team used a robotic arm equipped with a radar unit. As it moved around a sealed box, it gathered multiple measurements, building a detailed 3D picture of what was inside.",
      "A robotic arm scans a sealed box using mmWave radar to detect objects inside\u00a0 (MIT)",
      "Why robots that detect damage inside boxes are a game-changer for warehouses",
      "During testing, mmNorm achieved 96% accuracy in reconstructing complex items, such as power drills and silverware. That's a big jump compared to the 78% accuracy offered by similar systems. In a warehouse setting, this means robotic arms could inspect the contents of packages moving down a conveyor belt without unpacking them.",
      "It also opens the door for humanoid robots to roam warehouses and assess packages for damage or missing parts in real time. However, the technology does not work well for objects hidden behind metal or very thick walls, which limits some applications.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Where else could robots detect damage inside boxes and make an impact",
      "Beyond warehouse automation, this technology opens the door to several other promising uses. In factory production lines, robots that detect damage inside boxes could inspect goods quickly and without opening packages, helping maintain high-quality standards.",
      "In assisted-living centers, the same approach might help ensure safety by checking the contents of containers without disturbing residents. Even in security screening, being able to see through sealed boxes could enhance threat detection without adding any strain on bandwidth since the system uses the same mmWave signals as existing technologies. The research team plans to further improve the resolution of mmNorm and boost its performance on less reflective objects, making it even more versatile for future applications.",
      "A robotic arm scans a sealed box using mmWave radar to detect objects inside\u00a0 (MIT)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "We may be entering an era where robots don't just move boxes, but they understand what's in them.

      "A woman on the phone with customer service\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How chatbots are changing customer service for businesses",
      "A chatbot is an artificial intelligence tool designed to simulate real-time conversations with users. It operates around the clock, doesn't require breaks and can manage a high volume of requests simultaneously. For businesses, that sounds like an ideal solution. It's no surprise that the chatbot market has surged from $370 million in 2017 to $2.2 billion in 2024. Many companies now rely on chatbots as the first point of contact for customer service. Despite the convenience, not all customers are on board.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Why most customers still prefer human agents over chatbots",
      "While companies are excited about the speed and efficiency of chatbots, many customers are not. A recent survey found that 71% of people would rather speak with a human agent. Even more concerning, 60% said chatbots often do not understand their issue. This is not just about getting the wrong answer. It comes down to trust. Most people are still unsure about artificial intelligence, especially when their time or money is on the line.",
      "Customer service representatives (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WHAT IS CHATGPT?",
      "When customers want a human agent instead of a chatbot",
      "Not every customer question is the same. Some are simple and quick. Others are more complex or personal. And that's where chatbots fall short. A recent survey showed that 47% of people were OK with a company using their purchase history for marketing. But only 9% were OK with the company using their financial information. That's a big difference. When things feel more sensitive or serious, people want a real person to help.",
      "New research compares chatbots to human agents in customer service",
      "To better understand how people really interact with chatbots and human agents, researcher Vivek Astvansh partnered with a large North American retailer and analyzed more than 500,000 customer service chats. The findings are detailed in his peer-reviewed study, \"Insights from Customers' Chats with Bots and Human Agents.\"",
      "The study found that most inquiries fell into one of six categories: orders, coupons, products, shipping, account issues and payments. When customers had questions about detailed or sensitive topics, such as shipping or payment issues, they were far more likely to seek out a human agent rather than rely on a chatbot. Astvansh's research also revealed that human agents were more effective at matching the content and communication style of the customer than chatbots.",
      "This similarity in language and topic focus led to stronger rapport between customer and agent. In fact, the closer the agent's responses aligned with the dominant topic of the conversation, the faster and more frequently customers replied. The data suggests that customers feel more engaged when they sense they are being understood, which is a key driver of satisfaction during service interactions.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "How businesses can improve customer service with a hybrid approach",
      "So, how can businesses use these insights to improve customer service? Not every customer issue should be handled by a chatbot. Companies should determine the intent behind each inquiry before deciding whether it should be routed to a bot or a human.",
      "Human agents already know how to mirror a customer's tone and focus. For chatbots to succeed, they must be trained to recognize and adapt to customer intent and language patterns. While this doesn't come naturally to machines, it can be programmed using machine-learning models like those used in the study.",
      "If a company is investing in a chatbot system, it should track how well that system performs. Businesses should ask chatbot vendors to provide real-world data showing how their bots compare to human agents in terms of efficiency, accuracy and customer satisfaction. If the technology cannot meet a high standard, it may not be worth the investment.",

      "AI tools, such as chatbots, are helpful and are not going away anytime soon. But customers still want to feel heard and understood. That usually means talking to a real person.

      "Haddad traced the rise of extremist voices in the West to waves of immigration and population displacement from conflict zones in the Middle East.

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to \"produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony\" in the Jeffrey Epstein case \u2014 but it's unclear what's in that material, or whether a judge will even allow it to be released.",
      "The Justice Department filed the motion in federal court in New York late Friday afternoon, calling on a judge to \"release the associated grand jury transcripts\" of cases having to do with Epstein \"and lift any preexisting protective orders.\"",
      "The president handed down the directive on the case Thursday night, hours after The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump sent a \"bawdy\" 50th birthday letter to Epstein in 2003. NBC News has not independently verified the documents, and Trump denied sending such a letter. The president filed a lawsuit on Friday against the newspaper's publisher, two of its reporters and News Corp founder Rupert Murdoch. A Dow Jones spokesperson said in a statement, \u201cWe have full confidence in the rigor and accuracy of our reporting, and will vigorously defend against any lawsuit.\u201d",
      "The president in recent days has sought to brush off the growing pressure, including from some of his closest supporters, to release more information on the case. Epstein's criminal case and 2019 death have long been the subject of conspiracy theories.",
      "\"Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval. This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!\" he wrote.",
      "Bondi responded almost immediately, writing on X that the DOJ was \"ready to move the court tomorrow to unseal the grand jury transcripts.\"",
      "Experts told NBC News such a move could create legal and ethical issues, given laws protecting grand jury secrecy. The Justice Department said in its filing the move is necessary given \"longstanding and legitimate\" public interest in the Epstein case.",
      "The DOJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The White House referred NBC News to Trump's Truth Social posts.",
      "Here's a look at what to expect next, and what \u2014 if anything \u2014might be revealed.",
      "What comes next?",
      "The Justice Department filed its motion in federal court in Manhattan, where the grand jury that charged Epstein was convened. Epstein was found dead in his jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. A medical examiner ruled his death a suicide.",
      "While Trump directed the DOJ to ask to unseal \"pertinent\" information about the case, its filing goes a bit further, asking the judge to unseal apparently all of \"the underlying grand jury transcripts in United States v. Epstein, subject to appropriate redactions of victim-related and other personal identifying information.\"",
      "The filing, signed by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, also Trump's former personal attorney, indicates a similar motion may be filed in Florida.",
      "Epstein had previously been investigated in the mid-2000s by federal and state authorities in Florida, where he struck a much-scrutinized deal that allowed him to plead guilty to state solicitation charges involving a single underage victim, despite investigations into dozens of others. Federal prosecutors now say he \"harmed over 1,000 victims.\"",
      "Legal experts said any future hearings on the filing may be heard in closed court under seal, meaning the public would not be able to see what is specifically requested by the DOJ, at least at first.",
      "Grand jury transcripts can include testimony from any potential witnesses and victims, as well as members of state, local or federal law enforcement who may have played an investigatory role in the case.",
      "The material that could be released is expected to focus on Epstein and his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, because prosecutors primarily present evidence against the individuals they are trying to indict, according to a former federal prosecutor in New York, who spoke to NBC News on the condition of anonymity. Other individuals are typically mentioned in the broader case file that includes documents produced throughout the investigation.",
      "Maxwell, the only other person who has been charged in the probe, was convicted on sex trafficking charges in Manhattan in 2021 and sentenced to 20 years in prison. She is appealing her sentence.",
      "Why can't the DOJ just release the transcripts?",
      "By law, grand jury testimony is secret. Those involved in a grand jury matter generally may not disclose information or material from the grand jury, with some exceptions: Witnesses can discuss their testimony, and the government can share information with people who are working on the case or a related matter.",
      "There are other exceptions as well, related to matters involving foreign intelligence, counterintelligence, national security and foreign affairs \u2014 none of which appear to apply in this case.",
      "Prosecutors have one edge with the proceedings being held in New York. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals \u2014 the federal court that oversees appeals in New York\u2019s Southern District \u2014 has held that judges have inherent authority to release grand jury materials in special or exceptional circumstances.",
      "Whether this situation is considered a special or exceptional circumstance is unclear. Among the factors the court said judges should consider are \u201chistorical interest\u201d and the passage of time, including whether people involved in the case are still alive. While Epstein is dead, Maxwell is alive and appealing her conviction to the Supreme Court.",
      "The DOJ filing maintains that the materials should be made public anyway.",
      "\u201cWhile the Government recognizes that Maxwell\u2019s case is currently pending before the Supreme Court on a petition for a writ of certiorari, it nonetheless moves this Court for relief due to the intense public scrutiny into this matter,\u201d the filing says.",
      "Other circuit courts have disagreed with the 2nd Circuit\u2019s position on disclosure, and the high court has not weighed in on the issue.",
      "Will the 'client list' finally become public?",
      "The current uproar began after the Justice Department and FBI released a joint memo saying it had conducted an \"exhaustive\" review of the Epstein case. Contrary to the conspiracy theories championed by the right, the report said the politically connected financier didn't have a \"client list\" of associates, that no other parties were facing charges, and that his death was in fact a suicide.",
      "The grand jury testimony is not expected to shed much, if any, light on those issues, because it would not include FBI 302s (a form filled out by FBI agents describing details of interviews with individuals involved in a case), photo or video evidence, or unredacted names of individuals not directly involved in the grand jury testimony.",
      "It also wouldn't include flight logs of people who had flown on Epstein's plane \u2014 logs released in 2021 as part of Maxwell\u2019s trial showed Trump, former President Bill Clinton and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. were among those who traveled on the plane. All three have denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein and have not been charged in relation to the case. Trump denied last year that he'd ever been on Epstein's plane.",
      "Kristy Greenberg, a legal analyst for MSNBC and a former federal prosecutor, called the Trump-Bondi move a \u201cred herring.\u201d",
      "\u201cTrump knows SDNY prosecutors seeking to indict Epstein and Maxwell didn\u2019t ask questions about him in their grand jury presentations while he was POTUS. It\u2019s a red herring to distract from the evidence that matters: witness interview notes, videos, photos, etc.,\u201d she wrote in a post on X.",
      "The former New York federal prosecutor agreed that records describing the information collected by investigators \u2014 not grand jury testimony \u2014 are more likely to contain the information that some have been demanding.",
      "\"It's those case files that are likely to contain financial transactions, phone numbers and other information about friends and associates of Epstein,\" said the former prosecutor.",
      "But the former prosecutor said that he believed his former colleagues would have pursued cases against any individuals if there were clear evidence that they engaged in sex trafficking or broke other federal laws.",
      "\"I would be surprised if there was anything federally prosecutable that was not charged,\" said the former prosecutor, who added that some forms of misconduct are not federal offenses. \"There are a lot of things that are unsavory that are not federal crimes.\"",
      "Former federal prosecutor Chuck Rosenberg, an NBC News analyst, warned that releasing grand jury information could lead down a slippery slope.",
      "\"Rules aside, it is fundamentally unfair to dump subject names in the public domain\" because those individuals may have \"done nothing wrong\" and also \"have no real forum to rebut accusations.\"",
      "\"If they have done something wrong, then they ought to be charged in a forum where they can contest the charges,\" he added. \"If DOJ has something to say, they ought to say it in court. Otherwise, they should say nothing.\"",
      "Rosenberg also issued a similar warning regarding bipartisan calls to release all of the FBI's investigative files in the case.",
      "\"It is fundamentally a bad practice to release unredacted investigative files into the public domain,\" he said. \"In every case, investigative files contain lots of information \u2014 some vetted, some unvetted, some accurate, some inaccurate, some resolved, some unresolved.\"",
      "He added, \"Lots of people tell FBI agents lots of things. Of course, that doesn\u2019t make that information true.\""

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., pressed Justice Department leadership about their handling of files related to the federal investigation into the late Jeffrey Epstein, including reports that FBI personnel were instructed to \"flag\" any records that mentioned President Donald Trump.",
      "In a series of oversight letters written to Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, Durbin questioned Bondi about \"contradictions\" in her public statements on the case, Patel about reports that he was \"pressured\" by Bondi to place 1,000 personnel on 24-hour shifts to mine roughly 100,000 Epstein-related records and Bongino about reported disputes among Trump officials about \u201cthe lack of transparency\u201d in their handling of the high-profile case.",
      "In the letters sent Friday, Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, asked each of the Trump administration officials to respond to information received by his office that suggested FBI personnel were specifically instructed to \"flag\" any records mentioning Trump.",
      "\"My office was told that these personnel were instructed to 'flag' any records in which President Trump was mentioned. ... Why were personnel told to flag records in which President Trump was mentioned,\" Durbin asked Bondi, Patel and Bongino in separate letters. \"What happened to the records mentioning President Trump once they were flagged?\"",
      "A Durbin aide told NBC News that the senator's office received that information from a protected FBI whistleblower disclosure.",
      "The FBI declined NBC News' request for comment on Durbin's letters.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here.",
      "The letters mark the latest attempt by Democrats to keep attention on Epstein more than a week after the Justice Department released a memo outlining a decision to cease additional disclosures related to the investigation. The memo roiled Trump's MAGA base, creating a rare rift among Trump and the far-right base that thrusted him into power \u2014 a rift that Democratic lawmakers have aimed to widen.",
      "In the aftermath of the Justice Department memo, Bondi has faced blowback in part because of previous public statements she made pointing to the existence of thousands of pages of additional documents related to Epstein, including a purported \"client list.\"",
      "Durbin, like many of Trump's supporters over the past week, asked the attorney general to reconcile her earlier public declarations with her department's finding that \"no further disclosures\" are warranted in the case and that a review of records \"revealed no incriminating client list.\"",
      "\"Why did you publicly claim on February 21 that the client list was 'sitting on my desk right now to review?'\" Durbin asked Bondi. \"If it was not a client list, what was 'sitting on your desk' at that moment?\"",
      "Bongino and Patel have also faced backlash online. Both of them previously promoted conspiracy theories that suggested the Epstein case was part of a government cover-up to protect powerful political players involved in a child abuse ring.",
      "Patel, in the only post he's made to his personal social media account since the Justice Department memo was released, said \"the conspiracy theories just aren't true\" and \"never have been.\" Durbin, aiming to call attention to Patel's past suggestions of a cover-up, asked the FBI director to detail the conspiracy theories he was referring to in his post.",
      "\"What are the conspiracy theories you are referring to in your July 12 tweet that 'were never true?' If there are more than one, please explain each in detail,\" the senator wrote to Patel.",
      "NBC News previously reported that Bongino was \"out of control furious,\" skipped a day of work and considered resigning from his post due to the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein files, a topic Durbin questioned the former political commentator about.",
      "\"What was the nature of the dispute between you and White House and DOJ officials after the release of the July 7 memorandum,\" Durbin asked Bongino. \"Is this dispute between you and White House and DOJ officials the reason behind your July 11 absence from work?\"",
      "Durbin also questioned the Trump officials about reporting from The Wall Street Journal that alleged Trump wrote a letter to Epstein in 2003, accompanied by a drawing of a naked woman, that was included in a leather-bound birthday album gifted to Epstein for his 50th birthday, according to documents reviewed by the Journal.",
      "Trump has denied that he wrote the letter and he filed a lawsuit against the newspaper for publishing the story. NBC News has not independently confirmed the Journal's reporting.",
      "A spokesperson for Dow Jones, the newspaper\u2019s publisher, said in a statement, \u201cWe have full confidence in the rigor and accuracy of our reporting, and will vigorously defend against any lawsuit.\u201d",
      "\"Did personnel review any correspondence between President Trump and Mr. Epstein, including a letter in the reported 'leather-bound album' as part of this year's review [of Epstein records]?\" Durbin asked.",
      "Hours after the Journal's reporting, Trump on Thursday directed Bondi to \"produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony\" related to Epstein, \"subject to Court approval.\" Bondi on Friday filed a motion requesting the unsealing of grand jury transcripts related to the Epstein case.",
      "\u201cGiven the public interest in the investigative work conducted by the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation into Epstein, the Department of Justice moves the Court to unseal the underlying grand jury transcripts in United States v.

      "Faced with what critics and allies are calling a severe threat to his presidency, Trump has alternately dismissed the furor as a \u201choax\u201d ginned-up by Democrats and ordered Bondi to release \u201cpertinent\u201d grand jury transcripts and other documents that could shed more light on the scandal.",

      "\u201cI get upset when I hear his name,\u201d Arden said of Epstein.",
      "Arden said Epstein had identified himself as a talent scout for Victoria\u2019s Secret and she wanted to meet him. Epstein was a top adviser to former Victoria\u2019s Secret CEO Les Wexner but was not a talent scout for the retailer.",
      "\u201cI really wanted to be in the Victoria\u2019s Secret catalog,\u201d said Arden. \u201cBut then he grabbed me, tried to tear off my clothes, and said he wanted to \u2018manhandle\u2019 me. I ran out of there and he chased after me.\u201d",
      "Arden, who filed a police report after the encounter with Epstein, said she supports Trump but believes \u201cthere\u2019s a cover-up of some kind going on.\u201d",
      "\u201cPam Bondi was saying back in February there was a list and then she said the list was on her desk and now there is no list,\u201d said Arden, who lives in Santa Monica. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want something to come out and I don\u2019t understand why. Maybe the list is more horrifying than we think.\u201d",
      "Another victim, who has spoken publicly about how Maxwell recruited her to give Epstein erotic massages, told NBC News she was \u201cterrified\u201d when Bondi announced there was no \u201cclient list\u201d and that she would not prosecute anyone else.",
      "\u201cIn the past, I was out there talking about what happened, and now I don\u2019t want my name out there in connection with anything to do with Epstein because I\u2019m afraid of what they could do to me and my family,\u201d said the woman, who agreed to speak to NBC News on the condition her name not be used because she fears retribution from the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cI am not surprised Trump is now saying we should stop talking about Epstein,\u201d she said. \u201cThese people are trying to protect themselves.\u201d",
      "Bensky said that what\u2019s happening now is like \u201cGround Hog Day for the #MeToo Movement\u201d and threatens the strides all victims have made in confronting their abusers.",
      "\u201cWe need transparency and accountability for the sake of our daughters and future generations of young girls,\u201d she said.",
      "Now a choreographer who works with teenage dance troupes, Bensky said she has for many years found solace by using \u201csome of the same tools I use in my choreography to get into a meditative state.\u201d",
      "\u201cOf late, I\u2019ve been working with a group of young dancers in Hawaii and I sometimes think about how there are so many girls out there being victimized,\u201d Bensky said. \u201cI find myself thinking, how do I tell my students that the world isn\u2019t always dark and painful? Because I sat in sadness for a long time.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 In 2021, the New York Post ran an online trailer of an upcoming documentary about Jeffrey Epstein that was produced by former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. In the video, Bannon is on camera questioning Epstein about \u201call of the depravity you\u2019ve done against young women,\u201d among other things.",
      "But that documentary never came out. Now, Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s brother, Mark, is asking for Bannon to show him the unseen footage.",
      "\u201cLet me see the videotapes,\u201d he told NBC News on Friday. \u201cHe\u2019s my brother.\u201d",
      "Mark Epstein said that Bannon, the MAGA media personality, worked with his brother, then a  convicted sex offender, after the Miami Herald in 2018 chronicled victims\u2019 details of abuse by Jeffrey Epstein. The two men filmed together before Epstein\u2019s arrest by federal authorities in the summer of 2019.",
      "\u201cHe told me he has like 15 or 16 hours of videotape of Jeff. He was trying to help Jeff rehabilitate his reputation,\u201d Mark Epstein said of Bannon. He said his meeting and conversation with Bannon took place in New York City after his brother\u2019s death in prison \u2014 in either 2019 or 2020.",
      "\u201cThey spent a lot of time together,\u201d Mark Epstein told NBC News.",
      "Bannon is not accused of any wrongdoing and was never publicly part of any investigation into Epstein.",
      "Bannon did not return a request for comment.",
      "NBC News viewed Bannon entering Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s New York residence on one occasion in late 2018.",
      "\u201cWhen I met with Bannon, he said he wanted to put a documentary or something together. He was trying to raise some money for it,\u201d said Mark Epstein, who says he has not heard from Bannon since then.",
      "Business Insider first spoke with Mark Epstein in 2023 about his brother\u2019s death and Bannon\u2019s apparent documentary footage.",
      "Bannon has a central place in the MAGA movement. A populist who played a key role in Trump\u2019s political rise, he now hosts the popular \u201cWar Room\u201d podcast. He has been advocating for the Trump administration to appoint a special counsel to look into the Epstein case.",
      "In the trailer for \u201cThe Monsters: Epstein\u2019s Life Among the Global Elite,\u201d published by the New York Post, Jeffrey Epstein said he was a \u201cfirm believer and supporter\u201d of the Time\u2019s Up organization, which worked to combat sexual harassment. Bannon \u2014 who has a background as a Hollywood producer and a documentary filmmaker \u2014 is also seen asking Epstein whether he owns two islands, \u201cthe Islands of Doctor Moreau,\u201d to which Epstein replies, \u201cCorrect.\u201d",
      "Bannon acknowledged the footage during a live taping of his podcast on July 12 and said that he intends to release at least parts of its contents \u201cearly next year.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to release the film, the five-part series next year \u2014 early next year,\u201d Bannon said in response to a questioner about the documentary\u2019s future.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to name names, and you\u2019re going to have to understand how the elites of the world but also the intelligence services are inextricably linked in the Epstein story,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s the key.\u201d",
      "Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro this week criticized Bannon for not releasing the footage.",
      "\u201cSo, release the Epstein tapes, Steve,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cI mean, like, seriously. More transparency is gooder. How about that? It seems like it makes sense to me.\u201d",
      "During the taping of his podcast \u201cWar Room\u201d on Friday, Bannon called for Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of \u201call the sealed evidence\u201d related to the Epstein investigation.",
      "\u201cThey should petition to release all the sealed evidence, right? And then there\u2019s much more they can do, but start with that,\u201d Bannon said.",
      "In 2021, The New York Times said that Bannon had confirmed that he had recorded more than 15 hours of interviews with Jeffrey Epstein. He said the film was meant to illustrate how  Epstein\u2019s \u201cperversions and depravity toward young women were part of a life that was systematically supported, encouraged and rewarded by a global establishment that dined off his money and his influence.\u201d",
      "Jeffrey Epstein died in prison in August 2019. The medical examiner ruled his death a suicide by hanging. But the circumstances around his death have long been fodder for many on the far right, who have pushed the conspiracy that \u201cEpstein didn\u2019t kill himself.\u201d",
      "Mark Epstein told NBC News that he now has doubts about the official explanation.",
      "\u201cMy concern is that my brother was killed,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cMore and more, I believe he was murdered, and everyone who looks at all the information that\u2019s out there on facts comes to the same conclusion, correct?\u201d",
      "In May on Fox Business, FBI Director Kash Patel \u2014 who stoked Epstein conspiracy theories before joining the administration \u2014 said that the bureau had determined that Epstein took his own life.",
      "\u201cYou know a suicide when you see one, and that\u2019s what that was,\u201d Patel said at the time.",
      "Mark Epstein called Patel a \u201cf---ing moron\u201d for his assessment.",
      "He said that Bannon sent a Dropbox link of one interview clip to Jeffrey Epstein, who, in turn, sent it to his brother. Mark said that the link to that footage has expired."

Rafferty, a Virginia firefighter who was deployed to hard-hit Kerr County to help with search and recovery efforts, folded it up and took it back to his hotel. He rinsed it off in the bathtub. He worried the drain might clog because of all the filth, tree roots and rocks that came out.",
      "But the tub survived and, after a trip to the laundromat, the quilt was virtually good as new. He posted a photo of the blanket on a Facebook group where people across central Texas are keeping track of things they\u2019ve recovered from the devastation: waterlogged clothes, stuffed animals, Barbie dolls, marriage licenses, family photo albums. Rafferty eventually connected with the quilt\u2019s owner and hand-delivered it to her.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a father of 3-year-old twin boys. I know if I\u2019d gone through something like these quilts, I\u2019d want it back,\u201d said Rafferty, 34.",
      "Rafferty is part of a loose network of first responders, volunteers and good Samaritans who have fanned out across the region to help reunite Texans with the cherished belongings, family heirlooms and everyday household knickknacks that were swept away when floods ripped through Kerr County over Fourth of July weekend, killing more than 130 people and leaving at least 100 missing.",
      "This week, NBC News spoke with people in the region about the objects that have turned up in the floods\u2019 aftermath \u2014 and why they matter. In some cases, seemingly trivial items have taken on far greater emotional significance in the wake of the deadly floods. These are some of their stories.",

    "story": [
      "Ukraine risks backsliding on its endemic corruption problem \u2014 and even creeping toward authoritarianism \u2014 activists warn, following police raids against a high-profile anti-corruption campaigner and opposition figures.",
      "On July 11, armed police raided the home of Vitaliy Shabunin, the co-founder of Ukraine\u2019s Anti-Corruption Action Center. He has accused President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of \u201ctaking the first, but confident steps toward corrupt authoritarianism,\u201d including backing laws offering amnesty to those accused of corruption in the defense industry, and passing over an independently selected candidate for a key anti-graft role.",
      "The move has perturbed even some of Zelenskyy\u2019s supporters \u2014 people who are simultaneously worried about the heavy-handed and potentially spurious crackdown on dissent, and that such criticisms against the Ukrainian leader might be used in bad faith by opponents in Moscow or Washington.",
      "\u201cThis is the red line which President Zelensky has crossed \u2014 and the red line is in a very wrong direction in terms of the development of Ukraine,\u201d said Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, the Kyiv-based watchdog that Shabunin co-founded. She said the State Bureau of Investigations did not have the necessary court documents for the search.",
      "Shabunin has been charged with evading military service and fraud, with prosecutors alleging that while on secondment from the front lines to continue his activism back in Kyiv, he conducted activities unrelated to his military service. His defense team and supporters say the secondment was all aboveboard and ordered by his superiors, and that the allegations are trumped up and political.",
      "The case has caused grave alarm for many inside Ukraine and abroad, with even some of those who praise Zelenskyy for making progress on corruption flagging it as cause for concern that he may be engaging in some of the same questionable practices they\u2019d hoped he was rooting out.",
      "Zelenskyy pledged to reduce corruption when he was elected in 2019, and many expert observers say he has been effective at doing so, but the tide of criticism around Shabunin\u2019s arrest comes when the president is under intense pressure to fight off Russia and keep alive support from the United States and the West that has been at risk of faltering.",
      "It\u2019s not just Shabunin\u2019s own organization that\u2019s concerned. A group of 59 nongovernmental and civil society organizations, both inside Ukraine and abroad, have signed an open letter to Zelenskyy saying the arrest \u201cbears signs of political motivation, abuse of rights\u201d and either \u201cgross incompetence\u201d or \u201ca deliberate attack to pressure\u201d Shabunin.",
      "NBC News has contacted Zelenskyy\u2019s office and the State Bureau of Investigations for comment but has not received a response.",
      "The president has been a longtime vocal advocate on the issue of fighting corruption, particularly when it comes to suggestions from the U.S. and elsewhere that the billions of dollars in military aid his country is receiving might be being misappropriated.",
      "\u201cWhere we saw risks that something could be happening with weapons, we cracked down hard,\u201d he told the \u201cLex Fridman Podcast\u201d in January.",
      "Last year Shabunin himself dismissed the idea that foreign arms could be embezzled, telling the BBC that \u201call weapons supplied by Western allies end up in the hands of Ukrainian troops who use them effectively. It is impossible to steal Western weapons.\u201d",
      "Shabunin appeared in court Tuesday and was released on \u201crecognizance\u201d \u2014 essentially released without having to post bail \u2014 until the next hearing Aug. 20.",
      "The German Marshall Fund, a Washington think tank and one of the international signatories of the letter to Zelenskyy, said Ukraine had made \u201cmonumental strides\u201d on corruption in the past 11 years.",
      "Nevertheless, \u201cit\u2019s always concerning when a government targets its vocal critics with flimsy charges in politically motivated investigations,\u201d said Josh Rudolph, head of the fund\u2019s malign finance and corruption team. \u201cAlthough this is not a sign of corruption per se, it displays an alarming disregard for the fundamental values of freedom and the rule of law at a time when the international community has been rallying around Ukraine because it is defending those very values from Russia\u2019s brutal assault.\u201d",
      "Shabunin is not the only recent arrest to cause alarm. The opposition UDAR party, headed by former heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, says that a raid in April on the home of Kyiv City Council deputy Dmytro Bilotserkivets \u2014 again, they said, without the necessary documents \u2014 was a clear attempt to put pressure on political dissent.",
      "Corruption in Ukraine is a fraught and delicate topic, ripe for weaponization often in bad faith.",
      "Russia uses it as an example to support its otherwise untrue criticisms \u2014 such as Ukraine being run by neo-Nazis \u2014 while American and European politicians hold up such examples to bolster their pre-existing arguments about whether to support Kyiv\u2019s defense against Moscow.",
      "\u201cThe issue of corruption in Ukraine has long been highly politicized,\u201d said Mariya Omelicheva, a professor at the Pentagon-funded National War College in Washington, D.C.",
      "Ukrainian \u201ccorruption is almost always co-opted \u2014 either by Ukraine\u2019s supporters or, more problematically, by its adversaries,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is particularly sensitive in the current U.S. political climate, where both parties \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 have used Ukrainian corruption narratives for domestic political purposes.\u201d",
      "There is also a feeling among some Ukrainians that President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d focus has allowed officials abroad to act with greater impunity knowing Washington\u2019s hitherto exacting gaze is currently less troubled by world affairs.",
      "\u201cOur international partners, particularly the United States, don\u2019t care anymore about good governance and anti-corruption and reforms,\u201d Kaleniuk said. Washington \u201cfor the last 12 years had a powerful impact on how Ukraine develops, and the U.S. was usually tough on good governance, anti-corruption reforms and developments critical for democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now America doesn\u2019t care about that.\u201d",
      "While it\u2019s true Trump historically spoke warmly of Russian President Vladimir Putin and appeared to accept many of his war demands, in recent weeks he has been increasingly hostile to the Kremlin and signaled a renewed support for Ukraine, pledging Patriot missiles for Kyiv and tariffs on Moscow.",
      "It\u2019s also true that Ukraine \u2014 and Zelenskyy \u2014 have achieved some progress in the corruption fight in recent years. Transparency International, the best known international group that tracks this topic, says Ukraine has steadily improved in its annual \u201cCorruption Perceptions\u201d index \u2014 although it still ranks 105 of 180 countries worldwide.",
      "Nevertheless, domestically there are plenty of Ukrainians alarmed at what they see is a negative direction of travel when it comes to corruption in their country. Though the immediate fight is against Russia, the ultimate battle is for their values of liberty and democracy, supporters say, without which the battlefield struggle becomes pointless.",
      "\u201cWe are fighting for freedoms and for dignity,\u201d Kaleniuk said. If those are lost, \u201conly Russia will applaud.\u201d",
      "Alexander Smith and Freddie Clayton reported from London. Erin McLaughlin from Washington, D.C., and Anastasiia Parafeniuk and Daryna Mayer from Kyiv."

    "story": [
      "Four people in Florida have died this year from bacterial infections that can cause \u201cflesh-eating\u201d wounds, the state\u2019s health department reported this month.",
      "The culprit, the bacteria Vibrio vulnificus, thrives in warm seawater. The deadly cases were seen in counties spread around Florida\u2019s extensive coastline, from Bay County in the Panhandle and Hillsborough County, where Tampa is located, on the Gulf Coast, to Broward County in southeastern Florida and St. Johns County just south of Jacksonville.",
      "Florida has seen 11 Vibrio vulnificus cases so far this year, the state\u2019s health department says. The bacteria can get into the body through open wounds in the skin and cause the surrounding tissue to die, a condition known as necrotizing fasciitis, or flesh-eating disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People can also get Vibrio vulnificus from eating contaminated foods, particularly raw oysters. It\u2019s unclear how the people in Florida were infected.",
      "About 1 in 5 people with a Vibrio vulnificus infection die, the CDC says.",
      "Antarpreet Jutla, an engineering professor at the University of Florida who researches Vibrio bacteria, said Vibrio vulnificus infections are still rare, though they tend to increase after hurricanes. Last year, Florida saw a total of 82 cases, which may have been exacerbated by the \u201cextremely active\u201d hurricane season.",
      "What is Vibrio vulnificus?",
      "Vibrio vulnificus is one of over 200 species of Vibrio bacteria, said Rita Colwell, a professor emerita of microbiology at the University of Maryland.",
      "The majority of Vibrio infections aren\u2019t harmful to humans, Jutla said. Some only affect other animals.",
      "But Vibrio bacteria do cause about 80,000 infections in people each year, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Most of those cases are gastrointestinal. Only a small handful \u2014 100 to 200 cases \u2014 are due to Vibrio vulnificus. Other Vibrio species, including Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio alginolyticus, are often the cause of those stomach illnesses. Another type of Vibrio, Vibrio cholorae, causes the diarrheal disease cholera.",
      "Because Vibrio bacteria prefer warm water, they are typically found along the southeastern shores of the U.S., but are also found on the West Coast as well. As ocean temperatures warm, more cases have been found further north in recent years, Jutla said, including some in New York, Connecticut and Maryland.",
      "Who is at risk?",
      "Vibrio bacteria can creep in open wounds after spending time in salty or brackish water, said Dr. Norman Beatty, an infectious disease doctor at University of Florida Health. Most cases he\u2019s seen have been associated with spending extended time in the water, but he says that a brief exposure could be the \u201conly thing needed.\u201d",

If infection progresses, it can get into the bloodstream and cause sepsis, which can be deadly. Symptoms of sepsis include fever, chills and dangerously low blood pressure, according to the CDC.",
      "People with liver cirrhosis, weakened immune systems and those over 65 are most at risk for infection, Jutla said.",
      "Vibrio vulnificus infections can be treated with antibiotics.",
      "How to prevent Vibrio infections",
      "Beatty said he recommends covering up any open wounds before going into the ocean. Even a waterproof Band-Aid does the job, he said.",

      "\u201cA delay in presenting to health care is truly the likely reason why most people have a more serious outcome than others,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople who present within the same day with signs and symptoms of early infection, who receive antibiotics, can do well and can avoid a lot of these serious complications.\u201d"

      "Three different meteor showers are happening at the same time this month, giving skywatchers plenty of chances to spend their summer nights looking for shooting stars.",
      "The annual alpha Capricornids, the Southern delta Aquariids and the Perseid meteor showers are all currently active, with each celestial show set to last through mid-August.",
      "Here's what to know about these meteor showers, and where and how you can spot shooting stars.",
      "The alpha Capricornids",
      "The alpha Capricornids and the Southern delta Aquariids will peak in activity at the end of this month, overnight from July 29 to 30, while the Perseids \u2014 often considered the best and most reliable shooting star display \u2014 will ramp up to its peak next month.",
      "Skywatchers will likely encounter mostly favorable conditions for catching meteor showers this July, according to the American Meteor Society.",
      "The alpha Capricornids meteor shower is not typically a strong display, but it can produce a number of bright fireballs while active. At its height, the meteor shower can produce around five shooting stars per hour under dark skies and clear conditions, according to the American Meteor Society.",
      "The shower gets its name because the meteors appear to stream from the constellation of Capricorn. During this year\u2019s peak, the moon will be only 27% full, offering people on either side of the equator a chance to catch the celestial show.",
      "The alpha Capricornids meteor shower occurs when Earth passes through clouds of dust particles and debris from the comet 169P/NEAT, which completes one orbit around the sun every 4.2 years. As pieces of debris hit the planet\u2019s atmosphere and vaporize, they create bright streaks of light that sometimes leave behind bright trails.",
      "The Southern delta Aquariids",
      "The Southern delta Aquariids, as their name suggests, are best viewed from the Southern Hemisphere. This meteor shower is capable of producing up to 25 meteors per hour under ideal conditions, but the shooting stars are typically fainter.",
      "Southern delta Aquariids can be tricky to spot, according to NASA, but the best chances this year will likely be in the early morning hours.",
      "The meteor shower is thought to be caused by pieces of the comet 96P/Machholz, which completes one orbit around the sun every 5.2 years.",
      "The Perseids",
      "Finally, the Perseids meteor shower is underway and is expected to peak overnight from Aug. 12 to 13. The Perseids are usually one of the most highly anticipated skywatching events of the year because the meteor shower occurs during warm summer months in the Northern Hemisphere and it typically delivers a high rate of shooting stars. Under ideal conditions, the Perseids can produce as many as 100 shooting stars per hour.",
      "This year, however, the moon will be around 84% full, which will likely wash out meteors and \u201cseverely compromise this shower at the time of maximum activity,\u201d according to the American Meteor Society.",
      "\u201cSuch conditions will reduce activity by at least 75% as only the brighter meteors will be visible,\u201d the society said in its forecast.",
      "The Perseids shower occurs when Earth passes through a cloud of dust particles and debris left over from a comet known as 109P/Swift-Tuttle."

Rafferty, a Virginia firefighter who was deployed to hard-hit Kerr County to help with search and recovery efforts, folded it up and took it back to his hotel. He rinsed it off in the bathtub. He worried the drain might clog because of all the filth, tree roots and rocks that came out.",
      "But the tub survived and, after a trip to the laundromat, the quilt was virtually good as new. He posted a photo of the blanket on a Facebook group where people across central Texas are keeping track of things they\u2019ve recovered from the devastation: waterlogged clothes, stuffed animals, Barbie dolls, marriage licenses, family photo albums. Rafferty eventually connected with the quilt\u2019s owner and hand-delivered it to her.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a father of 3-year-old twin boys. I know if I\u2019d gone through something like these quilts, I\u2019d want it back,\u201d said Rafferty, 34.",
      "Rafferty is part of a loose network of first responders, volunteers and good Samaritans who have fanned out across the region to help reunite Texans with the cherished belongings, family heirlooms and everyday household knickknacks that were swept away when floods ripped through Kerr County over Fourth of July weekend, killing more than 130 people and leaving at least 100 missing.",
      "This week, NBC News spoke with people in the region about the objects that have turned up in the floods\u2019 aftermath \u2014 and why they matter.

The floodwaters were rising fast and they needed to get to higher ground as soon as possible, he told her. Hyatt, a 67-year-old retired teacher, loaded everyone into her Toyota Tacoma and headed to her son\u2019s house, leaving most of her things behind.",
      "When she returned to the Old River Road RV Resort the following morning, her 42-foot Forest River home was gone, washed away by the floods. She was heartbroken. \u201cI just lost stuff, not loved ones,\u201d she said \u2014 but most objects in her home were associated with special \u201cmemories\u201d and she was sorry to see them go."

    "story": [
      "Make no mistake about it: Dustin Poirier is still at the top of his game. Even at 36, he remains among the UFC\u2019s most dangerous fighters both standing and on the mat. He has wins over Conor McGregor, Michael Chandler and Beno\u00eet Saint Denis in recent years.",
      "So why, despite a No. 6 ranking among lightweights and a headlining fight at UFC 318 against Max Holloway in New Orleans on Saturday, does he plan on taking off the gloves for good?",
      "It all comes down to family.",
      "\u201cMe and my wife have been together for a long time, since before I was fighting, so she\u2019s been on this whole journey with me,\u201d Poirier told NBC News last week. \u201cShe\u2019s been asking me to stop fighting for a long time, and so has my daughter.\u201d",
      "After 30 wins in 40 fights, a resume mostly made up of all-out wars that have made him a fan favorite, Poirier has followed their advice. The Lafayette, Louisiana, native will walk out in front of his hometown crowd and compete for the final time, ending a legendary career.",
      "Poirier said his long-term health was a major factor.",
      "\u201cI want to be there for my family for the long run,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to watch my daughter get married and always be there for her, not just physically, but mentally, too. I want to leave with my faculties. This isn\u2019t good for you. Getting kicked and kneed and punched in the head for 18 years isn\u2019t good for you.\u201d",
      "Poirier said he officially came to terms with the decision after his last fight against Islam Makhachev in June 2024. In that bout, a fifth-round submission loss, he suffered his third defeat in a championship. He previously fell to Charles Oliveira and Khabib Nurmagomedov, respectively, with the belt on the line. The UFC will typically only give you so many shots at a title.",
      "He likely would have needed another winning streak to get back into contention, he said, and at his age, with wear and tear on his body since he began fighting at 17, it didn\u2019t appear set to happen anytime soon.",

He could walk out to the octagon in front of his hometown crowd, beat another fan favorite and leave with gold around his waist.",
      "It would be the perfect ending to one of the UFC\u2019s most storied careers.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s not something I thought about when I was a young kid in my early 20s or mid-20s,\u201d he said this week. \u201cIt\u2019s something that as I got older in the sport, I started realizing things and noticing things and doing my research and just growing up and realizing this isn\u2019t good for you.

The deadly cases were seen in counties spread around Florida\u2019s extensive coastline, from Bay County in the Panhandle and Hillsborough County, where Tampa is located, on the Gulf Coast, to Broward County in southeastern Florida and St. Johns County just south of Jacksonville.",
      "Florida has seen 11 Vibrio vulnificus cases so far this year, the state\u2019s health department says. The bacteria can get into the body through open wounds in the skin and cause the surrounding tissue to die, a condition known as necrotizing fasciitis, or flesh-eating disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People can also get Vibrio vulnificus from eating contaminated foods, particularly raw oysters. It\u2019s unclear how the people in Florida were infected.",
      "About 1 in 5 people with a Vibrio vulnificus infection die, the CDC says.",
      "Antarpreet Jutla, an engineering professor at the University of Florida who researches Vibrio bacteria, said Vibrio vulnificus infections are still rare, though they tend to increase after hurricanes. Last year, Florida saw a total of 82 cases, which may have been exacerbated by the \u201cextremely active\u201d hurricane season.",

Only a small handful \u2014 100 to 200 cases \u2014 are due to Vibrio vulnificus. Other Vibrio species, including Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio alginolyticus, are often the cause of those stomach illnesses. Another type of Vibrio, Vibrio cholorae, causes the diarrheal disease cholera.",

      "For starters, Nevada is expecting the law\u2019s changes to Medicaid and food assistance to boot hundreds of thousands of residents from crucial social safety net programs.",
      "Like other states in similar predicaments, lawmakers will have to scramble to figure out how to find money in the state budget to keep many of those people covered. But the impacts of the law on that budget and the state\u2019s broader finances could be even more significant than in many others because Nevada has no state income tax, and therefore is extremely limited in how it can find new revenues.",
      "Then there are the new law\u2019s tax provisions related to tipped employees and gamblers that will have an outsize effect on a state whose economy relies almost exclusively on casinos and hospitality.",
      "The implementation of the new law in the coming months and years will occur as Nevada is set to play a key role in the next midterm and presidential elections.",
      "In 2026, Gov. Joe Lombardo \u2014 who has walked a fine line between offering praise for certain aspects of the megabill while pushing back against others \u2014 is seen as the most vulnerable Republican governor up for re-election. And Nevada\u2019s battleground 3rd District, represented by Democratic Rep. Susie Lee, will be a key race in the fight for the House majority.",
      "And in 2028, Nevada will likely again host critical contests for the White House and Senate.",
      "Democrats are already eager to go on offense against the law. State Rep. Steve Yeager, the Democratic speaker of the state Assembly, said he\u2019s already been contacted by many constituents who have expressed \u201cconcern about what this bill might mean for them\u201d and how they could be impacted by its changes to Medicaid, food assistance, energy credits, taxes on tips and gambling.",

      "'A low-revenue state'",
      "Approximately 1 in 3 Nevadans are on Medicaid, according to data from the state and KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group, due in part to a massive expansion of the program back in 2013 by then-Gov. Brian Sandoval, one of the first Republican governors to embark on Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "Trump\u2019s law will institute steep cuts to Medicaid and food aid benefits mostly by establishing new work requirements, restrict state-levied fees on health care providers that are mostly used to fund Medicaid, and preclude the federal government from being responsible for reimbursing states any longer. In Nevada, as many as 100,000 people could fall off Medicaid as a result, according to the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "But unlike some other states, which may be able to shift funds around in their budgets to build financial support for affected residents, Nevada\u2019s hands are largely tied. It has no state income tax and has a state constitutional provision requiring a two-thirds majority to raise revenue.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have the funds to be able to fill these critical gaps,\u201d Yeager said. \u201cWe\u2019re a low-revenue state. \u2026 We\u2019re in a really tough place.\u201d",
      "Nevada is also likely to be uniquely impacted by a pair of tax provisions.",
      "Starting in 2026, gamblers will have to pay more taxes under the GOP\u2019s new law. That\u2019s because the law will limit what gamblers can deduct from their yearly taxes to 90% of their losses. Bettors can currently deduct the entirety of their losses \u2014 up until their winnings.",
      "Bettors have expressed concerns that the provision could cause professional gambling in the U.S. to fold. And Nevada Democrats say it\u2019s all but certain to impact the bustling and crucial industry in the casino-laden state.",
      "\u201cThis means if someone wins a big jackpot in Las Vegas and then loses that one jackpot later on, they would still be liable for 10% in taxes on gaming \u2018income,\u2019 even though they had not brought home anything,\u201d Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., said last week on the chamber floor. \u201cThat\u2019s not just bad math, it\u2019s bad policy.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Trump and Republicans have boasted of the law\u2019s provision that they call \u201cno tax on tips.\u201d Trump unveiled the concept during a 2024 campaign event in Nevada, which is among the states with the highest concentration of service workers who rely on tips.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re a restaurant worker, a server, a valet, a bellhop, a bartender, one of my caddies \u2026 your tips will be 100% yours,\u201d Trump said of the policy idea during a January visit to Las Vegas shortly after he was sworn in for his second term.",
      "The law allows for a deduction on federal taxes of up to $25,000 in tipped income. At first glance, it appears it could be a boon for workers who rely heavily on tips.",
      "But economists at the Yale Budget Lab have written that 37% of all tipped workers don\u2019t earn enough money to even pay federal income tax, meaning that these people wouldn\u2019t gain from the new deduction.",
      "In addition, critics note the cap is relatively small and that it phases out once workers enter a higher income bracket ($150,000 per year). Plus, the provision only runs through 2028.",
      "Democrats also note that the law froze nearly all of the clean energy funds the state had received under President Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act. Nevada, where scorching temperatures have led to soaring energy costs for voters and businesses, was among the states that claimed the most IRA funds used to incentivize clean energy investments and jobs, as well as home energy rebates.",
      "As those funds dry up, so too could financial relief for residents and businesses.",
      "\u201cWith the undoing of some of the Inflation Reduction Act, losing monies that were in the bill, we\u2019re going to lose solar jobs \u2014 and I am confident that our power bills are going to increase,\u201d Yeager said.",
      "A key gubernatorial race",
      "Those impacts will loom particularly large in next year\u2019s governor\u2019s race in Nevada. Even before Trump enacted the law, Lombardo, who won his 2022 election over Democrat Steve Sisolak by just 1.5 percentage points, was the only Republican governor up for re-election next year whose race was rated by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report as a \u201ctoss-up.\u201d",
      "Nevada Democrats have already aggressively sought to link Lombardo to the \u201cbig, beautiful bill.\u201d",
      "\u201cLombardo will have to reckon with the damage done to Nevadans\u2019 lives and livelihoods because he was too cowardly to stand up to Trump,\u201d said Nevada Democratic Party Chair Daniele Monroe-Moreno.",
      "Lombardo, for his part, has praised some of the tax provisions in the law, but he also warned Congress not to make changes to Medicaid funding ahead of its passage.",
      "\u201cWhile my administration continues to assess this bill as it moves to get signed into law, Nevadans should be excited about the potential impacts of tax cuts, investments in small businesses and American manufacturing, and efforts to help secure our border,\u201d Lombardo wrote on X the day before Trump signed it into law.",
      "A spokesperson for Lombardo declined to comment for this story but referred to that post on X, in which Lombardo also lauded the law\u2019s \u201cno tax on tips\u201d provision. The spokesperson also referred to the letters Lombardo wrote to Congress and state legislators expressing his concerns about the bill\u2019s impact on Medicaid, plus a letter he wrote to Trump urging him to reconsider the gambling losses provision.",
      "Lombardo was also among just seven Republican governors who did not sign a May letter in support of Trump\u2019s proposed \u201cbig, beautiful bill.\u201d",
      "That tension underscores the bind many Republican incumbents are likely to find themselves in during next year\u2019s midterms as they seek to take credit for some of the tax-saving mechanisms of the bill while distancing themselves from the cuts that Democrats are already hammering them on \u2014 all while trying to avoid running afoul of Trump.",
      "Responding to questions about the political impacts of the law, John Burke, a spokesperson for the Lombardo-supporting Better Nevada state PAC, said in an email, \u201cUnder Governor Lombardo\u2019s leadership, Nevada is finally getting back on track, and the people of our state are seeing results.\u201d He pointed specifically to accomplishments on affordable housing and education.",
      "\u201cThe Governor has been vocal about his support for eliminating taxes on tips and supports a return to previous law on gambling losses,\u201d Burke added.",
      "State Attorney General Aaron Ford, who is so far the only Democrat who\u2019s entered the race against Lombardo, slammed the law for its impacts on health care and food assistance. He said \u201cservers and bartenders and hospitality workers are going to be getting played\u201d by Republicans\u2019 \u201cno tax on tips\u201d claims."

    "summary": "Ukranian activists warn about corruption and authoritarianism after police raids against several high-profile anti-corruption campaigners and opposition figures.",
    "story": [
      "Ukraine risks backsliding on its endemic corruption problem \u2014 and even creeping toward authoritarianism \u2014 activists warn, following police raids against a high-profile anti-corruption campaigner and opposition figures.",
      "On July 11, armed police raided the home of Vitaliy Shabunin, the co-founder of Ukraine\u2019s Anti-Corruption Action Center. He has accused President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of \u201ctaking the first, but confident steps toward corrupt authoritarianism,\u201d including backing laws offering amnesty to those accused of corruption in the defense industry, and passing over an independently selected candidate for a key anti-graft role.",
      "The move has perturbed even some of Zelenskyy\u2019s supporters \u2014 people who are simultaneously worried about the heavy-handed and potentially spurious crackdown on dissent, and that such criticisms against the Ukrainian leader might be used in bad faith by opponents in Moscow or Washington.",
      "\u201cThis is the red line which President Zelensky has crossed \u2014 and the red line is in a very wrong direction in terms of the development of Ukraine,\u201d said Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, the Kyiv-based watchdog that Shabunin co-founded. She said the State Bureau of Investigations did not have the necessary court documents for the search.",
      "Shabunin has been charged with evading military service and fraud, with prosecutors alleging that while on secondment from the front lines to continue his activism back in Kyiv, he conducted activities unrelated to his military service. His defense team and supporters say the secondment was all aboveboard and ordered by his superiors, and that the allegations are trumped up and political.",
      "The case has caused grave alarm for many inside Ukraine and abroad, with even some of those who praise Zelenskyy for making progress on corruption flagging it as cause for concern that he may be engaging in some of the same questionable practices they\u2019d hoped he was rooting out.",
      "Zelenskyy pledged to reduce corruption when he was elected in 2019, and many expert observers say he has been effective at doing so, but the tide of criticism around Shabunin\u2019s arrest comes when the president is under intense pressure to fight off Russia and keep alive support from the United States and the West that has been at risk of faltering.",
      "It\u2019s not just Shabunin\u2019s own organization that\u2019s concerned. A group of 59 nongovernmental and civil society organizations, both inside Ukraine and abroad, have signed an open letter to Zelenskyy saying the arrest \u201cbears signs of political motivation, abuse of rights\u201d and either \u201cgross incompetence\u201d or \u201ca deliberate attack to pressure\u201d Shabunin.",
      "NBC News has contacted Zelenskyy\u2019s office and the State Bureau of Investigations for comment but has not received a response.",
      "The president has been a longtime vocal advocate on the issue of fighting corruption, particularly when it comes to suggestions from the U.S. and elsewhere that the billions of dollars in military aid his country is receiving might be being misappropriated.",
      "\u201cWhere we saw risks that something could be happening with weapons, we cracked down hard,\u201d he told the \u201cLex Fridman Podcast\u201d in January.",
      "Last year Shabunin himself dismissed the idea that foreign arms could be embezzled, telling the BBC that \u201call weapons supplied by Western allies end up in the hands of Ukrainian troops who use them effectively. It is impossible to steal Western weapons.\u201d",
      "Shabunin appeared in court Tuesday and was released on \u201crecognizance\u201d \u2014 essentially released without having to post bail \u2014 until the next hearing Aug. 20.",
      "The German Marshall Fund, a Washington think tank and one of the international signatories of the letter to Zelenskyy, said Ukraine had made \u201cmonumental strides\u201d on corruption in the past 11 years.",
      "Nevertheless, \u201cit\u2019s always concerning when a government targets its vocal critics with flimsy charges in politically motivated investigations,\u201d said Josh Rudolph, head of the fund\u2019s malign finance and corruption team. \u201cAlthough this is not a sign of corruption per se, it displays an alarming disregard for the fundamental values of freedom and the rule of law at a time when the international community has been rallying around Ukraine because it is defending those very values from Russia\u2019s brutal assault.\u201d",
      "Shabunin is not the only recent arrest to cause alarm. The opposition UDAR party, headed by former heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, says that a raid in April on the home of Kyiv City Council deputy Dmytro Bilotserkivets \u2014 again, they said, without the necessary documents \u2014 was a clear attempt to put pressure on political dissent.",
      "Corruption in Ukraine is a fraught and delicate topic, ripe for weaponization often in bad faith.",
      "Russia uses it as an example to support its otherwise untrue criticisms \u2014 such as Ukraine being run by neo-Nazis \u2014 while American and European politicians hold up such examples to bolster their pre-existing arguments about whether to support Kyiv\u2019s defense against Moscow.",
      "\u201cThe issue of corruption in Ukraine has long been highly politicized,\u201d said Mariya Omelicheva, a professor at the Pentagon-funded National War College in Washington, D.C.",
      "Ukrainian \u201ccorruption is almost always co-opted \u2014 either by Ukraine\u2019s supporters or, more problematically, by its adversaries,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is particularly sensitive in the current U.S. political climate, where both parties \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 have used Ukrainian corruption narratives for domestic political purposes.\u201d",
      "There is also a feeling among some Ukrainians that President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d focus has allowed officials abroad to act with greater impunity knowing Washington\u2019s hitherto exacting gaze is currently less troubled by world affairs.",
      "\u201cOur international partners, particularly the United States, don\u2019t care anymore about good governance and anti-corruption and reforms,\u201d Kaleniuk said. Washington \u201cfor the last 12 years had a powerful impact on how Ukraine develops, and the U.S. was usually tough on good governance, anti-corruption reforms and developments critical for democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now America doesn\u2019t care about that.\u201d",
      "While it\u2019s true Trump historically spoke warmly of Russian President Vladimir Putin and appeared to accept many of his war demands, in recent weeks he has been increasingly hostile to the Kremlin and signaled a renewed support for Ukraine, pledging Patriot missiles for Kyiv and tariffs on Moscow.",
      "It\u2019s also true that Ukraine \u2014 and Zelenskyy \u2014 have achieved some progress in the corruption fight in recent years. Transparency International, the best known international group that tracks this topic, says Ukraine has steadily improved in its annual \u201cCorruption Perceptions\u201d index \u2014 although it still ranks 105 of 180 countries worldwide.",
      "Nevertheless, domestically there are plenty of Ukrainians alarmed at what they see is a negative direction of travel when it comes to corruption in their country. Though the immediate fight is against Russia, the ultimate battle is for their values of liberty and democracy, supporters say, without which the battlefield struggle becomes pointless.",
      "\u201cWe are fighting for freedoms and for dignity,\u201d Kaleniuk said. If those are lost, \u201conly Russia will applaud.\u201d",
      "Alexander Smith and Freddie Clayton reported from London. Erin McLaughlin from Washington, D.C., and Anastasiia Parafeniuk and Daryna Mayer from Kyiv."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to \"produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony\" in the Jeffrey Epstein case \u2014 but it's unclear what's in that material, or whether a judge will even allow it to be released.",
      "The Justice Department filed the motion in federal court in New York late Friday afternoon, calling on a judge to \"release the associated grand jury transcripts\" of cases having to do with Epstein \"and lift any preexisting protective orders.\"",
      "The president handed down the directive on the case Thursday night, hours after The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump sent a \"bawdy\" 50th birthday letter to Epstein in 2003. NBC News has not independently verified the documents, and Trump denied sending such a letter. The president filed a lawsuit on Friday against the newspaper's publisher, two of its reporters and News Corp founder Rupert Murdoch. A Dow Jones spokesperson said in a statement, \u201cWe have full confidence in the rigor and accuracy of our reporting, and will vigorously defend against any lawsuit.\u201d",
      "The president in recent days has sought to brush off the growing pressure, including from some of his closest supporters, to release more information on the case. Epstein's criminal case and 2019 death have long been the subject of conspiracy theories.",
      "\"Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval. This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!\" he wrote.",
      "Bondi responded almost immediately, writing on X that the DOJ was \"ready to move the court tomorrow to unseal the grand jury transcripts.\"",
      "Experts told NBC News such a move could create legal and ethical issues, given laws protecting grand jury secrecy. The Justice Department said in its filing the move is necessary given \"longstanding and legitimate\" public interest in the Epstein case.",
      "The DOJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The White House referred NBC News to Trump's Truth Social posts.",
      "Here's a look at what to expect next, and what \u2014 if anything \u2014might be revealed.",
      "What comes next?",
      "The Justice Department filed its motion in federal court in Manhattan, where the grand jury that charged Epstein was convened. Epstein was found dead in his jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. A medical examiner ruled his death a suicide.",
      "While Trump directed the DOJ to ask to unseal \"pertinent\" information about the case, its filing goes a bit further, asking the judge to unseal apparently all of \"the underlying grand jury transcripts in United States v. Epstein, subject to appropriate redactions of victim-related and other personal identifying information.\"",
      "The filing, signed by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, also Trump's former personal attorney, indicates a similar motion may be filed in Florida.",
      "Epstein had previously been investigated in the mid-2000s by federal and state authorities in Florida, where he struck a much-scrutinized deal that allowed him to plead guilty to state solicitation charges involving a single underage victim, despite investigations into dozens of others. Federal prosecutors now say he \"harmed over 1,000 victims.\"",
      "Legal experts said any future hearings on the filing may be heard in closed court under seal, meaning the public would not be able to see what is specifically requested by the DOJ, at least at first.",
      "Grand jury transcripts can include testimony from any potential witnesses and victims, as well as members of state, local or federal law enforcement who may have played an investigatory role in the case.",
      "The material that could be released is expected to focus on Epstein and his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, because prosecutors primarily present evidence against the individuals they are trying to indict, according to a former federal prosecutor in New York, who spoke to NBC News on the condition of anonymity. Other individuals are typically mentioned in the broader case file that includes documents produced throughout the investigation.",
      "Maxwell, the only other person who has been charged in the probe, was convicted on sex trafficking charges in Manhattan in 2021 and sentenced to 20 years in prison. She is appealing her sentence.",
      "Why can't the DOJ just release the transcripts?",
      "By law, grand jury testimony is secret. Those involved in a grand jury matter generally may not disclose information or material from the grand jury, with some exceptions: Witnesses can discuss their testimony, and the government can share information with people who are working on the case or a related matter.",
      "There are other exceptions as well, related to matters involving foreign intelligence, counterintelligence, national security and foreign affairs \u2014 none of which appear to apply in this case.",
      "Prosecutors have one edge with the proceedings being held in New York. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals \u2014 the federal court that oversees appeals in New York\u2019s Southern District \u2014 has held that judges have inherent authority to release grand jury materials in special or exceptional circumstances.",
      "Whether this situation is considered a special or exceptional circumstance is unclear. Among the factors the court said judges should consider are \u201chistorical interest\u201d and the passage of time, including whether people involved in the case are still alive. While Epstein is dead, Maxwell is alive and appealing her conviction to the Supreme Court.",
      "The DOJ filing maintains that the materials should be made public anyway.",
      "\u201cWhile the Government recognizes that Maxwell\u2019s case is currently pending before the Supreme Court on a petition for a writ of certiorari, it nonetheless moves this Court for relief due to the intense public scrutiny into this matter,\u201d the filing says.",
      "Other circuit courts have disagreed with the 2nd Circuit\u2019s position on disclosure, and the high court has not weighed in on the issue.",
      "Will the 'client list' finally become public?",
      "The current uproar began after the Justice Department and FBI released a joint memo saying it had conducted an \"exhaustive\" review of the Epstein case. Contrary to the conspiracy theories championed by the right, the report said the politically connected financier didn't have a \"client list\" of associates, that no other parties were facing charges, and that his death was in fact a suicide.",
      "The grand jury testimony is not expected to shed much, if any, light on those issues, because it would not include FBI 302s (a form filled out by FBI agents describing details of interviews with individuals involved in a case), photo or video evidence, or unredacted names of individuals not directly involved in the grand jury testimony.",
      "It also wouldn't include flight logs of people who had flown on Epstein's plane \u2014 logs released in 2021 as part of Maxwell\u2019s trial showed Trump, former President Bill Clinton and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. were among those who traveled on the plane. All three have denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein and have not been charged in relation to the case. Trump denied last year that he'd ever been on Epstein's plane.",
      "Kristy Greenberg, a legal analyst for MSNBC and a former federal prosecutor, called the Trump-Bondi move a \u201cred herring.\u201d",
      "\u201cTrump knows SDNY prosecutors seeking to indict Epstein and Maxwell didn\u2019t ask questions about him in their grand jury presentations while he was POTUS. It\u2019s a red herring to distract from the evidence that matters: witness interview notes, videos, photos, etc.,\u201d she wrote in a post on X.",
      "The former New York federal prosecutor agreed that records describing the information collected by investigators \u2014 not grand jury testimony \u2014 are more likely to contain the information that some have been demanding.",
      "\"It's those case files that are likely to contain financial transactions, phone numbers and other information about friends and associates of Epstein,\" said the former prosecutor.",
      "But the former prosecutor said that he believed his former colleagues would have pursued cases against any individuals if there were clear evidence that they engaged in sex trafficking or broke other federal laws.",
      "\"I would be surprised if there was anything federally prosecutable that was not charged,\" said the former prosecutor, who added that some forms of misconduct are not federal offenses. \"There are a lot of things that are unsavory that are not federal crimes.\"",
      "Former federal prosecutor Chuck Rosenberg, an NBC News analyst, warned that releasing grand jury information could lead down a slippery slope.",
      "\"Rules aside, it is fundamentally unfair to dump subject names in the public domain\" because those individuals may have \"done nothing wrong\" and also \"have no real forum to rebut accusations.\"",
      "\"If they have done something wrong, then they ought to be charged in a forum where they can contest the charges,\" he added. \"If DOJ has something to say, they ought to say it in court. Otherwise, they should say nothing.\"",
      "Rosenberg also issued a similar warning regarding bipartisan calls to release all of the FBI's investigative files in the case.",
      "\"It is fundamentally a bad practice to release unredacted investigative files into the public domain,\" he said. \"In every case, investigative files contain lots of information \u2014 some vetted, some unvetted, some accurate, some inaccurate, some resolved, some unresolved.\"",
      "He added, \"Lots of people tell FBI agents lots of things. Of course, that doesn\u2019t make that information true.\""

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 In 2021, the New York Post ran an online trailer of an upcoming documentary about Jeffrey Epstein that was produced by former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. In the video, Bannon is on camera questioning Epstein about \u201call of the depravity you\u2019ve done against young women,\u201d among other things.",
      "But that documentary never came out. Now, Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s brother, Mark, is asking for Bannon to show him the unseen footage.",
      "\u201cLet me see the videotapes,\u201d he told NBC News on Friday. \u201cHe\u2019s my brother.\u201d",
      "Mark Epstein said that Bannon, the MAGA media personality, worked with his brother, then a  convicted sex offender, after the Miami Herald in 2018 chronicled victims\u2019 details of abuse by Jeffrey Epstein. The two men filmed together before Epstein\u2019s arrest by federal authorities in the summer of 2019.",
      "\u201cHe told me he has like 15 or 16 hours of videotape of Jeff. He was trying to help Jeff rehabilitate his reputation,\u201d Mark Epstein said of Bannon. He said his meeting and conversation with Bannon took place in New York City after his brother\u2019s death in prison \u2014 in either 2019 or 2020.",
      "\u201cThey spent a lot of time together,\u201d Mark Epstein told NBC News.",
      "Bannon is not accused of any wrongdoing and was never publicly part of any investigation into Epstein.",
      "Bannon did not return a request for comment.",
      "NBC News viewed Bannon entering Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s New York residence on one occasion in late 2018.",
      "\u201cWhen I met with Bannon, he said he wanted to put a documentary or something together. He was trying to raise some money for it,\u201d said Mark Epstein, who says he has not heard from Bannon since then.",
      "Business Insider first spoke with Mark Epstein in 2023 about his brother\u2019s death and Bannon\u2019s apparent documentary footage.",
      "Bannon has a central place in the MAGA movement. A populist who played a key role in Trump\u2019s political rise, he now hosts the popular \u201cWar Room\u201d podcast. He has been advocating for the Trump administration to appoint a special counsel to look into the Epstein case.",
      "In the trailer for \u201cThe Monsters: Epstein\u2019s Life Among the Global Elite,\u201d published by the New York Post, Jeffrey Epstein said he was a \u201cfirm believer and supporter\u201d of the Time\u2019s Up organization, which worked to combat sexual harassment. Bannon \u2014 who has a background as a Hollywood producer and a documentary filmmaker \u2014 is also seen asking Epstein whether he owns two islands, \u201cthe Islands of Doctor Moreau,\u201d to which Epstein replies, \u201cCorrect.\u201d",
      "Bannon acknowledged the footage during a live taping of his podcast on July 12 and said that he intends to release at least parts of its contents \u201cearly next year.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to release the film, the five-part series next year \u2014 early next year,\u201d Bannon said in response to a questioner about the documentary\u2019s future.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to name names, and you\u2019re going to have to understand how the elites of the world but also the intelligence services are inextricably linked in the Epstein story,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s the key.\u201d",
      "Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro this week criticized Bannon for not releasing the footage.",
      "\u201cSo, release the Epstein tapes, Steve,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cI mean, like, seriously. More transparency is gooder. How about that? It seems like it makes sense to me.\u201d",
      "During the taping of his podcast \u201cWar Room\u201d on Friday, Bannon called for Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of \u201call the sealed evidence\u201d related to the Epstein investigation.",
      "\u201cThey should petition to release all the sealed evidence, right? And then there\u2019s much more they can do, but start with that,\u201d Bannon said.",
      "In 2021, The New York Times said that Bannon had confirmed that he had recorded more than 15 hours of interviews with Jeffrey Epstein. He said the film was meant to illustrate how  Epstein\u2019s \u201cperversions and depravity toward young women were part of a life that was systematically supported, encouraged and rewarded by a global establishment that dined off his money and his influence.\u201d",
      "Jeffrey Epstein died in prison in August 2019. The medical examiner ruled his death a suicide by hanging. But the circumstances around his death have long been fodder for many on the far right, who have pushed the conspiracy that \u201cEpstein didn\u2019t kill himself.\u201d",
      "Mark Epstein told NBC News that he now has doubts about the official explanation.",
      "\u201cMy concern is that my brother was killed,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cMore and more, I believe he was murdered, and everyone who looks at all the information that\u2019s out there on facts comes to the same conclusion, correct?\u201d",
      "In May on Fox Business, FBI Director Kash Patel \u2014 who stoked Epstein conspiracy theories before joining the administration \u2014 said that the bureau had determined that Epstein took his own life.",
      "\u201cYou know a suicide when you see one, and that\u2019s what that was,\u201d Patel said at the time.",
      "Mark Epstein called Patel a \u201cf---ing moron\u201d for his assessment.",
      "He said that Bannon sent a Dropbox link of one interview clip to Jeffrey Epstein, who, in turn, sent it to his brother. Mark said that the link to that footage has expired."

    "summary": "Sen. Dick Durbin questioned DOJ leadership over their handling of the Epstein files, including reports that FBI personnel were told to flag any mentions of Trump.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., pressed Justice Department leadership about their handling of files related to the federal investigation into the late Jeffrey Epstein, including reports that FBI personnel were instructed to \"flag\" any records that mentioned President Donald Trump.",
      "In a series of oversight letters written to Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, Durbin questioned Bondi about \"contradictions\" in her public statements on the case, Patel about reports that he was \"pressured\" by Bondi to place 1,000 personnel on 24-hour shifts to mine roughly 100,000 Epstein-related records and Bongino about reported disputes among Trump officials about \u201cthe lack of transparency\u201d in their handling of the high-profile case.",
      "In the letters sent Friday, Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, asked each of the Trump administration officials to respond to information received by his office that suggested FBI personnel were specifically instructed to \"flag\" any records mentioning Trump.",
      "\"My office was told that these personnel were instructed to 'flag' any records in which President Trump was mentioned. ... Why were personnel told to flag records in which President Trump was mentioned,\" Durbin asked Bondi, Patel and Bongino in separate letters. \"What happened to the records mentioning President Trump once they were flagged?\"",
      "A Durbin aide told NBC News that the senator's office received that information from a protected FBI whistleblower disclosure.",
      "The FBI declined NBC News' request for comment on Durbin's letters.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here.",
      "The letters mark the latest attempt by Democrats to keep attention on Epstein more than a week after the Justice Department released a memo outlining a decision to cease additional disclosures related to the investigation. The memo roiled Trump's MAGA base, creating a rare rift among Trump and the far-right base that thrusted him into power \u2014 a rift that Democratic lawmakers have aimed to widen.",
      "In the aftermath of the Justice Department memo, Bondi has faced blowback in part because of previous public statements she made pointing to the existence of thousands of pages of additional documents related to Epstein, including a purported \"client list.\"",
      "Durbin, like many of Trump's supporters over the past week, asked the attorney general to reconcile her earlier public declarations with her department's finding that \"no further disclosures\" are warranted in the case and that a review of records \"revealed no incriminating client list.\"",
      "\"Why did you publicly claim on February 21 that the client list was 'sitting on my desk right now to review?'\" Durbin asked Bondi. \"If it was not a client list, what was 'sitting on your desk' at that moment?\"",
      "Bongino and Patel have also faced backlash online. Both of them previously promoted conspiracy theories that suggested the Epstein case was part of a government cover-up to protect powerful political players involved in a child abuse ring.",
      "Patel, in the only post he's made to his personal social media account since the Justice Department memo was released, said \"the conspiracy theories just aren't true\" and \"never have been.\" Durbin, aiming to call attention to Patel's past suggestions of a cover-up, asked the FBI director to detail the conspiracy theories he was referring to in his post.",
      "\"What are the conspiracy theories you are referring to in your July 12 tweet that 'were never true?' If there are more than one, please explain each in detail,\" the senator wrote to Patel.",
      "NBC News previously reported that Bongino was \"out of control furious,\" skipped a day of work and considered resigning from his post due to the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein files, a topic Durbin questioned the former political commentator about.",
      "\"What was the nature of the dispute between you and White House and DOJ officials after the release of the July 7 memorandum,\" Durbin asked Bongino. \"Is this dispute between you and White House and DOJ officials the reason behind your July 11 absence from work?\"",
      "Durbin also questioned the Trump officials about reporting from The Wall Street Journal that alleged Trump wrote a letter to Epstein in 2003, accompanied by a drawing of a naked woman, that was included in a leather-bound birthday album gifted to Epstein for his 50th birthday, according to documents reviewed by the Journal.",
      "Trump has denied that he wrote the letter and he filed a lawsuit against the newspaper for publishing the story. NBC News has not independently confirmed the Journal's reporting.",
      "A spokesperson for Dow Jones, the newspaper\u2019s publisher, said in a statement, \u201cWe have full confidence in the rigor and accuracy of our reporting, and will vigorously defend against any lawsuit.\u201d",
      "\"Did personnel review any correspondence between President Trump and Mr. Epstein, including a letter in the reported 'leather-bound album' as part of this year's review [of Epstein records]?\" Durbin asked.",
      "Hours after the Journal's reporting, Trump on Thursday directed Bondi to \"produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony\" related to Epstein, \"subject to Court approval.\" Bondi on Friday filed a motion requesting the unsealing of grand jury transcripts related to the Epstein case.",
      "\u201cGiven the public interest in the investigative work conducted by the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation into Epstein, the Department of Justice moves the Court to unseal the underlying grand jury transcripts in United States v. Epstein, subject to appropriate redactions of victim-related and other personal identifying information,\u201d the document said."

      "A Southern California couple at the center of a child abuse investigation that involves 21 young children, some of whom were birthed by different surrogate mothers, engaged in unethical and illegal activity while running their real estate business, according to two separate lawsuits filed by former employees.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re terrible people. They just had shady business practices,\u201d said Tina Powers, a former real estate assistant for Silvia Zhang and Guojun Xuan.",
      "Powers said she worked for the couple\u2019s real estate company, Yudao Investments, for six months in 2022. She\u2019s among a group of six former real estate employees who filed a class action lawsuit that accuses Zhang and Xuan of unfair treatment, including failure to pay overtime wages and failure to permit timely rest breaks.",
      "The suit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court in December 2023, is ongoing.",
      "Zhang and Xuan have not responded to multiple requests for comment. An attorney who represented them in the class action suit and the second lawsuit could not immediately be reached for comment.",
      "According to Powers, Zhang and Xuan initially ran their real estate business out of their Los Angeles suburban mansion, where police recently removed 15 children amid their investigation after a 2-month-old baby was brought to the hospital with head injuries. The children were taken into protective custody, police in Arcadia said.",
      "A spokesman for the Arcadia Police Department said Thursday that video evidence recovered from the home shows that some of the younger children \u201cwere subjected to physical and emotional abuse\u201d by nannies, and they believe Zhang and Xuan \u201cknew all this was occurring and let it happen.\u201d An arrest warrant has been issued for the 56-year-old nanny who authorities say was seen on camera violently shaking and striking the 2-month-old baby who was hospitalized.",
      "Zhang, 38, and Xuan, 65, were arrested in May on suspicion of felony child endangerment and neglect but were released from custody pending further investigation.",
      "Six other children belonging to the couple were found in the care of family and friends, police said. It is not clear how many of the children were born to surrogate mothers.",
      "Powers said that when she worked for the couple, many of the rooms in the nine-bedroom home had been turned into offices, and there were cameras everywhere because \u201cthey thought you were conspiring against them.\u201d",
      "She recalled seeing four or five children in the home: one she believed to be biologically Zhang\u2019s from a previous relationship and three others who she believed biologically belonged to a woman who was allegedly a surrogate and a nanny. Zhang and Xuan also had one biological child together, Powers said.",
      "\u201cWe used to call it the nursery. There were two girls that helped her out with that,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of them was a surrogate.\u201d",
      "Powers said she never witnessed any abuse toward the children, but she said Zhang and Xuan would yell at each other and mistreat their real estate employees. She alleged that some workers were paid a lower salary than what was advertised in the job description, were paid late, were denied proper breaks, and were not given sick leave.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that the employees typically worked over eight hours a day without being paid overtime, and that on most days they were not able to take a \u201ctimely\u201d and \u201cuninterrupted\u201d meal break of at least 30 minutes.",
      "The couple would also fire workers whenever they felt like it, Powers said. Most of the employees involved in the class action lawsuit only worked for the couple for a few months in 2022, according to the complaint.",
      "\u201cIt was just very poor working conditions. It was dysfunctional. Those two yelled and screamed at each other like bloody murder, and it would just echo throughout the mansion. They would throw things at each other. It was not acceptable,\u201d she said. \u201cWorking for them was terrible.\u201d",
      "Around July 2022, the real estate business moved out of the mansion and into an office building in El Monte. Powers said she was terminated by the couple in September 2022 after she began speaking up for herself and her colleagues.",
      "\u201cI was insisting that they fix things,\u201d she said. \u201cThey accused me of writing down something wrong. They came, locked down my computer, and expected me to stay there for the whole day waiting for my check, like they did everybody else. I just left. And I was like, thank God it\u2019s over. They were just terrible people.\u201d",
      "Shortly after she was terminated, Powers reached out to her former colleagues, and they filed the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cThe minute I left, I started making calls because I knew it wasn\u2019t right,\u201d she said.",
      "In July 2022, another former employee sued the real estate company and Xuan, alleging wrongful termination, battery, assault and failure to pay overtime. Alejandro Diaz alleged in his lawsuit that Xuan threw rocks at him following an argument, brandished an assault rifle and fired him without proper pay.",
      "In a cross-complaint, Yudao alleged that Diaz was the aggressor and said the firearm Diaz saw was a toy gun Xuan had as he played with his son.",
      "Diaz began working for the couple in May 2022 as an eviction manager, according to the complaint. The lawsuit says that Xuan created a hostile work environment, screamed at employees, and illegally removed tenants from their homes.",
      "Diaz described his time working for the couple as \u201cchaotic.\u201d He said he was fired after eight days on the job following an incident with Xuan.",
      "The suit states that during one trip to a rental property, Diaz witnessed Xuan illegally change the locks to a home, preventing the tenant from entering the residence. When the tenant arrived at the property, an argument ensued.",
      "Diaz, Xuan and another eviction manager eventually left the property and went to another home, where Xuan allegedly yelled at the tenant and fired a stun gun at the tenant\u2019s dog, according to the lawsuit. Xuan allegedly became irate and began kicking the tenant\u2019s door before leaving the property.",
      "Diaz, according to the lawsuit, told Xuan that his method of evicting tenants was violent and illegal. The two got into an argument, and Xuan is accused of becoming \u201cincreasingly hostile\u201d and hitting Diaz\u2019s hand, the lawsuit says. When Diaz told Xuan not to touch him, Xuan allegedly \u201cstarted swinging at Diaz\u201d and throwing rocks at him.",
      "Back at the office, Xuan asked Diaz to meet in his office. According to the lawsuit, Xuan \u201cbegan throwing office items\u201d at Diaz. Another employee had to intervene and took Diaz outside, it says.",
      "Diaz said he was informed that he had been fired and was told to wait for his final paycheck, the suit states. He alleged in the lawsuit that as he waited for his check, Xuan came into the garage with what appeared to be an assault rifle and stared at him \u201cin a threatening manner.\u201d Fearing for his safety, Diaz called the police, according to the lawsuit. He said Zhang gave him his final paycheck, but it did not include any of the overtime he had worked.",
      "Diaz\u2019s lawsuit was settled earlier this year with a confidentiality clause, his attorney said.",
      "Powers said she has not kept in touch with Zhang or Xuan since she was fired, but was not shocked by the recent allegations. Diaz said he always felt like \u201csomething was off\u201d during his brief employment.",
      "\u201cI sensed something sinister was going on \u2026 but I couldn\u2019t really pinpoint it,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what was happening.\u201d",
      "One surrogate mother, Kayla Elliott, told NBC News that she thought she was helping a couple who struggled to conceive, and was unaware that Zhang and Xuan had so many other children. The child Elliott birthed is now in foster care, and she is fighting to gain custody.",
      "The Arcadia Police Department said it is working with the FBI and the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services as it investigates the couple.",
      "In a text message to Los Angeles television station KTLA, a phone number associated with Zhang said that \u201cany accusations of wrongdoing are misguided and wrong,\u201d and she looks forward to \u201cvindicating any such claims at the appropriate time when and if any actions are brought.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "In rare public remarks, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Thursday that she believes \u201cthis last week was a turning point\u201d in the U.S. and European stance toward Ukraine and Russia, and potentially in the war in Ukraine, \u201cbecause the president is angry with Putin because he has, in effect, made the president look bad.\u201d",
      "Speaking on a panel moderated by NBC News\u2019 Andrea Mitchell at the annual Aspen Security Forum, Rice addressed the ultimatum that President Donald Trump gave Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday, to accept a peace deal with Ukraine within 50 days or face new secondary sanctions, which would penalize entities that do business with Russia.",
      "\u201cI think the best news that we could possibly give to the Ukrainian people is that the United States and Europe have finally aligned around the idea that Vladimir Putin will not be stopped with words. He will only be stopped if he believes that he can go no further, he can win no further,\u201d Rice said.",
      "The promise of additional weapons for Ukraine and the ultimatum for Russia haven\u2019t slowed Putin\u2019s aggression, however. Late Wednesday night, Russia launched hundreds more drones and missiles into Ukraine, killing two people, injuring dozens more and knocking out power for 80,000 families.",
      "While acknowledging that secondary sanctions can be hard to enforce, Rice pointed to ways they could still be painful for Russia. \u201cIf you\u2019re China,\u201d she said, \u201cwith an economy that\u2019s not in great shape,\u201d or \u201cIndia, which really doesn\u2019t want to be on the wrong side of this, maybe you start thinking about whether that discounted Russian oil is really worth it.\u201d",
      "Given Rice\u2019s experience as secretary of state and before that as national security adviser, both in the George W. Bush administration, Mitchell also asked her about Marco Rubio currently holding both titles, making him the only person other than Henry Kissinger to have held both roles at once.",
      "\u201cYou know what?\u201d she said, \u201cI don\u2019t mind it.\u201d Rice explained that proximity is everything: \u201cTo have Marco Rubio in the White House next to the Oval Office, which is where the national security adviser is, as opposed to down in Foggy Bottom, where the secretary of state is, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad thing right now.\u201d",
      "Rice also criticized the Biden administration for, in her view, having taken its time to get desperately needed weapons to Ukraine from the outset. \u201cIf you had given them everything at the beginning of the war,\u201d she said, when \u201cthe Russians were on their back foot, [Ukraine] could\u2019ve won this war outright.\u201d"

      "Of course, it\u2019s no surprise that the man who penned beloved love ballads, like \u201cJust the Way You Are,\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s Always a Woman\u201d and \u201cShe\u2019s Got a Way,\u201d has fallen love a few times himself. But who are the wives who\u2019ve walked down the aisle alongside him?",
      "Read on to learn more about each of the 76-year-old partners, past and present, including his \u201cUptown Girl\u201d and his longest lasting love.",
      "Elizabeth Weber (1973\u20131982)",
      "When Joel met his first wife-to-be, Elizabeth Weber, her last name was Small \u2014 and it\u2019s not just a coincidence that she shared the same last name as his then-best friend and bandmate Jon Small.",
      "In 1970, the married Smalls invited Joel to live with them and their son, out of both musical convenience and financial need. But the arrangement crumbled once an affair between Joel and Elizabeth Small began. Soon after it was discovered, Elizabeth Small went back to the name Weber, breaking off things with both her ex-husband and Joel.",
      "For a while.",

      "\u201cShe was \u2014 different,\u201d Joel recalled in Fred Schruers\u2019 2015 book, \u201cBilly Joel: The Definitive Biography.\u201d \u201cShe wasn\u2019t like a lot of the other girls I knew at that time who had taken home ec and cooking classes. She was a very bright woman, and she wasn\u2019t afraid to show how smart she was. I suppose that made her kind of exotic. Intelligent and not afraid to speak her mind, but could also be seductive. Almost like a European type \u2014 not a typical American girl.\u201d",

      "JoJo Siwa has seen your \u201cBette Davis Eyes\u201d videos.",
      "Her cover of Kim Carnes\u2019 1981 song neared the top of the U.K pop charts, but has also been met with a mix of fascination and bewilderment online. TikTokers are creating versions of their own \u201cBette Davis Eyes,\u201d wearing a version of the 1950s-inspired blue top she wears in the video and re-creating her raspy voice.",
      "\u201cSome of them, I die laughing,\u201d Siwa tells TODAY.com in a Zoom interview. \u201cThen there\u2019s some that I\u2019m like, \u2018Where do people get the audacity? Why do people feel OK to sleep at night?' There\u2019s a fine line of comedy and fine line of trashing.\u2019\u201d",
      "Siwa says she was walking recently and a man around her age came up to her singing \u201cBette Davis Eyes\u201d in a \u201cfake raspy voice.\u201d",
      "\u201cI turn around at him and said, \u2018Nice singing,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cHe ran off. I was just like \u2014 I wish I would\u2019ve pulled him aside and said, \u2018Look. If you\u2019re going to make fun of me, the least you could do is have a conversation with me.\u2019 I probably would have taken him to go buy a Gucci bag.\u201d",
      "Love it or hate it, \u201cBette Davis Eyes\u201d has become a cultural moment \u2014 which is ironic, considering Siwa didn\u2019t want to sing it in the first place. The idea came from a producer on her music team.",
      "\u201cShe played \u2018Bette Davis Eyes\u2019 and said, \u2018I bet you don\u2019t even know this song, but your voice would be incredible on it,'\u201d Siwa recalls. Siwa was born in 2003, over two decades after Kim Carnes\u2019 song spent nine consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and became an \u201880s anthem.",
      "After receiving criticism for her performances on Season 3 of \u201cThe Masked Singer,\u201d the \u201cDance Moms\u201d star was hesitant to make a cover her next career step.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely not. Never. Nope, nope, not happening. I got too shy, too insecure,\u201d she remembers saying.",
      "The conversation was tabled until she was planning her set at the Tecate Emblema music festival in Mexico City and had 20 minutes left to fill. Siwa\u2019s mom brought up \u201cBette Davis Eyes.\u201d Still unsure, Siwa says she \u201cactually started crying\u201d over the idea of singing it onstage.",
      "\u201cMy mom was like, \u2018You can. You\u2019re saying you can\u2019t, but you can,\u2019\u201d she remembers her mom saying. \u201cShe told me, \u2018Do something that makes you want to sing the song.\u2019\u201d",
      "This advice inspired the viral moment where Siwa changed the lyrics of \u201cBette Davis Eyes\u201d to \u201cChris Hughes's eyes\u201d onstage.",
      "Those following Siwa\u2019s personal life would know exactly what that means. It\u2019s a reference to her boyfriend, former \u201cLove Island\u201d contestant Chris Hughes. The two met on \u201cBig Brother UK.\u201d Siwa entered the show in a relationship with Kath Ebbs, an Australian influencer who identifies as a \"gender queer lesbian.\" The night the show ended, Siwa and Ebbs split up. Weeks later, Siwa and Hughes made things official. (In fact, he interrupted Siwa's conversation with TODAY.com with his rendition of \u201cYou Are My Sunshine.\u201d)",
      "After performing the song live for the first time, she was struck and surprised by the feedback. \u201cThe response to it was unreal,\u201d Siwa says. \u201cPeople had so much good to say about it \u2026 people actually want this.\u201d",
      "Siwa teased a recorded version on her TikTok twice then released the full cover on July 10 \u2014 and the reactions, some of them more negative, poured in.",
      "Siwa says she\u2019s come to expect commentary \u2014 it happened last summer after she released \u201cKarma,\u201d which at the time seemed like an edgy rebrand from her time as a child star.",
      "\u201cWhen I\u2019m posting something, I\u2019m sort of asking for that, right? I think people like to get a laugh. And I know I like to be a laugh,\u201d she says.",

      "What does Siwa have to say to her haters? \u201cAll good, troops, all good. Sometimes I hate me too, and it\u2019s all good,\u201d Siwa says, laughing. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re getting a smile or a laugh, and I\u2019m not ruining your day\u2026 Goal achieved from me.\u201d",
      "One of the skeptics was Carnes herself. The singer posted a now deleted TikTok about Siwa\u2019s song, implying Siwa\u2019s version lacked \u201cauthenticity.\u201d",
      "Carnes later clarified her statement to TMZ, saying she \u201cstrongly rejects(s) the kind of hate and personal attacks I\u2019ve seen online\u201d but also believes \u201cartists have the right to speak openly about how something makes them feel \u2014 especially when it\u2019s as personal as your voice.\u201d",
      "Carnes said Siwa's rendition \"felt a bit too close\" to her version, including \u201cthe phrasing, the tone, even the little inflections.\"",
      "\u201cKim kind of came out and said some stuff, but it actually fascinates me, what she said,\u201d Siwa tells TODAY.com. \u201cAs an artist, what you want to do is inspire people, and I think the most beautiful thing is to have another artist be inspired by you.\u201d",
      "Other artists who covered the song, like Taylor Swift, didn\u2019t use rasp like Carnes. Siwa defends keeping the rasp in her cover. For one, Siwa says she has \u201cvery broken vocal chords\u201d that make it possible to \u201ckind of replicate\u201d Carnes\u2019 singing style.",
      "She also \u201cdidn\u2019t want to sing the song like a natural beauty \u2014 I wanted to sing the song the way it inspired me,\u201d she says. \u201cYou want that rasp in there.\u201d",
      "During the recording session, she asked for no water. \u201cThe raspier I get, the better it is. So my voice is just screwed after, but worth it absolutely. Now I\u2019ll incorporate that super raspy tone into more,\u201d she says.",
      "Less natural was the look for the music video. Siwa says she \u201cabsolutely hates\u201d changing up her look.",
      "\u201cI put the costume on and I put the wig on and I was laughing at myself in the mural. Like, there\u2019s there\u2019s no way this is happening. This is hysterical. I look in the mirror and I\u2019m cackling at myself,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like Halloween.\u201d",
      "Beyond Siwa\u2019s cover, \u201cBette Davis Eyes\u201d is having a moment this summer \u2014 Ethel Cain also covered it and it figured prominently in Episode 7 of \u201cAnd Just Like That\u201d Season 3. Siwa says she missed the feature, as she spends most of her leisure time listening to the \u201cHamilton\u201d soundtrack or watching sports with Hughes.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve really found that I\u2019ve got a clear sense of vision again, in my personal life, but especially in my career.\u201d",
      "The moment inspired Siwa for her next chapter. She\u2019s now working on a new single inspired by \u201cBette Davis Eyes,\u201d set to release in August.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s interesting, because, for the first time, I\u2019ve actually enjoyed writing a song,\u201d Siwa says about the potential new single.",

      "In the 30 years since its release, the movie's cultural legacy has only grown stronger. Its slang has become part of the cultural lexicon and its characters are a popular choice for duo Halloween costumes. Many celebrities have dressed up as Cher and Dionne as well, such as Kim Kardashian and her daughter North West, Iggy Azalea and Sabrina Carpenter.",
      "But when Silverstone visited to TODAY in 1995, when she was about 19 years old, she had no idea about the impact \"Clueless\" and Cher would have.",
      "During her chat on TODAY, Silverstone said she disagreed with the movie's title. She never saw Cher as clueless, even though her character did say some head-scratching things.",
      "\"The title is the one thing that throws me off because I think that Cher is a very intelligent character and the whole film is so intelligent. That title is sort of a joke, because the characters are so defined and so well-rounded that they really aren't clueless,\" she said.",

      "From day one, the North Carolina native was impossible to ignore. Her bold energy and intense approach to connections made her one of the season\u2019s most talked-about contestants, generating equal parts admiration and criticism from viewers who couldn\u2019t look away. She threw herself into villa life with the kind of all-or-nothing intensity that reality TV thrives on, but that same intensity would soon become her biggest challenge.",
      "Her relationship with Jeremiah Brown started like a wildfire \u2014 passionate, consuming, and ultimately destructive. What began as one of the villa\u2019s strongest couples quickly devolved into something viewers and fellow Islanders alike recognized as toxic, marked by love-bombing, explosive fights and drama that extended far beyond their personal bubble. It was messy, it was painful and it was all happening under the unforgiving gaze of cameras and public opinion.",

After a brief romance with Chris, Huda made a decision that stunned viewers: she chose to walk away on her own terms, right before the season finale. For many fans, it wasn\u2019t just an exit \u2014 it was a redemption arc, a moment where she finally listened to her own voice over the noise of expectations and pressure.",

Mind you, like there are people that don\u2019t like me. That\u2019s fine. Everyone\u2019s entitled to their opinion. But just seeing all of the love, which is obviously what I\u2019m focusing on, it\u2019s like, wow \u2014 I\u2019m speechless. Like, it\u2019s overwhelming. I\u2019m trying to get up to date on everything.",

      "I think that we were toxic. We were both very toxic. Was I perfect in that? No. Was he perfect in that? No. I can understand why they would have separated us. America\u2019s vote, it took me by surprise in the moment, because I wasn\u2019t seeing things from an outside perspective. But looking at it from a different perspective, I can understand why.",
      "He told me himself, like he was learning through us. Things that I told him to do, he was changing to do it for other women. And I think that people can relate to that. I think a lot of girls, you know, have been the girl that kind of prepared a man to be in a relationship.",

      "I think I would hold a lot of things in out of fear. It's better to just say it. Even if it ends things, it\u2019s just better to talk about it. There\u2019s a lot of things \u2014 slowing down in relationships, not getting too physical too fast, really getting to know somebody. It was a good learning experience in all honesty.",

      "The line is said by a fan in the stands who recognizes Drebin as the man who had sung the national anthem after Drebin knocked out the fictional international opera singer Pallazzo and proceeded to butcher the song while pretending to be him.",
      "The man who said, \u201cHey! It\u2019s Enrico Pallazzo!\u201d was played by Mark Holton, who remains amazed at the love the film\u2019s fans have for the remark.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019ve been articles written on that line and what it meant to the movie, and it\u2019s just insane, because it\u2019s one line,\u201d he tells TODAY.com in a phone interview.",
      "\u201cI mean, I was in there half a day \u2014 a half a day. I said my one line. \u2018OK, I got my day rate. I\u2019m going to eat dinner tomorrow.\u2019 And that was it. And the next thing I know, it\u2019s still living.\u201d",

      "To someone who may not be familiar with the movie, the description of the Enrico Pallazzo line sounds ludicrous, but that quote has left quite an impression on moviegoers. It\u2019s hilarious, memorable and endlessly satisfying to say.",
      "Holton was thrilled to get the opportunity to work with ZAZ, whom he had admired for their work on \u201cPolice Squad!,\u201d the short-lived TV series that inspired the \u201cNaked Gun\u201d movie. He says his line dovetailed perfectly into the rest of the film.",
      "\u201cWhen I actually saw the scene and everything that was going on in the scene and how that fit into it, I went, \u2018OK, now I get it,\u2019\u201d he says.",
      "The scene helped cement Holton\u2019s status as a 1980s film icon after he scored parts as Francis in \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Big Adventure\u201d and Chubby in \u201cTeen Wolf.\u201d He says he didn\u2019t work with any of the movie\u2019s stars during his scene in \u201cThe Naked Gun,\u201d but got to meet Priscilla Presley at a convention about a year ago.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if she remembered me from the film or whatever, but we had a little talk and I got a pic with her,\u201d he says.",
      "Holton says he also met Nielsen before his death, calling him \u201cone of those guys I would love to have as a neighbor.\u201d",
      "Nielsen played Drebin in three \u201cNaked Gun\u201d movies, and now Liam Neeson steps in as the lead character in the upcoming \u201cNaked Gun\u201d reboot, opening Aug. 1. Holton hopes for the best for everyone affiliated with it, but doesn\u2019t intend to see it.",
      "\u201cI might watch part of it, but I don\u2019t have a burning desire to see what they\u2019ve done with it,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s too much of that in Hollywood, as far as I\u2019m concerned. I wish them the best of luck.\u201d",
      "There are parallels between Nielsen \u2014 who was in \u201cAirplane!\u201d \u2014 and Neeson, with both of them enjoying long careers as dramatic actors before turning to comedy. Holton points to Neeson\u2019s previous body of work in films like \u201cExcalibur\u201d and \u201cTaken,\u201d noting that he\u2019s \u201ca good actor,\u201d which should serve him well as he takes the reins of a revived beloved franchise.",
      "\u201cIf he executes the role properly, he\u2019ll do well,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m certainly rooting for him,\u201d he adds."

      "The real von Trapp family fled Austria in 1938 \u2014 and not by crossing the Alps with their suitcases, as they do in the film. Instead, they took a train to Italy the day before the borders closed in Austria and ended up in the United States.",

    "summary": "Ukranian activists warn about corruption and authoritarianism after police raids against several high-profile anti-corruption campaigners and opposition figures.",
    "story": [
      "Ukraine risks backsliding on its endemic corruption problem \u2014 and even creeping toward authoritarianism \u2014 activists warn, following police raids against a high-profile anti-corruption campaigner and opposition figures.",
      "On July 11, armed police raided the home of Vitaliy Shabunin, the co-founder of Ukraine\u2019s Anti-Corruption Action Center. He has accused President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of \u201ctaking the first, but confident steps toward corrupt authoritarianism,\u201d including backing laws offering amnesty to those accused of corruption in the defense industry, and passing over an independently selected candidate for a key anti-graft role.",
      "The move has perturbed even some of Zelenskyy\u2019s supporters \u2014 people who are simultaneously worried about the heavy-handed and potentially spurious crackdown on dissent, and that such criticisms against the Ukrainian leader might be used in bad faith by opponents in Moscow or Washington.",
      "\u201cThis is the red line which President Zelensky has crossed \u2014 and the red line is in a very wrong direction in terms of the development of Ukraine,\u201d said Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, the Kyiv-based watchdog that Shabunin co-founded. She said the State Bureau of Investigations did not have the necessary court documents for the search.",
      "Shabunin has been charged with evading military service and fraud, with prosecutors alleging that while on secondment from the front lines to continue his activism back in Kyiv, he conducted activities unrelated to his military service. His defense team and supporters say the secondment was all aboveboard and ordered by his superiors, and that the allegations are trumped up and political.",
      "The case has caused grave alarm for many inside Ukraine and abroad, with even some of those who praise Zelenskyy for making progress on corruption flagging it as cause for concern that he may be engaging in some of the same questionable practices they\u2019d hoped he was rooting out.",
      "Zelenskyy pledged to reduce corruption when he was elected in 2019, and many expert observers say he has been effective at doing so, but the tide of criticism around Shabunin\u2019s arrest comes when the president is under intense pressure to fight off Russia and keep alive support from the United States and the West that has been at risk of faltering.",
      "It\u2019s not just Shabunin\u2019s own organization that\u2019s concerned. A group of 59 nongovernmental and civil society organizations, both inside Ukraine and abroad, have signed an open letter to Zelenskyy saying the arrest \u201cbears signs of political motivation, abuse of rights\u201d and either \u201cgross incompetence\u201d or \u201ca deliberate attack to pressure\u201d Shabunin.",
      "NBC News has contacted Zelenskyy\u2019s office and the State Bureau of Investigations for comment but has not received a response.",
      "The president has been a longtime vocal advocate on the issue of fighting corruption, particularly when it comes to suggestions from the U.S. and elsewhere that the billions of dollars in military aid his country is receiving might be being misappropriated.",
      "\u201cWhere we saw risks that something could be happening with weapons, we cracked down hard,\u201d he told the \u201cLex Fridman Podcast\u201d in January.",
      "Last year Shabunin himself dismissed the idea that foreign arms could be embezzled, telling the BBC that \u201call weapons supplied by Western allies end up in the hands of Ukrainian troops who use them effectively. It is impossible to steal Western weapons.\u201d",
      "Shabunin appeared in court Tuesday and was released on \u201crecognizance\u201d \u2014 essentially released without having to post bail \u2014 until the next hearing Aug. 20.",
      "The German Marshall Fund, a Washington think tank and one of the international signatories of the letter to Zelenskyy, said Ukraine had made \u201cmonumental strides\u201d on corruption in the past 11 years.",
      "Nevertheless, \u201cit\u2019s always concerning when a government targets its vocal critics with flimsy charges in politically motivated investigations,\u201d said Josh Rudolph, head of the fund\u2019s malign finance and corruption team. \u201cAlthough this is not a sign of corruption per se, it displays an alarming disregard for the fundamental values of freedom and the rule of law at a time when the international community has been rallying around Ukraine because it is defending those very values from Russia\u2019s brutal assault.\u201d",
      "Shabunin is not the only recent arrest to cause alarm. The opposition UDAR party, headed by former heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, says that a raid in April on the home of Kyiv City Council deputy Dmytro Bilotserkivets \u2014 again, they said, without the necessary documents \u2014 was a clear attempt to put pressure on political dissent.",
      "Corruption in Ukraine is a fraught and delicate topic, ripe for weaponization often in bad faith.",
      "Russia uses it as an example to support its otherwise untrue criticisms \u2014 such as Ukraine being run by neo-Nazis \u2014 while American and European politicians hold up such examples to bolster their pre-existing arguments about whether to support Kyiv\u2019s defense against Moscow.",
      "\u201cThe issue of corruption in Ukraine has long been highly politicized,\u201d said Mariya Omelicheva, a professor at the Pentagon-funded National War College in Washington, D.C.",
      "Ukrainian \u201ccorruption is almost always co-opted \u2014 either by Ukraine\u2019s supporters or, more problematically, by its adversaries,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is particularly sensitive in the current U.S. political climate, where both parties \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 have used Ukrainian corruption narratives for domestic political purposes.\u201d",
      "There is also a feeling among some Ukrainians that President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d focus has allowed officials abroad to act with greater impunity knowing Washington\u2019s hitherto exacting gaze is currently less troubled by world affairs.",
      "\u201cOur international partners, particularly the United States, don\u2019t care anymore about good governance and anti-corruption and reforms,\u201d Kaleniuk said. Washington \u201cfor the last 12 years had a powerful impact on how Ukraine develops, and the U.S. was usually tough on good governance, anti-corruption reforms and developments critical for democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now America doesn\u2019t care about that.\u201d",
      "While it\u2019s true Trump historically spoke warmly of Russian President Vladimir Putin and appeared to accept many of his war demands, in recent weeks he has been increasingly hostile to the Kremlin and signaled a renewed support for Ukraine, pledging Patriot missiles for Kyiv and tariffs on Moscow.",
      "It\u2019s also true that Ukraine \u2014 and Zelenskyy \u2014 have achieved some progress in the corruption fight in recent years. Transparency International, the best known international group that tracks this topic, says Ukraine has steadily improved in its annual \u201cCorruption Perceptions\u201d index \u2014 although it still ranks 105 of 180 countries worldwide.",
      "Nevertheless, domestically there are plenty of Ukrainians alarmed at what they see is a negative direction of travel when it comes to corruption in their country. Though the immediate fight is against Russia, the ultimate battle is for their values of liberty and democracy, supporters say, without which the battlefield struggle becomes pointless.",
      "\u201cWe are fighting for freedoms and for dignity,\u201d Kaleniuk said. If those are lost, \u201conly Russia will applaud.\u201d",
      "Alexander Smith and Freddie Clayton reported from London. Erin McLaughlin from Washington, D.C., and Anastasiia Parafeniuk and Daryna Mayer from Kyiv."

      "The parish priest, the Rev. Gabriel Romanelli, \u201csustained light injuries,\u201d the patriarchate said. Romanelli held near nightly calls with Francis throughout the war in Gaza, and the late pontiff took time to speak with the priest and his parish even as his health was failing in the weeks before his death in April.",

      "The patriarchate did not provide any more information on the attack or who it believed was responsible, saying it would release further details once confirmed.",
      "Witnesses said the attack appeared to be an Israeli tank shelling, The Associated Press reported.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said it was aware of reports of casualties and damaged caused to the Holy Family Church and said the \"circumstances of the incident are under review.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s increasing turn against his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin has inspired hopes in Ukraine and among its supporters that he is starting to believe what they\u2019ve been telling him all along: Moscow is the antagonist and the only way to stop it is with cash and military equipment.",
      "But while Monday\u2019s apparent U-turn was dramatic, other Ukraine supporters, former officials and other foreign policy experts are wary at least and deeply skeptical at worst.",
      "\u201cThe question that Europeans and Ukrainians are asking,\u201d according to Ivo Daalder, former United States ambassador to NATO, is \u201chow real is this change? And how lasting is this change? And what does it really mean in terms of American policy toward the region?\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the second time that the Trump administration has moved the goal posts,\u201d having briefly cut off aid to Ukraine in February, he said. \u201cSo there are a lot of questions here.\u201d",
      "Trump has previously lavished praise on Putin while scorning Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But on  Monday in the Oval Office, sitting next to NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, he said he was \u201cvery unhappy\u201d with the Kremlin and that the United States would sell \u201ctop-of-the-line weapons\u201d to NATO allies \u2014 including the much-demanded Patriot missiles \u2014 so that they can be used in Ukraine.",
      "Alongside that, if Putin does not agree to a peace deal in 50 days, Trump said, he will slap 100% tariffs on any country that buys Russian goods. That lag time has been criticized across Europe, with officials and experts asking why Trump is giving additional time to an autocrat who has hardly wavered in his desire to subjugate Ukraine.",
      "The anxiety is fueled further by the widespread perception in Europe and elsewhere that Trump is a president who makes decisions on a whim and is prone to changing them.",
      "Trump himself hinted at this propensity to change his mind quickly. He recalled going home one night and telling first lady Melania Trump, \u201c\u2018I spoke to Vladimir today. We had a wonderful conversation.\u2019\u201d To which she responded, \u201c\u2018Oh, really, another city was just hit\u2019\u201d in Ukraine by Russia\u2019s missiles.",
      "The exact details of Trump\u2019s new direction are as yet unclear.",
      "He said that the shopping list included Patriot missiles, the state-of-the-art American defensive system that Ukraine says it desperately needs to fend off Russia\u2019s nearly nightly aerial assaults.",

      "The Patriot missiles could arrive in Ukraine \u201cvery soon \u2014 within days, actually,\u201d expedited by European nations giving their existing weapons to Ukraine and replacing them with the new systems delivered by the U.S., he said.",
      "\u201cThis is really big,\u201d said Rutte, a man who often heaps praise on Trump. \u201cIt will mean that Ukraine can get its hands on really massive numbers of military equipment, both for air defense, but also missiles, ammunition, etc.\u201d He added, \u201cif I\u2019m Ukraine, I think this is really great news.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy, who has clashed several times with Trump and his team, posted on X thanking the president \u201cfor the willingness to support Ukraine and to continue working together to stop the killings and establish a lasting and just peace.\u201d",
      "Other endorsements came with caveats.",
      "The U.S. has \u201crealized that Russia does not really want peace, so in order to have peace, we need to support Ukraine and we need to put the pressure on Russia,\u201d Kaja Kallas, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, told reporters in Brussels on Tuesday.",
      "However she suggested that waiting almost two months to impose tariffs was too long: \u201cFifty days is a very long time if we see that they are killing innocent civilians every day.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s a view also held by Yuriy Boyechko, CEO and founder of Hope for Ukraine, a nonprofit organization based in Roseland, New Jersey, that supports Ukrainian refugees in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThis is way too long,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless significant pressure is applied on Putin and the Russian economy immediately, more innocent civilians will die.\u201d",
      "Russian officials mixed grave condemnation with mockery.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called Trump\u2019s statements \u201cvery serious\u201d because it was \u201caddressed personally to President Putin.\u201d Whereas former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev called it a \u201ctheatrical ultimatum\u201d about which \u201cRussia didn\u2019t care.\u201d",
      "A senior Kremlin official told NBC News that Putin may not rush to respond. \u201cWe need to analyze the situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might take some time.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, the optimism of Ukraine\u2019s supporters will be dictated by what\u2019s actually in Trump\u2019s weapons deal \u2014 and whether he sticks with his renewed direction of thinking on the conflict.",
      "\u201cWe need to be a bit cautious as to whether this is a sea change in Trump\u2019s opinion or if it\u2019s just another part of a whiplash effect as he veers backwards and forwards,\u201d Matthew Savill, , director of military sciences at London\u2019s Royal United Services Institute think tank, told NBC News\u2019 British partner, Sky News. \u201cHis overriding goal is to get credit for ending the fighting.\u201d",

Authorities are still working to discover the extent of the data accessed.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security memo from June, describing the Pentagon\u2019s findings, said that the group, publicly known by the nickname Salt Typhoon, \u201cextensively compromised a U.S. state\u2019s Army National Guard network\u201d from March 2024 through December. The memo did not say which state.",
      "The report was provided to NBC News through the national security transparency nonprofit Property of the People, which obtained it through a freedom of information request.",
      "The Department of Defense didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. A National Guard Bureau spokesperson confirmed the compromise but declined to share details.",
      "\u201cWhile we cannot provide specific details on the attack or our response to it, we can say this attack has not prevented the National Guard from accomplishing assigned state or federal missions, and that NGB continues to investigate the intrusion to determine its full scope,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "A spokesperson for China\u2019s embassy in Washington did not deny the campaign but said the U.S. has failed to prove China is behind the Salt Typhoon hacks.",
      "\u201cCyberattacks are a common threat faced by all countries, China included,\u201d the spokesperson said, adding that the U.S. \u201chas been unable to produce conclusive and reliable evidence that the \u2018Salt Typhoon\u2019 is linked to the Chinese government.\u201d",
      "Salt Typhoon is notorious even by the standards of China\u2019s massive cyberspy efforts because of its ability to jump from one organization to another. Last year, U.S. authorities found that it had hacked at least eight of the country\u2019s largest internet and phone companies, including AT&T and Verizon, using access to spy on the calls and text messages of both the Harris and Trump presidential campaigns, as well as the office of then-Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.",
      "While part of the Department of Defense, National Guard units are also under the authority of their states; some are deeply integrated with local governments or law enforcement, which may have given the Salt Typhoon hackers the ability to compromise other organizations.",
      "The hack \u201clikely provided Beijing with data that could facilitate the hacking of other states\u2019 Army National Guard units, and possibly many of their state-level cybersecurity partners,\u201d the DHS report found. The National Guard in 14 U.S. states work with law enforcement \u201cfusion centers\u201d to share intelligence, the DHS memo notes. The hackers accessed a map of geographic locations in the targeted state, diagrams of how internal networks are set up, and personal information of service members, it said.",
      "In January, the Treasury Department \u2014 also a recent target of alleged Chinese hacking \u2014 sanctioned a Sichuan company for allegedly helping Beijing\u2019s Ministry of State Security conduct Salt Typhoon operations.",
      "Salt Typhoon can be pernicious and hard to root out once the hackers take hold. In the AT&T case, the company announced in December that it appeared as if they were no longer being affected and Verizon said in January it had \u201ccontained\u201d the incident. Both companies stopped short of saying they were fully protected from the hackers returning. A report from Cisco said that, in at least one instance, Salt Typhoon hackers remained in an affected environment for up to three years."

      "\u201cYou take that level of experience, the technology that we have, the know-how, the process expertise, and so clearly, we believe we have a lot to bring to the Philly Shipyard, as well as to the U.S. maritime industrial base, in terms of modernization capacity,\u201d he said on a walkthrough of the shipyard.",

The company hopes to build naval ships and become the first U.S. builder of specialized liquefied natural gas tankers.",
      "Shipbuilding in the United States has been all but dormant. China, South Korea, Japan and Europe all produce far more ships than the United States, with the few shipyards still operating in the country concentrating on military ships.",
      "Revitalizing shipbuilding has been one of the areas President Donald Trump has pointed to as part of a broader effort to bring manufacturing back to the United States \u2014 a move some see as shortsighted considering the costs associated with building the kind of gigantic modern ships that remain a core part of how goods and commodities move around the planet."

      "The probe, announced Tuesday by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data, came after an outcry from students at the university, the city's oldest, who said it hadn't done enough to protect them or punish the accused.",
      "\"The images were organized into folders named after the victims, totaling 700+ images (including the original photos),\" read a widely circulated letter that was posted Saturday on Instagram from an account run by three unnamed victims.",
      "The accused, referred to in the letter only as \u201ca male law student,\u201d took photos of the victims from social media and used AI software to generate pornographic images with their faces, according to the letter. The images were discovered on his laptop reported to the university in February. They were not known to have been widely distributed.",
      "In March, the university interviewed some of the victims, and in April informed one of them that the accused student had written a 60-word \"apology letter.\"",
      "While NBC News was unable to confirm the authenticity of that letter, and the account did not respond to a request for comment, the university said it was \"aware of the social media posts concerning a student allegedly using AI tools to create indecent images.\"",
      "\u201cThe University has already issued him a warning letter and demanded him a formal apology to his affected peers,\u201d the university said Saturday in a statement.",

      "In the U.S., regulations govern dissemination, with President Donald Trump signing legislation in May that bans nonconsensual online publication of AI-generated porn, but federal law does not explicitly prohibit personal possession, and a district judge ruled in February that possessing such images was protected by the First Amendment.",
      "After it was rocked by a number of scandals similar to the one playing out in Hong Kong, South Korea passed a law last year that criminalizes not only the possession but also the consumption of such content.",
      "Though the University of Hong Kong said that it had undertaken various steps on behalf of the victims, \u201cincluding class adjustments,\u201d the victims wrote in the letter that the university\u2019s inaction had resulted in them being forced to share the classroom with the suspect \u201cat least four times, causing unnecessary psychological distress.\u201d",
      "Outrage has since grown in the wider student community, which has demanded more stringent action. That prompted a response from the city\u2019s top official, Chief Executive John Lee, who said at a news briefing Tuesday that universities have the \u201cresponsibility of developing students\u2019 moral character,\u201d adding institutions should \u201cdeal with student misconduct seriously.\u201d",
      "\u201cAny conduct that causes harm to others may constitute a criminal offense and may also infringe individual rights and also privacy,\u201d he said.",
      "The university did not respond to a request for comment from NBC News, but it told the South China Morning Post this week that it was conducting a review of the incident and vowed further action if victims demanded more.",
      "\u201cThe university is now further reviewing the case and will take further actions when appropriate to ensure a safe and respectful learning environment,\u201d it said."

    "story": [
      "Aluminum in childhood vaccines is a target of vaccine skeptics, who blame the ingredient on myriad health concerns. But a study of more than 1 million people, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, found no link between aluminum in vaccines and an increased risk of 50 chronic conditions, including autoimmune diseases, allergies and autism.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has spread vaccine misinformation for years, said on a podcast in 2024 that aluminum in vaccines is \u201cextremely neurotoxic.\u201d (An HHS spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.)",
      "Senior study author Anders Hviid said that, as a parent, he understood the concerns about vaccine safety.",
      "\u201cOur study addresses many of these concerns and provides clear and robust evidence for the safety of childhood vaccines. This is evidence that parents need to make the best choices for the health of their children,\u201d said Hviid, who is a professor and the head of epidemiology research at Statens Serum Institut, a sector of the Danish Ministry of Health focused on combating and preventing infectious diseases.",
      "Hviid and his team used Denmark\u2019s nationwide registry to look for any connections between aluminum exposure from childhood vaccines and 50 chronic disorders, including 36 autoimmune disorders, nine allergy or asthma conditions, and five neurodevelopmental disorders including autism and ADHD.",
      "The study looked at more than 1.2 million people born in Denmark from 1997 through 2018 and followed them until the end of 2020. Because health records in Denmark are meticulously kept by government agencies, the researchers were also able to compare children who received more aluminum in their vaccines by age 2 compared those who received less. The study didn\u2019t include unvaccinated children.",
      "The researchers found no link between aluminum in childhood vaccines and any of the 50 conditions.",
      "Ross Kedl, a professor of immunology and microbiology at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, said Scandinavian public health studies are of uniquely good quality.",
      "\u201c[This excellence is] partly because they have, for a long time, had such a unified health system,\u201d said Kedl, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new study. \u201cEveryone is tracked for life from birth and you can go back for many years and ask, \u2018Can we find a link between something that happened in the past and in the future?\u2019\u201d",
      "Hviid said the catalyst for the Danish study was a widely criticized Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-funded study, published in 2022, that suggested a link between aluminum in childhood vaccines and increased asthma risk. The study, however, didn\u2019t distinguish between aluminum from vaccines and aluminum from other sources. It also contained inconsistencies: for example, in one group the researchers analyzed, more aluminum exposure wasn\u2019t linked to increased asthma risk, contrary to the study\u2019s conclusions.",
      "\u201cIf you are looking at people who got vaccines that contained aluminum versus those who had fewer, you have to control for confounding factors, you need to know that the only different source of aluminum these people received was from those vaccines,\u201d said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.",
      "The CDC study was not able to do that, Offit said. Aluminum is the third-most abundant metal on Earth and people are exposed to the metal through breast milk, air and water, he said.",
      "\u201cAluminum is part of our daily diet and has been since the beginning of time. That is the point people don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.",
      "Neither Osterholm nor Offit were involved with the new study.",
      "CDC officials said at the time that it appears that aluminum-containing vaccines \u201cdo not account for the overall trends that we see.\u201d",
      "Osterholm said the strength of the broader research is that it piles on dozens of studies that have drawn the same conclusion as the new study.",
      "\u201cOne study does not make for a safe vaccine supply or not,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the accumulative data that comes from many studies that have been done, that together demonstrate the safety of vaccines.\u201d",
      "Why is aluminum in vaccines?",
      "Different ingredients are added to vaccines for different reasons. Aluminum \u2014 added to vaccines as aluminum salts \u2014 is what\u2019s known as an adjuvant. These additives act as a beacon for the immune system, pointing out invaders and prompting the body to produce antibodies against an antigen, or the virus or bacteria a vaccine aims to protect against.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just have an antigen and have an immune response, you need some kind of stimulus to trigger that response,\u201d said Kedl, of the University of Colorado. \u201cAn adjuvant is a substance that alerts the body\u2019s immune response to the vaccine\u2019s antigen. Without adjuvants, you actually create tolerance, which is the opposite effect of what you want a vaccine to do.\u201d",
      "In the U.S., aluminum salts are used in the vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) as well as vaccines for pneumonia, HPV and hepatitis B.",
      "\u201cThe aluminum that is in vaccines is in the form of extremely small amounts of aluminum salts which is not the same as elemental aluminum which is a metal,\u201d Hviid said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for parents to understand that we are not injecting metal into children.\u201d",
      "Aluminum salts from vaccines are injected into the muscle and most are cleared away by the body and filtered out through the kidneys within two weeks, though small amounts can linger for years.",
      "\u201cThe aluminum-containing vaccines form the backbone of our childhood immunization programs,\u201d Hviid said, adding that there are currently no viable replacements. \u201cIt is critically important that we keep politics and science apart in this issue. If not, it is the children, including U.S. children, who are going to suffer the consequences.\u201d"

      "\u201cThe clear impression was that we were very, very close in agreement in principle,\u201d Denmark\u2019s foreign minister said Monday after the trade ministers meeting. \u201cUnfortunately, it wasn\u2019t possible due to this presidential letter, but it is still our major vision that we should reach an agreement, but we also want to send signal that it must be a fair deal for everybody.\u201d",
      "For its part, the E.U. has delayed any countermeasures \u2014 or retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. \u2014 but it currently has more than $100 billion of retaliatory tariffs on standby.",
      "Some of that retaliation targets goods and produce from politically sensitive U.S. states, such as soybeans from House Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s home state of Louisiana or bourbon from Kentucky. Other retaliatory tariffs could target Boeing planes and U.S.-built vehicles.",
      "The American Chamber of Commerce in the E.U. said it was \u201cconcerned\u201d about the tariffs that it said would \u201cgenerate damaging ripple effects across all sectors of the EU and US economies.\u201d The group added that \u201ctariffs disrupt supply chains and add costs and complexity for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic.\u201d",
      "Despite the major escalation, \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said that he planned to speak with his American counterparts, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, on Monday to keep negotiations going."

      "LONDON \u2014 Senior aides to King Charles III and Prince Harry were pictured meeting in London on Sunday, fueling speculation about a royal reconciliation between the estranged father and son.",
      "Photos obtained by The Mail on Sunday newspaper showed Meredith Maines, Harry's chief communications officer, meeting with Tobyn Andreae, Charles' communications secretary, at the Royal Over-seas League, a private club near Buckingham Palace.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a long road ahead, but a channel of communication is now open for the first time in years,\" a royal source told the newspaper about the meeting.",
      "It comes after Harry, who is the fifth in line to the throne, saying he would \u201clove reconciliation with my family,\u201d during a BBC interview in May. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in continuing to fight people,\u201d he said.",
      "His comments came after he lost his appeal against the British  government\u2019s decision to axe his publicly funded security detail, an issue that he said had driven a wedge between him and his father.",
      "\u201cHe won\u2019t speak to me because of this security stuff,\u201d Harry said, adding that he didn\u2019t know how long his father had left to live after Charles was diagnosed with cancer last year.",
      "Relations between the pair became strained after Harry and his wife, Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, announced that they would take a step back as senior members of the royal family in 2020, saying they would split their time between the United Kingdom and the United States.",
      "As a result, the couple was stripped of their taxpayer-funded security, spurring Harry\u2019s legal challenge with the British Home Office.",
      "Harry has been a regular in British courts in recent years, challenging both his security arrangements and tabloid newspaper publishers for allegedly hacking phones and using private investigators to snoop on his life for news stories.",
      "Harry has also openly expressed his frustrations with his family, who were the source of pointed criticism in his best-selling book, \u201cSpare,\u201d two years ago, which saw him claim that he had been physically attacked by his brother William, the Prince of Wales.",
      "This came after Harry and Meghan alleged in a 2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey that a member of the royal family had expressed concerns over the skin color of their son, Archie, before he was born."

    "summary": "Donald Trump will make an unprecendented second state visit to the U.K. in September where he will be hosted by King Charles III and Queen Camilla.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump will make an unprecedented second state visit to the United Kingdom in September along with first lady Melania Trump, where he will be hosted by King Charles III and Queen Camilla, Buckingham Palace said in a statement Sunday.",
      "No American president has ever been invited for a second state visit. But Trump, a big supporter of the royal family, was hosted by Charles' late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, in 2019.",
      "On this occasion, however, he will not stay at Buckingham Palace, which is currently undergoing renovations. Instead, he will travel to Windsor Castle, which sits around 30 miles to the west of London.",
      "Trump who shocked reporters and palace pundits in 2018 when he breached royal protocol by walking ahead of the queen, at times blocking her view and giving her his back, said it was a \u201cgreat, great honor\u201d when British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hand-delivered the invitation during a visit to the White House in February.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s really something,\u201d he added.",
      "Second-term U.S. presidents who have already made a state visit to the U.K. normally take lunch or tea with the monarch, as was the case with Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Meanwhile, state visits are ceremonial meetings between heads of state that are used to honor friendly nations and sometimes smooth relations between rivals.",
      "Although the king formally issues the invitation for a state visit, which comes with a full display of pageantry and royal pomp, he does so on the advice of the government.",
      "The announcement comes as Starmer courts Trump's favor on tariff negotiations, which have thrown a wrench in the Labour government's efforts to grow the British economy after it contracted in April amid a record fall in exports to the United States.",
      "Trump last month lowered tariffs on the British aerospace sector to zero, but imports of British steel products continue to face a 25% duty.",
      "On his last visit to the U.K., Trump injected himself into British politics by endorsing Boris Johnson to be the next prime minister and weighing in on negotiations over Brexit. He also continued his public feud with London Mayor Sadiq Khan, branding him a loser.",
      "Charles could also face challenges with Trump on Canada, since he's also the head of state for the former British colony. Trump has on several occasions threatened to annex Canada and suggested it should become the 51st U.S. state.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney criticized the state visit invite in May.",
      "In a speech to the Canadian Parliament in May, Charles highlighted the country's \"sovereignty\" and said it was facing a \"critical moment.\"",
      "\u201cThe true north is indeed strong and free,\u201d he said, referring to Canada's national anthem."
