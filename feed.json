      "Last year, Puerto Rican superstar Rauw Alejandro was in outer space with \u201cPlaya Saturno.\u201d",
      "MIAMI -- Last year, Puerto Rican superstar Rauw Alejandro was in outer space.",
      "\u201cPlaya Saturno,\u201d the 2023 surprise spinoff to his 2022 record \u201cSaturno,\u201d brought his R&B-informed reggaeton to new heights on an extraterrestrial concept album. A year later, and he's completely shifted gears, finding inspiration in classic sounds and imagery, pulling from a '60s and '70s Nuyorican cool \u2014 while still doing what he\u2019s always done best: contorting familiar genres into something novel.",
      "Alejandro is releasing his fifth studio album \u201cCosa Nuestra,\u201d a title borrowed from Willie Col\u00f3n and H\u00e9ctor Lavoe's 1969 album, on Friday. (There's a sample of Col\u00f3n and Lavoe's \u201cQu\u00e9 L\u00edo\u201d in the opening title track.) It marries classic Puerto Rican instruments and genres, like salsa and merengue, with more modern sounds like reggaeton. And it is amplified by a number of inventive samples \u2014 like Frankie Ruiz's \u201cT\u00fa Con \u00c9l\u201d \u2014 and all-star collaborators: Pharrell Williams, Bad Bunny and Feid among them.",
      "Alejandro's created a kind of character for the release, whom he calls \u201cRa\u00fal Alejandro,\u201d a nod to his father and the early migration of Puerto Ricans to New York, which he explored in an interview conducted in Spanish and English ahead of the 2024 Latin Grammys. It has been translated and edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "ALEJANDRO: I'm really happy. I think it's a different stage of my career. More elevated as a music producer, writer, artist in general. I've also grown a lot as a person. I feel more mature in every part of my life. This feels like the whole experience of my career in one whole project.",
      "ALEJANDRO: Puerto Rico is in every part of the books, in history. We're in every part of the world. You mentioned hip-hop, Puerto Ricans were involved in that as well. But before that, you see a salsa world \u2014 the Fania All-Stars. New York in the '70s was a lot of jazz, soul. It's just a lot of music from New York and Puerto Ricans have always been there. Reggaeton comes from Carolina, Puerto Rico. It's the birthplace. It's special. I feel really proud to be a Puerto Rican.",
      "In this new era, I went to New York and found great inspiration for my music but kept my essence. I keep the island at the forefront of everything that I do. I'm thinking about what it means to be Puerto Rican, our culture.",
      "ALEJANDRO: Of course, definitely. Salsa was a world that I had yet to explore. When I'm doing new projects, I try to look back at what I've accomplished and what I have yet to do. I try to analyze my whole career and see what's going to be next with Rauw, what's going to be new; I take my time at the studio, at home, studying, analyzing.",
      "This project has a lot of salsa influence, a lot of African influence. I'm using the live instruments (for) the first time. Instruments traditional to Puerto Rico like the cuatro, puertorrique\u00f1o guitar, maraca, el guiro, la conga, all mixed with the digital sounds. And, you know, it sounds fresh. It sounds rich and perfect for dancing.",
      "ALEJANDRO: We started working in New York and we finished in Paris. We have a few other records at the studio, but \u201cCommitted,\u201d this song is really special. He was the one that wrote that, the hook. And he was like, \u201cRauw, you have to sing it in English.\u201d And I was like, \u201cI've never done this before. It's new.\u201d It was challenge for me, you know, singing a whole hook in English. I told him, \u201cOK, but I\u2019ll do the verse in Spanish.\u201d I like to write my own verses and wanted to make it my own. We fused our ideas together.",
      "He understood the whole concept of the project. He's a legend, a mentor. You're going to hear more music from Pharrell and Rauw.",
      "ALEJANDRO: I always liked the classic stuff, and being really elegant, since I was a kid. I always like to be in a suit and tie. I found excuses to be really dressed up. And I think this character borrows that from Rauw Alejandro. I'm 31. I feel like a young spirt with an old soul, living in New York, the city's vibes, the musical influence of the '60s, the long coats ... the swag of Puerto Rico. I can't deny it. I think the way that you dress is the way you express yourself and your art.",
      "ALEJANDRO: I'm from Puerto Rico, that's my island. As a civilian, I'm always going to fight for my rights and give my opinion, share a positive message, be an example for the next generation and try to find the best solutions for my island. I think Benito (Bad Bunny) and Rene (Residente) have always done the same. I think everyone expresses themselves in different ways, but as an artist, the people can always count on me to share a message.",

      "Jake Paul and Mike Tyson aren't the only ones who have high stakes when they meet in the boxing ring on Friday night.",
      "For Netflix, it is their biggest live sports event to date, and an opportunity to make sure it can handle audience demand with the NFL and WWE on the horizon.",
      "The bout between the YouTuber-turned-boxer Paul, and Tyson, 58-year-old former heavyweight champion, from AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, will stream globally and be available to Netflix's 280 million subscribers at no additional cost.",
      "Netflix will broadcast the bout in English, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, French and German. It was originally scheduled for July 20, but was delayed by Tyson having a medical episode on a plane and needing time to recover from a stomach ulcer.",
      "Netflix declined multiple requests by The Associated Press to make a company executive available to discuss expectations about the fight.",
      "JP Morgan Chase analyst Doug Anmuth has not wavered in his prediction that it will be the most-watched fight ever. That might be an unrealistic bar to climb since four of Muhammad Ali's bouts had estimated worldwide audiences of one billion.",
      "The modern-day U.S. mark of 4.6 million from the 2015 bout between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao could be attainable though.",
      "\u201cWe believe the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight could be the most watched boxing match ever given ease of access and NFLX\u2019s (Netflix's) large global subscriber base, and it should attract Ad Tier subs, viewers, and dollars,\" Anmuth said in his analyst note according to CNBC Pro. \"Netflix is increasingly focused on sports entertainment, events, and shoulder content, and we expect a bigger push into live sports over time, particularly as negotiating leverage shifts in NFLX\u2019s direction.\u201d",
      "Netflix has used live sports as support programming for documentaries and series it airs. \u201cCountdown: Paul vs. Tyson\u201d, a three-part documentary series previewing the fight card, was ranked second Thursday night among Netflix's most-viewed shows.",
      "Last November\u2019s Netflix Cup, where Formula 1 drivers were paired with PGA golfers in a match-play format, brought together famous figures from \u201cDrive to Survive\u201d and \u201cFull Swing,\u201d The March 3 Netflix Slam exhibition match between Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz tied in with \u201cPoint Break\" and a documentary series about Alcaraz that will air next year.",
      "The NFL elected to partner with Netflix for a Christmas Day doubleheader of games because two series \u2014 \u201cQuarterback\u201d and \u201cReceiver\u201d \u2014 were among Netflix\u2019s top 10 series globally.",
      "Most Valuable Promotions is handling the production of Friday's bout while CBS will produce the two NFL games for Netflix. When \u201cRaw\u201d begins airing on Netflix in January, World Wrestling Entertainment handles the production of all its events.",
      "Netflix will carry \u201cRaw\u201d in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and Latin America beginning on Jan. 6, with additional countries to be added as contracts expire. The bigger component, though, is that Netflix will carry all of the company\u2019s shows overseas, including its premium live events like WrestleMania, SummerSlam and Royal Rumble.",
      "\u201cTechnically, it is a great dry run by putting on live events. The biggest problem they might have is you just end up in a situation where you\u2019ve got so much volume and viewing a way that you haven\u2019t had in the past,\u201d said Patrick Crakes, a media consultant and former Fox Sports executive. \u201cIt could end up being more than who watches the NFL games for a period of time. Others are handling the production, what they have to worry about is the operational flow. They know what they are doing.\u201d",

Taylor was simply the lucky one who happened to be casting for \u201cJulia,\u201d which didn\u2019t conflict with a play.",
      "Modesty is not antithetical to being a great casting director, though, a profession of observation, negotiation and nuance that operates mostly out of the public eye. It\u2019s why Taylor's a little nervous about Sunday, when she\u2019ll be presented with an honorary Oscar at the film academy\u2019s annual Governors Awards in a room full of Hollywood greats.",
      "Recognition is long overdue for Taylor and her peers. Earlier this year, the film academy announced that it would add a new competitive Oscar for casting directors starting with films released in 2025.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much people don\u2019t know about casting actors,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cOne thing is we negotiate all the contracts and we cast a movie within a budget.\u201d",
      "Casting wasn\u2019t always the art that it is today. In the studio system, it was more of cattle call, an organizational rather than creative job. But Taylor began her career in 1968 at time of change, mentored by one of the pioneers behind the movement: Marion Dougherty, who scouted talent in off-Broadway plays and turned casting into a more selective, humane process. It was also a profession led by a lot of women. Dougherty used to joke that it\u2019s because they didn\u2019t get paid much.",
      "The first movie Taylor led casting on was \u201cThe Exorcist,\u201d a baptism by fire in many ways. Director William Friedkin had not gotten along with Dougherty on \u201cThe Night They Raided Minsky\u2019s\" and called the office with a strange request.",
      "\u201cHe said, \u2018I hear you have a really good assistant. Would you let her cast my movie?\u2019\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he did that as something that was not nice to do. That was terrifying for me. I was scared to death the entire time.\u201d",
      "But she also found her voice on the film, discovering Linda Blair and taking a shot on Jason Miller, a playwright who she had a good feeling about.",
      "\u201cHe had such a great face and he was such an interesting kind of brooding man,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought, \u2018Gee let\u2019s see if he\u2019ll come in and cry.\u2019 He did and he got the part. That was exciting. That\u2019s a casting director\u2019s dream.\u201d",
      "As a New Yorker, Taylor quickly established herself as a go-to casting director for the likes of Woody Allen, for whom she cast over 40 films, Mike Nichols, Nora Ephron and Alan Parker. Among her over 100 credits, she did both \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind\u201d and \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d for Steven Spielberg, \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d for Martin Scorsese, \u201cBig\u201d for Penny Marshall and \u201cTerms of Endearment\u201d for James L Brooks.",
      "\u201cSo many of them turned out so well because I worked for such wonderful directors,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m being falsely modest, but I do feel like so many of these people were just so talented you couldn\u2019t miss it.\u201d",
      "Some of her proudest moments were finding real people to fill out movies, like the lounge singer in \u201cBroadway Danny Rose.\u201d There are also the actors who she didn\u2019t give up on.",
      "\u201cI used to drag poor Jeff Daniels in for everything,\u201d she said. \u201cBack then also there were two different communities of actors and there was very little intermingling. New York actors came to New York to be in the theater. If they got a movie, that was thrilling, but they didn\u2019t come thinking they were going to be a star.\u201d",
      "For the most part, she and her longest running filmmaker partners, Allen and Nichols, were able to operate independently.",
      "\u201cWoody made his movies on a very tight budget with the agreement that he wouldn\u2019t be interfered with,\u201d she said. \u201cMike Nichols was so admired that people didn\u2019t bother with him too much at first. But as his movies got more expensive, then you started to see a little bit more interference.\u201d",
      "When \u201cWorking Girl\u201d came along, for instance, the studio had ideas about needing bigger stars. She and Nichols wanted Alec Baldwin as the male lead, but he was too unknown for the studio and Harrison Ford was called in.",
      "Taylor retired a few years ago and doesn't regret it. She\u2019ll still talk to some of her old director friends about projects here and there. But she\u2019s mostly just enjoying going to the theater. And she\u2019s excited that her profession is being celebrated.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019ve been so many people who went before us who really deserved it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very moving for me and the whole community. It\u2019s been too long.\u201d"

      "Words and phrases like \u201cnostalgia\u201d or \u201cback to her roots\u201d come to mind when listening to Gwen Stefani\u2019s fifth studio album, \u201cBouquet\u201d \u2014 and it is in no way negative.",
      "Across 10-tracks, the powerhouse singer leans into the mellow rock of her youth \u2014 think Hall & Oates, Chicago, Fleetwood Mac \u2014 with dashes of country vibes here and there. Her voice is ageless, unaltered and distinctive, immediately recalling the early aughts when No Doubt still existed, and Stefani was still a bit of a ska girl.",
      "Thematically, however, the songs are about a woman who\u2019s been through the ringer \u2014 but life gave her a reprieve in her second act, and she found stability, lots of flowers and no mo\u2019 drama. In that way, \u201cBouquet\u201d is a not so furtive ode to husband Blake Shelton \u2014 who she met and fell in love with while they were both coaches on the singing reality competition show, \u201cThe Voice.\" At the time, they were both going through divorces to Gavin Rossdale and Miranda Lambert, respectively.",
      "On \u201cBouquet,\u201d the Stefani-Shelton romance arrives through yacht rock sounds and flowery language in songs with titles like \u201cMarigolds,\u201d \u201cLate to Bloom\u201d and \u201cEmpty Vase.\u201d When the album reaches its end, it is with a duet with Shelton on \u201cPurple Irises.\"",
      "If the album tells a story of her relationship, it starts with the opener \u201cSomebody Else's.\u201d Stefani starts off the proceedings by listing her previous romantic entanglement and bad choices. \u201cI don\u2019t know what a heart like mine/Was doin\u2019 in a love like that, ah,\" she sings. \"I don\u2019t\u205fknow\u205fwhat\u205fa woman like\u205fme/Was doin\u2019 with\u205fa man like you, ooh.\u201d",
      "It's a direct counter to the title track, where the focus appears to be back on Shelton: \u201cWe met when my heart was broken/Thank God that yours was, too,\u201d she shares. \u201cSo lucky that you were goin'/ Through what I was goin' through.\u201d",
      "In \"Late to Bloom,\u201d she decries the fact that they met so late in life.",
      "A nice bass progression, a clever turn of the phrase and a great voice are what it takes to get this album going. Add a cohesive theme, a pleasant vibe and a charismatic star \u2014- and that's coming up roses.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 12:58:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Payal Kapadia's &ldquo;All We Imagine as Light&quot; is about as rich a movie experience as you&rsquo;ll find this year",
    "story": [
      "Payal Kapadia's \u201cAll We Imagine as Light\" is about as rich a movie experience as you\u2019ll find this year",
      "NEW YORK -- Fiction moves stealthily through Payal Kapadia\u2019s films.",
      "The Indian filmmaker\u2019s first movie, \u201cNight of Knowing Nothing,\u201d is a documentary about the student strike at the Film and Television Institute of India, Kapadia\u2019s alma mater, following the appointment by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of a right-wing chairman. The film, though, is threaded through with fictional letters between two students who have split because they belong to separate castes.",
      "Kapadia\u2019s first fully narrative film, \u201cAll We Imagine as Light,\u201d begins more like a documentary, surveying Mumbai, particularly at night, before gently gravitating toward three women, all of them hospital workers, who are juggling their workaday realities, and those of India\u2019s stratified society, with their own aspirations.",
      "\u201cReal life is more interesting than cinema can be. We just have to pick its fruits,\u201d Kapadia says, smiling. \u201cThere\u2019s a quote from Rilke that I really love: \u2018If your real life is poor, it means you are not poet enough to draw from its riches.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cAll We Imagine as Light,\u201d which opens Friday in theaters and expands in the coming weeks, is about as rich a movie experience as you\u2019ll find this year. The film, which won the Grand Prix (second prize) at the Cannes Film Festival, is an intoxicatingly atmospheric portrait of life in Mumbai \u2014 of its dreams, its illusions and its impossibilities.",
      "As \u201cAll We Imagine as Light\u201d moves along, it slowly accumulates the magic of fable. Prabha (Kani Kusruti) hasn\u2019t heard from her husband, who\u2019s working in Germany, in years. Anu (Divya Prabha) is in love with a Muslim man, a relationship they have to hide and that, probably, is doomed. Their slightly older, recently widowed colleague, Parvaty (Chhaya Kadam), is being evicted after many years in her apartment.",
      "But when they escape the city \u2014 Parvaty is forced to move back to her village \u2014 the three women shed the various constrictions that grip them. They begin to imagine possibilities and see a light hidden to them by the patriarchal inequalities of Mumbai. \u201cAll We Imagine as Light,\u201d begun in documentary, turns increasingly fictional, and yet truer.",
      "\u201cI wanted to get closer and closer to a dreamlike state toward the end of the film and then snap back to reality,\u201d Kapadia says. \u201cI wanted the first part of the film to be very kind of nonfiction, with a documentary beginning. And the second half to feel as if time slows down. The landscape changes and the feeling of light changes.\u201d",
      "The luminous phases of \u201cAll We Imagine as Light\u201d has made it one of the most acclaimed films of the year \u2014 and yet, curiously, not India\u2019s submission for best international film at the Academy Awards. In announcing its choice, Kiran Rao\u2019s \u201cLaapataa Ladies,\u201d Ravi Kottarakara, president of the Film Federation of India, explained that the selection committee felt \u201cthat they were watching a European film taking place in India, not an Indian film taking place in India.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat is Indian? It\u2019s a very big continent that we have. There\u2019s a lot of Indias,\u201d Kapadia said in a recent interview. \u201cI\u2019m really happy with the film they chose. It\u2019s a really nice film. I liked it a lot. But I feel like these kind of statements, I don\u2019t know what purpose they serve. The committee that made the selection was 13 men. Is that very Indian? Then I don\u2019t mind so much.\u201d",
      "Kapadia, 38, met a reporter at the Criterion Collection offices in New York while \u201cAll We Imagine as Light\u201d was playing at the New York Film Festival. Her bag was stuffed with DVDs from a visit to the Criterion closet, including an Agnes Varda box set. Kapadia will chat naturally about arthouse inspirations or social ills but she\u2019s an ebullient, easy-going presence. That her film has inspired so much emotion (the festival press screening was the rare one where attendees burst into spontaneous applause at the end) is, for her, the thing that matters most.",
      "\u201cWhat else would you want as a filmmaker, that people watch it and like it and feel something when they watch it?\" Kapadia says. \"As somebody who loves to go to the cinema and cry \u2013 it\u2019s for me the greatest catharsis I can have \u2013 I just feel I want to make films where people also cry in the cinema.\u201d",
      "\u201cI cry a lot. I\u2019m very easy,\u201d she adds. \u201cI\u2019m a bit of a romantic.\u201d",
      "Not so unlike her characters, Kapadia is attempting to find another way as a filmmaker, operating outside the studio system of Bollywood. In Cannes, where \u201cAll We Imagine as Light\u201d was the first Indian feature to play in competition in 30 years, she argued that Indian cinema is broader than the bigger budget productions churned out by its state centers of industry.",
      "\u201cIndependent filmmakers everywhere in the world, we are just a sad lot,\u201d Kapadia says, laughing. \u201cEverywhere we are the odd ones out. Nobody understands what we\u2019re doing. People are like, \u2018We don\u2019t get to see your movies in cinemas. What really are you doing for five years?\u2019 It\u2019s a struggle for all independent filmmakers.\u201d",
      "Kapadia was born in Mumbai; her family has been there for generations. She attended school in southern India, and, in going and back and forth to home, she was often mesmerized by Mumbai.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of anonymity and freedom. It can be nice,\" she says. \"But it\u2019s also a city that has extreme inequality, more and more. Since the \u201980s, it\u2019s become obnoxious the lack of any kind of social systems who are financially struggling. That\u2019s the really brutal part of Bombay (the earlier name for Mumbai), the disregard for life.\u201d",
      "As an example, she cites a scene early in \u201cAll We Imagine as Light\u201d \u2014 one of its documentary moments \u2014 of masses trying to get on a train at the end of a workday. An announcement is heard urging people not to sit on top of the train or they\u2019ll be electrocuted.",
      "\u201cHow horrible this announcement needs to be made,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople would rather risk their life just to get home in time.\u201d",
      "Such pressures aren't unique to Mumbai, Kapadia notes. You could find something similar in those accustomed to living with capitalism, for example \u2014 anywhere where people struggle to realize their circumstances don't have to be as they're told.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about not knowing there\u2019s another way,\" says Kapadia. \u201cWe tend to work against ourselves when we don\u2019t see that there\u2019s another way.\u201d"

      "Christie\u2019s announced Friday it will sell more than 130 items, including 90 guitars, from the collection of the Yardbirds and Jeff Beck Group guitarist, who died in January 2023 at age 78.",
      "Valued at more than 1 million pounds ($1.3 million), the collection includes an oxblood 1954 Gibson Les Paul that Beck bought in Memphis in 1972 and played for the rest of the decade. The guitar, which is featured on the cover of Beck\u2019s Grammy-winning 1975 jazz-fusion album \u201cBlow by Blow,\u201d is expected to sell for between 350,000 pounds and 500,000 pounds ($450,000 and $640,000).",
      "Amelia Walker, head of Private and Iconic Collections at Christie's, called it \u201ca really beautiful instrument, covered in grime and dust and signs of use.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s part of the appeal,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are things that he used. They\u2019ve got the indents of his fingernails on the fret boards. Some of them, the strings haven\u2019t been changed for years. He played them hard. He didn\u2019t see them as precious works of art \u2014 they were his tools to ply his trade with.\u201d",
      "Beck came to prominence in the 1960s with hard-rock progenitors the Yardbirds and went on to a solo career that incorporated rock, jazz, blues and even opera. Twice inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame \u2014 with the Yardbirds and as a solo artist \u2014 he played with everyone from Rod Stewart to Davie Bowie, Stevie Wonder and Tina Turner, and was known for his improvisational skill and the unique sound he got from the whammy bar on his preferred guitar, the Fender Stratocaster.",
      "\u201cHe had an unparalleled ability to bend entire tones\u201d on the Strat, Walker said. The sale includes Beck\u2019s 1954 Sunburst Fender Stratocaster, valued at between 50,000 pounds and 80,000 pounds ($65,000 and $100,000), and a white Strat that was his staple instrument for 16 years, played everywhere from Ronnie Scott\u2019s jazz club to the Obama White House. It has an estimated value between 20,000 pounds and 30,000 pounds ($26,000 and $39,000).",
      "One of a group of 1960s guitar heroes that included Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page and Jimi Hendrix, Beck was revered by many peers as \u201cthe ultimate maestro,\u201d Walker said.",
      "As well as Beck\u2019s beloved Strats, the sale features other models including a Telecaster-Gibson hybrid \u201cTele-Gib\u201d valued at between 100,000 pounds and 150,000 pounds ($130,000 and $190,000).",
      "\u201cIt didn\u2019t really matter what he was playing, he\u2019d always sound like Jeff Beck,\u201d Walker said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter what the amp was turned to or which guitar, he could still pick it up and make it sound incredible. It\u2019s all in the fingers, and in his brain.\u201d",
      "The sale follows Christie's auction of some of Dire Straits\u2019 guitarist Mark Knopfler\u2019s collection, which raised more than 8.8 million pounds ($11.2 million) earlier this year, and memorabilia from model, artist and 1960s musicians\u2019 muse Pattie Boyd, which sold for 2.8 million pounds ($3.6 million) in March.",

      "\u201cAfter some hard thinking I decided they need to be shared, played and loved again,\u201d she said.",
      "A selection of the guitars will go on display at Christie's Los Angeles showroom Dec. 4-6, and the whole collection will be at Christie\u2019s in London from Jan. 15 until the sale on Jan. 22."

      "Pete Hegseth, the Army National Guard veteran and Fox News host nominated by Donald Trump to lead the Department of Defense, was flagged as a possible \u201cInsider Threat\u201d by a fellow service member due to a tattoo on his bicep that\u2019s associated with white...",
      "WASHINGTON -- Pete Hegseth, the Army National Guard veteran and Fox News host nominated by Donald Trump to lead the Department of Defense, was flagged as a possible \u201cInsider Threat\u201d by a fellow service member due to a tattoo on his bicep that's associated with white supremacist groups.",
      "Hegseth, who has downplayed the role of military members and veterans in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack and railed against the Pentagon\u2019s subsequent efforts to address extremism in the ranks, has said he was pulled by his District of Columbia National Guard unit from guarding Joe Biden\u2019s January 2021 inauguration. He's said he was unfairly identified as an extremist due to a cross tattoo on his chest.",
      "This week, however, a fellow Guard member who was the unit\u2019s security manager and on an anti-terrorism team at the time, shared with The Associated Press an email he sent to the unit\u2019s leadership flagging a different tattoo reading \u201cDeus Vult\u201d that\u2019s been used by white supremacists, concerned it was an indication of an \u201cInsider Threat.\u201d",
      "If Hegseth assumes office, it would mean that someone who has said it's a sham that extremism is a problem in the military would oversee a sprawling department whose leadership reacted with alarm when people in tactical gear stormed up the U.S. Capitol steps on Jan. 6 in military-style stack formation. He's also shown support for members of the military accused of war crimes and criticized the military's justice system.",
      "Hegseth and the Trump transition team did not respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "As the AP reported in an investigation published last month, more than 480 people with a military background were accused of ideologically driven extremist crimes from 2017 through 2023, including the more than 230 arrested in connection with the Jan. 6 insurrection, according to data collected and analyzed by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, or START, at the University of Maryland. Though those numbers reflect a small fraction of those who have served honorably in the military \u2014 and Lloyd Austin, the current defense secretary, has said that extremism is not widespread in the U.S. military \u2014 AP's investigation found that plots involving people with military backgrounds were more likely to involve mass casualties.",
      "Since Jan. 6, Hegseth, like many Trump supporters, has minimized both the riot's seriousness and the role of people with military training. Amid the widespread condemnation the day after the assault, Hegseth took a different approach. On a panel on Fox News, Hegseth portrayed the crowd as patriots, saying they \u201clove freedom\u201d and were \u201cpeople who love our country\u201d who had \u201cbeen re-awoken to the reality of what the left has done\u201d to their country.",
      "Of the 14 people convicted in the Capitol attack of seditious conspiracy, the most serious charge resulting from Jan. 6, eight previously served in the military. While the majority of those with military backgrounds arrested after Jan. 6 were no longer serving, more than 20 were in the military at the time of the attack, according to START.",
      "Hegseth wrote in his book \u201cThe War on Warriors,\u201d published earlier this year, that just \u201ca few\u201d or \u201ca handful\u201d of active-duty soldiers and reservists had been at the Capitol that day. He did not address the hundreds of military veterans who were arrested and charged.",
      "Hegseth has argued the Pentagon overreacted by taking steps to address extremism, and has taken leadership to task for the military's efforts to remove people it deemed white supremacists and violent extremists from the ranks. Hegseth has written that the problem is \u201cfake\u201d and \u201cmanufactured\u201d and characterized it as \u201cpeddling the lie of racism in the military.\u201d He said efforts to root extremism out had pushed \u201crank-and-file patriots out of their formations.\u201d",
      "\u201cAmerica is less safe, and our generals simply do not care about the oath that they swore to uphold. The generals are too busy assessing how domestic \u2018extremists\u2019 wearing Carhartt jackets will usurp our \u2018democracy\u2019 with gate barriers or flagpoles,\u201d he wrote in \u201cThe War on Warriors.\u201d",
      "In a segment on Fox News last year about Jacob Chansley, a Navy veteran known as the \u201cQAnon Shaman\u201d who walked through the Capitol while wearing a horned fur hat, Hegseth played a misleading video clip from his then-colleague Tucker Carlson that sought to portray Chansley as a passive sightseer.",
      "In fact, Chansley was among the first rioters to enter the building and pleaded guilty to a felony charge of obstructing an official proceeding in 2021. Chansley acknowledged using a bullhorn to rile up the mob, offering thanks in a prayer while in the Senate chamber for having the chance to get rid of traitors and writing a threatening note to Vice President Mike Pence saying, \u201cIt\u2019s Only A Matter of Time. Justice Is Coming!\u201d",
      "In a message on Facebook Hegseth posted with an excerpt of the video, he wrote the way Chansley had been treated by the justice system \u201cis disgusting.\u201d",
      "\u201cTrump, Chansley, and many more... the Left wants us all locked up,\u201d Hegseth wrote.",
      "Hegseth served for almost 20 years and deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay. He has two Bronze Stars. In speaking about his service and advocating for other service members and veterans, he has taken actions to support convicted war criminals and recently said he had told his platoon they could ignore directives limiting when they can shoot.",
      "In a podcast interview released earlier this month, Hegseth described getting a briefing from a military lawyer in 2005 in Baghdad on the rules of engagement. Hegseth said the lawyer told them they could not shoot someone carrying a rocket-propelled grenade unless it was pointed at them.",
      "\u201cI remember walking out of that briefing, pulling my platoon together and being like, \u2018Guys we\u2019re not doing that. You know, like if you see an enemy and they, you know, engage before he\u2019s able to point his weapon at you and shoot, we\u2019re going to have your back,\u2019\u201d Hegseth said.",
      "\u201cAll they do is take one incident and yell \u2018war criminal,\u2019\u201d he said, referring to The New York Times, the left and Democrats, adding, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t we back these guys up even if they weren\u2019t perfect?\u201d",
      "He said he was proud of his role in securing pardons from Trump in 2019 for a former U.S. Army commando set to stand trial in the killing of a suspected Afghan bomb-maker, as well as a former Army lieutenant convicted of murder for ordering his men to fire upon three Afghans, killing two. At Hegseth\u2019s urging, Trump also ordered a promotion for Eddie Gallagher, a Navy SEAL convicted of posing with a dead Islamic State captive in Iraq.",
      "Hegseth has complained that he himself was labeled an extremist by the D.C. National Guard and said he was prevented from serving during Biden\u2019s inauguration, a few weeks after the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, because of a cross tattoo on his chest. He said he decided to end his military service shortly after that in disgust.",
      "But a fellow Guard member who was working as a security officer ahead of the inauguration gave AP an email he sent that showed him raising concerns about a different tattoo.",
      "Retired Master Sgt. DeRicko Gaither, who was serving as the D.C. Army National Guard\u2019s physical security manager and on its anti-terrorism force protection team in January 2021, told the AP that he received an email from a former D.C. Guard member that included a screenshot of a social media post that included two photos showing several of Hegseth\u2019s tattoos.",
      "Gaither told AP he researched the tattoos \u2014 including one of a Jerusalem Cross and the context of the words \u201cDeus Vult,\u201d Latin for \u201cGod wills it,\u201d on his bicep \u2014 and determined they had sufficient connection to extremist groups to elevate the email to his commanding officers.",
      "Several of Hegseth\u2019s tattoos are associated with an expression of religious faith, according to Heidi Beirich of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, but they have also been adopted by some far right groups and violent extremists. Their meaning depends on context, she said.",
      "Former Navy intelligence officer Travis Akers was the person who initially saw the photos on a group chat, then researched them and decided to post the photos to social media. Those images were then seen by the former member of the D.C. National Guard, who sent them in an anonymous email to Gaither.",
      "\u201cIt was just quite concerning to see that on a service member\u2019s body, but even more concerning now that a person who chose to bear those symbols is being nominated to lead the most powerful, nuclear military in the world,\" Akers told the AP in a phone interview Friday.",
      "Some extremists invoke their association with the Christian crusades to express anti-Muslim sentiment. The Global Project Against Hate and Extremism notes that in 2023 the words were in the notebooks of the Allen, Texas, shooter Mauricio Garcia. Anders Breivik, a right-wing extremist who killed 77 people in 2011, had similar markings in his manifesto.",
      "In an email Gaither sent on Jan. 14, 2021, which he provided to the AP, he raised concerns about Hegseth, a major at the time, and mentioned only the \u201cDeus Vult\u201d tattoo. In the email addressed to then-Maj. Gen. William Walker, who was commanding general of the D.C. National Guard, Gauther raised concern that the phrase was associated with white supremacists who invoke the idea of a white Christian medieval past as well as the Christian crusades.",
      "\u201cMG Walker, Sir, with the information provided this falls along the line of Insider Threat and this is what we as members of the U.S. Army, District of Columbia National Guard and the Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection Team strive to prevent,\u201d Gaither wrote.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2019you guys need to take a look at this,'\u201d Gaither said in a phone interview with the AP on Thursday. \u201cI later received an email that he was told to stay away.\u201d",
      "Biden\u2019s inauguration took place just two weeks after the insurrection, and the Army was taking no chances. More than 25,000 Guard members were pouring into the city and each was going through additional vetting, depending on how close they were going to be to Biden.",
      "A total of 12 National Guard members were told to stay home, former Pentagon press secretary Jonathan Hoffman told reporters in a briefing a day before the inauguration. At least two were flagged due to potential extremism concerns; the rest were due to other background check issues that were identified as concerning by either the Army, FBI or Secret Service. It was not clear whether Hegseth was among the 12 Hoffman referenced at the time.",
      "Hegseth has also speculated in podcast interviews that he was asked to stand down because of his political views, his role as a journalist covering Jan. 6 or because he works for Fox News.",

    "story": [
      "Linkin Park, the inventive American rap-rock band who wove electronica into its heavy, melodic compositions, return with their first new album in seven years, \u201cFrom Zero.\u201d",
      "Linkin Park, the inventive American rap-rock band who wove electronica into its heavy, melodic compositions, return with their first new album in seven years, \u201cFrom Zero.\u201d It's a reference to their earliest days \u2014 when the band was known as Xero \u2014 a reclamation of their angry and ascendant sound, and something else entirely.",
      "It started in September. Linkin Park debuted their first new music since the 2017 death of lead singer Chester Bennington: a new song titled \u201cThe Emptiness Machine,\u201d with new singer Emily Armstrong of the band Dead Sara and drummer Colin Brittain, joining returning members Mike Shinoda, Brad Delson, Phoenix and Joe Hahn. (Shinoda and Armstrong share vocal duties.)",
      "It was a surprising return; as AP wrote at the time, Armstrong\u2019s performance style comfortably continuing the band\u2019s legacy. Her full-throated vocals recalled Bennington without attempting parody. That spirit continues throughout \"From Zero,\" Armstrong stretching out a scream into the kind of raspy, vibrato-fake out immediately recognizable as a Bennington-ism.",
      "In his absence, however, Shinoda takes more of the vocal lead. And in some points, it is to the band's detriment, like on \u201cCut the Bridge.\u201d Elsewhere, it's a revisitation to \u201cMeteora\u201d-era LP, like on the fistful \u201cHeavy Is the Crown.\u201d Ultimately, he makes a fine solo leader.",
      "More melodic moments may sound like the work of another band entirely when performed by Armstrong, like on \u201cOver Each Other,\" but that's quickly abandoned for the nu-metal ferocity of the track that follows, \u201cCasualty.\u201d",
      "It's an easy impulse, to look for Bennington on this album. One of the most rewarding moments arrives on \u201cTwo Faced\": \u201cI can\u2019t hear myself think,\u201d Armstrong speak-sings, before launching into a guttural bellow, \u201cStop yelling at me.\u201d It has echoes of Linkin Park's career-defining hits, like \u201cOne Step Closer.\u201d The necessary reminder to the listener, then, should be that this is the same band just in the midst of a transformation. Much is intact: The album is produced by Shinoda and it sounds it; signatures of Hahn, the band's DJ, turntablist and creative director, exist throughout.",
      "But it is also possible the controversy surrounding Armstrong will overshadow some fans\u2019 enjoyment of the record. Shortly after the new lineup debuted, the singer posted a statement on Instagram that many took to mean her appearance at an early court hearing for \u201cThat \u201970s Show\u201d star Danny Masterson, who was sentenced to 30 years in prison for the rape of two women in 2023.",
      "Shortly thereafter, Bennington\u2019s mother, Susan Eubanks, told Rolling Stone she had no idea the band was going to continue on without her son \u2014 and that they previously said they'd give her a heads up; they did not.",
      "For some Linkin Park fans, it is a nonstarter. For the others who will dive into \u201cFrom Zero,\u201d there are echoes of the band they loved.",

      "NEW YORK -- An arbitrator upheld five-year suspensions of the chief executives of Bad Bunny\u2019s sports representation firm for making improper inducements to players and cut the ban of the company's only certified baseball agent to three years.",
      "Ruth M. Moscovitch issued the ruling Oct. 30 in a case involving Noah Assad, Jonathan Miranda and William Arroyo of Rimas Sports. The decision became become public Tuesday when the Major League Baseball Players Association filed a petition to confirm the 80-page decision in New York Supreme Court in Manhattan.",
      "The union issued a notice of discipline on April 10 revoking Arroyo's agent certification and denying certification to Assad and Miranda, citing a $200,000 interest-free loan and a $19,500 gift. It barred them from reapplying for five years and prohibited certified agents from associating with any of the three or their affiliated companies. Assad, Miranda and Arroyo then appealed the decision, and Moscovitch was jointly appointed as the arbitrator on June 17.",
      "Moscovitch said the union presented unchallenged evidence of \u201cuse of non-certified personnel to talk with and recruit players; use of uncertified staff to negotiate terms of players\u2019 employment; giving things of value \u2014 concert tickets, gifts, money \u2014 to non-client players; providing loans, money, or other things of value to non-clients as inducements; providing or facilitating loans without seeking prior approval or reporting the loans.\u201d",
      "\u201cI find MLBPA has met its burden to prove the alleged violations of regulations with substantial evidence on the record as a whole,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThere can be no doubt that these are serious violations, both in the number of violations and the range of misconduct. As MLBPA executive director Anthony Clark testified, he has never seen so many violations of so many different regulations over a significant period of time.\u201d",
      "Mar\u00eda de Lourdes Mart\u00ednez, a spokeswoman for Rimas Sports, said the company declined to comment. Arroyo did not respond to a text message seeking comment.",
      "Moscovitch held four in-person hearings from Sept. 30 to Oct. 7 and three on video from Oct. 10-16.",
      "\u201cWhile these kinds of gifts are standard in the entertainment business, under the MLBPA regulations, agents and agencies simply are not permitted to give them to non-clients,\u201d she said.",
      "Arroyo's clients included Mets catcher Francisco Alvarez and teammate Ronny Mauricio.",
      "\u201cWhile it is true, as MLBPA alleges, that Mr. Arroyo violated the rules by not supervising uncertified personnel as they recruited players, he was put in that position by his employers,\u201d Moscovitch wrote. \u201cThe regulations hold him vicariously liable for the actions of uncertified personnel at the agency. The reality is that he was put in an impossible position: the regulations impose on him supervisory authority over all of the uncertified operatives at Rimas, but in reality, he was their underling, with no authority over anyone.\u201d",
      "In its petition to the court, the MLBPA asked the court to confirm Moscovitch's decision and to order the three individuals to pay the union $400,000, the amount they were fined by the union, plus interest dating from Moscovitch's decision.",

It's the first time the library has acquired a collection from one of its Gershwin recipients.",

      "But the Onion's purchase of Alex Jones' conspiracy-theory-saturated media empire at a bankruptcy auction tied to lawsuits by the families of Sandy Hook shooting victims is very real \u2014 an effort to fight falsehoods with funny and a who'd-have-thunk-it development in an already somewhat unbelievable year. An element of doubt was added late Thursday when the judge in Jones' bankruptcy case ordered a hearing for next week on how the auction was conducted.",

      "The new Infowars will be a satire of theories Jones advanced, which themselves were so absurd that they could have seemed satirical if they hadn't caused real-life harm.

      "In Collins, who once covered misinformation for NBC News, the new venture has a leader uniquely suited to what is being attempted, said Dale Beran, who made this year's Netflix documentary, \u201cThe Anti-Social Network,\u201d about the topic.",
      "The Onion, founded as a newspaper in 1988, has gone through several ownership changes and was purchased earlier this year by a group that includes Jeff Lawson, co-founder of the software company Twilio. Since then, Beran said, it \u201cfeels like there is new life breathed into it.\"",
      "Done well, a satirical site on conspiracy theories and those who traffic in them could meet a historical moment much like comedian Stephen Colbert did when his Comedy Central show, \u201cThe Colbert Report,\u201d mocked pompous conservative television talk show hosts a decade and more ago.",
      "And what will happen when some of Jones' casual fans who didn't follow the news of the bankruptcy auction log on to Infowars in a few months only to find the Onion's new creation? Probably not much, said Beran, who suggested it's unlikely there's much overlap between people attracted by conspiracy theories and those who want to mock them.",
      "Indeed, conspiracy theories about the Onion's purchase of Infowars began popping up online only hours after it was announced.",
      "\u201cThere's no chance this outlet which hasn't been relevant in years was able to afford this purchase on their own. Who was really behind this?\u201d the website Zeee Media, which bills itself as \u201cone of the most trusted, uncensored sources of information in Australia,\u201d posted on X.",
      "Jones himself hurriedly posted a video aimed at his fans on Thursday. \u201cThis is a total attack on free speech,\u201d he said. \u201cThe deep state is completely out of control.\u201d",
      "There is an impact any time a prominent website that traffics in misinformation is shut down. Still, the business model of reaching people who want to be enraged is still viable, Beran said. Another expert in misinformation suggested Jones will quickly move on, and his fans will move with him.",
      "\u201cAs long as there are people willing to tune in, he will find new outlets,\u201d said Yotam Ophir, head of the Media Effects, Misinformation and Extremism Lab at the University of Buffalo. \u201cIf anything, the Onion trolling and the court cases against him will just make some of his most dedicated fans even more sure of his righteousness, seeing him as a martyr for free speech.\u201d",
      "At the very least, the Onion purchase offered a moment of zen for liberals who have had a pretty rough week or so following Donald Trump's election victory and the GOP sweep in Congress.",
      "\u201cThis is bad karma turned good,\u201d wrote Timothy W. Larson, who describes himself on X as a \u201cunabashed progressive.\" \u201cI love it.\u201d",

      "Amano's prolific career across media \u2014 from his start as an animator at the Tatsunoko studio at age 15 to recent work including posters celebrating Puccini\u2019s centenary \u2014 reflects his notion that an artist is someone with many talents.",

      "Striking out on his own in the 1980s, Amano illustrated such science fantasy classics as the Vampire Hunter D novel series and made his mark in the video game arena with the Final Fantasy franchise.",
      "The exhibition also includes more recent, and perhaps lesser-known, works: an illustration of a model for the January 2020 issue of Vogue Italia, its only cover ever not to feature a live model; an album cover for David Bowie featuring the artist and his wife, Iman; and the Candy Girl series of Pop Art and manga-inspired paintings on aluminum.",

      "\u201cEvery fan would immediately recognize his style,\u201d Viola said. \u201cTrue, it is full of influences. Whoever has a little background in art history would find art nouveau, Klimt, bites of Renaissance, or the Ukiyo-e and the traditional Japanese art prints techniques. But all of this is revisited in a way that Amano\u2019s woman is clearly Amano\u2019s woman.\"",
      "Trademarks include the lightly drawn eyebrows, smears of color and the brush strokes of acrylic paint, Viola said.",

      "A nine-person delegation had traveled to Norway this week to collect the items. Four of them spent the night at the Oslo museum, alongside the remains as part of a ritual ceremony to take back the spirits of the remains.",
      "\u201cFirst one must awaken the spirits, and then speak to them in our original language. Food is then prepared to eat a meal with them, where the smell of the food goes to the spirits,\u201d a member of the delegation, Laura Tarita Rapu Alarc\u00f3n, told NTB.",
      "\u201cIt is important that those who own the culture are involved in the process,\" Liv Heyerdahl was quoted as saying by NTB. \"Of course these remains should be returned, and it feels right because they belong to the Rapa Nui.\u201d",
      "In 2019, an agreement was signed in Santiago, Chile, during a visit by Norway's King Harald. However, the COVID-19 pandemic stopped all activities in 2020, the museum said. Harald met with the Rapa Nui delegation on Tuesday.",
      "A book about Thor Heyerdahl's voyage \u2014 he died in 2002 at the age of 87 \u2014 has become an international bestseller, and his film of the journey won an Academy Award for best documentary in 1951.",
      "Rapa Nui is best known for the hundreds of moai \u2014 monolithic human figures carved centuries ago by this remote Pacific island\u2019s Rapanui people.",
      "Covering about 164 square kilometers (63 square miles) and home to about 7,700 people, half of them with Rapa Nui ancestry, Easter Island was formed at least 750,000 years ago by volcanic eruptions and is one of the world\u2019s most isolated inhabited islands.",
      "Located 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles) from South America, Rapa Nui was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995. In 2019, it was officially renamed \u201cRapa Nui-Easter Island\u201d from its previous name of just Easter Island."

      "Environmental advocates released reports Friday decrying fossil fuel industry influence at these climate talks in Baku, Azerbaijan, called COP29",
      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- Good or bad, the United Nations climate negotiations process itself became the focus of the international talks that aim to curb warming from coal, oil and natural gas.",
      "Environmental advocates released reports Friday decrying fossil fuel industry influence at the climate talks called COP29. At the same time, a letter signed by a former United Nations secretary-general and ex-top climate negotiators called for dramatic reform. And the conference's chief negotiator said current talks \u2014 aimed at striking a deal worth hundreds of billions of dollars to help finance a transition to clean energy and adapting to climate change \u2014 were going too slowly.",
      "All that put the focus on process \u2014 not results.",
      "\u201cWe consider COP29 as a litmus test for the global climate architecture,\" conference lead negotiator Yalchin Rafiyev said at a Friday news conference.",
      "A letter signed by former U.N. chief Ban Ki-Moon, former U.N. climate secretary Christiana Figueres and former Ireland President Mary Robinson called for \u201ca fundamental overhaul of the COP.\"",
      "\"We need a shift from negotiation to implementation,\u201d it said.",
      "Two signees \u2014 Figueres and Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research \u2014 said the letter was being badly misinterpreted as criticism of the climate talks. They said the letter was intended to show support for the process, which they said has worked and just needs to shift into a new mode.",
      "Instead of spending so much effort negotiating new deals in annual conferences that can attract 70,000 people, the process should be smaller and more frequent and aimed at putting what was already agreed upon into action, Rockstrom said.",
      "\u201cIt's about strengthening the COP,\" Rockstrom said. \u201cIt's about recognizing we\u2019ve accomplished so much that we have what we need. ... We really need to get serious about delivery.\"",
      "Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare said he had issues with some of the suggestions in the letter and personally considers the COP process broken. His analysis this week showed that after the 2015 Paris agreement projected future warming dropped, but in the past three years, warming projections \u2014 based on negotiations, promises and policies \u2014 for the future have stayed the same or even gone up slightly.",
      "An analysis from the Kick Big Polluters Out coalition said Friday that the official attendance list of the talks featured at least 1,770 people connected to fossil fuel interests.",
      "Catherine Abreu, director of the International Climate Politics Hub, suggested that there should be a \u201cfirewall\u201d between fossil fuel lobbyists, U.N. climate bodies and negotiators from countries. \u201cWe know over 1,700 fossil fuel lobbyists are here at COP29. That is not acceptable,\u201d she said.",
      "Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who on Friday presented new data on carbon pollution sites, said \u201cit\u2019s unfortunate that the fossil fuel industry and the petrostates have seized control of the COP process to an unhealthy degree.\"",
      "For his part, COP29 negotiator Rafiyev defended the process.",
      "\u201cThe process has already delivered, the COP process so far by reducing projected warming, delivering finance to those in need,\" Rafiev said. \u201cIt\u2019s better than any alternative.\u201d",
      "One key benefit of the U.N. climate talks process is it's the only place where vulnerable small island nations have an equal seat at the table, United Nations Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen told The Associated Press. But the process has its limits because \u201cthe rules of the game are set by member states,\u201d she said.",
      "At a press conference, Alliance of Small Islands States Chair Cedric Schuster said the negotiating bloc felt the need to remind everyone else why the talks matter.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re here to defend the Paris agreement,\u201d Schuster said, referring to the climate deal in 2015 to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned that countries are forgetting that protecting the world\u2019s most vulnerable is at the core of this framework.\u201d",
      "Also at the talks Friday, new data from an organization co-founded by Gore that combines observations and artificial intelligence found that cities in Asia and the United States emit the most heat-trapping gas, with Shanghai the most polluting.",
      "Using observations and artificial intelligence, Climate Trace quantifies heat-trapping carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, as well as other traditional air pollutants worldwide, including for the first time in more than 9,000 urban areas.",
      "Seven states or provinces spew more than 1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases, all of them in China, except Texas, which ranks sixth.",
      "Earth's total carbon dioxide and methane pollution grew 0.7% to 61.2 billion metric tons with the short-lived but extra potent methane rising 0.2%. The figures are higher than other datasets \u201cbecause we have such comprehensive coverage and we have observed more emissions in more sectors than are typically available,\u201d said Gavin McCormick, Climate Trace's co-founder.",
      "Shanghai's 256 million metric tons of greenhouse gases led all cities and exceeded those from the nations of Colombia or Norway. Tokyo's 250 million metric tons would rank in the top 40 of nations if it were a country, while New York City's 160 million metric tons and Houston's 150 million metric tons would be in the top 50 of countrywide emissions. Seoul, South Korea, ranks fifth among cities at 142 million metric tons.",
      "\u201cOne of the sites in the Permian Basin in Texas is by far the No. 1 worst polluting site in the entire world,\u201d Gore said. \u201cAnd maybe I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised by that, but I think of how dirty some of these sites are in Russia and China and so forth. But Permian Basin is putting them all in the shade.\u201d",
      "China, India, Iran, Indonesia and Russia had the biggest increases in emissions from 2022 to 2023, while Venezuela, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States had the biggest decreases in pollution.",
      "The dataset \u2014 maintained by scientists and analysts from various groups \u2014 also looked at traditional pollutants such as carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, ammonia, sulfur dioxide and other chemicals associated with dirty air. Burning fossil fuels releases both types of pollution, Gore said.",
      "This \u201crepresents the single biggest health threat facing humanity,\u201d Gore said.",

      "A U.S. military watchdog says Navy officials lacked sufficient understanding of the risks of maintaining massive fuel storage tanks on top of a drinking water well at Pearl Harbor where spilled jet fuel poisoned more than 6,000 people",
      "HONOLULU -- Navy officials \u201clacked sufficient understanding\u201d of the risks of maintaining massive fuel storage tanks on top of a drinking water well at Pearl Harbor where spilled jet fuel poisoned more than 6,000 people in 2021, a U.S. military watchdog said Thursday.",
      "That lack of awareness came even though officials had engineering drawings and environmental studies that described the risks, the U.S. Department of Defense\u2019s inspector general said.",
      "The finding was among a long list of Navy failures identified by the inspector general in two reports that follow a yearslong investigation into the fuel leak at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility. Investigators said it was imperative for the Navy to address its management of fuel and water systems at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam and recommended that the military assess leak detection systems at other Navy fuel facilities.",
      "\"The DoD must take this action, and others, to ensure that tragedies like the one in November of 2021 are not allowed to repeat,\u201d Inspector General Robert P. Storch said in a statement.",
      "The military built the Red Hill fuel tanks into the side of a mountain in the early 1940s to protect them from aerial attack. There were 20 tanks in all, each about the height of a 25-story building with the capacity to hold 12.5 million gallons (47.3 million liters.) The site was in the hills above Pearl Harbor and on top of an aquifer equipped with wells that provided drinking water to the Navy and to Honolulu's municipal water system.",
      "Fuel leaks at Red Hill had occurred before, including in 2014, prompting the Sierra Club of Hawaii and the Honolulu Board of Water Supply to ask the military to move the tanks to a place where they wouldn't threaten Oahu's water. But the Navy refused, saying the island's water was safe.",
      "The 2021 spill gushed from a ruptured pipe in May of that year. Most of it flowed into a fire suppression drain system, where it sat unnoticed for six months until a cart rammed a sagging line holding the liquid. Crews believed they mopped up most of this fuel but they failed to get about 5,000 gallons (19,000 liters.) Around Thanksgiving, the fuel flowed into a drain and drinking water well that supplied water to 90,000 people at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam.",
      "The inspector general's report noted 4,000 families had to move out of their homes for months because they couldn't drink or bathe in their water. The military spent more than $220 million housing residents in hotels and responding to the spill. Congress appropriated $2.1 billion more, some of which is helping the Navy close the Red Hill facility in compliance with an order from Hawaii regulators.",
      "Among the inspector general's other findings:",
      "1. The Navy never told the state Department of Health, which regulates underground fuel tanks, about the missing fuel after the May 2021 spill. 2. The Navy missed four separate opportunities in November 2021 to activate emergency response plans to respond to the water contamination. That includes on Nov. 20, when fuel was released from the drainage pipe, and on Nov. 28, when residents called base authorities to report chemical and fuel smells emanating from their water. 3. The Navy issued news releases on Nov. 21 and 22 saying \u201cthe drinking water was safe\u201d but did so without conducting any laboratory analysis to confirm that was the case.4. The Navy didn't assume contamination from the spill had spread throughout Pearl Harbor's drinking water system, as required by the water system emergency response plan. The report said some residents may have continued to cook and shower with their tap water as a result.",

      "Hawaii's congressional delegation, which called for the investigation in 2021, issued a joint statement saying the reports made clear the Navy and the military failed to manage fuel and water operations at Red Hill and Pearl Harbor to a standard that protects the health and safety of the people of Hawaii.",
      "\u201cIt's outrageous and unacceptable,\u201d said the statement from U.S. Sens. Mazie Hirono and Brian Schatz and U.S. Reps. Ed Case and Jill Tokuda, all Democrats.",
      "They called on the Navy to take \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for its failures and immediately implement the inspector general's recommendations.",
      "A Navy spokesperson said in a statement that the inspector general's findings align with previous evaluations and support corrective actions the Navy is implementing.",
      "\u201cWe are committed to constant improvement to ensure the highest standards of operation, maintenance, safety, and oversight at all of our facilities at all times,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The Navy last year issued written reprimands to three retired military officers for their roles in the fuel spill in a move the Sierra Club called \u201cslaps on the wrist.\u201d",
      "Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said he welcomed the inspector general's findings, which he said underscored what environmental advocates had long alleged.",

      "The Texas Supreme Court has ruled against a legislative subpoena that lawmakers used to stave off the execution of Robert Roberson",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- A Texas Supreme Court ruling has again cleared the way for the execution of Robert Roberson, who would become the first person in the U.S. to be put to death over a murder conviction tied to a case of shaken baby syndrome, a diagnosis that some medical experts have questioned.",
      "Roberson was convicted of killing his 2-year-old daughter in 2003 and had been slated to die by lethal injection on Oct. 17. But the execution was halted after a bipartisan group of Texas lawmakers, including some who believe Roberson is innocent, issued a last-ditch subpoena ordering Roberson to testify at the Capitol days after his execution date.",
      "The unusual tactic created a legal conundrum that successfully temporarily held off Roberson's execution. However, the Texas Supreme Court on Friday ruled that a legislative subpoena cannot stop an execution, reopening a path for the execution to proceed unless Republican Gov. Greg Abbott grants a 30-day reprieve. A new date hasn't been set yet.",
      "Here's a timeline of the case:",
      "___",
      "February 2003: Roberson is convicted of killing his daughter, Nikki Curtis, in Palestine, Texas. Prosecutors said she died from severe head trauma after being violently shaken back and forth.",
      "July 2024: Roberson's execution date is scheduled for Oct. 17 after numerous years of failed attempts to appeal the case.",
      "September 2024: A group of nearly 90 Republican and Democratic lawmakers file a clemency petition to the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles urging it to spare Roberson's life because they believe his daughter died of severe pneumonia, not abuse. The former lead detective on the case, several medical experts, civil rights advocates and best-selling author John Grisham also signed the petition.",
      "Oct. 16: The parole board votes unanimously, 6-0, to not recommend to grant clemency. Abbott can only grant clemency after receiving a recommendation from the board. With the execution appearing imminent, a Texas House committee ordered Roberson to testify at a hearing scheduled after his execution date.",
      "Oct 18: The Texas Supreme Court temporarily rules in the lawmakers' favor and allows Roberson to testify, which successfully delays his execution.",
      "October 21, 2024: Roberson does not show up to the committee hearing following pushback from the attorney general's office. Celebrity talk show host \u201cDr. Phil\u201d McGraw and John Grisham testify and say they believe he was convicted on the basis of \u201cjunk science.\u201d",
      "Nov. 15: The state Supreme Court ruled that a legislative subpoena cannot be used to override an execution.",

      "Minister Vili Bero\u0161, the directors of two hospitals in the capital Zagreb, and two companies are suspected of \"accepting and giving bribes, abuse of position and authority and money laundering,\" the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, or EPPO, in Zagreb said in a statement.",

      "\u201cI am appalled by the idea that anyone in the health system would use their position for personal gains or for favors to anyone else,\u201d Plenkovi\u0107 said at a press conference. \u201cThe health system is a particularly sensitive department.",
      "\u201cWe as a government have not and will not protect anyone from criminal prosecution if they are suspected of committing criminal acts, regardless of who that may be or which duty they have,\u201d Plenkovi\u0107 said.",
      "Bero\u0161' lawyer Laura Valkovi\u0107 said he denied wrongdoing.",
      "Croatia has had severe problems with systemic and political corruption. Among the 27 European Union member countries, it is generally ranked by international anti-graft groups as one of the most corrupt states.",
      "The EPPO statement said that five of the suspects between June 2022 and Nov. 2024 \u201cteamed up\u201d to secure undue financial gains for two companies by promising and giving monetary rewards to relevant stakeholders.",
      "\u201cTheir goal was to ensure that one of the companies was allowed to sell medical robotic devices for several hospitals in Croatia,\u201d the statement added. The group was also suspected of offering bribes to manipulate the public procurement process and exclude market competition in favor of that company.",
      "\u201cOther suspects offered and handed over bribes to several relevant stakeholders in the public health system, including the minister of health and the directors of two hospitals, to gain their support for different contracts\" funded by the EU or Croatia's national budget, said the EPPO statement.",
      "This was attempted on at least four occasions but didn't work in the case of an EU-funded project in the coastal town of Split, where the responsible person refused the offered bribe, the prosecutors said.",
      "In the other three cases in various hospitals in Zagreb, the statement said the health minister allegedly approved the purchase of microscopes at prices that were increased by 619,583 euros ($654,000) in exchange of a bribe.",
      "The EPPO is the independent public prosecutors' office of the European Union. It\u202fis responsible for investigating, prosecuting and bringing to judgment crimes against the financial interests of the EU.",
      "Croatia's State Attorney Ivan Turudi\u0107 criticized the EU prosecutors for allegedly not informing Croatia's anti-graft authorities that they are also investigating Bero\u0161 and the others. He said that he will decide who is responsible for the entire case.",
      "The EPPO stated that they suspected Bero\u0161 of receiving bribes, while Turudi\u0107 said Croatian investigators are accusing him of the lesser crime of \u201cinfluence peddling.\""

      "All of them said the election was the reason they were making these choices now.",
      "Requests for long-term birth control and permanent sterilizations have surged across the nation since the election, doctors told The Associated Press. And companies that sell emergency contraception and abortion pills say they're seeing significant spikes in requests from people who are stockpiling the medications \u2014 one saw a 966% increase in sales of emergency contraception from the week before in the 60 hours after the election.",
      "\u201cI saw this bump after the Trump election in 2016\" and after Roe vs. Wade was overturned in 2022, said Alfonso, an OB-GYN at Duke University in North Carolina. \u201cBut the patients seem more afraid this time.\u201d",
      "Although anti-abortion advocates are pressing Trump for more restrictions on abortion pills, it's unclear what \u2014 if much \u2014 will be done regarding access to contraceptives of any kind during the second Trump administration. Trump told a Pittsburgh television station in May that he was open to supporting regulations on contraception. But after media reports on the interview, he wrote on his social media platform Truth Social that he \u201chas never and will never\u201d advocate for restricting birth control and other contraceptives.",
      "Alfonso said his patients want to replace still-effective IUDs and \u201crestart\u201d the 3-to-12-year clock on them before the inauguration. He also said the women are particularly concerned about IUDs, which have been attacked by abortion opponents who believe life begins when an egg is fertilized. Experts believe the devices work mostly by blocking fertilization, but also may make it harder for a fertilized egg to implant in the womb.",
      "A patient who requested a tubal ligation Tuesday told Alfonso she doesn\u2019t want kids and is \u201cjust absolutely terrified of either forced pregnancy or inability to access contraception.\"",

      "One patient, Mara Zupko, said she wants prescription emergency contraception since she\u2019s on the cusp of the weight limit for Plan B, the most well-known over-the-counter type. Her husband is getting a vasectomy.",

Other research found that more women had their tubes tied post-Roe, with the biggest increases in states that ban abortion.",
      "Mifepristone has a shelf life of about five years and misoprostol around two years, according to Plan C, an organization that provides information about medical abortions. Plan B typically has a shelf life of four years.",
      "Telehealth company Wisp saw orders for abortion pills spike 600% between Election Day and the following day. And between Nov. 6 and 11, the company saw a 460% increase in sales of its emergency contraception and birth control offerings.",

Sales of \u201cvalue packs\u201d of Restart \u2014 four doses instead of one \u2014 were up more than 7,000% in the past week.",
      "\"Morning after pills\u201d are legal in all states, but Winx co-founder Cynthia Plotch said many people seem confused about what emergency contraception is compared to abortion pills. In a 2023 poll by the health policy research organization KFF, a majority of responders said they know these two things aren't the same, but only 27% reported knowing emergency contraceptive pills cannot end a pregnancy.",
      "Doctors agree confusion around morning after pills may explain some of the stockpiling. But Alfonso at Duke suspects most people are doing this for the same reason they are seeking longer-term methods of birth control: to avoid abortion by preventing pregnancy in the first place.",
      "Alfonso predicts the birth control and abortion pill surge may level out like it did in 2016 and 2022. If the new administration \u201cis not focused on health care right away,\" he said, \"then I think it\u2019ll go to the back of people\u2019s minds until it picks up in the media.\u201d",

      "Through her shock, Nawfal said, \u201cI was relieved that her body was in one piece.\u201d In Gaza, blasts often ripped people apart, leaving their loved ones without even a body to bury.",
      "Halima\u2019s brother was unconscious next to her. He was quickly revived at the hospital. But staff at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital confirmed Nawfal\u2019s fears, she said: Halima was dead. Her small body was placed in the morgue.",
      "But as the family was preparing to bury her, the little girl\u2019s uncle noticed faint signs of life, the family said.",
      "Officials at Al-Aqsa hospital could not be reached to confirm the account. But Abu Sitta, who has worked in several Gaza hospitals during the war, said in the chaotic situation it was not uncommon for patients to be misidentified as dead because normal protocols for emergency room examinations were often abandoned.",
      "\u201cBecause of the sheer number of cases that would come in with each air raid ... the ambulance staff would take to the morgue immediately those who they thought were dead,\" he said.",
      "In the days after her daughter was determined to be alive, Nawfal stayed with her, manually pumping oxygen into her lungs. After a week, the little girl began to breathe on her own. Finally, she woke up.",
      "\u201cSome of the doctors cried and said this is a miracle,\u201d Nawfal said.",

      "The Lebanese militant group began firing rockets across the border into Israel in support of its ally, Hamas, on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after Palestinian militants staged the deadly surprise incursion into southern Israel that sparked the ongoing war in Gaza. Israel responded with shelling and airstrikes.",
      "For months, the conflict in Lebanon was mainly confined to the border area, far from Beirut.",
      "Abu Sitta said he chose Lebanon for the wounded children's treatment because the Mediterranean country has specialists with wide experience treating war injuries.",
      "Lebanon has been through its share of conflicts, including a 15-year civil war that ended in 1990 and a brutal monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, as well as spillover effects from other regional conflicts.",

      "Nawfal said her daughter has lingering memory problems but is improving with therapy. A chipper, happy-go-lucky child, Halima thrived in Beirut. She swam in the hotel pool, loved to color and played with the other children from Gaza. She walked with her siblings to pick out fruit at the neighborhood produce stand, a straw hat covering the scar on the back of her head.",
      "In mid-September, Israel launched an offensive against Hezbollah. It pummeled wide swathes of Lebanon with airstrikes, including Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs and some sites within the city center.",
      "The children quickly snapped back into wartime habits. They cracked open the balcony's sliding glass doors to prevent the glass shattering from the pressure of a blast and began sleeping in the central sitting room in the family\u2019s hotel suite, away from windows.",
      "Nawfal said some organizations offered to evacuate the family from Lebanon to continue treatment elsewhere, but she \u201ccompletely refused.\u201d",
      "\u201cLebanon isn\u2019t just another Arab country or a country we came to for treatment \u2014 Lebanon is a sister to Gaza,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are like two souls in one body. ... We live or die together.\u201d",
      "Adam Afana's uncle, Eid Afana, said the escalation in Lebanon \u201creminds us of the beginning of the war in Gaza.\u201d Afana said the sound of airstrikes frightened Adam, who felt the war was pursuing them.",
      "\u201cWhat we hope for Lebanon is that what happened in Gaza won\u2019t happen here \u2014 that the beginning and the ending won\u2019t both be the same,\u201d Afana said.",
      "The Ghassan Abu Sitta Fund halted bringing wounded Palestinian children to Lebanon but continues to treat the existing patients \u2014 with some challenges.",
      "Since arriving in Beirut, Adam has undergone a procedure to clear infection from his bones, a neurosurgery and regular physiotherapy sessions. With effort, he can now slightly clench his hand.",
      "But the final operation \u2014 a muscle transfer and surgery to repair the damaged nerves to his arm \u2014 is on hold.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just a handful of people who specialize in this globally, and we were expecting one of them to come to Lebanon,\u201d Abu Sitta said. The trip has been delayed by the escalation in Lebanon.",
      "When he first launched the program, Abu Sitta hoped to treat 50 Palestinian children from Gaza at any given time. Unable to bring more patients in, the team is turning its resources to treating Lebanese children.",
      "The numbers of wounded Lebanese children are still far lower than in Gaza. As of last week, Lebanon\u2019s Ministry of Public Health said 192 children had been killed and at least 1,255 wounded since October 2023. In Gaza, more than 13,000 children have been killed and thousands more have been wounded, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.",
      "Abu Sitta said the wounds of children in Lebanon are \u201cidentical to the injuries of Palestinian children from Gaza.\u201d Most were wounded while at home. They suffered \u201ccrush injuries to the limbs, blast injuries to the face\u201d and often \u201cmultiple members of the family killed at the same time,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cAs in Gaza, this war takes its toll on children,\u201d he said. \u201cAll wars are waged on children.\u201d"

      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- For the third straight year, efforts to fight climate change haven't lowered projections for how hot the world is likely to get \u2014 even as countries gather for another round of talks to curb warming, according to an analysis Thursday.",
      "At the United Nations climate talks, hosted in Baku, Azerbaijan, nations are trying to set new targets to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases and figure out how much rich nations will pay to help the world with that task.",
      "But Earth remains on a path to be 2.7 degrees Celsius (4.9 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, according to Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists and analysts who study government policies and translate that into projections of warming.",
      "If emissions are still rising and temperature projections are no longer dropping, people should wonder if the United Nations climate negotiations \u2014 known as COP \u2014 are doing any good, said Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot going on that\u2019s positive here, but on the big picture of actually getting stuff done to reduce emissions ... to me it feels broken,\u201d Hare said.",
      "The world has already warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. That's near the 1.5-degree (2.7 F) limit that countries agreed to at 2015 climate talks in Paris. Climate scientists say the atmospheric warming, mainly from human burning of fossil fuels, is causing ever more extreme and damaging weather including droughts, flooding and dangerous heat.",
      "Climate Action Tracker does projections under several different scenarios, and in some cases, those are going up slightly.",
      "\u201cThis is driven highly by China,\u201d said Sofia Gonzales-Zuniga of Climate Analytics. Even though China's fast-rising emissions are starting to plateau, they are peaking higher than anticipated, she said.",
      "Another upcoming factor not yet in the calculations is the U.S. elections. A Trump administration that rolls back the climate policies in the Inflation Reduction Act, and carries out the conservative blueprint Project 2025, would add 0.04 degree Celsius (0.07 Fahrenheit) to warming projections, Gonzales-Zuniga said. That's not much, but it could be more if other nations use it as an excuse to do less, she said.",
      "\u201cFossil fuels and emissions are not peaking,\u201d said Sherry Rehman, chair of climate and environment committee in Pakistan\u2019s senate. After 29 years of climate talks, Rehman said countries are \u201cstill talking in bumper stickers.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need a transformative solution. We need strong delivery,\u201d Rehman said.",
      "The major battle in Baku is over how much rich nations will pay for developing countries to decarbonize their energy systems, cope with future harms of climate change and pay for damage from warming's extreme weather.",
      "A special independent group of experts commissioned by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued its own estimate of costs and finances on Thursday, calling for a tripling of the old commitment. It said about $1 trillion a year is needed by developing nations from all outside sources, not just government grants.",
      "\u201cAdvanced economies need to demonstrate a credible commitment\u201d to helping poor nations, the report said.",
      "Negotiations on a grand total and structuring the overall amount have taken \u201ca step back\u201d when a draft of just a few pages that was worked on for a year was rejected and the latest proposal with many options has more than 30 pages, said top European negotiator Veronika Bagi of Hungary. European Commission negotiator Jacob Werksman said there\u2019s a \u201cvery significant gap\u2033 between what rich and poor nations propose.",
      "German climate envoy Jennifer Morgan said \u201cprivate investment has to be brought to the table\u201d in order to fulfill developing countries needs. But Mariana Paoli of Christian Aid said any number that comes out of negotiations that's not based in publicly-financed grants \u201cwill be meaningless.\u201d",
      "Relying on the private sector means climate cash will not be \u201cneeds based, it will be profit-driven,\" she said, adding that crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and bank bailouts proves that public funds are available.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about fairness, it\u2019s about justice,\u201d she said.",
      "Getting climate cash is personal for many activists from vulnerable nations, like Sandra Leticia Guzman Luna, who is from Mexico and the director of the climate finance group for Latin America and the Caribbean. \u201cWe are observing the climate impacts causing a lot of costs, not only economic costs but also human losses,\u201d she said.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump says he will nominate anti-vaccine activist Robert F",
      "NEW YORK -- President-elect Donald Trump announced Thursday he will nominate anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, putting a man whose views public health officials have decried as dangerous in charge of a massive agency that oversees everything from drug, vaccine and food safety to medical research, Medicare and Medicaid.",
      "\u201cFor too long, Americans have been crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation when it comes to Public Health,\u201d Trump said Thursday in a post on his Truth Social site announcing the appointment. Kennedy, he said, would \u201cend the Chronic Disease epidemic\" and \u201cMake America Great and Healthy Again!\u201d",
      "Trump said Kennedy would target drugs, food additives and chemicals.",
      "As one of the most prominent anti-vaccine activists in the world, Kennedy's nomination immediately alarmed some public health officials.",
      "Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Associated Press, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go backwards and see children or adults suffer or lose their lives to remind us that vaccines work, and so I am concerned.\u201d",
      "Trump also announced Thursday that he has chosen Doug Collins, a former congressman from Georgia, to run the Department of Veterans Affairs. Collins is a chaplain in the U.S. Air Force Reserve Command. The Republican served in Congress from 2013 to 2021, and he helped defend Trump during his first impeachment process.",
      "Later Thursday, Trump said he was nominating North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum to lead the Department of the Interior. After ending his own presidential campaign in December 2023, Burgum endorsed Trump and became an outspoken supporter, appearing on TV news shows and at rallies and other events. He was on Trump's short list of potential running mates.",
      "Kennedy hails from one of the nation\u2019s most storied political families and is the son of the late Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of President John F. Kennedy. He first challenged President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination last year. He then ran as an independent but abandoned his bid this summer after striking a deal to endorse Trump in exchange for a promise to serve in a health policy role during a second Trump administration.",
      "He and the president-elect have since become good friends. The two campaigned together extensively during the race\u2019s final stretch, and Trump made clear he intended to give Kennedy a major public health role.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to let him go wild on health,\u201d Trump said at a rally last month.",
      "During the campaign, Kennedy told NewsNation that Trump had asked him to \u201creorganize\u201d agencies including the CDC, the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Kennedy has pushed against processed foods and the use of herbicides like Roundup weed killer. He has long criticized the large commercial farms and animal feeding operations that dominate the industry.",
      "But he is perhaps best known for his criticism of childhood vaccines.",
      "Again and again, Kennedy has made his opposition to vaccines clear. In July, he said in a podcast interview that \u201cThere\u2019s no vaccine that is safe and effective\u201d and told FOX News that he still believes in the long-ago debunked idea that vaccines can cause autism.",
      "In a 2021 podcast he urged people to \u201cresist\u201d CDC guidelines that advise when kids should receive routine vaccinations.",
      "\u201cI see somebody on a hiking trail carrying a little baby and I say to him, \u2018Better not get them vaccinated,\u2019\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "Repeated scientific studies in the U.S. and abroad have found no link between vaccines and autism. Vaccines have been proven safe and effective in laboratory testing and in real world use in hundreds of millions of people over decades. The World Health Organization credits childhood vaccines with preventing as many as 5 million deaths a year.",
      "Trump during his first term launched Operation Warp Speed, an effort to speed the production and distribution of a vaccine to combat COVID-19. The resulting vaccines were widely credited, including by Trump himself, with saving lives.",
      "Kennedy has also worked to shore up support among young mothers in particular, on a message of ridding the U.S. of unhealthy ingredients in foods, promising to model regulations after those imposed in Europe. His claims that the U.S. obesity epidemic, as well as a rise in chronic diseases like diabetes, are the result of processed and unhealthy foods has resonated on social media among fitness gurus and mom influencers alike.",
      "It remains unclear how that will square with Trump\u2019s history of deregulation of big industries, including food. Trump has pushed for fewer inspections of the meat industry, for example.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s stance on vaccines raises question about his ability to get confirmed, even in a GOP-controlled Senate. He also has said he would make a controversial recommendation to remove fluoride from drinking water, although fluoride levels are mandated by state and local governments. The addition of the mineral has been cited as leading to improved dental health and is considered safe at low levels.",
      "Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune would not comment on Trump's pick of Kennedy or any other potential nominee. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make any judgments about any of these folks at this point,\u201d he said.",
      "But Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, R-MO, praised the HHS pick, posting on X: \u201cBad day for Big Pharma! @RobertKennedyJr.\"",
      "Several Democrats quickly condemned the selection.",
      "Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the No. 3 Democrat, said that Kennedy\u2019s confirmation would be \u201cnothing short of a disaster for the health of millions of families.\u201d",
      "But not every Democrat recoiled from the news. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said he was \u201cexcited\u201d for Kennedy to lead HHS. Polis said he wants to see Kennedy take on \u201cbig pharma\u201d and hopes he will \u201clean into personal choice\u201d on vaccines.",
      "That idea is concerning to former New York Public Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan, who said that if people opt against vaccines, deadly viruses could run wild. He points to an uptick in measles outbreaks \u2014 16 have occurred so far this year compared to four last year. \u201cThat\u2019s going to continue if we have someone at the top of our health system that is saying, \u2018I\u2019m not so sure about the science here,\u2019\u201d Vasan said.",
      "FDA could have one of the biggest shakeups, with Kennedy's promises of more regulations \u2014 action that would buck the moves that previous Republican administrations have made. He has promised a crackdown on food dyes and preservatives. And with pharmaceutical companies, he's suggested that drugmakers be barred from advertising on TV, a multibillion-dollar enterprise that accounts for most of the industry\u2019s marketing dollars. He also proposed eliminating fees that drugmakers pay the FDA to review their products.",
      "He wants to weaken FDA regulations around a host of unsubstantiated therapies, including psychedelics and stem cells as well as discredited COVID-era drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.",
      "Kennedy also will focus on ending the \u201crevolving door\u201d of employees who have previously worked for pharmaceutical companies or leave government service to work for that industry, his former campaign communications manager, Del Bigtree, told the AP last month.",
      "This past weekend, Kennedy said he wanted to fire 600 employees at NIH, which oversees vaccine research and replace them with 600 new people. In separate comments, he has said that in his first week he would order a pause in drug development and infectious disease research, shifting the focus to chronic diseases.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaccine nonprofit group, Children\u2019s Health Defense, currently has a lawsuit pending against a number of news organizations, among them The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy took leave from the group when he announced his run for president but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit.",
      "Trump also announced Thursday that he will nominate Jay Clayton, who served as chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission during his first term, to serve as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.",

      "\u201cAt first they thought it was really weird, like, \u2018What are we doing?\u2019\u201d Clayton said. \u201cThere were a lot of cameras off and I\u2019m sure a lot of people were like, \u2018This is awkward.\u2019\" But after a couple of weeks, there was a shift. Employees of the Austin, Texas company were saying, 'This feels good,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Deep breathing can be an effective way to reduce stress at work, studies show. But on the job, many people don\u2019t think about how they\u2019re inhaling and exhaling.",
      "Desk workers sitting a computer tend to take shallow breaths as their shoulders creep up. Workers who spend the day on their feet in retail or health care may be too busy to focus on breathing.",
      "But there's good reason to remember to pause to take deep breaths. Chronic, unmanaged stress, which increases the risk of heart disease and stroke, can be as harmful to our health as secondhand smoke, according to the American Heart Association. Research suggests deep-breathing exercises can lower a person's blood pressure and reduce anxiety.",
      "Other benefits: deep breathing is free, can be done anywhere and doesn't require taking a half-hour to meditate. Spending just a minute or two breathing deeply can help calm racing thoughts, experts say.",
      "\u201cIt relaxes my mind. It makes my mind so full of ease,\u201d Lisa Marie Deleveaux, a marketing professional and mother of five, said. \u201cIt brings you back to the present moment.\u201d",
      "Deleveaux was laid off several months ago and has struggled to find a new job. She wakes most mornings at 4 or 5 a.m., before the children, to do breathing exercises. One is a technique known as alternate nostril breathing, a yoga exercise that involves inhaling through one nostril and out through another, using a thumb or forefinger to hold one nostril closed at a time.",
      "\u201cIf you set a priority for yourself ... you can make the time,\u201d Deleveaux said.",
      "Focusing on breathing for one to five minutes \"can help you clear the slate and wipe all these things out of your mind...and allow you to get back to focusing on the one thing you want to accomplish,\u201d said cardiologist Glenn Levine, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. \u201cThe best analogy is turning your computer off when you have 37 programs (open) and it freezes.\u201d",
      "A good way to do deep breathing exercises is while sitting on a bench outside, Levine said. If that\u2019s not an option, doing it at a desk works.",
      "\u201cEither turn off your screen or just put something blank on the screen so people think you\u2019re still working,\" Levine said. \u201cInstead of focusing on the screen or work, just focus on your breathing. If possible, close your eyes.\u201d",
      "There are other ways to fit in breathing exercises. To get ahead of anxiety before starting a day of cold calls, sales development representative Lindsay Carlisle does breathing exercises with her 7-year-old daughter during the drive to school. They breathe in for seven counts, hold their breath for five, breathe out for seven counts, and then repeat the cycle several times.",
      "\u201cThroughout that process, my shoulders start to drop on their own, and it really is calming,\u201d Carlisle, who lives in Flint, Michigan, said. \u201cI\u2019m not a yoga instructor. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing, but it works.\u201d",
      "Suze Yalof Schwartz was an overworked fashion editor when her mother-in-law taught her a three-minute meditation technique that she says changed her life. She gave up her fashion career and founded Unplug Meditation, a Santa Monica, California, company with a meditation studio, an app and programs for corporate clients.",
      "\u201cWhen we slow down our breath, we send a signal to our brain that everything\u2019s OK, even when it\u2019s not,\" she said.",
      "A 16-second breathing technique she's taught to firefighters, police officers, doctors and others is called the box breathing technique. You breathe in for four counts, hold for four, breathe out for four counts and hold for four.",
      "\u201cIt is the best thing that you can do at work before you have a meeting, before you send out an email that you wish you didn\u2019t send, before you have a difficult conversation, because it just calms you down, gets rid of your negative energy,\" Yalof Schwartz said.",
      "Employers such as Coca-Cola, Mattel and Netflix have hired Unplug Meditation to teach breathing or meditation.",
      "It's not always easy for workers to find space for deep breathing exercises. For example, in retail jobs, workers often mix with customers. Yalof Schwartz recommends doing breathing exercises when ringing up a sale or folding clothes. You can also take a deep breath right before walking through a door.",
      "Office workers can set a timer on their phones to remind themselves to breathe deeply. That's what Carlisle, the sales representative, does. She also keeps a Post-it note on her monitor that says \u201cBreathe.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe anxiety is always going to be there,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cBut at least I know I have one small tool. ... It sounds so simple and silly, but it works.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has picked a prominent vaccine skeptic to lead the nation\u2019s sprawling public health apparatus",
      "President-elect Donald Trump 's plan to appoint Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to lead the Health and Human Services Department will put a prominent vaccine skeptic at the helm of the nation's sprawling public health apparatus.",
      "A scion of a famous Democratic dynasty, Kennedy made a name in his own right as an environmental attorney who successfully took on large corporations including DuPont and Monsanto.",
      "But over the past two decades, he's increasingly devoted his energy to promoting claims about vaccines that contradict the overwhelming consensus of scientists.",
      "Trump would have Kennedy lead a massive Cabinet agency that oversees everything from drug, vaccine and food safety to medical research and the social safety net programs Medicare and Medicaid. He said before the election he would give Kennedy free rein over health policy.",
      "Here's a look at Kennedy and the agency he'll be tasked with leading:",
      "He took over the anti-vaccine group Children's Health Defense and built it into a juggernaut during the pandemic. His activism helped him build a loyal following that he's leveraged in his political pursuits.",
      "Kennedy insists he is not anti-vaccine and claims he has never told the public to avoid vaccination. But he has repeatedly made his opposition to vaccines clear. He said on a podcast \u201cthere\u2019s no vaccine that is safe and effective\u201d and has urged people to resist CDC guidelines on when kids should get vaccinated.",
      "While there are rare instances when people have severe reactions to vaccines, the billions of doses administered globally provide real-world evidence that they are safe. The World Health Organization says vaccines prevent as many as 5 million deaths each year.",
      "He wants to eliminate liability protections for drug companies.",
      "Even before Trump was elected, Kennedy said he would recommend water agencies stop adding fluoride to drinking water. Fluoride strengthens teeth and is viewed as one of the biggest public health successes of the past century.",
      "He made a variety of other claims not backed by science, such as questioning whether HIV causes AIDS and suggesting antidepressants lead to school shootings.",
      "Children\u2019s Health Defense, currently has a lawsuit pending against a number of news organizations, among them The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy took leave from the group when he announced his run for president but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit.",
      "Kennedy has promised to take a serious look at those who work for HHS and its agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "He is especially focused on putting an end to the \u201crevolving door\u201d of employees who have previous history working for pharmaceutical companies or leave government service to work for that industry, his campaign communications manager Del Bigtree told the AP last month. Bigtree is also an anti-vaccine organizer.",
      "He said he wants to fire 600 employees at the National Institutes of Health, which oversees vaccine research, and replace them with 600 new employees.",
      "Many of the scientists and researchers who work at the NIH are not political appointees, which makes firing them abruptly more difficult. Nevertheless, Kennedy made the promise at the Genius Network Annual Event in Scottsdale, Arizona, according to a video first obtained by ABC News.",
      "\u201cWe need to act fast, and we want to have those people in place on Jan. 20, so that on Jan. 21, 600 people are going to walk into offices at NIH and 600 people are going to leave,\u201d Kennedy said, according to a video of his remarks posted on YouTube.",
      "He says the public health establishment is too focused on infectious diseases and wants to redirect resources toward panoply of problems he characterizes as the chronic disease epidemic, including obesity, diabetes, autism and mental illnesses. He blames them on greedy corporations including drug companies that worry healthy Americans would be bad for their bottom line and food producers using harmful pesticides and additives.",
      "Kennedy's father was Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, brother of President John F. Kennedy. Both men were assassinated.",
      "Kennedy originally ran in the Democratic primary against President Joe Biden before deciding to launch an independent bid. He then suspended that campaign earlier this year and endorsed Trump, who has repeatedly praised Kennedy, promised him influence in a future administration, and vowed to \u201cMake America Healthy Again.\u201d",
      "The GOP base has eagerly welcomed Kennedy since he joined forces with Trump, an embrace Kennedy never received from the Democratic Party. His anti-vaccine activism has alienated him from much of his famous family.",
      "Doctors found a dead parasitic worm in Kennedy's brain and high levels of mercury that he said caused brain fog and memory problems.",
      "He once retrieved a bear that was killed by a motorist and left it in New York\u2019s Central Park with a bicycle on top, sparking a mystery that consumed the city in 2014. A photo showed Kennedy with his fingers in the bear\u2019s bloodied mouth, a mock grimace on his face and an apparent bloodstain on his pantleg.",
      "He denied eating a dog after a friend shared a photo with Vanity Fair showing Kennedy dramatically preparing to take a bite of a charred animal; Kennedy said it was a goat.",
      "And a federal law enforcement agency opened an investigation after Kennedy allegedly cut off the head of a dead whale and took it home two decades ago. The National Marine Fisheries Service ended the probe a short time later.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s nomination is certain to be opposed by the pharmaceutical lobby in Washington, which relies on the predictability of FDA\u2019s science-based rules to bring new medicines to market.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s proposals for the agency bear little resemblance to those of prior Republican administrations, which have typically favored cutting regulations to speed up product approvals.",
      "Instead, Kennedy has suggested barring drugmakers from advertising on TV, a multibillion-dollar enterprise that accounts for most of the industry\u2019s marketing dollars. He\u2019s also proposed eliminating fees that drugmakers pay the FDA to review their products, allowing the agency to hire extra scientists to speed up their work. Replacing those funds would require billions in new appropriations from the federal budget.",
      "In a post last month to the social media platform X, Kennedy vowed to end FDA\u2019s \u201caggressive suppression\u201d of a host of unsubstantiated therapies, including psychedelics and stem cells as well as discredited COVID-era drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.",
      "In recent interviews, Kennedy has also suggested clearing out \u201centire departments\u201d at FDA, including the one responsible for nutrition standards.",
      "The Kennedy pick was condemned by public health officials and some congressional Democrats.",
      "\u201cRobert F. Kennedy, Jr., is not remotely qualified for the role and should be nowhere near the science-based agencies that safeguard our nutrition, food safety, and health,\u201d said Dr. Peter Lurie, president of the public health watchdog group Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "But it also won some bipartisan support.",
      "\u201cFinally, someone to detox the place after the Fauci era,\u201d Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, wrote on the social media platform X, referring to Anthony Fauci, the former leading public health official who has been demonized by people opposed to vaccines and the government's response to COVID-19.",
      "Jared Polis, the Democratic governor of Colorado, said he was \u201cexcited\u201d about Kennedy's appointment and said he would shake up HHS and the FDA.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019m most optimistic about is taking on big pharma and the corporate ag oligopoly to improve our health,\u201d Polis wrote on X. Facing backlash, he later added, \u201cScience must remain THE cornerstone of our nation\u2019s health policy.\u201d"

      "Food and beverage manufacturer Kraft Heinz says it's no longer serving the Lunchables meals it created for U.S. schools",
      "Food and beverage manufacturer Kraft Heinz said Tuesday that it no longer is serving the Lunchables meals it created for U.S. schools.",
      "The company introduced the two packaged meals \u2014 one starring pizza and the other a turkey, cheddar cheese and cracker plate \u2014 at the beginning of the 2023-2024 academic year. At the time, Kraft Heinz said the offerings were protein-enriched and contained reduced levels of saturated fat and sodium to meet the requirements of the national free and reduced-price school lunch program.",
      "Nutritionists and advocacy groups were not thrilled by the launch. The Center for Science in the Public Interest called having Lunchables in cafeterias \u201ca highly questionable move for school nutrition\u201d that might confuse families into thinking the versions sold at supermarkets were a healthy option.",
      "The drumbeat quickened in April, when Consumer Reports said its tests showed the school-approved Lunchables contained more sodium than the store varieties. The organization also reported that commercially available Lunchables had more lead compared to ready-made meals made several other companies.",
      "Consumer Reports petitioned the U.S. Department of Agriculture to ban Lunchables and similar processed meal kits from schools.",
      "In a statement, Pittsburgh-based Kraft Heinz attributed the decision to pull out of the market served by the National School Lunch Program to a lack of demand. The company described the business impact as \u201cnegligible,\u201d saying sales of the school-designed meals \u201cwere far less than 1% of overall Lunchables sales\u201d during the last academic year.",
      "\u201cLast year, we brought two NSLP compliant Lunchables options to schools that had increased protein. While many school administrators were excited to have these options, the demand did not meet our targets,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis happens occasionally across our broad portfolio, especially as we explore new sales channels. Lunchables products are not available in schools this year and we hope to revisit at a future date.\u201d",
      "The Kraft Heinz Co. produces a wide range of familiar products, including Capri Sun juice pouches, Oscar Meyer hot dogs, Grey Poupon mustard, Kool-Aid and Philadelphia Cream Cheese."

      "Long before the COVID-19 pandemic, Robert F",
      "Long before the COVID-19 pandemic, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was building up a following with his anti-vaccine nonprofit group, Children\u2019s Health Defense, and becoming one of the world\u2019s most influential spreaders of fear and distrust around vaccines.",
      "Now, President-elect Donald Trump says he will nominate Kennedy to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, which regulates vaccines.",
      "Kennedy has long advanced the debunked idea that vaccines cause autism. He has also pushed other conspiracy theories, such as that COVID-19 could have been \u201cethnically targeted\u201d to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people, comments he later said were taken out of context. He has repeatedly brought up the Holocaust when discussing vaccines and public health mandates.",
      "No medical intervention is risk-free. But doctors and researchers have proven that risks from disease are generally far greater than the risks from vaccines.",
      "Vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective in laboratory testing and in real world use in hundreds of millions of people over decades \u2014 they are considered among the most effective public health measures in history.",
      "Kennedy has insisted that he is not anti-vaccine, saying he only wants vaccines to be rigorously tested, but he also has shown opposition to a wide range of immunizations. Kennedy said in a 2023 podcast interview that \u201cThere\u2019s no vaccine that is safe and effective\u201d and told Fox News that he still believes in the long-ago debunked idea that vaccines can cause autism. In a 2021 podcast he urged people to \u201cresist\u201d CDC guidelines on when kids should get vaccines.",
      "\u201cI see somebody on a hiking trail carrying a little baby and I say to him, better not get them vaccinated,\u201d Kennedy said.",

One, called \u201cCause Unknown,\u201d is built on the false premise that sudden deaths of young, healthy people are spiking due to mass administration of COVID-19 vaccines. Experts say these rare medical emergencies are not new and have not become more prevalent.",

      "New rules require drugmakers to be clearer about explaining the risks and side effects of prescription drugs",
      "WASHINGTON -- Those ever-present TV drug ads showing patients hiking, biking or enjoying a day at the beach could soon have a different look: New rules require drugmakers to be clearer and more direct when explaining their medications' risks and side effects.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration spent more than 15 years crafting the guidelines, which are designed to do away with industry practices that downplay or distract viewers from risk information.",
      "Many companies have already adopted the rules, which become binding Nov. 20. But while regulators were drafting them, a new trend emerged: thousands of pharma influencers pushing drugs online with little oversight. A new bill in Congress would compel the FDA to more aggressively police such promotions on social media platforms.",
      "\u201cSome people become very attached to social media influencers and ascribe to them credibility that, in some cases, they don\u2019t deserve,\u201d said Tony Cox, professor emeritus of marketing at Indiana University.",
      "Still, TV remains the industry's primary advertising format, with over $4 billion spent in the past year, led by blockbuster drugs like weight-loss treatment Wegovy, according to ispot.tv, which tracks ads.",
      "The new rules, which cover both TV and radio, instruct drugmakers to use simple, consumer-friendly language when describing their drugs, without medical jargon, distracting visuals or audio effects. A 2007 law directed the FDA to ensure that drug risk information appears \u201cin a clear, conspicuous and neutral manner.\u201d",
      "FDA has always required that ads give a balanced picture of both benefits and risks, a requirement that gave rise to those long, rapid-fire lists of side effects parodied on shows like \u201c Saturday Night Live.\u201d",
      "But in the early 2000s, researchers began showing how companies could manipulate images and audio to de-emphasize safety information. In one example, a Duke University professor found that ads for the allergy drug Nasonex, which featured a buzzing bee voiced by Antonio Banderas, distracted viewers from listening to side effect information, making it harder to remember.",
      "Such overt tactics have largely disappeared from drug ads.",
      "\u201cIn general, I would say the ads have gotten more complete and transparent,\u201d says Ruth Day, director of the medical cognition lab at Duke University and author of the Nasonex study.",
      "The new rules are \u201csignificant steps forward,\u201d Day said, but certain requirements could also open the door to new ways of downplaying risks.",
      "One requirement instructs companies to show on-screen text about side effects while the audio information plays. A 2011 FDA study found that combining text with audio increased recall and understanding.",
      "But the agency leaves it to companies to decide whether to display a few keywords or a full transcript.",
      "\u201cYou often cannot put all that on the screen and expect people to read and understand it,\u201d Day said. \u201cIf you wanted to hide or decrease the likelihood of people remembering risk information, that could be the way to do it.\u201d",
      "Viewers tend to tune out long lists of warnings and other information. But experts who work with drug companies don\u2019t expect those lists to disappear. While the guidelines describe how the information should be presented, companies still decide the content.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re a company and you\u2019re worried about possible FDA enforcement or product liability and other litigation, all your incentives are to say more, not less,\u201d said Torrey Cope, a food and drug lawyer who advises companies.",
      "Experts also say the new rules will have little effect on the overall tone and appearance of ads.",
      "\u201cThe most salient element of these ads are the visuals, and they are uniformly positive,\u201d said Cox. \u201cEven if the risk message is about, for instance, sudden heart failure, they\u2019re still showing someone diving into a swimming pool.\u201d",
      "The new rules come as Donald Trump's advisers begin floating plans for the FDA and the pharmaceutical industry.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist who has advised the president-elect, wants to eliminate TV drug ads. He and other industry critics point out that the U.S. and New Zealand are the only countries where prescription drugs can be promoted on TV.",
      "Even so, many companies are looking beyond TV and expanding into social media. They often partner with patient influencers who post about managing their conditions, new treatments or navigating the health system.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re teaching people to live a good life with their disease, but then some of them are also paid to advertise and persuade,\u201d said Erin Willis, who studies advertising and media at the University of Colorado Boulder.",
      "Advertising executives say companies like the format because it\u2019s cheaper than TV and consumers generally feel influencers are more trustworthy than companies.",
      "FDA\u2019s requirement for truthful, balanced risk and benefit information applies to drugmakers, leaving a loophole for both influencers and telehealth companies like Hims, Ro and Teledoc, who may not have a direct financial connection to makers of the drugs they\u2019re promoting.",
      "The issue has attracted attention from members of Congress.",
      "\u201cThe power of social media and the deluge of misleading promotions has meant too many young people are receiving medical advice from influencers instead of their health care professional,\u201d Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois and Mike Braun of Indiana wrote the FDA in a February letter.",
      "A recently introduced bill from the senators would bring influencers and telehealth companies clearly under FDA\u2019s jurisdiction, requiring them to disclose risk and side effect information. The bill also would require drugmakers to publicly disclose payments to influencers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s asking the FDA to take a more serious stance with this kind of marketing,\u201d said Willis. \u201cThey know it\u2019s happening, but they could be doing more.\u201d",

      "\u201cThis is a pretty stunning and rapid reversal of drug overdose mortality numbers,\u201d said Brandon Marshall, a Brown University researcher who studies overdose trends.",
      "Overdose death rates began steadily climbing in the 1990s because of opioid painkillers, followed by waves of deaths led by other opioids like heroin and \u2014 more recently \u2014 illicit fentanyl. Provisional data had indicated a slight decline for 2023, and the tally released Wednesday showed that the downward trend has kept going.",

      "One is COVID-19. In the worst days of the pandemic, addiction treatment was hard to get and people were socially isolated \u2014 with no one around to help if they overdosed.",
      "\u201cDuring the pandemic we saw such a meteoric rise in drug overdose deaths that it\u2019s only natural we would see a decrease,\u201d said Farida Ahmad of the CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics.",
      "Still, overdose deaths are well above what they were at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The recent numbers could represent the fruition of years of efforts to increase the availability of the overdose-reversing drug naloxone, and addiction treatments such as buprenorphine, said Erin Winstanley, a University of Pittsburgh professor who researches drug overdose trends.",
      "Marshall said such efforts likely are being aided by money from settlements of opioid-related lawsuits, brought by state, local and Native American governments against drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies. Settlement funds have been rolling out to small towns and big cities across the U.S., and some have started spending the money on naloxone and other measures.",
      "Some experts have wondered about changes in the drug supply. Xylazine, a sedative, has been increasingly detected in illegally manufactured fentanyl, and experts are sorting out exactly how it's affecting overdoses.",
      "In the latest CDC data, overdose death reports are down in 45 states. Increases occurred in Alaska, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington.",
      "The most dramatic decreases were seen in North Carolina and Ohio, but CDC officials voiced a note of caution. Some jurisdictions have had lags in getting death records to federal statisticians \u2014 particularly North Carolina, where death investigations have slowed because of understaffing at the state medical examiner's office. The CDC made estimates to try to account for incomplete death records, but the decline in some places may ultimately turn out not to be as dramatic as initial numbers suggest.",
      "Another limitation of the provisional data is that it doesn't detail what's happening in different groups of people. Recent research noted the overdose deaths in Black and Native Americans have been growing disproportionately larger.",
      "\u201cWe really need more data from the CDC to learn whether these declines are being experienced in all racial ethnic subgroups,\" Marshall said.",

      "Democratic lawmakers who wield control of the Virginia Legislature are hoping to make good on promises made on the campaign trail, including becoming the first Southern state to expand constitutional protections for abortion access",
      "RICHMOND, Va. -- Democrats who control both chambers of the Virginia legislature are hoping to make good on promises made on the campaign trail, including becoming the first Southern state to expand constitutional protections for abortion access.",
      "The House Privileges and Elections Committee advanced three proposed constitutional amendments Wednesday, including a measure to protect reproductive rights. Its members also discussed measures to repeal a now-defunct state constitutional ban on same-sex marriage and ways to revise Virginia's process to restore voting rights for people who served time for felony crimes.",
      "\u201cThis meeting was an important next step considering the moment in history we find ourselves in,\u201d Democratic Del. Cia Price, the committee chair, said during a news conference. \u201cWe have urgent threats to our freedoms that could impact constituents in all of the districts we serve.\u201d",
      "The at-times raucous meeting will pave the way for the House and Senate to take up the resolutions early next year after lawmakers tabled the measures last January. Democrats previously said the move was standard practice, given that amendments are typically introduced in odd-numbered years. But Republican Minority Leader Todd Gilbert said Wednesday the committee should not have delved into the amendments before next year's legislative session. He said the resolutions, particularly the abortion amendment, need further vetting.",
      "\u201cNo one who is still serving remembers it being done in this way ever,\u201d Gilbert said after the meeting. \u201cCertainly not for something this important. This is as big and weighty an issue as it gets.\u201d",
      "The Democrats' legislative lineup comes after Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin, to the dismay of voting-rights advocates, rolled back a process to restore people's civil rights after they completed sentences for felonies. Virginia is the only state that permanently bans anyone convicted of a felony from voting unless a governor restores their rights.",
      "\u201cThis amendment creates a process that is bounded by transparent rules and criteria that will apply to everybody \u2014 it's not left to the discretion of a single individual,\u201d Del. Elizabeth Bennett-Parker, the patron of the voting rights resolution, which passed along party lines, said at the news conference.",
      "Though Democrats have sparred with the governor over their legislative agenda, constitutional amendments put forth by lawmakers do not require his signature, allowing the Democrat-led House and Senate to bypass Youngkin's blessing.",
      "Instead, the General Assembly must pass proposed amendments twice in at least two years, with a legislative election sandwiched between each statehouse session. After that, the public can vote by referendum on the issues. The cumbersome process will likely hinge upon the success of all three amendments on Democrats' ability to preserve their edge in the House and Senate, where they hold razor-thin majorities.",
      "It's not the first time lawmakers have attempted to champion the three amendments. Republicans in a House subcommittee killed a constitutional amendment to restore voting rights in 2022, a year after the measure passed in a Democrat-led House. The same subcommittee also struck down legislation supporting a constitutional amendment to repeal an amendment from 2006 banning marriage equality.",
      "On Wednesday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers voted 16-5 in favor of legislation protecting same-sex marriage, with four Republicans supporting the resolution.",
      "\u201cTo say the least, voters enacted this (amendment) in 2006, and we have had 100,000 voters a year become of voting age since then,\u201d said Del. Mark Sickles, who sponsored the amendment as one of the first openly gay men serving in the General Assembly. \u201cMany people have changed their opinions of this as the years have passed.\u201d",
      "A constitutional amendment protecting abortion previously passed the Senate in 2023 but died in a Republican-led House. On Wednesday, the amendment passed on party lines.",
      "If successful, the resolution proposed by House Majority Leader Charniele Herring would be part of a growing trend of reproductive rights-related ballot questions given to voters. Since 2022, 18 questions have gone before voters across the U.S., and they have sided with abortion rights advocates 14 times.",
      "The voters have approved constitutional amendments ensuring the right to abortion until fetal viability in nine states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Ohio and Vermont. Voters also passed a right-to-abortion measure in Nevada in 2024, but it must be passed again in 2026 to be added to the state constitution.",
      "As lawmakers debated the measure, roughly 18 members spoke. Mercedes Perkins, at 38 weeks pregnant, described the importance of women making decisions about their own bodies. Rhea Simon, another Virginia resident, anecdotally described how reproductive health care shaped her life.",
      "Then all at once, more than 50 people lined up to speak against the abortion amendment.",
      "\u201cLet's do the compassionate thing and care for mothers and all unborn children,\u201d resident Sheila Furey said.",
      "The audience gave a collective \u201cAmen,\u201d followed by a round of applause.",

      "Cases have been detected in 14 states, according to an update from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One person died in Colorado and four people have developed a potentially life-threatening kidney disease complication.",

      "Illnesses were reported between Sept. 12 and Oct. 21. At least seven people who got sick said they ate McDonald's food while traveling.",
      "Slivered onions served on the Quarter Pounders were the likely source of the outbreak, the CDC said. Taylor Farms, a California-based produce grower, recalled onions potentially linked to the outbreak. Tests by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration detected a type of E. coli bacteria that produces a dangerous toxin in one sample of the onions, but it did not match the strain that made people sick, officials reported.",
      "Quarter Pounders were removed from menus in several states during the early days of the outbreak. McDonald's officials said Wednesday that the company identified an alternate supplier for the 900 restaurants that temporarily stopped serving the burgers with onions. Over the past week, those restaurants resumed selling Quarter Pounders with slivered onions.",

      "In 2023, Do No Harm filed a similar federal lawsuit seeking to overturn the state's requirement that one member of the Tennessee Board of Podiatric Medical Examiners must be a racial minority. That suit was initially dismissed by a judge in August but the group has since filed an appeal to the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "Do No Harm is now targeting Tennessee's Board of Medical Examiners, which requires the governor to appoint at least one Black member, and Board of Chiropractic Examiners, which requires one racial minority member.",

      "\u201cWhile citizens may serve on a wide array of boards and commissions, an individual\u2019s candidacy often depends on factors outside his or her control, like age or race,\" the lawsuit states. \"Sadly, for more than thirty-five years, Tennessee governors have been required to consider an individual\u2019s race when making appointments to the state\u2019s boards, commissions, and committees.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the both the medical and chiropractic boards did not immediately return a request for comment on Thursday. Gov.

    "summary": "More than a dozen humanitarian organizations that provide health care to migrants have denounced Italy&rsquo;s migration deal with Albania as a violation of the code of medical ethics",

      "More than a dozen humanitarian organizations that provide health care to migrants have denounced Italy\u2019s migration deal with Albania as a violation of the code of medical ethics",
      "ROME -- More than a dozen humanitarian organizations that provide health care to migrants criticized Italy\u2019s migration deal with Albania on Friday as violating the code of medical ethics, and urged health workers not to cooperate with it.",
      "The deal, the centerpiece of Premier Giorgia Meloni\u2019s crackdown on human trafficking, calls for some male migrants rescued at sea to have their asylum cases processed while they are detained at two holding centers in Albania, a non-EU nation.",
      "Italy, which has long demanded Europe shoulder more of the continent\u2019s migration problem, has held up the deal with Albania as a model for the continent and a strong deterrent to would-be refugees setting out on smugglers\u2019 boats from North Africa for a better life.",
      "But the five-year deal, which is budgeted to cost Italy 670 million euros ($730 million), has run into a series of obstacles and legal challenges that have prevented even a single migrant from being processed in Albania.",
      "First, construction delays prevented the opening of the centers for several months. Then, after the first two batches of 20 men were brought to Albania this month, Italian courts issued rulings that resulted in them being taken to Italy anyway.",
      "The matter is now before the European Union\u2019s Court of Justice in Luxembourg, which has been asked to rule on whether the men come from countries deemed safe for return. All 20 hail from Bangladesh and Egypt.",
      "On Friday, the non-governmental organizations released a detailed analysis of the procedures to screen migrants first on Italian naval ships, and then in the Albanian centers, to determine if they are \u201cvulnerable.\u201d Only men deemed to be not \u201cvulnerable\u201d are to be sent to Albania.",
      "The aid groups said there were no proper facilities or instruments to make such a determination. And regardless, practically everyone who has set off on the dangerous Mediterranean crossing has endured the type of physical, psychological or sexual abuse that should disqualify them from Albanian detention, they said.",
      "The migrants should be considered at risk of post-traumatic stress disorder or other serious physical and mental health consequences, they said.",
      "\u201cThe Italy-Albania Protocol violates the code of medical ethics and human rights and puts the physical and psychological health of migrants at risk,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The groups criticized the international organizations that are apparently cooperating with the project, identifying the International Organization of Migration and the Knights of Malta\u2019s Italian rescue corps as being \u201ccomplicit\u201d in human rights violations.",
      "The Knights of Malta strongly rejected the claim, denying their doctors and nurses were in any way taking part in the \u201cselection\u201d of migrants or where they disembark and said none had participated in the transfer of migrants to Albania. In a statement, the Knights said their medical teams had worked on Italian naval vessels rescuing migrants in the Mediterranean since 2008, providing necessary first aid and said that work continues today unchanged.",
      "The Knights \u201care proud of what has been accomplished in more than 15 years with the coast guard saving human lives at sea and has no intention of stopping this activity which often is the difference between life and death,\u201d the group said.",
      "There was no immediate reply to an email sent to the IOM seeking comment.",
      "The Italian government has said the rights of the migrants would be fully guaranteed in the Albanian centers and the deal has been blessed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen as an example of \u201cout-of-box thinking\u201d to tackle the migration issue. But human rights groups say it sets a dangerous precedent and represents a violation of Italy's obligations under international law.",
      "The U.N. refugee agency has agreed to supervise the first three months of the agreement and one of its teams is conducting an \u201cindependent mission\u201d on board the transfer ship to monitor the screening process.",
      "The legal challenges have come despite the small number of people impacted so far. Even though the centers were built to house as many as 3,000 migrants a month, just 20 were transferred in the first two separate ship passages, only to be sent to Italy after the Rome courts intervened.",
      "The statement was signed by Doctors\u2019 Without Borders, Emergency, Sea-Watch, SOS Mediterranee and other aid groups."

      "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin in what appeared to be the first conversation with the sitting leader of a major Western power in nearly two years",
      "BERLIN -- German Chancellor Olaf Scholz spoke Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin leader\u2019s first publicly announced conversation with the sitting head of a major Western power in nearly two years. Scholz urged Putin to be open to negotiations with Ukraine, his office said.",
      "The Kremlin leader responded that any peace deal should acknowledge Russia's territorial gains and security demands, including that Kyiv renounce joining NATO.",
      "Government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said Scholz urged Putin in the hour-long call to withdraw his troops and end the full-scale invasion launched in February 2022. The conflict will reach its 1,000th day on Tuesday, and exiled Russian opposition leaders, including Alexei Navalny's widow, Yulia, have set an antiwar rally for Sunday in Berlin.",
      "\u201cThe chancellor urged Russia to be willing to negotiate with Ukraine with the aim of achieving a just and lasting peace and stressed Germany\u2019s unwavering determination to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression for as long as necessary,\u201d Hebestreit said in a statement.",
      "The new communication between Scholz and Putin \u2014 their first since December 2022 \u2014 comes at a time of widespread speculation about what the new administration of President-elect Donald Trump will mean for Ukraine. Scholz faces a political crisis at home and has called for a vote of confidence next month, with an early election in February.",
      "Washington has been Ukraine's biggest military backer, but Trump has repeatedly questioned the amount of aid being given to Ukraine. While Trump has suggested he could settle the war quickly, Ukraine has ruled out giving up any territory to Moscow in return for peace.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy criticized Scholz\u2019s call to Putin, calling it \u201ca Pandora\u2019s box\u201d and would only serve to make Russia less isolated.",
      "\u201cNow there may be other conversations, other calls. Just a lot of words. And this is exactly what Putin has wanted for a long time,\u201d Zelenskyy said in his nightly address. \u201cIt is crucial for him to weaken his isolation. ... And to engage in negotiations, ordinary negotiations, that will lead to nothing.\u201d",
      "Scholz condemned Russian air raids on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure and warned that the deployment of North Korean troops to Russia to fight in the war would mark a serious escalation. The U.S., South Korea and Ukraine say North Korea has sent thousands of troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine.",
      "The Kremlin said Germany initiated the call, during which the leaders had a \u201cdetailed and frank exchange of opinions on the situation in Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Putin blamed \u201cthe current crisis\u201d on what he called NATO\u2019s \u201clong-standing aggressive policy aimed at creating an anti-Russian stronghold on Ukrainian territory while ignoring our country\u2019s security interests and trampling on the rights of Russian-speaking residents,\u201d a Kremlin readout said.",
      "Putin also said Russia remains open to resuming peace talks, pointing to conditions he laid out in June that included Kyiv renouncing its bid to join NATO and withdrawing troops from the four Ukrainian regions that Moscow illegally annexed in 2022.",
      "\u201cPossible agreements should take into account the interests of the Russian Federation in the security sphere, proceed from new territorial realities, and most importantly, eliminate the root causes of the conflict,\u201d the readout said.",
      "Putin, who earlier this month said it's up to Western leaders to resume contact with Russia if they want, also noted the \u201cunprecedented degradation\u201d in bilateral relations between Germany and Russia, the Kremlin statement said, while noting that leaders also discussed the situation in the Middle East.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the leaders had a \u201cdetailed\" and \u201cfrank\u201d exchange of opinions but added that \u201dthere is no talk about convergence of opinions.\"",

      "JOHANNESBURG -- The South African government said on Friday it has put together a team including mine rescue experts to come up with a plan to bring to surface illegal miners who remain under a disused gold mine.",
      "The move signaled the government was taking a more conciliatory approach compared to earlier this week, when it said it wouldn't send help to the miners under the disused Stilfontein gold mine in the North West province. Officials have closed entrances to the mineshaft used to bring them food, water and other basic necessities as part of a government strategy to force them to return to the surface and be arrested.",
      "Authorities had said the operation, called \u201cClose the Hole,\u201d would \u201csmoke out\u201d the miners from the mineshaft. There are no official estimates of the numbers of miners remaining in the mine, but police had cited local information and said up to 4,000 may be underground.",
      "But a police spokesperson said on Thursday that they believed the number was exaggerated and maybe be far less than that, estimating a figure of between 350 and 400 miners.",
      "A government delegation led by police minister Senzo Mchunu visited the site of the disused mine on Friday to engage with the community and relatives of the miners who are underground.",
      "While Mchunu insisted that the illegal miners were committing a crime, he said the government also wanted to save their lives.",
      "\u201cWe need a much quicker process, because it is risky and dangerous for them to remain where they are for a longer period,\" Mchunu said.",
      "Mchunu said they had been advised that the mineshaft was 2,500 meters (more than 8,000 feet) deep and that the process to get people out of there was very dangerous. He added that his team was also wary of the fact that the miners may be heavily armed.",
      "A team including mine safety experts, police, the army and various government departments was scheduled to meet Friday to put together a plan, with the mine safety experts expected to do an immediate assessment of the situation.",
      "According to the police, 369 firearms, 10,000 rounds of ammunition, 5 million rand ($275,000) in cash and 32 million rand ($1.75 million) worth of uncut diamonds have been recovered from illegal miners since the government's operation began.",
      "More than 1,000 miners have surfaced at various mines in North West province, with many reported to be weak, hungry and sickly after going for weeks without basic necessities.",
      "Some family members of the illegal miners have pleaded with the government to deploy resources and expertise to get them out, with community members retrieving some miners themselves this week.",
      "A decomposed body believed to be of one of the miners was brought to the surface on Thursday, and police said they were still trying to determine the person's identity and cause of death."

A Lebanese politician said Hezbollah officials had received the draft, were studying it and would express their opinion on it to Berri. The politician, who knows the work of Hezbollah, and the official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media about the ongoing talks.",

      "President Joe Biden praised the cooperation between South Korea, Japan and the U_S_ at countering what he described as North Korea\u2019s \u201cdangerous and destabilizing cooperation with Russia.\u201d",
      "LIMA, Peru -- President Joe Biden on Friday praised the cooperation between South Korea, Japan and the U.S. at countering what he described as North Korea's \u201cdangerous and destabilizing cooperation with Russia.\u201d",
      "Biden spoke at the start of a meeting in Peru with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. The talks came amid heightened concerns about North Korea\u2019s growing military partnership with Russia and Pyongyang\u2019s stepped-up cadence of ballistic missile tests.",
      "Biden celebrated the partnership between Japan and South Korea, two countries that have historical enmity but under Biden's presidency are now tightening security and economic ties as their corner of the world becomes more complicated.",
      "Biden noted that it would be his last meeting with them but that the trilateral partnership should be preserved for years to come.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m proud of how far we\u2019ve come,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWhatever the issue, we\u2019ve taken it on together.\u201d",
      "It comes as North Korea has deployed thousands of troops to Russia to help Moscow try to claw back land in the Kursk border region that Ukraine seized earlier this year.",
      "\u201cAs we can see from the recent deployment of DPRK troops to Russia, the challenging security environment within and outside the region once again reminds us the importance of our trilateral cooperation,\u201d Yoon said, using the initials for North Korea\u2019s formal name and speaking through a translator.",
      "Ishiba also emphasized the importance of the three nations acting as a bulwark against North Korea and pointed to recent military exercises between the three nations as a sign of cooperation.",
      "A three-day exercise in June was geared toward improving joint ballistic missile defense, anti-submarine warfare, surveillance and other skills and capabilities and to help the three countries improve their ability to share missile warnings \u2014 increasingly important as North Korea tests ever-more sophisticated systems.",
      "\u201cI look forward to furthering our partnership in response against North Korea and in many other areas,\u201d Ishiba said through a translator.",
      "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered a series of ballistic missile tests in the lead-up to this month\u2019s U.S. election and is claiming progress on efforts to build capability to strike the U.S. mainland.",
      "White House officials are concerned that Pyongyang could be dialed up for more provocative action ahead of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration and the early days of his administration.",
      "\u201cI do not think we can count on a period of quiet with the DPRK,\u201d said White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan. \u201cThe transitions have historically been time periods when the DPRK has taken provocative actions both before and after the transition from one president to a new president.\u201d",
      "Biden, Yoon, and Ishiba\u2019s conversation largely focused on the growing threat caused by North Korea and Russia\u2019s cooperation, according to a senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private conversations. The official said Trump and how the change in administration might affect the trilateral relationship did not come up.",
      "Biden is on a six-day visit to Latin America for the final major international summits of his presidency, following up APEC with a gathering in Brazil of leaders from the Group of 20 top economies. He's likely to face questions from world leaders about the incoming administration as they turn their attention to what Donald Trump's return to the White House will mean for them.",
      "Biden took part in an informal meeting with other APEC leaders and met with Peru President Dina Boluarte. Biden thanked her for Peru\u2019s efforts to counter drug trafficking and noted the $65 million the U.S. is providing her country over the next five years to assist in that effort, including nine Blackhawk helicopters.",
      "Biden also met one-on-one with Ishiba \u2014 their first in-person since the Japanese prime minister took office on Oct. 1 \u2014 ahead of the three-country meeting focused on North Korea-Russia ties.",
      "The introduction of North Korean troops to the Russia-Ukraine conflict comes as Moscow has seen a favorable shift in momentum. Trump has signaled that he could push Ukraine to agree to give up some land seized by Russia to find an end to the conflict.",
      "Up to 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia, according to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian assessments.",
      "U.S. and South Korean intelligence officials say North Korea also has provided Russia with significant amounts of munitions to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles.",
      "The talks between the U.S., South Korea and Japan follow up on a partnership launched at a historic 2023 meeting at the U.S. presidential retreat at Camp David, Maryland.",
      "Biden nudged Japan and South Korea to put aside years of historic animosity and strengthen economic and security ties as they confront the threat from North Korea and increasing military assertiveness by China in the Pacific.",
      "The three countries signed a pledge agreeing to consult, share information and align their messaging with each other in the face of a threat or crisis.",
      "Sullivan said the Biden administration is working to ensure the three-country cooperation is \u201can enduring feature of American policy.\u201d He expects it would continue under Trump, noting its bipartisan support, but acknowledged it was up to the incoming president\u2019s team.",
      "Both Yoon and Ishiba already have reached out to Trump and are aiming to keep their countries\u2019 relationships with the incoming administration on steady footing amid the heightened tensions.",
      "Just hours before Election Day in the U.S., North Korea fired a barrage of short-range ballistic missiles into the sea.",
      "Those launches came days after Kim supervised a flight test of the country\u2019s newest intercontinental ballistic missile designed to be able to reach the U.S. mainland. In response, the United States flew a long-range B-1B bomber in a trilateral drill with South Korea and Japan on Sunday in a show of force.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea tested exploding drones designed to crash into targets and leader Kim Jong Un called for accelerating mass production of the weapons, state media said Friday.",
      "The country\u2019s latest military demonstration came as the United States, South Korea and Japan engaged in combined military exercises involving advanced fighter jets and a U.S. aircraft carrier in nearby international waters, in a display of their defense posture against North Korea.",
      "North Korea\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency published photos of Kim talking with officials near at least two different types of unmanned aerial vehicles. They included those with X-shaped tails and wings that look similar to the ones the country disclosed in August, when Kim inspected another demonstration of drones that explode on impact.",
      "The drones flew various routes and accurately struck targets, KCNA said. Its images showed what appeared to be a BMW sedan being destroyed and old models of tanks being blown up.",
      "Kim expressed satisfaction with the weapons\u2019 development process and stressed the need to \u201cbuild a serial production system as early as possible and go into full-scale mass production,\u201d noting how drones are becoming crucial in modern warfare.",
      "KCNA paraphrased Kim as saying drones were easy to make at low cost for a range of military activities. The report didn\u2019t say if Kim spoke directly about rival South Korea, which the North Korean drones are apparently designed to target.",
      "North Korea last month accused South Korea of sending its own drones to drop anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets over the North's capital of Pyongyang, and threatened to respond with force if such flights occur again. South Korea\u2019s military has refused to confirm whether or not the North\u2019s claims were true.",
      "Tensions in the region have escalated as Kim flaunts his advancing nuclear and missile program, which includes various nuclear-capable weapons targeting South Korea and intercontinental ballistic missiles that can potentially reach the U.S. mainland.",
      "Kim is also allegedly sending military equipment and troops to Russia to support President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine, which raised concerns in Seoul that he would get Russian technology in return to further develop his arsenal.",
      "In addition to his intensifying nuclear threats, Kim has also engaged in psychological and electronic warfare against South Korea, such as flying thousands of balloons to drop trash in the South and disrupting GPS signals from border areas near the South\u2019s biggest airport.",
      "South Korean officials say North Korea will be a key topic in a trilateral summit between South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, U.S. President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba this week at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings in Peru.",
      "South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met on the margins of the APEC on Thursday and discussed \u201cstrong concerns\u201d over deepening ties between Pyongyang and Moscow, particularly the deployment of North Korean troops to support Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, the U.S. State Department said."

      "Since the Mideast wars began with Hamas\u2019 initial Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, many international airlines have halted, restarted and halted again their flights into Israel\u2019s main gateway to the rest of the world",
      "BEN GURION INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, Israel -- At Israel's Ben Gurion International Airport, more than a year of war has taken its toll. Global airlines have canceled flights, gates are empty and pictures of hostages still held in the Gaza Strip guide the few arriving passengers to baggage claim.",
      "But one check-in desk remains flush with travelers: the one serving flights to the United Arab Emirates, which have kept up a bridge for Israelis to the outside world throughout the war.",
      "The Emirati flights, in addition to bolstering the airlines' bottom line, have shined a light on the countries\u2019 burgeoning ties \u2014 which have survived the wars raging across the Middle East and could be further strengthened as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump prepares to return to office.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a political and economic statement,\u201d said Joshua Teitelbaum, a professor of Middle Eastern studies at Israel\u2019s Bar-Ilan University. \u201cThey are the main foreign airlines that continue to fly.\u201d",
      "Since the wars began with Hamas\u2019 initial Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, many international airlines have halted, restarted and halted again their flights into Israel\u2019s main gateway to the rest of the world. The concern is real for the carriers, who remember the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine 10 years ago and Iran shooting down Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 after takeoff from Tehran in 2020.",
      "But FlyDubai, the sister airline to the long-haul carrier Emirates, has kept up multiple flights daily and kept Israel connected to the wider world even as its other low-cost competitors have stopped flights. Abu Dhabi\u2019s Etihad has continued its flights as well.",
      "While maintaining the flight schedule remains politically important for the UAE after its 2020 diplomatic recognition of Israel, it also provided a further shot in the arm for revenues \u2014 particularly for FlyDubai.",
      "Since the wars started, international carriers such as Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines Inc., Germany\u2019s Lufthansa and other major airlines halted their flights. Some resumed, only to stop again after Iran\u2019s Oct. 1 ballistic missile attack on Israel and Israel\u2019s Oct. 26 retaliatory strike on the Islamic Republic. Tehran has threatened to strike Israel again.",
      "That\u2019s brought major business to Israel's national carrier El Al, which had struggled in the coronavirus pandemic and prior years. The airline posted its best-ever half-year results this year, recording a $227 million profit as compared to $58 million profit in the same period last year. El Al stock has risen by as much 200% over the last year, as compared to a 29% rise in the wider Tel Aviv 125 stock market index.",
      "El Al, however, lacks the routes and connections of major international carriers. Low-cost carriers as well have stopped flying into Israel during periods of the war, sending the price of El Al tickets ever higher. Passenger numbers through Ben Gurion halved compared to the same period the year before, El Al said in its second-quarter financial results.",
      "However, FlyDubai has kept flying. The carrier has operated over 1,800 flights to Israel since October last year, cancelling only 77 flights overall, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics company. In September alone, it flew over 200 flights.",
      "As a line snaked toward the FlyDubai check-in counters at Ben Gurion Airport, UAE-bound Motti Eis said the flights were \"a symbol that the Emirates countries decided to keep the peace.\u201d",
      "FlyDubai declined to answer questions from The Associated Press about the flights.",
      "Etihad, the flag carrier for Abu Dhabi, has kept flying into Tel Aviv, but the number of its flights has been dwarfed by FlyDubai. FlyDubai had 3.6% market share at Ben Gurion, compared to El Al\u2019s 43.2% in the second half of 2024. However, at least two of the foreign low-cost airlines with greater market, Wizz Air and Blue Bird, stopped flying for extended periods this year.",
      "Etihad said it maintains a close watch on the situation in the region, but continues its daily flights to and from Tel Aviv.",
      "\u201cBen Gurion International Airport remains open, employing best practices in safety and security practices, enabling Etihad and other airlines to provide essential air connectivity as long as it is secure to do so,\u201d the airline said in a statement.",
      "But beyond the financial impact, the decision also takes root in the UAE\u2019s decision to recognize Israel in 2020, under agreements brokered by then President Trump known as the Abraham Accords. While Abu Dhabi has repeatedly expressed concern and outrage as Israel\u2019s conduct during the wars, Israel\u2019s Consulate in Dubai and Embassy remain open in the country.",
      "And while Dubai broadly speaking remains focused on business in the country, Abu Dhabi\u2019s focus long has been on its geopolitical aims \u2014 which since the 2011 Arab Spring have been squarely focused on challenging Islamist movements, and those who back them, in the wider region. The UAE, a hereditary autocracy, long has viewed those groups as serious challenges to its power.",
      "The Emirati government, in response to questions from the AP over the flights, sent a story published by its state-run WAM news agency about its participation in a Nov. 1 conference in Riyadh in support of a two-state solution to the decadeslong Israel-Palestinian crisis. The UAE has called repeatedly for a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip, along with the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners.",
      "However, likely given the wider anger in the Arab world over Israel\u2019s devastating militant campaign in Gaza, Dubai International Airport no longer advertises on its electronic billboard the location of the check-in for Tel Aviv. It sits in a distant corner of one of the airport\u2019s terminals, next to a Dubai police stand. Private security guards also keep watch over the line, while individuals who appeared to be undercover police officers watched the gate, a higher level of security than normally noticed at the airport.",
      "But in the lines, Hebrew and Arabic can be heard and those traveling routinely have their blue-backed Israeli passports out in their hands.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a symbol of the UAE\u2019s commitment to the relationship,\u201d said Dina Esfandiary, a senior advisor on the Middle East at the International Crisis Group, a think tank. \u201cNo matter what happens, no matter where the war goes, no matter how much Israel flouts international law, the UAE has decided that this is a step they took, that the relationship remains beneficial to them.\u201d",

      "The Viasna human rights center said that the raids began Thursday, targeting relatives and friends of political prisoners in various cities across the country. They marked an apparent effort to uproot any remaining sign of opposition to Lukashenko, who has been in power for more than 30 years.",

      "Exports grew 1.5%. The weakening yen is a plus for exports, tending to make Japanese products cheaper overseas. But the impact was relatively limited in the latest quarter. The Japanese yen was trading at 160-yen levels earlier this year. It\u2019s now trading at 150-yen levels.",
      "Prior to the last two quarters, the economy contracted 0.6% in the January-March quarter after recording a 0.1% growth in October-December in 2023, highlighting how Japan\u2019s economy recently slipped into periods of contraction in between weak expansion.",

      "He noted winter bonuses many Japanese get in coming months should also help strengthen domestic demand.",
      "As for headwinds, Japan is facing political uncertainty with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba having to survive a runoff this week to remain in office but now facing an emboldened opposition.",
      "Unlike the U.S. and other developed nations grappling with inflationary pressures, Japan struggled with years of deflation, or a continuous cascading down of prices that underlines a fragile economy. Inflation stood at 2.5% in September.",
      "Market watchers are also focused on when the central bank might move next on interest rates. The Bank of Japan kept interest rates at zero or below zero for years to wrest the economy out of deflation but is gradually raising them.",

      "A New York judge has rejected an effort by state regulators to shutter a bitcoin mine over concerns about its greenhouse gas emissions",
      "NEW YORK -- A cryptocurrency plant in central New York can continue operating after a court rejected the state\u2019s effort to shutter the facility over concerns about its climate impact.",
      "The decision was hailed as a victory by Greenidge Generation, a large-scale crypto mine in the Finger Lakes region that has drawn the ire of environmental groups and watchdogs since it began mining bitcoin four years ago.",
      "Like other large-scale crypto-mining operations, Greenidge relies on thousands of electricity-guzzling computer servers that generate bitcoin by solving complex equations. To power those servers, Greenidge uses a former coal-burning plant that was converted to natural gas in 2017 after years of disuse.",
      "In 2022, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation denied a required air permit to the plant on the grounds that its greenhouse gas emissions ran afoul of the state\u2019s ambitious climate goals.",
      "In response to a lawsuit by the corporation, State Supreme Court Justice Vincent M. Dinolfo ruled Thursday that the agency had failed to give Greenidge an opportunity to justify its alleged violation, an \u201cinterpretative error\u201d under the law.",
      "\u201cTransparent political bias lost today,\u201d Greenidge said in a prepared statement. \u201cThe ruling ensures our facility will continue operating and our local employees will not have their careers ripped away by politically motivated governmental overreach that had no basis in law from the first day it began.\u201d",
      "A coalition of environmental groups, meanwhile, allege Greenidge is pumping millions of pounds of carbon dioxide into the air, while contaminating the nearby Seneca Lake with daily discharges of heated water required to run the plant.",
      "\u201cThe Finger Lakes community has been sounding the alarm on the disastrous impacts of this facility on their water, air, and climate,\u201d said Mandy DeRoche, a deputy managing attorney in the Clean Energy Program at Earthjustice. \u201cWe will continue our fight until Greenidge shuts down for good,\u201d",
      "In rejecting the permit, the DEC said the plant had misled regulators about the true purpose of the conversion. \u201cInstead of helping to meet the current electricity needs of the state as originally described, the facility is operating primarily to meet its own significant new energy load,\u201d the agency said in its letter to the company.",
      "A spokesperson for the DEC did not respond to a request for comment about the decision.",
      "Greenidge has said it is in compliance with its permits and that the plant is 100% carbon neutral, thanks to the purchase of carbon offsets such as forestry programs and projects that capture methane from landfills.",
      "Yvonne Taylor, a vice president at Seneca Lake Guardian, said the facility was a test case for the state\u2019s ability to enforce a raft of climate laws. She worried the recent election of Donald Trump, who received billions of dollars from the crypto industry, would further weaken efforts to enforce those protections.",
      "\u201cGreenidge being permitted to continue operating flies in the face of our state climate goals and what we\u2019ve spent generations working for in our community,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt\u2019s not serving any public purpose or benefit other than making a few people who are already rich, richer.\u201d"

      "Jake Paul and Mike Tyson aren't the only ones who have high stakes when they meet in the boxing ring on Friday night.",
      "For Netflix, it is their biggest live sports event to date, and an opportunity to make sure it can handle audience demand with the NFL and WWE on the horizon.",
      "The bout between the YouTuber-turned-boxer Paul, and Tyson, 58-year-old former heavyweight champion, from AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, will stream globally and be available to Netflix's 280 million subscribers at no additional cost.",
      "Netflix will broadcast the bout in English, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, French and German. It was originally scheduled for July 20, but was delayed by Tyson having a medical episode on a plane and needing time to recover from a stomach ulcer.",
      "Netflix declined multiple requests by The Associated Press to make a company executive available to discuss expectations about the fight.",
      "JP Morgan Chase analyst Doug Anmuth has not wavered in his prediction that it will be the most-watched fight ever. That might be an unrealistic bar to climb since four of Muhammad Ali's bouts had estimated worldwide audiences of one billion.",
      "The modern-day U.S. mark of 4.6 million from the 2015 bout between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao could be attainable though.",
      "\u201cWe believe the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight could be the most watched boxing match ever given ease of access and NFLX\u2019s (Netflix's) large global subscriber base, and it should attract Ad Tier subs, viewers, and dollars,\" Anmuth said in his analyst note according to CNBC Pro. \"Netflix is increasingly focused on sports entertainment, events, and shoulder content, and we expect a bigger push into live sports over time, particularly as negotiating leverage shifts in NFLX\u2019s direction.\u201d",
      "Netflix has used live sports as support programming for documentaries and series it airs. \u201cCountdown: Paul vs. Tyson\u201d, a three-part documentary series previewing the fight card, was ranked second Thursday night among Netflix's most-viewed shows.",
      "Last November\u2019s Netflix Cup, where Formula 1 drivers were paired with PGA golfers in a match-play format, brought together famous figures from \u201cDrive to Survive\u201d and \u201cFull Swing,\u201d The March 3 Netflix Slam exhibition match between Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz tied in with \u201cPoint Break\" and a documentary series about Alcaraz that will air next year.",
      "The NFL elected to partner with Netflix for a Christmas Day doubleheader of games because two series \u2014 \u201cQuarterback\u201d and \u201cReceiver\u201d \u2014 were among Netflix\u2019s top 10 series globally.",
      "Most Valuable Promotions is handling the production of Friday's bout while CBS will produce the two NFL games for Netflix. When \u201cRaw\u201d begins airing on Netflix in January, World Wrestling Entertainment handles the production of all its events.",
      "Netflix will carry \u201cRaw\u201d in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and Latin America beginning on Jan. 6, with additional countries to be added as contracts expire. The bigger component, though, is that Netflix will carry all of the company\u2019s shows overseas, including its premium live events like WrestleMania, SummerSlam and Royal Rumble.",
      "\u201cTechnically, it is a great dry run by putting on live events. The biggest problem they might have is you just end up in a situation where you\u2019ve got so much volume and viewing a way that you haven\u2019t had in the past,\u201d said Patrick Crakes, a media consultant and former Fox Sports executive. \u201cIt could end up being more than who watches the NFL games for a period of time. Others are handling the production, what they have to worry about is the operational flow. They know what they are doing.\u201d",

      "Croatia has had severe problems with systemic and political corruption. Among the 27 European Union member countries, it is generally ranked by international anti-graft groups as one of the most corrupt states.",
      "The EPPO statement said that five of the suspects between June 2022 and Nov. 2024 \u201cteamed up\u201d to secure undue financial gains for two companies by promising and giving monetary rewards to relevant stakeholders.",
      "\u201cTheir goal was to ensure that one of the companies was allowed to sell medical robotic devices for several hospitals in Croatia,\u201d the statement added. The group was also suspected of offering bribes to manipulate the public procurement process and exclude market competition in favor of that company.",
      "\u201cOther suspects offered and handed over bribes to several relevant stakeholders in the public health system, including the minister of health and the directors of two hospitals, to gain their support for different contracts\" funded by the EU or Croatia's national budget, said the EPPO statement.",

      "The EPPO stated that they suspected Bero\u0161 of receiving bribes, while Turudi\u0107 said Croatian investigators are accusing him of the lesser crime of \u201cinfluence peddling.\""

      "The state Public Service Commission voted unanimously to approve a siting permit for Summit Carbon Solutions' modified, 333-mile route in North Dakota. The company's proposed $8 billion, 2,500-mile pipeline system would carry tons of planet-warming CO2 emissions from 57 ethanol plants in five states for storage deep underground in North Dakota.",
      "No construction has begun anywhere on Summit\u2019s proposed route. Iowa has approved the project, but other hurdles remain in North Dakota as well as South Dakota, Minnesota and Nebraska.",
      "The approval is a win for the company after North Dakota initially denied a permit in 2023, shortly followed by rejection in South Dakota. Another company, Navigator CO2 Ventures, canceled its project around the same time due to the \u201cunpredictable nature of the regulatory and government processes involved, particularly in South Dakota and Iowa.\"",
      "Supporters cheer carbon capture projects as a way to combat climate change, with lucrative federal tax credits available for such efforts. The ethanol industry sees Summit's project opening up sustainable aviation fuel markets, a boost for ethanol and No. 1 corn producer Iowa.",

Doug Burgum, now President-elect Donald Trump's choice for Interior Secretary, a position with wide influence over natural resources, has touted his state's underground CO2 storage potential as a \u201cgeologic jackpot.\u201d Carbon-capture skeptics say the technology is untested at scale and allows the fossil-fuel industry to continue largely unchanged.",
      "Summit opponents, including many landowners across the Midwest, decry the potential of a pipe rupture releasing hazardous, heavy CO2 gas to flow over the land, endangering people's health and lives. They also fear the taking of their land through eminent domain.",
      "North Dakota Public Service Commission Chairman Randy Christmann urged Summit not to use eminent domain, \u201cat least not more than absolutely necessary.\u201d Eminent domain is not in the panel's jurisdiction or a part of the siting process, he said.",

      "In a statement, landowner attorney Brian Jorde said, \u201cNo surprise on the decision. We need to analyze the written decision. Like in Iowa, the courts will sort this out and ultimately decide if the PSC decision will stand or be reversed.\"",
      "In August, the Iowa Utilities Commission issued Summit a hazardous liquid pipeline permit after approving the company's application in June. The panel also granted Summit the right of eminent domain over numerous parcels of land.",
      "But the company cannot start construction in Iowa until it has route approvals from both Dakotas and approval for underground storage in North Dakota, among other requirements. The Iowa panel's decision sparked lawsuits in opposition.",
      "Christmann said the North Dakota permit has no restrictions based on what any other states do.",
      "The North Dakota panel had denied Summit a siting permit in August 2023. The regulators said Summit hadn't sufficiently addressed several issues, including geologic instability, wildlife areas, cultural resource impacts and some landowner concerns.",
      "Soon afterward, the panel agreed to reconsider, beginning more than a year of meetings and document filings.",
      "Summit submitted three storage facility permit applications to North Dakota\u2019s Department of Mineral Resources, but no decision has been made.",
      "In 2022, Minnkota Power Cooperative and Summit agreed to collaborate on developing CO2 storage in central North Dakota, a pact that also lets Summit use Minnkota's previously permitted 100-million-ton underground storage.",
      "In September 2023, South Dakota's Public Utilities Commission denied Summit's permit application after commission staff said the route would violate county ordinances for setback distances. Summit has said it plans to reapply this month for a permit.",

      "Austria's chancellor says Russia\u2019s state-owned natural gas company Gazrom will cut off supplies early Saturday to Austrian utility OMV",
      "VIENNA -- Russia\u2019s state-owned natural gas company Gazprom will cut off supplies to Austria\u2019s OMV utility early Saturday, Austria\u2019s chancellor said, adding that his country\u2019s underground gas storage was full and that it had alternative, non-Russia supplies.",
      "The cutoff follows OMV\u2019s announcement that it would stop paying for Gazprom gas to its Austrian arm to offset a 230 million-euro ($242 million) arbitration award it won over an earlier cutoff of gas to its German subsidiary.",
      "Chancellor Karl Nehammer said Friday that Austria has a secure supply of alternative fuel and that \u201cno one will freeze this winter, no home will be cold.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur gas storage facilities are full and we have sufficient capacity to obtain gas from other regions,\" Nehammer said in a hastily called appearance at the chancellery. \u201cWe cannot be blackmailed.\u201d",
      "OMV gave notice of the cutoff in a trading statement on the Central European Gas Hub website. An OMV spokesperson couldn't be reached for comment. Gazprom had no immediate comment.",
      "Russia cut off most natural gas supplies to Europe in 2022, citing disputes over payment in rubles, a move European leaders described as energy blackmail over their support for Ukraine against Russia's invasion. The cutoff sent gas prices soaring and contributed to a sharp burst of inflation that went into double digits in October 2022, but has since subsided.",
      "European governments had to scramble to line up alternative supplies at higher prices, much of it liquefied natural gas brought by ship from the U.S. and Qatar.",
      "Still, three European countries \u2014 Austria, Slovakia and Hungary \u2014 have been getting supplies of Russian gas through a pipeline through Ukraine despite the fighting there. Ukraine has said it won't continue gas transit past Jan. 1, leaving those countries looking for other supplies. Austria gets the bulk of its natural gas from Russia, as much as 98% in December 2023, according to Energy Minister Lenore Gewessler.",
      "The European Union has ended most supplies of Russian oil, but hasn't directly sanctioned Russian gas. Instead, it has set a nonbinding goal of 2027 for member countries to stop importing Russian gas. Oil and gas exports and the associated tax revenues are the most important single source of cash for the Kremlin.",
      "In 1968, Austria became the first Western European country to import gas from the Soviet Union, and its dependence on Russian energy increased in the following decades. During a visit by Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin to Austria in 2018, an agreement for the extension of natural gas supplies to Austria until 2040 was signed by Gazprom head Alexey Miller and Rainer Seele, then chairman of the OMV Executive Board. The contract obligates the Austrian side to pay for the gas whether it takes delivery or not.",
      "Gewessler convened a commission to look into the circumstances under which it was signed and legal possibilities to get out of it.",

      "The South African government says it has put together a team including mine rescue experts to come up with a plan to bring to surface illegal miners who remain under a disused gold mine",
      "JOHANNESBURG -- The South African government said on Friday it has put together a team including mine rescue experts to come up with a plan to bring to surface illegal miners who remain under a disused gold mine.",
      "The move signaled the government was taking a more conciliatory approach compared to earlier this week, when it said it wouldn't send help to the miners under the disused Stilfontein gold mine in the North West province. Officials have closed entrances to the mineshaft used to bring them food, water and other basic necessities as part of a government strategy to force them to return to the surface and be arrested.",
      "Authorities had said the operation, called \u201cClose the Hole,\u201d would \u201csmoke out\u201d the miners from the mineshaft. There are no official estimates of the numbers of miners remaining in the mine, but police had cited local information and said up to 4,000 may be underground.",
      "But a police spokesperson said on Thursday that they believed the number was exaggerated and maybe be far less than that, estimating a figure of between 350 and 400 miners.",
      "A government delegation led by police minister Senzo Mchunu visited the site of the disused mine on Friday to engage with the community and relatives of the miners who are underground.",
      "While Mchunu insisted that the illegal miners were committing a crime, he said the government also wanted to save their lives.",
      "\u201cWe need a much quicker process, because it is risky and dangerous for them to remain where they are for a longer period,\" Mchunu said.",
      "Mchunu said they had been advised that the mineshaft was 2,500 meters (more than 8,000 feet) deep and that the process to get people out of there was very dangerous. He added that his team was also wary of the fact that the miners may be heavily armed.",
      "A team including mine safety experts, police, the army and various government departments was scheduled to meet Friday to put together a plan, with the mine safety experts expected to do an immediate assessment of the situation.",
      "According to the police, 369 firearms, 10,000 rounds of ammunition, 5 million rand ($275,000) in cash and 32 million rand ($1.75 million) worth of uncut diamonds have been recovered from illegal miners since the government's operation began.",
      "More than 1,000 miners have surfaced at various mines in North West province, with many reported to be weak, hungry and sickly after going for weeks without basic necessities.",
      "Some family members of the illegal miners have pleaded with the government to deploy resources and expertise to get them out, with community members retrieving some miners themselves this week.",
      "A decomposed body believed to be of one of the miners was brought to the surface on Thursday, and police said they were still trying to determine the person's identity and cause of death."

      "Americans stepped up their spending at retailers last month in the latest sign that healthy consumer spending is driving the economy\u2019s steady growth",
      "WASHINGTON -- Americans stepped up their spending at retailers last month in the latest sign that healthy consumer spending is driving the economy's steady growth.",
      "Retail sales rose 0.4% from September to October, the Commerce Department said Friday, a solid increase though less than the previous month's robust 0.8% gain.",
      "A 1.6% jump in sales at auto dealers drove much of the gain. Purchases climbed 2.3% at electronics and appliances stores and 0.7% at restaurants and bars. Though some of October's rise in retail sales reflected higher prices, it mainly indicated increased purchases.",
      "Sales in some categories fell \u2014 furniture stores, clothing outlets and drug stores, among them \u2014 though economists said that weakness likely resulted, at least in part, from last month's hurricanes. Sales at home and garden stores rose, potentially reflecting rebuilding activity after the storms.",
      "\u201cThe moderation in the pace of price growth is allowing consumers to ratchet up spending,\u201d said Tim Quinlan, an economist at Wells Fargo. \u201cPeople may not love how much it costs to go out to eat, but their bar and restaurant spending is growing faster than prices are.\u201d",
      "Friday\u2019s report arrives as retailers are poised to enter the critically important holiday shopping season in less than two weeks. Analysts envision a solid holiday shopping season, though perhaps not as robust as last year\u2019s, with many shoppers under pressure from overall still-high prices despite the easing of inflation.",
      "The latest retail sales figures suggest that the economy is growing briskly again in the current October-December quarter, after having expanded at a sturdy 2.8% annual rate in the previous quarter. Since peaking at 9.1% more than two years ago, inflation has sunk to 2.6%, not far above pre-pandemic levels. And Americans' take-home pay, on average, has surpassed inflation for about 18 months.",
      "Still, the post-pandemic inflation spike has left prices about 20% higher than they were three years ago and dimmed Americans' outlook on the economy. That was a key reason why Donald Trump was able to capitalize on public discontent with the Biden-Harris administration and recapture the White House in last week's election.",
      "Despite high price levels, though, Trump inherits an economy in which spending is strong, growth is solid and unemployment low.",
      "Other recent economic reports have also pointed to a healthy economy. In a sign that households, whose purchases drive most of the economy, will continue spending, the Conference Board\u2019s most recent consumer confidence index posted its biggest monthly gain since 2021. The proportion of consumers who expect a recession in the next 12 months dropped to its lowest point since the board first posed that question in 2022.",
      "One cautionary note is that grocery-store sales barely rose last month, a sign that many Americans may still be struggling to adapt to food prices that are still much higher than they were three years ago.",
      "Lorraine Thompson, who was food shopping this week at a Walmart in Secaucus, New Jersey, said she\u2019s not noticing any slowdown in inflation.",
      "\u201cEverything is high,\" she said. \u201cThe meat, the cheese.\u201d",
      "Thompson said she\u2019s been buying less cheese and has been food shopping more at Walmart because she thinks the prices there are lower than at other supermarkets.",
      "The National Retail Federation has predicted that shoppers will increase their spending in November and December by between 2.5% and 3.5% over the same period a year ago. During the 2023 holiday shopping season, spending had surged by a stronger 3.9% from 2022.",
      "Some retailers say they expect consumers to spend more freely in the coming months. Affirm, a buy-now, pay-later company that has been expanding as more consumers seek online installment loans, last week reported that growth in its active consumers accelerated for a third straight quarter to nearly 20 million.",
      "\u201cEverything we see suggests the consumer feels like they want to be out spending,\u201d Michael Linford, Affirm\u2019s chief operating officer, told The Associated Press.",
      "Analysts will be dissecting quarterly results next week from Walmart and Target, among others, to gauge how shoppers are navigating still-high prices and to assess their mood after a presidential race that pivoted in large part on voters' discontent with the economy.",
      "One of the first major retailers to report fiscal third quarter earnings was Home Depot, which continues to grapple with a pullback in spending from customers. But the retrenchment was less severe than in the past, and its performance beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations.",
      "Home Depot\u2019s CEO Edward Decker said that Trump's proposed high tariffs on imports, if implemented, would intensify pressure on the company. But he added that Home Depot sources well more than half its goods domestically and elsewhere in North America.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump said Friday that North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Trump\u2019s choice to head the Interior Department, will also head a newly created National Energy Council that will seek to establish U.S. \u201cenergy dominance\u201d around the world",
      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump announced Friday that North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, his choice to head the Interior Department, will also lead a newly created National Energy Council that will seek to establish U.S. \u201cenergy dominance\u201d around the world.",
      "Burgum, in his new role, will oversee a panel that crosses all executive branch agencies involved in energy permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation and transportation, Trump said in a statement. As chairman of the National Energy Council, Burgum will have a seat on the National Security Council, Trump said.",
      "\u201cThis Council will oversee the path to U.S. ENERGY DOMINANCE by cutting red tape, enhancing private sector investments across all sectors of the Economy, and by focusing on INNOVATION over longstanding, but totally unnecessary, regulation,\" Trump wrote.",
      "The Republican president-elect accused the \u201cradical left\u201d of engaging in a war on American energy, in the name of fighting climate change. His policy of energy dominance, which he also espoused during his first term, will allow the U.S. to sell oil, gas and other forms of energy to European allies, making the world safer, Trump said.",
      "Trump's policies, if adopted, would represent a near-complete reversal from actions pursued by Democratic President Joe Biden, who has made fighting climate change a top priority and has pushed for more electric vehicles and stricter regulation of carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants. Trump has pledged to rescind unspent funds in Biden\u2019s landmark climate and health care bill and stop offshore wind development when he returns to the White House in January.",
      "Trump, who has called oil \u201cliquid gold,\" said oil and natural gas, along with minerals such as lithium and copper, should be exploited to the maximum extent possible. \u201cWe will \u201cDRILL BABY DRILL,\" expand ALL forms of Energy production to grow our Economy, and create good-paying jobs,\" Trump wrote.",
      "Speaking to reporters at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort before his selection as interior secretary was announced Thursday night, Burgum said he and Trump are concerned about \u201cthe nexus between energy and inflation and the nexus between energy and national security.\"",
      "\u201cEnergy is a component of everything \u2014 it\u2019s the clothes you wear, the food you eat,\" Burgum said, adding that the U.S. needs to boost electricity production to meet increased demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.",
      "\u201cThe AI battle affects everything from defense to healthcare to education to productivity as a country,\u2033 Burgum said, referring to artificial intelligence. \u201cAnd the AI that\u2019s coming in the next 18 months is going to be revolutionary. So there\u2019s just a sense of urgency and a sense of understanding in the Trump administration\u2033 to address it.",
      "Burgum, 68, was elected North Dakota governor in 2016, his first campaign for elected office. A former software executive, he led Great Plains Software, which Microsoft acquired for $1.1 billion in 2001. Burgum has also led other companies in real estate development and venture capital.",
      "Burgum, a Republican, has taken a pro-business style as governor of a state where agriculture and oil are the main industries. He\u2019s pushed income tax cuts, reduced regulations, and changes to animal agriculture laws and higher education governance. Burgum also emphasized a \u201cdata-driven\u201d approach to governing, advocated for a Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library in the state and prioritized engagement with tribal nations.",
      "He ran for president in 2023, but dropped out after his bid failed to resonate. He later endorsed Trump.",
      "Industry groups welcomed Burgum to the new administration and said Trump's creation of an energy council signaled renewed emphasis on spurring domestic production and streamlining regulations.",
      "Burgum's \u201cdeep understanding of American energy resources and public lands positions him to tackle critical issues such as enhancing energy affordability ... and strengthening the U.S. in the global energy marketplace,\" said Erik Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, which promotes offshore drilling. Milito is a former vice president of the American Petroleum Institute, the industry's top lobbying group.",
      "David Seabrook, president of The Wilderness Society, called Burgum \u201ca longtime friend to fossil fuel interests\" who played a role in an April event at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort where Trump reportedly asked industry leaders and lobbyists to donate $1 billion to his campaign, with the expectation that he would curtail environmental regulations if re-elected.",
      "\u201cThe first Trump administration treated (public lands) like they\u2019re meant to be dug up, drilled or sold off for profit,\" Seabrook said. \u201cGov. Burgum\u2019s long track record of pushing for unchecked fossil fuel development sends a loud signal about which path they will take this time around.\"",
      "Later Friday, Trump named his campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt to serve as his White House press secretary. The 27-year-old Leavitt would be the youngest White House press secretary in history.",
      "Earlier, Trump announced that Steven Cheung will serve as his White House communications director and Sergio Gor will run the personnel office. Both are longtime advisers.",
      "Cheung led communications for Trump's latest campaign, where he gained a reputation for combative and insulting attacks on the Republican's opponents. A native of Sacramento, California, he worked in Republican politics and for the Ultimate Fighting Championship before joining Trump\u2019s team in 2016.",
      "Gor ran Winning Team Publishing, which he started with Donald Trump Jr. The company has published books by Trump and his allies. Gor also led the super PAC Right for America.",
      "And late Friday night, during a Conservative Political Action Conference event at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, the president-elect asked Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley to remain in the role, according to a person in the room who spoke anonymously to share details of a private event.",

The reality is this ban, if implemented, is just kicking the can down the road for when a young person goes on social media,\u201d Leo added.",
      "Leo has been applauded for his work online. He was a finalist in his home state Victoria's nomination for the Young Australian of the Year award, which will be announced in January.

There are so many different harms for them to try and manage and kids just don\u2019t have the skills or the life experience to be able to manage those well,\u201d Sonya Ryan said.",
      "\u201cThe result of that is we\u2019re losing our kids. Not only what happened to Carly, predatory behavior, but also we\u2019re seeing an alarming rise in suicide of young people,\u201d she added.",
      "Sonya Ryan is part of a group advising the government on a national strategy to prevent and respond to child sexual abuse in Australia.",
      "She wholeheartedly supports Australia setting the social media age limit at 16.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to get this perfect,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to make sure that there are mechanisms in place to deal with what we already have which is an anxious generation and an addicted generation of children to social media.\"",
      "A major concern for social media users of all ages is the legislation\u2019s potential privacy implications.",
      "Age estimation technology has proved inaccurate, so digital identification appears to be the most likely option for assuring a user is at least 16.",
      "Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner, an office that describes itself as the world\u2019s first government agency dedicated to keeping people safer online, has suggested in planning documents adopting the role of authenticator. The government would hold the identity data and the platforms would discover through the commissioner whether a potential account holder was 16.",
      "Tama Leaver, professor of internet studies at Curtin University, fears that the government will make the platforms hold the users\u2019 identification data instead.",
      "The government has already said the onus will be on the platforms, rather than on children or their parents, to ensure everyone meets the age limit.",
      "\u201cThe worst possible outcome seems to be the one that the government may be inadvertently pushing towards, which would be that the social media platforms themselves would end up being the identity arbiter,\u201d Leaver said.",
      "\u201cThey would be the holder of identity documents which would be absolutely terrible because they have a fairly poor track record so far of holding on to personal data well,\u201d he added.",
      "The platforms will have a year once the legislation has become law to work out how the ban can be implemented.",
      "Ryan, who divides her time between Adelaide in South Australia and Fort Worth, Texas, said privacy concerns should not stand in the way of removing children from social media.",
      "\u201cWhat is the cost if we don\u2019t? If we don\u2019t put the safety of our children ahead of profit and privacy?\u201d she asked.",

      "A battery manufacturer has selected Kentucky for a nearly $712 million project to produce industrial-sized batteries used to store and distribute energy",
      "FRANKFORT, Ky. -- A battery manufacturer has selected Kentucky for a nearly $712 million project to produce industrial-sized batteries used to store and distribute energy, a process seen as increasingly important to help secure a reliable electric grid for the country, officials said Friday.",
      "The Shelbyville Battery Manufacturing plant will employ 1,572 workers once the project reaches full capacity, deepening Kentucky's ties to emerging battery technologies. Companies wanting to make batteries to power vehicles have announced projects expected to total nearly $12 billion in new investments and create more than 10,280 fulltime jobs in Kentucky.",
      "\u201cWith this investment, we\u2019re putting our stamp on working to become just the battery capital of the United States,\u201d Gov. Andy Beshear said in announcing the new project to be located in Shelbyville.",
      "Production at the Shelbyville battery plant is expected to begin in late 2025.",
      "The plant, a part of Canadian Solar Inc., will produce batteries used by utilities and other customers to store energy at large scale. The batteries are about 20 feet long, 8 feet wide and nearly 9 feet tall, the company said. They can be paired with solar, wind or other forms of electricity generation and are seen as playing a crucial role for both a green energy future and a secure power grid as demand for electricity continues to grow in the U.S.",
      "The batteries can keep a steady flow of power when sources like wind and solar are not producing. For example, when people are sleeping and thus using less electricity, the energy produced from wind blowing through the night can be stored in batteries \u2014 and used when demand is high during the day.",
      "\u201cEnergy storage is a crucial part of the new and evolving electricity grid,\" said Shawn Qu, chairman and CEO of Canadian Solar. \"Battery cells are the heart of a utility-scale energy storage system. This project will put Kentucky at the center of the effort to build a robust and secure electricity grid for this country.\u201d",
      "Canadian Solar has a global presence in the design and production of battery energy storage systems for utility-scale applications. Kentucky's ties to the company will only strengthen the Bluegrass State's role in the energy sector, Beshear said.",
      "For centuries, Kentucky coal helped power the nation. Now, the Shelbyville plant will produce batteries used across the country to help ensure a reliable flow of electricity for consumers, Beshear said.",
      "\u201cThis is energy security for the United States,\" the governor said. \"It\u2019s in our national security. And this company choosing to do it in Kentucky means we\u2019re going to be a part of providing that security for the entire country\u2019s infrastructure and in the grid.\u201d",
      "The battery factory will be the largest economic development project in Shelby County's history and ranks as the third-largest jobs project announced during Beshear's nearly five-year tenure as governor.",
      "Shelbyville Mayor Troy Ethington called the project a milestone for his community, located just east Louisville. It will become Shelby County's largest employer, creating new opportunities for residents, he said. The company said it is committed to hiring locally to fill the jobs. The Shelbyville facility also will include a research and development lab to help advance battery technology, the company said.",
      "\u201cThis investment ensures more Kentucky families will thrive, and that the commonwealth\u2019s incredible economic momentum continues,\u201d Beshear said.",
      "State officials offered a package of performance-based tax incentives for the battery project, tied to the company's investment, job creation and employee wages, the state said."

      "NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks tumbled Friday as the \u201cTrump bump\u201d  that Wall Street got from last week\u2019s presidential election, along with a cut to interest rates  by the Federal Reserve, kept fading.",
      "The S&P 500 dropped 1.3% for its worst day since before Election Day to close out a losing week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 305 points, or 0.7%, and the Nasdaq composite sank 2.2%.",
      "Makers of vaccines helped drag the market down after President-elect Donald Trump said he wants Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent anti-vaccine activist, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Moderna tumbled 7.3%, and Pfizer fell 4.7% amid concerns about a possible hit to profits.",
      "Kennedy still needs confirmation from the Senate to get the job, and some analysts are skeptical about his chances. \u201cHowever, if Kennedy is confirmed, it is hard to bookend risks for investors as his views are so outside the traditional Republican health policy orthodoxy,\u201d Raymond James analyst Chris Meekins wrote in a research note. Meekins is a former deputy assistant secretary at the department known as HHS.",
      "\u201cInvestors may need to forget everything they thought they knew about Republicans and healthcare,\u201d Meekins said. \u201cKennedy\u2019s appointment may make it less likely traditional qualified experienced (Republican) staff will agree to join HHS, creating more uncertainty.\u201d",
      "Biotech stocks broadly sank to some of the market\u2019s worst losses, but the sharpest drop in the S&P 500 came from Applied Materials. It fell 9.2% even though it reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.",
      "The provider of manufacturing equipment and services to the semiconductor industry gave a forecasted range for upcoming revenue whose midpoint was short of analysts\u2019 expectations.",
      "The pressure is on companies to deliver big growth, in part because their stock prices have been rising so much faster than their earnings. That\u2019s made the broad stock market look more expensive by a range of measures, which has critics calling for at least a fade. The S&P 500 is still up 23% for the year and not far from its all-time high set on Monday, despite this past week\u2019s weakness.",
      "Stocks had been broadly roaring since Election Day, when Trump\u2019s victory sent a jolt through financial markets worldwide. Investors immediately began sending up stocks of banks, smaller U.S. companies and cryptocurrencies as they laid bets  on the winners coming out of Trump\u2019s preference for higher tariffs, lower tax rates and lighter regulation.",
      "But investors are also taking into account some of the potential downsides from Trump\u2019s return to the White House.",
      "Besides Friday\u2019s hit to vaccine makers, Treasury yields have been climbing on both the economy\u2019s surprising resilience and worries that Trump\u2019s policies could spur bigger U.S. government deficits and faster inflation.",
      "That\u2019s forced traders to recalibrate how much relief the Federal Reserve could provide for the economy next year through cuts to interest rates. The Fed earlier this month lowered its main interest rate for the second time this year, and past forecasts indicated Fed officials saw more cuts as likely through 2025.",
      "Lower interest rates can act as fuel for the economy and stock market, but they can also put upward pressure on inflation.",
      "On Thursday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested the U.S. central bank may be cautious about future decisions on interest rates. \u201cThe economy is not sending any signals that we need to be in a hurry to lower rates,\u201d Powell said, though he declined to discuss how Trump\u2019s potential policies could alter things.",
      "Traders have since ratcheted back forecasts for whether the Fed will cut rates again at its meeting next month, though they still see better than a coin flip\u2019s chance of it, according to data from CME Group.",
      "On Friday, Treasury yields edged down in the bond market after swinging following several reports on the economy.",
      "One showed shoppers spent more at U.S. retailers  last month than expected, another signal that the most influential force on the economy remains solid.",
      "\u201cMany consumers were reporting that they were putting off trips and big ticket item purchases until after the election,\u201d according to Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \u201cMany businesses reported they were putting off capital investment due to the election. Now that the uncertainty of the outcome is behind us, we could see some decent \u2018relief spending.\u2019\u201d",
      "Friday\u2019s data on retail sales, though, may not be quite as strong as it appeared. After taking away purchases of automobiles, sales at retailers were weaker last month than economists expected.",
      "The 10-year Treasury\u2019s yield held at 4.44%, where it was late Thursday, after swinging up and down. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, fell to 4.31% from 4.36% late Thursday.",
      "All told, the S&P 500 fell 78.55 points to 5,870.62. The Dow dropped 305.87 to 43,444.99, and the Nasdaq sank 427.53 to 18,680.12.",
      "In stock markets abroad, London\u2019s FTSE 100 fell 0.1% after data from the Office for National Statistics showed economic growth slowed to 0.1% in the July-September quarter from the 0.5% in the previous quarter. It was weaker than expected.",

      "Mexico's president has lashed out at Moody\u2019s ratings service after it downgraded the Mexican government\u2019s debt outlook to \u201cnegative.\u201d",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico\u2019s president lashed out Friday at Moody\u2019s ratings service, after it downgraded the Mexican government\u2019s debt outlook to \u201cnegative.\u201d",
      "Moody\u2019s said it had downgraded the government's debt outlook from \u201cstable\u201d to \u201cnegative\u201d because newly approved laws in Mexico could weaken the judiciary branch and checks and balances. It reaffirmed Mexico\u2019s Baa2 overall credit rating, but said increased government debt represented a risk for Mexico.",
      "It also mentioned the possibility that the government will have to transfer more money to shore up the highly indebted state-owned oil company, Pemex.",
      "\u201cDeteriorating debt affordability and further government spending rigidity make fiscal consolidation challenging, following this year\u2019s widening in the government deficit,\u201d Moody\u2019s wrote, \u201ca deviation from a longstanding track record of low deficits regardless of economic pressures.\u201d",
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum said that ratings agencies often have a \u201cbias of origin\u201d against the economic policies her party adopted under former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who took office on Dec. 1, 2018.",
      "\u201cMany times these ratings agencies are aimed at issuing evaluations starting from an economic model,\u201d Sheinbaum said. \u201cStarting in 2018, the economic model in our country changed. Many times these ratings have this bias of origin.\u201d",
      "Under L\u00f3pez Obrador, who was Sheinbaum's political mentor, the government began transferring large amounts of money to the state-run oil company, started large building projects and implemented cash handout programs. That led to federal budget deficits of about 6% of Mexico's gross domestic product in 2024.",
      "Sheinbaum ruled out enacting new taxes next year and said she would rely on increasing tax collection from existing sources. But in the 2025 federal budget submitted by her administration to Congress on Friday, it was clear that sizable budget deficits would continue for some time.",
      "Mexico's treasury department said it would aim to reduce the deficit to 3.9% of GDP in 2025, but it was unclear if it could achieve that: L\u00f3pez Obrador left behind a lot of unfinished train and oil refinery projects, and Sheinbaum has expanded benefit programs for the elderly.",
      "\u201cThe government will only gradually narrow the deficit in coming years,\u201d Moody's wrote.",
      "The 2025 budget says Mexico's outstanding federal debts would finish 2025 at around 51.4% of GDP. But that doesn't include a lot of government oil company and pensions debts. It also predicted the economy would grow by between 2 and 3% in 2025, something analysts say is optimistic, given that Mexico's GDP grew by only 1.5% in the third quarter of 2024.",
      "The government is also expecting the exchange rate to improve to 18.70 pesos to $1 and inflation to fall to 3.5%, both of which also seem highly optimistic. The Mexican peso has dropped in value to about 20.40 to $1 in recent days.",
      "The election of Donald Trump in the United States may also weigh on Mexico's economy, given his past threats to close the border and impose tariffs.",
      "Moody's said Mexico has been benefitting from \u201cnearshoring\u201d investments by companies seeking to move production closer to the U.S. market.",
      "But it noted \u201cadditional downside risks to investment dynamics could emerge ahead of the revision of United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) in 2026, particularly if modifications to the agreement\u2019s rule of origins, labor specifications and other US trade policies towards Mexico changed in a way that durably limit the country\u2019s exports.\u201d",
      "\u201cLower economic growth and, consequently, government revenue would undermine fiscal consolidation efforts,\u201d it continued.",
      "Perhaps most importantly, Sheinbaum has continued L\u00f3pez Obrador's push to implement changes to the judiciary that will make all federal judges stand for election in 2025 and 2026.",
      "The U.S. government and business groups worry that could weaken the independence of the courts, and make them vulnerable to political pressure. Critics say that could also allow drug cartels to fund judges' election campaigns and get their own candidates elected.",
      "\u201cThe constitutional overhaul risks eroding checks and balances of the country\u2019s judiciary system, with potential negative impact to Mexico\u2019s economic and fiscal strength,\u201d it continued, adding the changes \u201chave the potential to materially alter the checks and balances and the business operating environment in the country.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Jon Jones and Stipe Miocic are set to fight for the heavyweight championship at UFC 309 on Saturday night at Madison Square Garden",
      "NEW YORK -- Stipe Miocic chewed on his place in UFC history as he picked at a plate of food in between \u2014 and even during \u2014 questions ahead of his heavyweight clash with champion Jon Jones that should satiate the palate of most fight fans.",
      "After a year delay, and MMA pundits would argue this fight should have gone down much earlier than Saturday night, Miocic gets his shot at a third heavyweight championship reign when he fights Jones at UFC 309.",
      "Win or lose, Miocic isn\u2019t thinking retirement just yet.",
      "Oh, as a fighter? Sure, the prospect of the 42-year-old Miocic hanging up the gloves after his fight at Madison Square Garden looms as a talking point ahead of the showdown with Jones.",
      "As a firefighter and paramedic in Ohio, Miocic isn\u2019t ready to retire his hose.",
      "\u201cOh, that\u2019s a long time away,\" Miocic said.",
      "Almost as long as Miocic (20-4) has had to train \u2014 and stew for more than three years since his last fight \u2014 for his shot at Jones.",
      "The heavyweights were slated to fight last November at the Garden until Jones, widely considered the greatest fighter in the world, tore a tendon during training and was forced to withdraw. UFC President Dana White deemed an interim championship fight was beneath a fighter of Miocic\u2019s stature.",
      "\u201cOf course,\u201d Miocic said, \u201cI wanted Jon Jones more than anything.\u201d",
      "Miocic would join MMA great Randy Couture as the only UFC fighters with three title reigns in one division. Miocic beat Fabricio Werdum and UFC Hall of Famer Daniel Cormier to win his previous two heavyweight championships.",
      "A win against Jones might top the exhilaration of the previous title wins.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re all special,\u201d Miocic said. \"But maybe this one, I think, because it\u2019s the Mecca; it\u2019s Jon Jones. It doesn\u2019t get any better than that. Or bigger.\u201d",
      "Cormier knows the feeling about as well as any fighter of the thirst to fight Jones. Cormier, who now calls fights for ESPN, is also forever connected to Miocic thanks to their epic UFC trilogy. Cormier also fought Jones (27-1-0; 1 NC) twice.",
      "Cormier lost to Jones at light heavyweight in 2015 and again in 2017, though the latter was overturned to a no-contest after Jones tested positive for the steroid Turinabo. He beat Miocic for the heavyweight crown with a first-round knockout in 2018, then lost consecutive fights to him in 2019 and 2020 before he retired.",
      "Cormier wanted to stay neutral because of his commentary role and declined to pick a winner. A former UFC light heavyweight and heavyweight champion, Cormier did break down the fight for The Associated Press.",
      "Jones is a 15-1 favorite, per BetMGM Sportsbook.",
      "\u201cJones\u2019 best weapons are that he\u2019s so diverse, man. And he\u2019s tough,\u201d Cormier said. \u201cYou can hit him with some really big shots, hard shots, and he just doesn\u2019t get deterred. He\u2019s very tough, diverse weapons, well-rounded, great cardio, fight IQ is really high.\u201d",
      "Jones reclaimed his UFC light heavyweight title in July 2017 by stopping Cormier in the third round with a vicious head kick and a finish on the ground at UFC 214.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t even touch Jones,\u201d Cormier said, laughing. \u201cI\u2019m like, diving at him, throwing lunging punches and he\u2019s kneeing me the whole time.\u201d",
      "Cormier abruptly flattened Miocic in July 2018 with a right elbow out of a clinch in the first round of their first fight and was crowned heavyweight champion.",
      "\"He\u2019s got a championship mind,\u201d Cormier said. \u201cHe can adjust on the fly, which is very important.\u201d",
      "Cormier lost the title back to Miocic in 2019 and was defeated via unanimous decision in the final fight of his career a year later.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very fast for a big guy,\u201d Cormier said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be faster than Jones this weekend in terms of hand speed. He\u2019s freaking strong, man. Like, physically just strong. When he grabs you, it\u2019s very difficult to get away from that dude.\u201d",
      "Both fighters are 6-foot-4, though an 84-inch reach could actually hinder Jones if they go deep into the five-round bout.",
      "\u201cWhen he\u2019s in close, he\u2019s not as good,\u201d Cormier said. \u201cWhen you get inside of his range, he\u2019s not as good because his arms are so long. He\u2019s almost limited to kneeing and trying to elbow. If you\u2019re a guy that\u2019s good in the clinch, you can get some punches off on him.\u201d",
      "Both fighters have had little to do but train over the last five years.",
      "Jones hasn\u2019t fought since he ended a three-year sabbatical and choked out Ciryl Gane at UFC 285 in March 2023. Miocic last fought when he dropped the belt to Francis Ngannou at UFC 280 in March 2021.",
      "Cormier compared Miocic to retired New England Patriots QB Tom Brady in the sense that they were both athletes who thrived \u2014 and took hard hits \u2014 from their late 30s and into their 40s.",
      "\u201cStipe Miocic is tasked with going out there for 25 minutes and doing something he\u2019s done his entire adulthood,\u201d Cormier said. \u201cHe\u2019s big now. He\u2019s 250! He\u2019s huge. He doesn\u2019t even look like the same guy I fought. When I fought him he was 230 because he wanted to be faster because I was fast. Jon\u2019s not as fast with his hands. But if you stay in range, Jon will kick you, and he will kick you a lot and hard.\u201d",
      "Both fighters have teased retirement, though a fight with interim heavyweight champion Tom Aspinall looms for the winner.",
      "No matter the outcome, Miocic said he was reporting back to duty later in the week with his Ohio fire department. Jones' legacy as one of the great mixed martial arts fighters of all time is secure.",
      "\u201cI think for Stipe it will be tough to continue,\u201d Cormier said. \u201cIf the sport wants Jon Jones around, Stipe needs to win. I think there\u2019s a better chance Jones fights again soon if he loses. If he wins, he has nothing to prove. He\u2019s done everything.\u201d",

      "PHILADELPHIA -- Jalen Hurts rolled over, face down, and grabbed his helmet.",
      "The Philadelphia Eagles quarterback's head was spiked into the turf by Washington linebacker Frankie Luvu in the second quarter and bounced off the ground. Hurts was evaluated for a concussion \u2014 \u201cI guess I beat the protocol,\u201d he quipped \u2014 and stayed in the game.",

      "\u201cWhen you see grass coming out of his helmet, yeah man, he got rocked a few times,\u201d offensive lineman Lane Johnson said. \u201cI thought he did a good job coming in the second half, and really putting it behind him.\u201d",
      "After the game, Hurts laughed when he failed to recall details of a specific play.",
      "\u201cI don't know what you're talking about. Probably not the right thing to say right now,\u201d he said.",

      "But Gonzalez, promoted off the practice squad with Austin Seibert dealing with a hip injury, didn't get another opportunity late in the fourth. The Commanders were stopped on second- and third-and-1, and Daniels, the No. 2 overall draft pick, was stuffed on Philadelphia\u2019s 26.",

      "The kicker carousel has spun frequently around the NFL this fall",
      "EAGAN, Minn. -- The kicker carousel has spun frequently around the NFL this fall.",
      "The riders keep getting hurt.",
      "Traditionally viewed in this tough-guy sport as the quirky specialists who get to steer clear of the danger that lurks on the field, the place-kicking community has experienced an outsized amount of pain this season for a role that primarily hinges on handling the mental challenge of high-pressure performance.",
      "Teams that have made it this far without having to switch kickers ought to feel fortunate.",
      "\u201cJust looking for a live leg, you know?\u201d New York Jets interim coach Jeff Ulbrich said last week after his team's latest shuffle landed on Spencer Shrader, who's now headed for the Kansas City Chiefs with eighth-year veteran Harrison Butker on injured reserve.",
      "Butker is one of seven kickers currently on IR, a who's-who group of sorts at the position that includes Matt Prater and Greg Zuerlein.",
      "This will be Shrader's third team, having also kicked in one game for the Indianapolis Colts. His expected replacement on the Jets, Anders Carlson, has already handled kicking duty in two games for the San Francisco 49ers. There were 45 different players who attempted at least one kick this regular season entering this week, and that figure didn't reflect Shrader's appearance with multiple teams. Essentially, after the weekend is over, the total would be 48.",
      "The Jets will be at four \u2014 in four weeks \u2014 and join the 49ers and their co-tenant the New York Giants for the most in the league. Both the 49ers and the Giants had to give their punters a turn, thanks to in-game injuries. The Washington Commanders have used three.",
      "According to Sportradar data, there were only 41 kickers used across the league over the entire 2023 season, including one punter appearance and a double shot by Riley Patterson with both the Cleveland Browns and the Detroit Lions. Ten years ago, only 37 players attempted a kick in a regular season game.",
      "So what's the story? Predictably, opinions vary around the NFL.",
      "One issue has been more kickoffs in play following the rule change, as the 49ers experienced with Jake Moody and Matthew Wright going down in consecutive games while trying to make a tackle. The touchback rate, per Sportradar, has dropped from 74.3% in 2023 to 67.2% in 2024.",
      "\u201cI would never be the coach that says, \u2018Just let them score,\u2019 but, dang, that\u2019s two weeks in a row,\u201d 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said last month.",
      "There's also, of course, the theory that the collective increase in leg strength across the league has led to more muscle injuries. There have already been nine field goals attempted from 60-plus yards, matching the 2023 total. The number of 50-plus field goal tries, currently at 154, is on pace to smash the 2023 total of 230.",
      "\u201cAs a result of that, maybe you\u2019re practicing and working more 50-yard field goals during the week, so the taxing of the leg and those soft-tissue injuries kind of build up as we\u2019re getting deeper and deeper into the season,\u201d said Minnesota Vikings special teams coordinator Matt Daniels, whose rookie kicker Will Reichard went down last week with a quadriceps strain that bubbled up during a recent game.",
      "The Vikings typically kick on Wednesdays and Fridays in practices for a Sunday game.",
      "\u201cYou really have to make sure you\u2019re monitoring those guys, especially the young ones who feel like they\u2019re young whippersnappers and they can kick until their leg falls off,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cYou definitely have got to be smart with that and hold them accountable for sure.\u201d",
      "For those who dismiss the correlation from longer-distance kicking to league-wide injury increase, there's still a clear understanding that during-the-week workloads must be carefully managed.",
      "\u201cPart of it is finding that routine in the first place. I think some guys are young enough where it doesn\u2019t matter early on, and after a couple of years if they don\u2019t have a routine, then it kind of rears its head and something happens,\u201d said Browns kicker Dustin Hopkins, who has fought hamstring injuries for several seasons. \"I don\u2019t want to say long kicks, because in theory your effort is very similar \u2014 at least for me \u2014 for a 60-yarder as it is for a 44-yarder.\u201d",
      "Parker Romo can attest to the benefit of a reliable routine. The 27-year-old got the call from the Vikings to replace Reichard and made all four of his field goal attempts to beat the Jacksonville Jaguars last week.",
      "\u201cYou definitely don\u2019t want to kick too much just because you never know when that phone could ring. You\u2019ve got to be ready, because they call you one day and the next day you\u2019re working out for the team,\u201d Romo said. \u201cI think it\u2019s just important to limit those longer reps. Sure, it\u2019s fun to hit \u2019em and keep going, but you\u2019ve got to be smart with it.\u201d",

      "Quinn, Morris and Harbaugh have another thing in common. They previously were head coaches in the NFL. Harbaugh led the San Francisco 49ers to a Super Bowl appearance before going to Michigan and winning a national title last season.",
      "Quinn was Atlanta\u2019s coach when the Falcons blew a 28-3 lead in the Super Bowl to Tom Brady and the New England Patriots. Morris led Tampa Bay to one 10-win season in three years with the team more than a decade ago and also served as an interim coach for the Falcons in 2020.",
      "The five other first-year coaches \u2014 Seattle\u2019s Mike Macdonald (4-5), Tennessee\u2019s Brian Callahan (2-7), New England\u2019s Jerod Mayo (3-7), Carolina\u2019s Dave Canales (3-7) and Las Vegas\u2019 Antonio Pierce (2-7) are 14-33 combined. Macdonald, Callahan, Canales and Mayo are head coaches for the first time. Pierce went 5-4 as an interim coach with the Raiders last year.",

      "Last year, it was DeMeco Ryans guiding Houston to an AFC South title and a playoff victory. In 2022, a record five first-year coaches led their teams to the postseason.",
      "Quinn took over a team that hadn\u2019t had a winning record since 2016. But the Commanders had the No. 2 pick in the draft and nailed it with quarterback Jayden Daniels, a leading candidate for AP Offensive Rookie of the Year.",

They also signed running back Austin Ekeler, drafted wide receiver Luke McCaffrey and just traded for Pro Bowl cornerback Marshon Lattimore.",
      "The Commanders still have a chance to win the NFC East even after losing to the Eagles (8-2). Washington has a softer schedule the rest of the way. After a bye, the Commanders play the Cowboys, Titans and Saints. Then they face the Eagles and Dallas sandwiched around a matchup with Atlanta.",
      "Morris inherited a team that last had a winning record in 2017. The Falcons signed Kirk Cousins to a massive contract to solve their quarterback dilemma. They added receiver Darnell Mooney and Pro Bowl safety Justin Simmons in free agency and acquired pass rusher Matthew Judon in a trade.",
      "With two wins over Tampa Bay (4-6), Atlanta essentially has a three-game edge over the three-time defending division champion Buccaneers.",
      "Harbaugh walked into the most favorable situation in Los Angeles. The Chargers already had franchise QB Justin Herbert and were a playoff team in 2022. They signed running backs J.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards to strengthen their rushing attack and balance the offense. Los Angeles drafted right tackle Joe Alt with the No. 5 overall pick and selected wide receiver Ladd McConkey in the second round to help replace Keenan Allen and Mike Williams.",
      "The Chargers have a tough schedule the rest of the way, starting with a home game against the Bengals this week. Then it\u2019s the Ravens, Falcons, Chiefs, Buccaneers and Broncos before finishing up against the Patriots and Raiders.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 17:46:21 -0500",

      "The NBA is considering going to a tournament-style event for the All-Star Game, similar to what has been used in the Rising Stars competition in recent years",
      "The NBA is considering going to a tournament-style event for the All-Star Game, similar to what has been used in the Rising Stars competition in recent years, two people with knowledge of the plan said Friday.",
      "The people, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because no changes had been finalized, said the notion has been discussed for several weeks and was further talked about during a competition committee meeting on Friday.",
      "The idea centers around the 24 All-Star selections being split into three teams of eight players, with the fourth team likely to be the winner of the Rising Stars competition that will be held earlier that weekend.",
      "The changes would take effect starting with this season's All-Star weekend in San Francisco, set for Feb. 14-16.",
      "It remains unclear how the voting process would change. Fans, players and media have been part of a weighted system to choose starters, while coaches have selected reserves. Under the proposed format, there would not be any reserves \u2014 so it's likely all four voting entities would play a role in selecting the 24-player group.",
      "Also unclear: how choosing coaches would work. Typically, the coaching staffs from the teams leading the Eastern and Western Conferences are invited to coach the All-Star Game \u2014 but now, with three or four teams involved, more coaches could be needed.",
      "ESPN first reported the idea of the changes Friday.",
      "Commissioner Adam Silver said earlier this month that the league wants to change the format of the All-Star Game, with hopes that it can become more competitive. The East beat the West 211-186 last season, combining for the most points in the game\u2019s 73-year history and marking the first time a team eclipsed 200 points.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking at other formats,\u201d Silver said on Nov. 2, without specifying what may change. \u201cI think there\u2019s no doubt that the players were disappointed as well in last year\u2019s All-Star Game. We all want to do a better job providing competition and entertainment for our fans.\u201d",
      "The league has tinkered with the All-Star formula several times in recent years. Among the attempts were scrapping the longstanding East-vs.-West format for a draft picked by team captains and going to an untimed fourth quarter with a target score to ensure that the game must end on a made shot.",
      "Last year\u2019s game went back to the traditional format \u2014 four full 12-minute quarters, East vs. West. And it was nothing but an offensive showcase, with the teams combining for 168 3-point attempts.",
      "So, this year, the NBA is on the brink of trying something new \u2014 at least for the All-Stars. The rookie-sophomore game was scrapped a few years ago for the Rising Stars tournament, where the top first- and second-year players are split into four teams. Two teams play, then the other two teams play, and the winners meet to decide the Rising Stars champion. It's shorter bursts of basketball, and that may appeal to the All-Star players more than the 48-minute game.",
      "Silver enlisted Golden State star Stephen Curry, among other players, to help figure out a way to make the All-Star Game more competitive this season. Members of the National Basketball Players Association leadership group have been involved in the talks surrounding the current All-Star changes, the people said.",
      "There were elements added to last year's All-Star weekend that worked, such as the Curry vs. Sabrina Ionescu 3-point contest that the league wants to bring back this season \u2014 likely with Caitlin Clark and perhaps Klay Thompson involved to make it a 2-on-2 format.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at the interest in terms of viewership last year, one of the highlights was that Sabrina-Steph shootout,\u201d Silver said earlier this month. \u201cSo, we do want to do more of that.\u201d",

      "PHILADELPHIA -- Washington trailed by two points on in the fourth quarter, needing a field goal or first down to keep its prospects of a win \u2014 and a shot at the NFC East lead \u2014 alive in Philadelphia.",
      "The Commanders were behind 12-10 when they were stopped on second- and third-and-1. Buoyed by an early-season hot streak, coach Dan Quinn called his rookie quarterback's number on fourth-and-2 from the Eagles 26.",

      "\u201cBold call,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cI'd also say we were prepared for that moment. Didn't love the execution. But we've been an excellent fourth-down team. Going into it, we knew we'd have to take our shots against a tough division team on the road. We didn't like the execution or the result. But we were prepared for that.\u201d",
      "Plan B was the field goal.",
      "Zane Gonzalez, promoted off the practice squad with Austin Seibert dealing with a hip injury, made a 45-yarder in the third quarter for a 10-3 lead. Quinn decided not to give him another shot from about 44 yards out for a 13-12 lead.",
      "\u201cTo be the heavy hitters that we want to be, you've got to be able to close,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cHow do you learn the lesson to close? That's what we're going to become. You knew this adversity was coming. It just does.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "New Las Vegas Raiders interim offensive coordinator Scott Turner has deep ties to Las Vegas",
      "HENDERSON, Nev. -- New Raiders interim offensive coordinator Scott Turner opened his news conference Thursday by expressing gratitude for longtime college and NFL coach John Robinson, who died Monday at 89.",
      "Turner was a quarterback under Robinson at UNLV in the early 2000s. At that time, there was no thought of the Raiders one day landing in Las Vegas and not staying in Oakland.",
      "Robinson gave Turner a shot with the Rebels, and now Raiders coach Antonio Pierce is doing the same more than 20 years later and just 11 miles from campus.",
      "\"The only thing I really asked for was if we could have my dad come just for some help,\" Turner said.",
      "Pierce agreed to the request, remembering going against Norv Turner \u2014 a former longtime NFL head coach and offensive coordinator \u2014 during this playing days with Washington and the New York Giants.",
      "The elder Turner, who went 9-23 as the Oakland Raiders head coach in 2004-05, is a senior adviser and lives with Scott and his family. They regularly bounce ideas off each other. They have a lot to talk about.",
      "Las Vegas' offense is 29th in yardage (280.2 per game), last in rushing (76.9) and 25th in scoring (18.7 points per game). The Raiders, who visit the Miami Dolphins on Sunday, are 2-7 and used the last week's bye to make major staff changes.",
      "Gone were offensive coordinator Luke Getsy, quarterbacks coach Rich Scangarello and offensive line coach James Cregg. Scott Turner also fills the role of QBs coach and former Dolphins coach Joe Philbin oversees the offensive line.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to make promises,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cJust wanted a change, wanted a spark, wanted different ideas.\u201d",
      "This is Turner's second shot at offensive coordinator.",
      "He held the same position with Washington from 2020-22, a three-year stretch in which the team ranked in the bottom third in scoring before being let go. Eight different quarterbacks received snaps during that time.",
      "\u201cI told the guys, \u2018This league\u2019s about adversity and you learn that,'\" Turner said. \"I learned that in Washington. I was coordinator for three years, and whatever, we were 8-8-1, got fired. It didn\u2019t work out. So I\u2019m getting an opportunity, and I\u2019m just excited to work with our players, and just trying to make them perform at the best level they\u2019re capable of.\u201d",
      "How many changes Turner can make to improve the offense is debatable. It's not a roster that screams playoff contender, and numerous injuries on the offensive line have created a major obstacle in trying to upgrade a side of the ball without a true franchise quarterback and virtually no running game.",
      "Not that there aren't positive parts. Rookie Brock Bowers already has established himself as one of the league's top tight ends, Jakobi Meyers is a quality receiver and there has been strong play from some individual offensive lineman.",
      "Turner has eight games to try to figure it all out.",
      "\u201cYou keep the same verbiage, you keep the bones of the offense,\u201d quarterback Gardner Minshew said. \"I think kind of the approach for calling the game might be a little different, a little bit different flavor to it. We\u2019ll kind of see how that develops as we move forward.\u201d",
      "No matter how it turns out, Turner never thought he would be back in Las Vegas as an NFL offensive coordinator when he was backing up Shane Steichen as UNLV's quarterback. The two became close and even served in each other's weddings. They each still have phone numbers with Las Vegas' 702 area code.",
      "Steichen also rose through the coaching ranks, becoming the offensive coordinator of the Philadelphia Eagles team that reached the Super Bowl two seasons ago. That led to a head coaching opportunity with the Indianapolis Colts.",
      "Both played under Robinson, who influenced their future coaching careers. Turner said Robinson's ability to establish strong running games made an indelible impression on him, but he also saw the importance of healthy relationships from the future College Football Hall of Famer.",
      "\u201cI learned that from him, just like how he truly cared about all the players on the team,\u201d Turner said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter if it was a walk-on or the highest recruit that we had there at the time, he knew about them and he found time to build relationships with guys to try to help them be the best that they can be. That\u2019s what coaching is about, and that\u2019s why you get in this business.\u201d",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A tech consultant charged with murder in Cash App founder Bob Lee\u2019s stabbing death sparred with the lead prosecutor at trial Thursday, interrupting questions asked of him with his own questions as he was grilled on his testimony.",
      "Nima Momeni, 40, had to be told several times by the judge to provide responsive answers.",
      "He broke his public silence after 18 months when he took the witness stand Wednesday to explain how Lee was found staggering on a deserted downtown San Francisco street at 2:30 a.m. on April 4, 2023, dripping a trail of blood and calling for help. He later died at a hospital.",
      "Momeni testified Lee, 43, suddenly pulled a knife on him after he cracked a \u201cbad joke\u201d suggesting Lee should spend his last night in the city with family instead of trying to visit a strip club. He said Lee later walked away, showing no signs he was injured.",
      "His testimony stunned Lee's father, brother and ex-wife, who have been a steadfast presence in the criminal trial. They say Lee was big-hearted and gentle, and close to his two children and ex-wife.",
      "\u201cWhat you have seen is Nima be aggressive on the stand, you\u2019ve seen him just trying to take control of this room, his arrogance and his entitlement are on full display here,\u201d said the victim's brother, Timothy Oliver Lee, speaking with reporters outside the court room Thursday.",
      "\u201cThis is insane,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of this is ridiculous.\u201d",
      "The trial is in its fifth week. Momeni faces 26 years to life if convicted.",
      "Lee\u2019s death stunned the tech community as fellow executives and engineers penned tributes to the charismatic entrepreneur\u2019s generosity and brilliance. He was chief product officer of cryptocurrency platform MobileCoin when he died.",
      "Prosecutors say Momeni planned the April 4 attack after a dispute over his younger sister, Khazar Momeni, with whom Lee was friends. Momeni had picked up his sister from the home of a drug dealer introduced to her by Lee, and she said she may have been sexually assaulted after ingesting a date-rape drug called GHB.",
      "They say Momeni was angry with Lee so he took a knife from his sister\u2019s condo, and after the pair was kicked out of her place at 2 a.m., he drove Lee to a secluded area and stabbed him three times and then fled.",
      "Omid Talai, the assistant district attorney, grilled Momeni on Thursday on details of exactly how the attack unfolded. He asked Momeni why he did not call police after the attack and learning Lee had died, and why he did not respond to his sister's text asking where he had dropped off Lee.",
      "Momeni said he did not learn of Lee\u2019s death until the following day and was puzzled by his sister\u2019s query. He said he thought Lee could have been stabbed by someone else shortly after he saw him walk off, unharmed.",
      "In response to questions, Momeni said he didn't know what the prosecutor was getting at, accused him of misrepresenting his statements and said he had already answered.",
      "At one point, San Francisco Superior Court Judge Alexandra Gordon said that the prosecutor had no obligation to provide him with a printout of the texts he was questioning him about or to put them on the multimedia screen.",
      "\u201cGotcha,\u201d said Momeni, dressed in a blue suit and tie. \u201cThank you for clarifying.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors have video showing Lee and Momeni leaving Khazar Momeni's condo after 2 a.m. and driving off together in Momeni\u2019s BMW. Video also shows the two men getting out of the car in an isolated spot by the Bay Bridge.",
      "Prosecutors say that is where Momeni stabbed Lee, while the defense says that is where Lee attacked Momeni, erratic and aggressive from a multi-day bender of cocaine, ketamine and drinking.",
      "A knife recovered from the area where Lee was stabbed showed Momeni's DNA on the handle, but the defense said the handle should have been tested for fingerprints, namely Lee\u2019s.",
      "Momeni said he and Lee were on friendly terms when they left his sister's condo, but prosecutors say the defendant grilled the entrepreneur earlier in the evening about what might have happened to his sister at the drug dealer's apartment.",
      "The prosecutor pointed out multiple times Thursday that Momeni was questioning him the way he grilled Lee.",
      "Nima Momeni was 14 when his mother, Mahnaz Tayarani, took him and Khazar to the U.S., fleeing Iran and a husband who had inflicted years of abuse and violence on the family, she wrote in a letter submitted to the court in support of her son\u2019s pre-trial release.",
      "She has sat on one side of the courtroom while Lee's family members sit on the other."

      "Two separate teams found fragments of volcanic rock that were about 2.8 billion years old. One piece was even more ancient, dating back to 4.2 billion years.",
      "\u201cTo obtain a sample from this area is really important because it\u2019s an area that otherwise we have no data for,\u201d said Christopher Hamilton, a planetary volcano expert at the University of Arizona who was not involved with the research.",

Previous studies, including data from NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, suggested the far side might also have a volcanic past. The first samples from that region facing away from Earth confirm an active history.",
      "The results were published Friday in the journals Nature and Science.",

In 2020, the Chang\u2019e-5 spacecraft returned moon rocks from the near side, the first since those collected by NASA\u2019s Apollo astronauts and Soviet Union spacecraft in the 1970s. The Chang'e-4 spacecraft became the first to visit the moon's far side in 2019.",
      "The moon\u2019s far side is pockmarked by craters and has fewer of the near side\u2019s flat, dark plains carved by lava flows. Why the two halves are so different remains a mystery, said study co-author Qiu-Li Li from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.",

      "The Australian government's plan to ban children from social media to protect them from harm has won almost universal political support",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- How do you remove children from the harms of social media? Politically the answer appears simple in Australia, but practically the solution could be far more difficult.",
      "The Australian government\u2019s plan to ban children from social media platforms including X, TikTok, Facebook and Instagram until their 16th birthdays is politically popular. The opposition party says it would have done the same after winning elections due within months if the government hadn\u2019t moved first.",
      "The leaders of all eight Australian states and mainland territories have unanimously backed the plan, although Tasmania, the smallest state, would have preferred the threshold was set at 14.",
      "But a vocal assortment of experts in the fields of technology and child welfare have responded with alarm. More than 140 such experts signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemning the 16-year age limit as \u201ctoo blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\u201d",
      "Details of what is proposed and how it will be implemented are scant. More will be known when legislation is introduced into the Parliament next week.",
      "Leo Puglisi, a 17-year-old Melbourne student who founded online streaming service 6 News Australia at the age of 11, laments that lawmakers imposing the ban lack the perspective on social media that young people have gained by growing up in the digital age.",
      "\u201cWith respect to the government and prime minister, they didn\u2019t grow up in the social media age, they\u2019re not growing up in the social media age, and what a lot of people are failing to understand here is that, like it or not, social media is a part of people\u2019s daily lives,\u201d Leo said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s part of their communities, it\u2019s part of work, it\u2019s part of entertainment, it\u2019s where they watch content \u2013 young people aren\u2019t listening to the radio or reading newspapers or watching free-to-air TV \u2013 and so it can\u2019t be ignored. The reality is this ban, if implemented, is just kicking the can down the road for when a young person goes on social media,\u201d Leo added.",
      "Leo has been applauded for his work online. He was a finalist in his home state Victoria's nomination for the Young Australian of the Year award, which will be announced in January. His nomination bid credits his platform with \u201cfostering a new generation of informed, critical thinkers.\u201d",

      "Her 15-year-old daughter Carly Ryan was murdered in 2007 in South Australia state by a 50-year-old pedophile who pretended to be a teenager online. In a grim milestone of the digital age, Carly was the first person in Australia to be killed by an online predator.",
      "\u201cKids are being exposed to harmful pornography, they\u2019re being fed misinformation, there are body image issues, there\u2019s sextortion, online predators, bullying. There are so many different harms for them to try and manage and kids just don\u2019t have the skills or the life experience to be able to manage those well,\u201d Sonya Ryan said.",
      "\u201cThe result of that is we\u2019re losing our kids. Not only what happened to Carly, predatory behavior, but also we\u2019re seeing an alarming rise in suicide of young people,\u201d she added.",
      "Sonya Ryan is part of a group advising the government on a national strategy to prevent and respond to child sexual abuse in Australia.",
      "She wholeheartedly supports Australia setting the social media age limit at 16.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to get this perfect,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to make sure that there are mechanisms in place to deal with what we already have which is an anxious generation and an addicted generation of children to social media.\"",
      "A major concern for social media users of all ages is the legislation\u2019s potential privacy implications.",
      "Age estimation technology has proved inaccurate, so digital identification appears to be the most likely option for assuring a user is at least 16.",
      "Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner, an office that describes itself as the world\u2019s first government agency dedicated to keeping people safer online, has suggested in planning documents adopting the role of authenticator. The government would hold the identity data and the platforms would discover through the commissioner whether a potential account holder was 16.",
      "Tama Leaver, professor of internet studies at Curtin University, fears that the government will make the platforms hold the users\u2019 identification data instead.",
      "The government has already said the onus will be on the platforms, rather than on children or their parents, to ensure everyone meets the age limit.",
      "\u201cThe worst possible outcome seems to be the one that the government may be inadvertently pushing towards, which would be that the social media platforms themselves would end up being the identity arbiter,\u201d Leaver said.",
      "\u201cThey would be the holder of identity documents which would be absolutely terrible because they have a fairly poor track record so far of holding on to personal data well,\u201d he added.",
      "The platforms will have a year once the legislation has become law to work out how the ban can be implemented.",
      "Ryan, who divides her time between Adelaide in South Australia and Fort Worth, Texas, said privacy concerns should not stand in the way of removing children from social media.",
      "\u201cWhat is the cost if we don\u2019t? If we don\u2019t put the safety of our children ahead of profit and privacy?\u201d she asked.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Disgruntled X users are again flocking to Bluesky, a newer social media platform that grew out of the former Twitter before billionaire Elon Musk took it over in 2022. While it remains small compared to established online spaces such as X, it has emerged as an alternative for those looking for a different mood, lighter and friendlier and less influenced by Musk.",
      "Championed by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Bluesky was an invitation-only space until it opened to the public in February. That invite-only period gave the site time to build out moderation tools and other features. The platform resembles Musk\u2019s X, with a \u201cdiscover\u201d feed and a chronological feed for accounts that users follow. Users can send direct messages and pin posts, as well as find \u201cstarter packs\u201d that provide a curated list of people and custom feeds to follow.",
      "Bluesky said in mid-November that its total users surged to 15 million, up from roughly 13 million at the end of October, as some X users look for an alternative platform to post their thoughts and talk to others online. The post-election uptick in users isn\u2019t the first time Bluesky has benefited from people leaving X. The platform gained 2.6 million users in the week after X was banned in Brazil in August \u2014 85% of them from Brazil, the company said. About 500,000 new users signed up in one day in October, when X signaled that blocked accounts would be able to see a user\u2019s public posts.",
      "Across the platform, new users \u2014 among them journalists, left-leaning politicians and celebrities \u2014 have posted memes and shared that they were looking forward to using a space free from advertisements and hate speech. Some said it reminded them of the early days of Twitter more than a decade ago.",
      "Despite Bluesky\u2019s growth, X posted after the election that it had \u201cdominated the global conversation on the U.S. election\u201d and had set new records.",
      "Bluesky, though, has bigger ambitions than to supplant X. Beyond the platform itself, it is building a technical foundation \u2014 what it calls \u201ca protocol for public conversation\u201d \u2014 that could make social networks work across different platforms \u2014 also known as interoperability \u2014 like email, blogs or phone numbers.",
      "Currently, you can\u2019t cross between social platforms to leave a comment on someone\u2019s account. Twitter users must stay on Twitter and TikTok users must stay on TikTok if they want to interact with accounts on those services. Big Tech companies have largely built moats around their online properties, which helps serve their advertising-focused business models.",
      "Bluesky is trying to reimagine all of this and working toward interoperability."

      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- Good or bad, the United Nations climate negotiations process itself became the focus of the international talks that aim to curb warming from coal, oil and natural gas.",
      "Environmental advocates released reports Friday decrying fossil fuel industry influence at the climate talks called COP29. At the same time, a letter signed by a former United Nations secretary-general and ex-top climate negotiators called for dramatic reform. And the conference's chief negotiator said current talks \u2014 aimed at striking a deal worth hundreds of billions of dollars to help finance a transition to clean energy and adapting to climate change \u2014 were going too slowly.",
      "All that put the focus on process \u2014 not results.",
      "\u201cWe consider COP29 as a litmus test for the global climate architecture,\" conference lead negotiator Yalchin Rafiyev said at a Friday news conference.",
      "A letter signed by former U.N. chief Ban Ki-Moon, former U.N. climate secretary Christiana Figueres and former Ireland President Mary Robinson called for \u201ca fundamental overhaul of the COP.\"",
      "\"We need a shift from negotiation to implementation,\u201d it said.",
      "Two signees \u2014 Figueres and Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research \u2014 said the letter was being badly misinterpreted as criticism of the climate talks. They said the letter was intended to show support for the process, which they said has worked and just needs to shift into a new mode.",
      "Instead of spending so much effort negotiating new deals in annual conferences that can attract 70,000 people, the process should be smaller and more frequent and aimed at putting what was already agreed upon into action, Rockstrom said.",
      "\u201cIt's about strengthening the COP,\" Rockstrom said. \u201cIt's about recognizing we\u2019ve accomplished so much that we have what we need. ... We really need to get serious about delivery.\"",
      "Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare said he had issues with some of the suggestions in the letter and personally considers the COP process broken. His analysis this week showed that after the 2015 Paris agreement projected future warming dropped, but in the past three years, warming projections \u2014 based on negotiations, promises and policies \u2014 for the future have stayed the same or even gone up slightly.",
      "An analysis from the Kick Big Polluters Out coalition said Friday that the official attendance list of the talks featured at least 1,770 people connected to fossil fuel interests.",
      "Catherine Abreu, director of the International Climate Politics Hub, suggested that there should be a \u201cfirewall\u201d between fossil fuel lobbyists, U.N. climate bodies and negotiators from countries. \u201cWe know over 1,700 fossil fuel lobbyists are here at COP29. That is not acceptable,\u201d she said.",
      "Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who on Friday presented new data on carbon pollution sites, said \u201cit\u2019s unfortunate that the fossil fuel industry and the petrostates have seized control of the COP process to an unhealthy degree.\"",
      "For his part, COP29 negotiator Rafiyev defended the process.",
      "\u201cThe process has already delivered, the COP process so far by reducing projected warming, delivering finance to those in need,\" Rafiev said. \u201cIt\u2019s better than any alternative.\u201d",
      "One key benefit of the U.N. climate talks process is it's the only place where vulnerable small island nations have an equal seat at the table, United Nations Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen told The Associated Press. But the process has its limits because \u201cthe rules of the game are set by member states,\u201d she said.",
      "At a press conference, Alliance of Small Islands States Chair Cedric Schuster said the negotiating bloc felt the need to remind everyone else why the talks matter.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re here to defend the Paris agreement,\u201d Schuster said, referring to the climate deal in 2015 to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned that countries are forgetting that protecting the world\u2019s most vulnerable is at the core of this framework.\u201d",
      "Also at the talks Friday, new data from an organization co-founded by Gore that combines observations and artificial intelligence found that cities in Asia and the United States emit the most heat-trapping gas, with Shanghai the most polluting.",
      "Using observations and artificial intelligence, Climate Trace quantifies heat-trapping carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, as well as other traditional air pollutants worldwide, including for the first time in more than 9,000 urban areas.",
      "Seven states or provinces spew more than 1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases, all of them in China, except Texas, which ranks sixth.",
      "Earth's total carbon dioxide and methane pollution grew 0.7% to 61.2 billion metric tons with the short-lived but extra potent methane rising 0.2%. The figures are higher than other datasets \u201cbecause we have such comprehensive coverage and we have observed more emissions in more sectors than are typically available,\u201d said Gavin McCormick, Climate Trace's co-founder.",
      "Shanghai's 256 million metric tons of greenhouse gases led all cities and exceeded those from the nations of Colombia or Norway. Tokyo's 250 million metric tons would rank in the top 40 of nations if it were a country, while New York City's 160 million metric tons and Houston's 150 million metric tons would be in the top 50 of countrywide emissions. Seoul, South Korea, ranks fifth among cities at 142 million metric tons.",

      "It's auction time for Alex Jones' Infowars",
      "Conspiracy theory purveyor Infowars and most of its assets went on the auction block Wednesday, with Alex Jones waiting to see if he will be allowed to stay or if he will get kicked off its online platforms.",
      "The private auction was being held as part of Jones' personal bankruptcy, which resulted from the nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuit judgments a judge and jurors ordered the bombastic internet show and radio host to pay to families of victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting for repeatedly telling his audience that the Connecticut massacre of 20 children and six adults was a hoax staged by crisis actors. Jones, who has since acknowledged that the shooting did happen, is appealing the defamation verdicts.",
      "The bankruptcy trustee had said sealed bids would be opened at 10:30 a.m. CST so the winning bidder or bidders could be chosen. But Jones appeared to be getting impatient on his show as hours passed without any word on the results.",
      "\u201cI just want to know: Is this our last day here or not?\" he said.",
      "He later wrote on the social media platform X that the trustees told him the results will be released Thursday morning.",
      "Both Jones' supporters and detractors expressed interest in submitting bids. They included Roger Stone, an ally of Jones and President-elect Donald Trump, and progressive media groups that have been critical of Jones. He said he could be allowed to stay and keep using Infowars' platforms if allies won the bidding but that he could be kicked out and Infowars shut down if opponents bought it.",
      "Jones, based in Austin, Texas, said he set up a new studio, websites and social media accounts just in case. His personal social media in his name \u2014 including his account on X, with more than 3 million followers \u2014 were not up for sale. Court proceedings on whether they should be auctioned are pending.",
      "Jones revealed Wednesday that he worked with a group that put in a bid, but did not provide any details.",
      "\u201cThe folks I\u2019m working with, who put in (a) substantive bid to try to save Infowars and continue it in the future, have been given no information on the other bidders. That\u2019s all secret,\" he said in a video posted on X.",
      "Everything from Jones\u2019 studio desk to Infowars\u2019 name, video archive, social media accounts, and product trademarks and inventory were up for sale. Buyers could even purchase an armored truck and video cameras. . Any unsold items will be auctioned off next month.",
      "Many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, including real estate as well as guns and other personal belongings, also are being sold as part of the bankruptcy.",
      "Prospective buyers submitted sealed bids and confidentiality agreements by last Friday. The bankruptcy trustee, attorney Christopher Murray, appointed by the Justice Department, could have held new rounds of bidding Wednesday to boost prices above the sealed bids.",
      "Jones said Murray decided to choose from among the sealed bids. Jones said he was frustrated with that decision and learned about changes to the auction process only on Monday. A judge's order in September gave the trustee wide authority and said new bidding rounds on Wednesday were optional.",
      "Murray also could reject bids, even the highest ones, if he deemed them \u201ccontrary to the best interests of the Debtor\u2019s estate, FSS (Infowars parent company Free Speech Systems) and their creditors.\u201d",
      "Families sued Jones and his company for defamation and emotional distress for repeatedly saying on his show that the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, was a hoax staged by crisis actors to spur more gun control. Parents and children of many of the victims testified that they were traumatized by Jones\u2019 conspiracies and threats by his followers."

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 12:26:31 -0500",
    "summary": "The refugee organization, the International Rescue Committee, is testing some artificial intelligence tools to try to increase the number of displaced people they can reach with critical information",
    "story": [
      "The refugee organization, the International Rescue Committee, is testing some artificial intelligence tools to try to increase the number of displaced people they can reach with critical information",
      "NEW YORK -- As the International Rescue Committee copes with dramatic increases in displaced people in recent years, the refugee aid organization has looked for efficiencies wherever it can \u2014 including using artificial intelligence.",
      "Since 2015, the IRC has invested in Signpost \u2014 a portfolio of mobile apps and social media channels that answer questions in different languages for people in dangerous situations. The Signpost project, which includes many other organizations, has reached 18 million people so far, but IRC wants to significantly increase its reach by using AI tools \u2014 if they can do so safely.",
      "Conflict, climate emergencies and economic hardship have driven up demand for humanitarian assistance, with more than 117 million people forcibly displaced in 2024, according to the United Nations refugee agency. The turn to artificial intelligence technologies is in part driven by the massive gap between needs and resources.",
      "To meet its goal of reaching half of displaced people within three years, the IRC is testing a network of AI chatbots to see if they can increase the capacity of their humanitarian officers and the local organizations that directly serve people through Signpost. For now, the pilot project operates in El Salvador, Kenya, Greece and Italy and responds in 11 languages. It draws on a combination of large language models from some of the biggest technology companies, including OpenAI, Anthropic and Google.",
      "The chatbot response system also uses customer service software from Zendesk and receives other support from Google and Cisco Systems.",
      "If they decide the tools work, the IRC wants to extend the technical infrastructure to other nonprofit humanitarian organizations at no cost. They hope to create shared technology resources that less technically focused organizations could use without having to negotiate directly with tech companies or manage the risks of deployment.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to really be clear about where the legitimate concerns are but lean into the optimism of the opportunities and not also allow the populations we serve to be left behind in solutions that have the potential to scale in a way that human to human or other technology can\u2019t,\" said Jeannie Annan, International Rescue Committee\u2019s Chief Research and Innovation Officer.",
      "The responses and information that Signpost chatbots deliver are vetted by local organizations to be up to date and sensitive to the precarious circumstances people could be in. An example query that IRC shared is of a woman from El Salvador traveling through Mexico to the United States with her son who is looking for shelter and for services for her child. The bot provides a list of providers in the area where she is.",
      "More complex or sensitive queries are escalated for humans to respond.",
      "The most important potential downside of these tools would be that they don't work. For example, what if the situation on the ground changes and the chatbot doesn\u2019t know? It could provide information that's not just wrong, but dangerous.",
      "A second issue is that these tools can amass a valuable honeypot of data about vulnerable people that hostile actors could target. What if a hacker succeeds in accessing data with personal information or if that data is accidentally shared with an oppressive government?",
      "IRC said it's agreed with the tech providers that none of their AI models will be trained on the data that the IRC, the local organizations or the people they are serving are generating. They've also worked to anonymize the data, including removing personal information and location.",
      "As part of the Signpost.AI project, IRC is also testing tools like a digital automated tutor and maps that can integrate many different types of data to help prepare for and respond to crises.",
      "Cathy Petrozzino, who works for the not-for-profit research and development company MITRE, said AI tools do have high potential, but also high risks. To use these tools responsibly, she said, organizations should ask themselves, does the technology work? Is it fair? Are data and privacy protected?",
      "She also emphasized that organizations need to convene a range of people to help govern and design the initiative \u2014 not just technical experts, but people with deep knowledge of the context, legal experts, and representatives from the groups that will use the tools.",
      "\u201cThere are many good models sitting in the AI graveyard,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause they weren\u2019t worked out in conjunction and collaboration with the user community.\u201d",
      "For any system that has potentially life-changing impacts, Petrozzino said, groups should bring in outside experts to independently assess their methodologies. Designers of AI tools need to consider the other systems it will interact with, she said, and they need to plan to monitor the model over time.",
      "Consulting with displaced people or others that humanitarian organizations serve may increase the time and effort needed to design these tools, but not having their input raises many safety and ethical problems, said Helen McElhinney, executive director of CDAC Network. It can also unlock local knowledge.",
      "People receiving services from humanitarian organizations should be told if an AI model will analyze any information they hand over, she said, even if the intention is to help the organization respond better. That requires meaningful and informed consent, she said. They should also know if an AI model is making life-changing decisions about resource allocation and where accountability for those decisions lies, she said.",
      "Degan Ali, CEO of Adeso, a nonprofit in Somalia and Kenya, has long been an advocate for changing the power dynamics in international development to give more money and control to local organizations. She asked how IRC and others pursuing these technologies would overcome access issues, pointing to the week-long power outages caused by Hurricane Helene in the U.S. Chatbots won't help when there's no device, internet or electricity, she said.",
      "Ali also warned that few local organizations have the capacity to attend big humanitarian conferences where the ethics of AI are debated. Few have staff both senior enough and knowledgeable enough to really engage with these discussions, she said, though they understand the potential power and impact these technologies may have.",
      "\u201cWe must be extraordinarily careful not to replicate power imbalances and biases through technology,\u201d Ali said. \u201cThe most complex questions are always going to require local, contextual and lived experience to answer in a meaningful way.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- A computer expert who stole bitcoin worth billions of dollars at current prices \u2014 and then spent years laundering some of the hacked cryptocurrency with help from his wife \u2014 was sentenced on Thursday to five years in prison.",
      "Ilya Lichtenstein masterminded one of the largest-ever thefts from a virtual currency exchange before he and his wife, Heather Rhiannon Morgan, carried out an elaborate scheme to liquidate the stolen funds, according to federal prosecutors.",
      "U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly told Lichtenstein that his theft was \u201cmeticulously planned\u201d and not an impulsive act.",
      "\u201cIt's important to send a message that you can't commit these crimes with impunity, that there are consequences to them,\u201d she said.",
      "Lichtenstein, who gets credit for the two years and nine months that he has spent in jail since his February 2022 arrest, expressed remorse for \u201cwasting my talents on crime instead of a positive contribution to society.\u201d He said he hopes that he can apply his expertise to fight cybercrime when he gets out of prison.",
      "\u201cI want to take full responsibility for my actions and make amends any way I can,\u201d he said.",
      "The judge is scheduled to sentence Morgan on Monday. Lichtenstein pleaded with the judge to spare his wife from prison, blaming himself for her involvement.",
      "In August 2016, Lichtenstein hacked into a virtual currency exchange, Hong Kong-based Bitfinex, and stole approximately 120,000 bitcoin. It was worth approximately $71 million at the time of the hack and would be valued at more than $7.6 billion at current market prices, according to prosecutors.",
      "Several months later, Lichtenstein began moving the stolen bitcoin in a string of complex transactions designed to conceal its path across a series of accounts and platforms. He enlisted his wife\u2019s help in cleaning the stolen funds.",
      "Lichtenstein, an entrepreneur and cryptocurrency investor, is a U.S. citizen who was born in Russia and grew up in a Chicago suburb. Morgan, a business owner and writer, adopted the alter ego \u201c Razzlekhan \u201d for performing rap songs and recording videos for her music.",
      "Lichtenstein and Morgan were living in New York City when they were arrested in February 2022. They had been living in San Francisco around the time of the hack.",
      "Prosecutors recommended a five-year prison sentence for Lichtenstein, who pleaded guilty in August 2023 to one count of money laundering conspiracy. They recommended an 18-month prison sentence for Morgan, who pleaded guilty to the same charge.",
      "\u201cNeither the hack nor the laundering scheme was an impulsive decision. The defendant (Lichtenstein) spent months attempting to gain access to Bitfinex\u2019s infrastructure and get the accesses and permissions he needed in order to orchestrate his hack,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Lichtenstein told his wife about the hack over three years later, but he initially solicited her help in laundering the proceeds \u201cwithout explaining exactly what he was doing,\u201d according to prosecutors.",
      "Morgan \u201cwas certainly a willing participant and bears full responsibility for her actions, but she was a lower-level participant,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "During family trips to Kazakhstan and Ukraine, Lichtenstein met with couriers who delivered him money that he smuggled back into the U.S.",
      "\u201cOver half a decade, the defendant engaged in what IRS agents described as the most complicated money laundering techniques they had seen to date,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, which is digital money that typically isn\u2019t backed by any government or banking institution. Transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "The couple successfully laundered about 21 percent of the funds stolen from Bitfinex. The laundered money was worth at least $14 million at 2016 prices. Its value would have exceeded $1 billion at the time of their 2022 arrest.",
      "Authorities seized the remaining funds, collectively valued at over $6 billion at current prices.",
      "\u201cHe became one of the greatest money launderers that the government has encountered in the cryptocurrency space,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "An attorney for Bitfinex said the hack \u201cdevastated\u201d its finances and its reputation with its customers, with the stolen funds accounting for approximately 36% of the company's assets at the time of theft.",
      "\u201cBitfinex had to take unprecedented and immediate action to ensure that any losses from the Hack would ultimately be borne by Bitfinex and its shareholders alone, not its customers,\u201d the lawyer, Barry Berke, wrote in a letter to the judge.",
      "A prosecutor said Lichtenstein immediately began cooperating with federal authorities after his arrest, helping them with other cybercrime investigations.",
      "Over 96% of the stolen funds have been recovered, with help from Lichtenstein, according to defense attorney Samson Enzer. The \u201cvast bulk\u201d of the stolen money was never spent, the lawyer said.",

    "story": [
      "Japan\u2019s nuclear watchdog has formally disqualified a reactor in the country\u2019s north-central region from starting",
      "TOKYO -- Japan's nuclear watchdog on Wednesday formally disqualified a reactor in the country's north-central region from restarting, the first rejection under safety standards that were reinforced after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. The decision is a setback for Japan as it seeks to accelerate reactor restarts to maximize nuclear power.",
      "The Nuclear Regulation Authority said the Tsuruga No. 2 reactor is \u201cunfit\u201d as its operator failed to address safety risks stemming from the presence of possible active fault lines, which can potentially cause earthquakes, underneath it.",
      "Tsuruga No. 2, operated by the Japan Atomic Power Co., is the first reactor to be rejected under safety standards adopted in 2013 based on lessons from the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi meltdown disaster following a massive earthquake and tsunami.",
      "\u201cWe reached our conclusion based on a very strict examination,\u201d NRA chairperson Shinsuke Yamanaka told reporters.",
      "The verdict comes after more than eight years of safety reviews that were repeatedly disrupted by data coverups and mistakes by the operator, Yamanaka said. He called the case \u201cabnormal\u201d and urged the utility to take the result seriously.",
      "The decision is a blow to Japan Atomic Power because it virtually ends its hopes for a restart. The operator, which is decommissioning its other reactor, Tsuruga No. 1, had hoped to put No. 2 back online, but it would require an examination of dozens of faults around the reactor to prove their safety.",
      "\u201cThe decision is extremely regrettable,\" Japan Atomic Power said in a statement. It said it will continue efforts to restart.",
      "An NRA safety panel concluded three months ago it could not rule out the possibility of active fault lines about 300 meters (330 yards) north of the No. 2 reactor stretching to right underneath the facility, meaning the reactor cannot be operated.",
      "Japan\u2019s government in 2022 adopted a plan to maximize the use of nuclear energy, pushing to accelerate reactor restarts to secure a stable energy supply and meet its pledge to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.",
      "Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters that safety is the prerequisite for nuclear plant operation and that the government respects the scientific and highly technical decision by the watchdog. He said the government's position to promote nuclear energy is unchanged.",
      "Concern about the government\u2019s revived push for nuclear energy grew after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit Japan\u2019s Noto Peninsula on Jan. 1, 2024, killing more than 400 people and damaging more than 100,000 structures. The quake caused minor damage to two nearby nuclear facilities, and evacuation plans for the region were found to be inadequate.",
      "Building key nuclear facilities, such as reactors, directly above active fault lines is prohibited in earthquake-prone Japan.",
      "Yamanaka said the NRA is not immediately ordering a decommissioning because the reactor, which is offline and its spent fuel safely cooled, will not pose a major threat.",
      "If the utility decides to reapply, it must address not only the faults issue but it also must implement adequate safety measures for the entire plant, Yamanaka said. Providing scientific proof of the status of faults underneath key nuclear facilities is difficult, but other operators that obtained restart permits all cleared the requirement, he noted.",
      "The Tsuruga No. 2 reactor first started commercial operation in February 1987 and has been offline since May 2011. The operator rejected the NRA panel's 2013 on-site inspection results, which concluded that the faults under the No. 2 reactor were active, and applied for a restart in 2015.",
      "Of more than 50 commercial reactors, 27 have applied for restarts and 17 of them have been approved so far under the post-Fukushima safety standard."

      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- For the third straight year, efforts to fight climate change haven't lowered projections for how hot the world is likely to get \u2014 even as countries gather for another round of talks to curb warming, according to an analysis Thursday.",
      "At the United Nations climate talks, hosted in Baku, Azerbaijan, nations are trying to set new targets to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases and figure out how much rich nations will pay to help the world with that task.",
      "But Earth remains on a path to be 2.7 degrees Celsius (4.9 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, according to Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists and analysts who study government policies and translate that into projections of warming.",
      "If emissions are still rising and temperature projections are no longer dropping, people should wonder if the United Nations climate negotiations \u2014 known as COP \u2014 are doing any good, said Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot going on that\u2019s positive here, but on the big picture of actually getting stuff done to reduce emissions ... to me it feels broken,\u201d Hare said.",
      "The world has already warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. That's near the 1.5-degree (2.7 F) limit that countries agreed to at 2015 climate talks in Paris. Climate scientists say the atmospheric warming, mainly from human burning of fossil fuels, is causing ever more extreme and damaging weather including droughts, flooding and dangerous heat.",
      "Climate Action Tracker does projections under several different scenarios, and in some cases, those are going up slightly.",
      "\u201cThis is driven highly by China,\u201d said Sofia Gonzales-Zuniga of Climate Analytics. Even though China's fast-rising emissions are starting to plateau, they are peaking higher than anticipated, she said.",
      "Another upcoming factor not yet in the calculations is the U.S. elections. A Trump administration that rolls back the climate policies in the Inflation Reduction Act, and carries out the conservative blueprint Project 2025, would add 0.04 degree Celsius (0.07 Fahrenheit) to warming projections, Gonzales-Zuniga said. That's not much, but it could be more if other nations use it as an excuse to do less, she said.",
      "\u201cFossil fuels and emissions are not peaking,\u201d said Sherry Rehman, chair of climate and environment committee in Pakistan\u2019s senate. After 29 years of climate talks, Rehman said countries are \u201cstill talking in bumper stickers.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need a transformative solution. We need strong delivery,\u201d Rehman said.",
      "The major battle in Baku is over how much rich nations will pay for developing countries to decarbonize their energy systems, cope with future harms of climate change and pay for damage from warming's extreme weather.",
      "A special independent group of experts commissioned by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued its own estimate of costs and finances on Thursday, calling for a tripling of the old commitment. It said about $1 trillion a year is needed by developing nations from all outside sources, not just government grants.",

European Commission negotiator Jacob Werksman said there\u2019s a \u201cvery significant gap\u2033 between what rich and poor nations propose.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s about fairness, it\u2019s about justice,\u201d she said.",
      "Getting climate cash is personal for many activists from vulnerable nations, like Sandra Leticia Guzman Luna, who is from Mexico and the director of the climate finance group for Latin America and the Caribbean. \u201cWe are observing the climate impacts causing a lot of costs, not only economic costs but also human losses,\u201d she said.",

      "Disney earned $460 million, or 25 cents per share, for the period ended Sept. 28. A year earlier the Burbank, California-based company earned $264 million, or 14 cents per share.",
      "Removing certain items, earnings were $1.14 per share. This topped the $1.09 per share that analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research were looking for.",
      "Shares jumped more than 9% before the market open on Thursday.",
      "Revenue climbed 6% to $22.57 billion, but fell a bit short of Wall Street's estimate of $22.59 billion.",
      "Operating income for the entertainment segment, which includes its movie studio and parts of its television wing, more than quadrupled to $1.07 billion.",
      "This was helped in part by a strong performance from its content/sales, licensing and other segment, which benefited from $316 million in operating income from \u201cInside Out 2\u201d and \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine.\u201d",
      "The Walt Disney Co. said Thursday that its direct-to-consumer business, which includes Disney+ and Hulu, reported quarterly operating income of $253 million compared with an operating loss of $420 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 15% to $5.78 billion.",
      "The combined streaming businesses, which includes Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, achieved profitability for the first time in the third quarter.",
      "Disney+ saw a 2% increase in paid subscribers domestically, which includes the U.S. and Canada. It had a 5% rise internationally, which excludes Disney+ HotStar.",
      "Disney ended the quarter with 174 million Disney+ Core and Hulu subscriptions, and more than 120 million Disney+ Core paid subscribers, an increase of 4.4 million over the prior quarter.",
      "Disney said that its improved direct-to-consumer business results were due in part to subscription revenue growth thanks to increased in retail pricing and subscriber growth. Advertising revenue also increased and marketing costs at Disney+ declined.",

      "Iger was confident about the future of Disney's streaming platform on the company's conference call, noting that whenever Disney has success with a movie, or there's expected success for a movie, like with \u201cInside Out 2\u201d and \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d the viewership for previous films, like \u201cInside Out\u201d and \u201cDeadpool,\u201d spikes significantly on its streaming service. Iger anticipates this trend will continue in the future.",

      "The Experiences division, which includes six global theme parks, its cruise line, merchandise and videogame licensing, reported operating income dropped 6% to $1.7 billion. While operating income improved at domestic parks and Experiences, it fell for international parks and Experiences.",
      "Disney previously forecast that its fourth-quarter Experiences operating income would fall by mid single digits compared with the prior-year period due to domestic parks moderation as well as cyclical softening in China and less people at Disneyland Paris due to the impact the Olympics had on normal consumer travel.",

      "Gorman said in a statement in October that by naming Disney\u2019s next CEO in 2026, it \u201cwill allow ample time for a successful transition before the conclusion of Bob Iger\u2019s contract in December 2026.\u201d",
      "Disney is continuing to review internal and external candidates for the CEO position.",
      "In April shareholders rebuffed efforts by activist investor Nelson Peltz to claim seats on the company board, standing firmly behind Iger as he tries to energize the company after a rough stretch.",
      "In June Disney asked a federal appellate court to dismiss its lawsuit against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis after his appointees approved a deal with the company on how Walt Disney World will be developed over the next two decades, ending the last piece of conflict between the two sides.",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia plans to require social media platforms to act to prevent online harms to users such as bullying, predatory behavior and algorithms pushing destructive content, the government said Thursday.",
      "\u201cThe Digital Duty of Care will place the onus on digital platforms to proactively keep Australians safe and better prevent online harms,\u201d Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said in a statement.",
      "The proposed changes to the Online Safety Act were announced before the government next week introduces to Parliament world-first legislation that would ban children younger than 16 from platforms including X, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok.",
      "Critics have argued that removing children from social media reduced incentives for platforms to provide safer online environments.",
      "Social media has been blamed for an increase in children taking their own lives and developing eating disorders due to bulling and exposures to negative body images.",
      "Rowland said making tech companies legally responsible for keeping Australians safe was an approach already adopted by Britain and the European Union.",
      "Digital businesses would be required to take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable harms on their platforms and services. The duty of care framework would be underpinned by risk assessment and risk mitigation, and informed by safety-by-design principles, the minister said.",
      "Legislating a duty of care would mean services can\u2019t \u201cset and forget.\u201d Instead, their obligations would mean they need to continually identify and mitigate potential risks, as technology and service offerings change and evolve, she said.",
      "The categories of harm in the legislation include harm to young people and mental well-being, promotion of harmful practices and illegal activity.",
      "The government has not said when the duty of care legislation will be introduced to Parliament or outlined the punishment for breaches.",
      "The Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia better known as DIGI, welcomed government efforts to \u201cfuture-proof\u201d the Online Safety Act.",

      "Swinburne University digital media expert Belinda Barnet described the duty of care as a \u201cgreat idea.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite pioneering to expect that platforms that host Australian users would have a duty of care responsibility in terms of the content they show and the experiences they offer,\u201d Barnet said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s making the platforms take responsibility and that just simply doesn\u2019t happen at the moment. There\u2019s an assumption that they\u2019re a neutral third party. They\u2019re not responsible for the impact of that content,\u201d Barnet added.",

      "In a Cypriot National Guard camp, Ukrainians are being trained on how to identify, locate and dispose of landmines and other unexploded munitions that litter huge swaths of their country, killing and maiming hundreds of people, including children",
      "NICOSIA, Cyprus -- In a Cypriot National Guard camp, Ukrainians are being trained on how to identify, locate and dispose of landmines and other unexploded munitions that litter huge swaths of their country, killing and maiming hundreds of people, including children.",
      "Analysts say Ukraine is among the countries that are the most affected by landmines and discarded explosives, as a result of Russia\u2019s ongoing war.",
      "According to U.N. figures, some 399 people have been killed and 915 wounded from landmines and other munitions since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, equal to the number of casualties reported from 2014-2021. More than 1 in 10 of those casualties have been children.",
      "The economic impact is costing billions to the Ukrainian economy. Landmines and other munitions are preventing the sowing of 5 million hectares, or 10%, of the country\u2019s agricultural land.",
      "Cyprus stepped up to offer its facilities as part of the European Union\u2019s Military Assistance Mission to Ukraine. So far, almost 100 Ukrainian armed forces personnel have taken part in three training cycles over the last two years, said Cyprus Foreign Ministry spokesperson Theodoros Gotsis.",
      "\u201cWe are committed to continuing this support for as long as it takes,\u201d Gotsis told the Associated Press, adding that the Cyprus government has covered the 250,000 euro ($262,600) training cost.",
      "Cyprus opted to offer such training owing to its own landmine issues dating back five decades when the island nation was ethnically divided when Turkey invaded following a coup that sought union with Greece. The United Nations has removed some 27,000 landmines from a buffer zone that cuts across the island, but minefields remain on either side. The Cypriot government says it has disposed of all anti-personnel mines in line with its obligations under an international treaty that bans the use of such munitions.",
      "In Cyprus, Ukrainians undergo rigorous theoretical and practical training over a five-week Basic Demining and Clearance course that includes instruction on distinguishing and safely handling landmines and other explosive munitions, such as rockets, 155 mm artillery shells, rocket-propelled grenades and mortar shells.",
      "Theoretical training uses inert munitions identical to the actual explosives.",
      "Most of the course is comprised of hands-on training focusing on the on-site destruction of unexploded munitions using explosives, the chief training officer told the Associated Press. The officer spoke on condition of anonymity because he\u2019s not authorized to disclose his identity for security reasons.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re trained on ordnance disposal using real explosives,\u201d the officer said. \u201cThat will be the trainees\u2019 primary task when they return.\u201d",
      "Cypriot officials said the Ukrainian trainees did not want to be either interviewed or photographed.",
      "Defusing discarded munitions or landmines in areas where explosive charges can\u2019t be used \u2014 for instance, near a hospital \u2014 is not part of this course because that\u2019s the task of highly trained teams of disposal experts whose training can last as long as eight months, the officer said.",
      "Trainees, divided into groups of eight, are taught how to operate metal detectors and other tools for detecting munitions like prodders \u2014 long, thin rods which are used to gently probe beneath the ground\u2019s surface in search of landmines and other explosive ordnance.",
      "Another tool is a feeler, a rod that\u2019s used to detect booby-trapped munitions. There are many ways to booby-trap such munitions, unlike landmines which require direct pressure to detonate.",
      "\u201cBooby-trapped munitions are a widespread phenomenon in Ukraine,\u201d the chief training officer explained.",
      "Training, primarily conducted by experts from other European Union countries, takes place both in forested and urban areas at different army camps and follows strict safety protocols.",
      "The short, intense training period keeps the Ukrainians focused.",
      "\u201cYou see the interest they show during instruction: they ask questions, they want to know what mistakes they\u2019ve made and the correct way of doing it,\u201d the officer said.",
      "Humanitarian data and analysis group ACAPS said in a Jan. 2024 report that 174,000 sq. kilometers (67,182 sq. miles) or nearly 29% of Ukraine\u2019s territory needs to be surveyed for landmines and other explosive ordnance.",
      "More than 10 million people are said to live in areas where demining action is needed.",
      "Since 2022, Russian forces have used at least 13 types of anti-personnel mines, which target people. Russia never signed the 1997 Ottawa Convention banning the use of anti-personnel mines, but the use of such mines is nonetheless considered a violation of its obligations under international law.",
      "Russia also uses 13 types of anti-tank mines.",
      "The International Campaign to Ban Landmines said in its 2023 Landmine Monitor report that Ukrainian government forces may have also used antipersonnel landmines in contravention of the Mine Ban Treaty in and around the city of Izium during 2022, when the city was under Russian control."

Amazon plans to ship the products to U.S. customers from a warehouse it operates in China, according to documentation the company provided to sellers. Amazon said Haul orders could arrive within one to two weeks.",
      "Many of the available products on the storefront Wednesday resembled the types of items typically found on Shein and Temu, the China-founded e-commerce platforms that have grown in popularity in recent years.",
      "Shein\u2019s core customers are young women enticed by the low-cost apparel sold on the site. Temu offers clothing, accessories, kitchen gadgets and a broad array of other products for bargain-hungry shoppers.",

The company is seeking to drive home its message on value, with banners on its page advertising \u201ccrazy low prices\u201d and activewear \u201cthat won\u2019t stretch your budget.\u201d",

In September, the Biden administration said it was cracking down on cheap products sold out of China, a move designed to reduce U.S. dependence on Beijing but could also trigger higher prices for the U.S. consumers who have flocked to Shein and Temu. President-elect Donald Trump has also proposed a 60% tariff on goods from China.",
      "Amazon announced other news this week.",
      "The company said it was shutting down its free, ad-supported streaming service Freevee and consolidating the content under Prime Video, which now also features ads for Prime members who refuse to pay extra to avoid them.",

      "European Union regulators hit Facebook parent Meta with a fine of nearly 800 million euros on Thursday for what it calls \u201cabusive practices\u201d involving its Marketplace online classified ads business",
      "LONDON -- European Union regulators issued their first antitrust fine to Facebook parent Meta on Thursday with a penalty of nearly 800 million euros for what they call \u201cabusive practices\u201d involving its Marketplace online classified ads business.",
      "The European Commission, the 27-nation bloc's executive branch and top antitrust enforcer, issued the 797.72 million euro ($841 million) penalty after its long-running investigation found that the company abused its dominant position and engaged in anti-competitive behavior.",
      "It\u2019s the first time the EU has imposed a fine on the social media giant for breaches of the bloc\u2019s competition law. Brussels has already slapped Big Tech rivals Google and Apple with billions in antitrust penalties.",
      "The commission had accused Meta of distorting competition by tying its online classified ad business to its social network, automatically exposing Facebook users to Marketplace \u201cwhether they want it or not\" and shutting out competitors.",
      "It was also concerned that Meta was imposing unfair trading conditions with terms of service that authorized the company to use ad-related data \u2014 generated from competing classified ad platforms who advertise on Facebook or Instagram \u2014 to benefit Marketplace.",
      "Meta's practices gave it \u201cadvantages that other online classified ads service providers could not match,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, the commission's executive vice-president in charge of competition policy, said in a press release \u201cThis is illegal under EU antitrust rules. Meta must now stop this behaviour.\u201d",
      "Meta said in a statement that the decision fails to prove any \u201ccompetitive harm\u201d to rivals or consumers and \u201cignores the realities of the thriving European market for online classified listing services.\u201d",
      "The company said the Commission's case ignores the fact that Facebook users can choose to \u201dengage with Marketplace, and many don't.\" It said online marketplaces, including global sites like eBay, Europe-wide platforms like Vinted, and national services are continuing to grow.",
      "Meta said it would comply with the Commission's order to end the offending conduct and not repeat it, but also vowed to appeal.",
      "The case dates back to 2021, when European Union regulators and their counterparts in Britain opened dual investigations into the classified business. The British regulator wrapped up its investigation last year after Meta made concessions.",
      "The company continues to face EU scrutiny on other fronts, including investigations into whether Facebook and Instagram child safety and election integrity measures comply with the bloc\u2019s digital rulebook. Meta has previously been hit with a series of fines for breaches of the EU\u2019s stringent privacy laws, including a record 1.2 billion euro penalty last year.",

      "In 2022, Nvidia paid a $5.5 million fine to settle charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it failed to disclose that cryptomining was a significant source of revenue growth from the sale of graphics processing units that were produced and marketed for gaming.

      "Italy's president has sharply rebuked Elon Musk",
      "ROME -- Italian President Sergio Mattarella sharply rebuked Elon Musk on Wednesday for weighing in on Italian court rulings that have stymied the government\u2019s plans to process some asylum-seekers in Albania.",
      "Musk, who is expected to have a top advisory role in Donald Trump\u2019s new administration, wrote Tuesday on X that \u201cthese judges need to go.\u201d He was referring to the latest Italian court ruling against right-wing Premier Giorgia Meloni\u2019s much-touted Albania immigration deal.",
      "\u201cThis is unacceptable. Do the people of Italy live in a democracy or does an unelected autocracy make the decisions?\u201d he wrote in a subsequent post Wednesday.",
      "The posts concerned a Rome court's refusal to rule on a formal request to detain seven migrants rescued at sea and transferred to Albania for processing. Monday's ruling resulted in the men being brought to Italy for processing.",
      "Mattarella didn\u2019t cite Musk by name but \u2014 in an unusually piqued statement \u2014 made clear on Wednesday that he was referring to him. Italy's head of state demanded respect for the country's sovereignty, especially from other soon-to-be public officials.",
      "\u201cItaly is a great democratic country and \u2026 knows how to take care of itself while respecting its Constitution,\u201d Mattarella said in a statement issued by his spokesman.",
      "\u201cAnyone, particularly if as announced is about to assume an important role of government in a friendly and allied country, must respect its sovereignty and cannot attribute to himself the task of imparting prescriptions,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Trump announced Tuesday that Musk, one of the most influential people around the U.S. president-elect, would help lead a Department of Government Efficiency, essentially an independent advisory panel to eliminate waste and fraud.",
      "Musk is a supporter of Meloni and has met with her in Rome on a few occasions, and in September joined her at an awards ceremony on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. Photos of them together made such news that Musk seemingly felt the need to tamp down speculation by posting \u201cWe are not dating.\u201d",
      "Musk has a history of making provocative statements and sparring with leaders on X. Earlier this year, he posted messages insulting U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and saying the United Kingdom was headed for civil war. He has also clashed with a Brazilian supreme court justice over free speech, far-right accounts and purported misinformation on X, and also accused Venezuela\u2019s socialist president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, of \u201cmajor election fraud\u201d after that country\u2019s disputed election.",
      "Later Wednesday, an Italian representative of X, Andrea Stroppa, tweeted what appeared to be a statement from Musk that said he had spoken during the day with Meloni. According to Stroppa's tweet, Musk \u201cexpresses his respect\u201d for Mattarella and the Italian Constitution but insists on his right to freedom of expression.",
      "The courts\u2019 rulings have raised the ire of Meloni\u2019s far-right-led government, which has been seeking strategies to ease the strain on Italy of the arrival of migrants seeking a better life in Europe. The government had held up the opening of the Albanian centers as a centerpiece of its immigration crackdown, also as a means of deterrence, and said they could be a model for Europe.",
      "In both cases, Italian courts referred the cases to the EU court of justice in Luxembourg to rule if the countries of origin for the migrants are considered safe for repatriation. There is no word on when the European court might rule.",
      "But as a result of the Rome court decisions, no migrant has yet been processed in the Albanian centers, which are budgeted to cost Italy 670 million euros ($730 million) over five years to build and operate.",
      "Italy's opposition says the money could be much better spent on reinforcing Italian-operated migrant processing centers, while human rights groups say the outsourcing of asylum processing contravenes international law.",
      "The centers opened in October after a months-long delay, because crumbling soil at one of the facilities needed to be repaired. They are run by Italy and are under the country's jurisdiction, while Albanian guards provide external security."

      "Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency whose mascot is a super-cute dog that muses things like \u201cmuch wow,\u201d has been racing higher in value since Donald Trump won the presidential election last week. It got another bump after Trump named Tesla's Elon Musk as one of the heads of a new \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency,\u201d which is not a government agency but does have the acronym DOGE.",
      "All this makes sense and is maybe humorous for anyone who\u2019s chronically online. For others, here's some explanation about what's going on:",
      "It's a cryptocurrency, whose value rises and falls against the U.S. dollar based on however much people will pay for it.",
      "At first, it was seen as a joke. But over time, dogecoin has amassed a group of fans who have periodically sent its price soaring. Like other cryptocurrencies, supporters say it could be used to buy and sell things on the internet without having to worry about a central bank or government affecting how many are in circulation.",
      "One dogecoin \u2014 which is pronounced dohj-coin \u2014 was worth less than 16 cents just before Election Day. It's since more than doubled to nearly 38 cents, as of Wednesday afternoon, according to CoinDesk. It briefly got above 43 cents earlier Wednesday.",
      "Cryptocurrencies have generally been shooting higher since Trump's election. Bitcoin, which is the most famous digital currency, has set an all-time high above $93,000 after starting the year below $43,000.",
      "Excitement is racing because Trump has embraced crypto and said he wants the United States to be the \u201ccrypto capital of the planet\u201d and create a bitcoin \u201cstrategic reserve.\u201d",
      "Musk has become one of Trump's close allies. He's also been one of the most famous fans of dogecoin. In 2021, Musk played a character on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d who went by the nickname, the \u201cDogefather.\u201d",
      "In 2022, Musk made more headlines when he suggested Twitter should perhaps accept dogecoin as payment for subscriptions.",
      "It all came to a head Tuesday, when Trump announced the \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency,\u201d which will work from outside the government to offer the White House \u201cadvice and guidance\u201d and will partner with the Office of Management and Budget to \u201cdrive large scale structural reform, and create an entrepreneurial approach to Government never seen before.\u201d",
      "It has the acronym DOGE, which is also the ticker symbol under which dogecoin trades. Musk will lead it, along with former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy.",
      "Dogecoin's history is interesting.",
      "In 2021, on April 20, dogecoin fans tried but failed to get its value above $1 on what they were calling \u201cDoge Day.\u201d",
      "April 20 has long been an unofficial holiday for marijuana devotees, and Musk himself has referred to 420 several times in his career, including his tweet in 2018 saying he had secured funding to take Tesla private at a price of $420 per share.",
      "Sadly, no. The dog, whose real name was Kabosu, passed away in Japan earlier this year at 18 years old. Much rest, may she have."

    "story": [
      "A hacking group that is believed to be Chinese state-sponsored has compromised two websites with ties to the Tibetan community in an attack meant to install malware on users\u2019 computers",
      "BANGKOK -- A hacking group that is believed to be Chinese state-sponsored has compromised two websites with ties to the Tibetan community in an attack meant to install malware on users' computers, according to findings released Wednesday by a private cybersecurity firm.",
      "The hack of the Tibet Post and Gyudmed Tantric University websites appears geared toward obtaining access to the computers of people visiting to obtain information on them and their activities, according to the analysis by the Insikt Group, the threat research division of the Massachusetts-based cybersecurity consultancy Recorded Future.",
      "The hackers, known in the report as TAG-112, compromised the websites so that visitors are prompted to download a malicious executable file disguised as a security certificate, Insikt Group said. Once opened, the file loads Cobalt Strike Beacon malware on the user's computer that can be used for key logging, file transferring and other purposes, including deploying additional malware.",
      "\u201cWhile we do not have visibility into the activity that TAG-112 conducted on compromised devices in this campaign, given their likely cyber espionage remit and the targeting of the Tibetan community, it is almost certain that they were engaged in information collection and/or surveillance rather than destructive attacks,\u201d Insikt Group senior director Jon Condra told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cThis behavior aligns with historical targeting of the Tibetan community,\u201d he said.",
      "Chinese authorities have consistently denied any form of state-sponsored hacking, saying China itself is a major target of cyberattacks.",
      "The Chinese Foreign Ministry said it was not aware of the hacking of the two websites reported by the Insikt Group.",
      "\u201cChina's stance on the issue of cybersecurity is consistent and clear,\u201d the ministry said in a faxed reply to a request for comment without elaborating.",
      "According to the Insikt group research, the sites were first compromised in late May and the attacks bear many overlaps with a previously tracked hacker group known as TAG-102, leading analysts to conclude it is a subgroup of the already known group \u201cworking toward the same or similar intelligence requirements,\u201d Insikt Group said.",
      "Overlaps include reuse of specific tactics, techniques and procedures and going after identical targets, Condra said.",
      "\u201cThese two threat clusters are almost certainly interrelated,\u201d he said.",
      "TAG-102, known by multiple names such as Evasive Panda and StormBamboo, has been in operation since as early as 2012, and is widely thought to be a Chinese-sponsored advanced persistent threat, or APT, group, Insikt Group said.",
      "Among other things, it uses custom malware frameworks used by other Chinese APT groups and its targeting \u201caligns with likely Chinese intelligence requirements,\u201d Condra said.",
      "\u201cThe group has engaged in a wide variety of campaigns over the years, with an emphasis on targeting individuals and organizations in opposition to the Chinese government, such as human rights organizations, religious organizations, ethnic minority groups, academic institutions, and supporters of democracy or independence movements in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and even in mainland China,\u201d Insikt Group said.",
      "The university and the news website, which are both located in India, have been informed by Insikt Group of the hack. As of this week, it appears the Gyudmed Tantric University, which is a place of learning about Tibetan Buddhism, language, history and culture, has remediated the problem while the news website remained compromised, Condra said.",
      "The Tibet Post is known for promoting democracy, freedom of speech and for advocating Tibetan independence from China, he said.",
      "China claims Tibet has been part of its territory for centuries, although it only established firm control over the Himalayan region after the Communist Party swept to power during a civil war in 1949.",
      "Many Tibetans' loyalties still lie with the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader who has lived in exile in India since a failed anti-Chinese uprising in 1959.",
      "China has been regularly accused of human rights abuses in Tibet, including earlier this year over its efforts to forcibly urbanize villagers and herders as part of a drive to assimilate rural Tibetans through control over their language and traditional Buddhist culture."

      "An attorney representing two women who were witnesses in the House Ethics Committee's investigation into now-former Rep. Matt Gaetz is calling for the release of the committee's report, telling ABC News that one of his clients testified that she witnessed the Florida congressman having sex with a minor.",
      "\"My client testified to the House Ethics Committee that she witnessed Matt Gaetz having sex with a minor,\" Florida attorney Joel Leppard told ABC News.",
      "\"As the Senate considers former Rep. Gaetz's nomination for attorney general, several questions demand answers,\" Leppard said. \"What if multiple credible witnesses provided evidence of behavior that would constitute serious criminal violations?\"",
      "\"Democracy demands transparency. Release the Gaetz Ethics report,\" said Leppard, who represents two women who sat for closed-door testimony with the committee over the summer.",
      "Gaetz, who President-elect Donald Trump selected this week to serve as his attorney general, has long denied any wrongdoing, including have an inappropriate relationship with a minor. The Justice Department declined to charge Gaetz last year after a yearslong investigation into the allegations.",
      "In a statement issued in response to Leppard's claim, a spokesperson for Gaetz said, \"Merrick Garland's DOJ cleared Matt Gaetz and didn't charge him. Are you alleging Garland is part of a cover up?\"",
      "The two witnesses, who ABC News is not naming, both allegedly attended parties with the congressman. Gaetz's one-time friend Joel Greenberg is currently serving an 11-year prison sentence after reaching a deal with prosecutors in May 2021 in which he pleaded guilty to multiple federal crimes including sex trafficking of the woman when she was a minor and introducing her to other \"adult men\" who also had sex with her when she was underage.",
      "According to Greenberg's plea deal, the woman, who ABC News is not identifying, met Greenberg online in 2017 and began meeting him in hotels and houses in the Middle District of Florida, where he \"introduced the Minor to other adult men, who engaged in commercial sex acts with the Minor in the Middle District of Florida,\" court documents said.",
      "At the time, the minor \"represented that she was an adult\" on the website where she met Greenberg -- and according to his plea agreement, he acknowledges that he \"acted in reckless disregard of the fact that the Minor was less than 18 years old when he engaged in commercial sex acts\" and had a \"reasonable opportunity to observe\" that she was underage.",
      "Leppard's statement comes after attorney John Clune, who represents the former minor at the center of the probe, called for the release of the Ethics Committee's report on Thursday.",
      "\"Mr. Gaetz's likely nomination as Attorney General is a perverse development in a truly dark series of events. We would support the House Ethics Committee immediately releasing their report. She was a high school student and there were witnesses,\" Clune said in a statement.",
      "The woman, who is now in her 20s, testified to the House Ethics Committee that the now-former Florida congressman had sex with her when she was 17 years old and he was in Congress, ABC News previously reported.",
      "In a statement responding to that reporting, Gaetz said, \"These allegations are invented and would constitute false testimony to Congress. This false smear following a three year criminal investigation should be viewed with great skepticism.\"",
      "The Justice Department spent years investigating the allegations against Gaetz, including allegations of obstruction of justice, before informing Gaetz last year that it would not bring charges.",
      "Gaetz has long vehemently denied any wrongdoing related to the Justice Department probe. In September, he released a detailed response to questions sent to him by the House Ethics Committee, which was investigating allegations of alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.",
      "\"Your correspondence of September 4 asks whether I have engaged in sexual activity with any individual under 18. The answer to this question is unequivocally NO. You can apply this response to every version of this question, in every forum,\" Gaetz said in a statement posted to his social media account.",
      "Gaetz resigned from the House this week after being selected to lead Trump's Justice Department, which ended the House Ethics Committee's probe that sources tell ABC News had been entering its final stages. Prior to Gaetz's resignation, the committee had planned to meet this week to discuss whether to release their report on the investigation -- leaving it unclear if the report will ever see the light of day.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said on Friday that he does not think the House Ethics Committee should release the findings of its investigation into Gaetz, now that the Florida Republican is no longer a member of Congress.",
      "\"I believe it is very important to maintain the House's tradition of not issuing ethics reports on people who are no longer members of Congress. I think it would open a Pandora's box,\" he said.",

      "The attorney argued that the court \"should never have allowed the turnover\" of the Mercedes Benz, arguing that the car should be appraised and returned to Giuliani if the value does not exceed $5,500.",

      "\"Unfortunately for Mr. Woodward, the hate that fueled his thoughts was super disconcerting to this court and unfortunately reflects a larger societal ill that's currently raging throughout this country,\" she said.",
      "Orange County Senior Deputy District Attorney Jennifer Walker, who prosecuted the case, said during the hearing that the state wanted to continue with the scheduled sentencing, despite Woodward's illness, after bringing several people to the hearing.",
      "The defense attorney, Ken Morrison, told the court it was his preference for Woodward to be present, \"notwithstanding how difficult that would have been for him, how difficult all this has been and continues to be to his family.\"",
      "\"This is unpleasant for everybody, hopefully cathartic for some, as they search their path for healing,\" he said.",
      "The court heard several victim impact statements ahead of the sentencing, including ones delivered by Bernstein's parents.",
      "His mother, Jeanne Pepper, said her son was \"handsome, well-liked, accomplished, loved and good at everything he tried -- the antithesis of the man that would murder him.\"",
      "She said Woodward was \"too cowardly\" to sit in the courtroom on Friday.",
      "Pepper recounted the fear she felt while her son was missing and the subsequent discovery of his body.",
      "\"I had to go to a cemetery with a broken heart and choose a grave for my 19-year-old son,\" she said. \"I couldn't believe this was real.\"",
      "She said she \"collapsed on the ground screaming\" when she learned he had been stabbed 28 times, and her health deteriorated following his murder.",
      "\"To lose my first-born child, my dream for the future, my partner in fun, is the single worst, most painful thing that has ever happened to me,\" she said.",
      "She remembered Bernstein as an incredible chef and writer, who had a beautiful singing voice and wanted to go to medical school.",
      "While Woodward remains in prison, she said they will be outside celebrating Bernstein's life and \"continuing to do good with others who work every day to make this world more caring, kind and safe for the Jewish and LGBTQ communities.\"",
      "\"Let's be clear -- this was a hate crime,\" she said. \"Sam Woodward ended my son's life because my son was Jewish and gay.\"",
      "His father, Gideon Bernstein, said his death led to the \"most dark and tragic days\" for his family and friends.",
      "\"The person at fault for this should have been in this room today,\" he said. \"He is guilty of disrupting the path of a brilliant future for Blaze, and yet I don't think that he realizes how many others he devastated along the way.\"",
      "He said living a good life \"is the best revenge that I can have after this crime,\" and urged the judge to hand down a sentence of life without the possibility of parole.",
      "Following their statements, Menninger reiterated that Woodward was not in court due to an illness.",
      "Bernstein's godmother, Hillary Gerber, asked that Woodward never be released from prison.",
      "\"Not a day goes by without the pain and loss of Blaze weighing on us,\" Gerber said. \"Knowing this was a deliberate, premeditated act only deepens our sadness, suffering and fear.\"",
      "Woodward faced life without the possibility of parole with the special circumstance of the hate crime.",
      "The defense asked the judge to strike the hate crime enhancement, while also arguing that there is a lesser hate crime enhancement that the court could impose. Morrison said he asked for a sentence of 28 years to life in his sentencing brief.",
      "Morrison said he was \"struggling with how to proceed\" during the hearing because there is a pending motion by the prosecution to seal his brief.",
      "Menninger said she has read his brief and doesn't have an opinion yet on the motion to seal it.",
      "Walker requested that the judge find that probation \"is not suitable for this defendant\" and sentence him to life in prison without the possibility of parole. She also argued that the lesser hate crime enhancement cited in the defense's sentencing brief is not applicable.",
      "The jury reached its verdict on July 3 following a nearly three-month-long trial in Orange County.",
      "During closing arguments, Morrison told jurors that Woodward is guilty of homicide but said the act was not a hate crime but a spontaneous, irrational one.",
      "\"You heard me right out of the gate tell you that my client was guilty,\" Morrison said. \"Guilty of a serious, violent homicide. But as you also know, there are many different kinds of homicide.\"",
      "Woodward testified during the trial that on the night of the murder, he went into a state of terror after thinking Bernstein may have been recording him while touching him sexually at the park, then pulled out a knife, ABC Los Angeles station KABC reported.",
      "Walker told jurors during closing arguments that Woodward's hatred of gay people and his affiliation with Atomwaffen Division -- a far-right, neo-Nazi group -- led him to plan the murder.",
      "\"He already had his bags, he was already talking to Atomwaffen people about going somewhere else, and he thought he was going to get away with it,\" she said. \"It's only by the grace of God that rain happened, and they found his body.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 21:08:33 -0500",
    "summary": "As President-elect Donald Trump names his cabinet picks, environmental groups are concerned over who he's chosen to regulate environmental and energy policies.",
    "story": [
      "Environmental groups are expressing concerns over some of Trump's cabinet picks.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump is quickly naming members of his cabinet and administration -- some of whom will oversee large government agencies responsible for everything from clean water and air to energy to how our public lands are managed.",
      "What Trump's picks can accomplish is largely based on the agency they oversee.",
      "Here's a look at what these potential cabinet heads would be responsible for after taking office.",
      "Trump tapped former Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin to head up the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "\"He will ensure fair and swift deregulatory decisions that will be enacted in a way to unleash the power of American businesses, while at the same time maintaining the highest environmental standards, including the cleanest air and water on the planet,\" Trump said. \"He will set new standards on environmental review and maintenance, that will allow the United States to grow in a healthy and well-structured way.\"",
      "The EPA works to protect the environment in the United States, particularly as it relates to human health.",
      "The agency includes scientists who study environmental issues at labs and academic institutions across the nation, a regulatory arm that implements environmental laws passed by Congress through national standards and grant-making programs that fund projects such as community clean-ups, recycling infrastructure, electric school buses and others.",
      "The \"deregulatory decisions\" Trump referenced in his announcement of Zeldin are widely expected by environmental groups to encompass a slew of rollbacks on Biden-era regulations and environmental protections around things such as emissions standards for vehicles and power plants.",
      "Aru Shiney-Ajay, the executive director of Sunrise Movement -- a youth-led climate advocacy group -- said the pick of Zeldin is \"yet another example of Trump filling his administration with unqualified loyalists who lack the expertise needed to manage essential federal agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency.\"",
      "Shiney-Ajay called Zeldin's record on climate \"appalling,\" emphasizing aspects of his congressional voting record, including voting against the Biden administration's key climate legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "Zeldin's record from his time in Congress does also include some pro-environmental votes that suggest a concern for water issues, including votes for allowing the EPA to set PFAS drinking water standards and a reauthorization of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.",
      "Trump tapped North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum to lead the Department of the Interior.",
      "DOI manages the nation's natural resources and public lands, in addition to navigating relationships with Native tribes and the conservation of the environment and endangered species.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the department has prioritized clean energy development, improving relationships with Tribal Nations and the conservation and restoration of public lands and waters through the \"America the Beautiful\" initiative.",
      "In his official announcement of Burgum, Trump said the governor's role as secretary of the Interior and chairman of a newly formed \"National Energy Council\" will lead to \"U.S. energy dominance,\" which was a key refrain for the president-elect on the campaign trail. He also expressed a desire to deemphasize longstanding regulations, similar to his comments about Zeldin's appointment as EPA administrator.",
      "Trump said the \"National Energy Council\" will consist of all departments and agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation and transportation of all forms of American energy.",
      "\"This Council will oversee the path to U.S. energy dominance by cutting red tape, enhancing private sector investments across all sectors of the economy, and by focusing on innovation over longstanding, but totally unnecessary, regulation,\" Trump said in the statement on Burgum's new role.",
      "Burgum's own brief presidential campaign included energy as one of his key priorities, with the governor saying he wanted to \"dramatically increase energy production\" in the U.S.",
      "Following the news that Burgum would head up the DOI under the incoming Trump administration, Kier\u00e1n Suckling, executive director at the Center for Biological Diversity -- a legally-focused nonprofit working to protect endangered species -- said Burgum would be \"disastrous\" in the role.",
      "\"Burgum will be a disastrous Secretary of the Interior who'll sacrifice our public lands and endangered wildlife on the altar of the fossil fuel industry's profits,\" Suckling claimed.",
      "His home state of North Dakota is the third largest provider of crude oil in the nation and has the third largest reserves, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The state also relies heavily on coal-fired power plants, which provide 55% of its electricity, though the state also has a sizable wind energy footprint with 36% of power coming from wind energy, according to the EIA.",
      "Trump has not yet named his pick for the Department of Energy, which is responsible for administering national energy policy, funding energy research and managing the U.S. nuclear infrastructure.",
      "One of DOE's key projects this year has been a study on the climate impacts of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) after the department announced a pause on LNG export project approvals.",
      "The production of LNG has boomed during both the Biden administration and Trump's first term. As of 2023, the U.S. is the world's leading exporter of LNG, according to the EIA.",
      "On Friday, House Republicans on the Energy and Commerce Committee released a letter calling for current DOE Secretary Jennifer Granholm to lift the pause, saying the study aims to, \"hamstring the incoming Presidential administration.\"",
      "\"The results of the 2024 presidential election are clear, and DOE leadership will soon change,\" the representatives wrote. \"As a traditional part of the peaceful transfer of power, DOE should immediately stop work on any plans to expand the scope of review or add new conditions to LNG export licenses. DOE should immediately lift the ban on LNG export approvals in compliance with the NGA and the District Court order.\"",

      "The president-elect spoke at America First Policy Institute's annual gala.",
      "Delivering his first public speech since winning the 2024 election, President-elect Donald Trump touted his victory and praised his allies at the America First Policy Institute Gala at Mar-a-Lago in Florida.",
      "Calling this year's the \"most consequential election,\" Trump recalled how he lost the popular vote in 2016 but won it this time around.",
      "\"They would say, 'he didn't win the popular vote.' And we won the popular vote by records now, which so nobody can say that anymore about us,\" Trump said.",
      "He also celebrated his newly selected Cabinet members and senior administration officials, many of whom were in attendance.",
      "Newly announced picks who attended the annual gala on Thursday evening, including Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.",
      "Notably, Trump did not give a shout out to former Rep. Matt Gaetz, who he had announced as his attorney general and who was also in attendance.",
      "As he provided pleasantries to several members in the room, Trump transitioned into complimenting Musk, with whom he's spent a significant amount of time since his victory.",
      "\"We have a man who has a seriously high IQ. You know, I'm a person that believes in high IQs, and his is about as high as they get,\" Trump said, thanking him for campaigning in Pennsylvania on his behalf.",
      "Trump then touted his pairing of Ramasamy and Musk to lead the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "\"They're going to be saving a lot of money and making our country stronger and better. And they'll be coming out with individual reports. But a big one toward the end. And you put those two together, it's going to be really great. So we look forward to seeing and working with Elon and that'll be a great experience,\" Trump said.",
      "Trump briefly mentioned his choice of RFK Jr. for the secretary of Health and Human Services.",
      "\"He wants to make people healthy. It's driven him pretty wild over the last number of years,\" Trump said, describing the position in a roundabout way: \"And today I nominated him for, I guess -- if you like health, and if you like people that live a long time, it's the most important position.\"",
      "However, he added a word of caution: \"I just looked at the news reports. People like you, Bobby. Don't get too popular, Bobby.\"",
      "At the end of his remarks, Trump blurted out that Burgum would be appointed Secretary of Interior. The formal announcement is due on Friday, and Trump teased that he would announce his pick for Secretary of Energy then, too.",
      "\"Hi, Doug. He's going to be announced tomorrow. And we have somebody else that's probably coming up with him to be announced, who's a big one. And we're going to do things with energy and with land interior. That is going to be incredible. And so, I look forward to doing the formal announcement,\" Trump teased.",
      "Trump also joked that his term's official start date should be marked as Nov. 6, claiming that the economy is already doing better since his victory.",
      "\"You have to start my term from November 5th, okay? Or November 6th if you want ... November 5th, because the market's gone through the roof. Enthusiasms doubled. It's doubled in the last short while,\" Trump said.",
      "It's notable that the president-elect chose to deliver his first public speech since his victory at an event for America First Policy Institute, signaling the organization's role in Trump's forthcoming agenda.",
      "\"I really want to congratulate Linda, you and Brooke, for the job you've done. And it's an honor to be here,\" Trump closed, complimenting the AFPI executives.",
      "Trump was introduced by \"Rocky\" actor Sylvester Stallone, who delivered brief remarks that compared the president-elect to his own legacy film character and then to George Washington. Notably, Vice President Kamala Harris held her final campaign rally on the iconic \"Rocky steps\" in Philadelphia on the eve of the election.",
      "Before Trump took the stage, speakers included AFPI President Brook Rollins, AFPI board chair and Trump transition co-chair Linda McMahon, Argentine President Javier Millei, Ramaswamy and Larry Kudlow.",
      "After Trump spoke, Musk delivered a short speech as well, doubling down on his promise to gut the federal government.",
      "Trump's decision to deliver his first full speech on camera at the America First Policy Institute gala symbolized a move away from his campaign to his transition efforts \u2013 and a celebration of the AFPI's work for four years to quietly prepare for such a moment, building out Trump-aligned policy agenda for his second term and housing hundreds of former Trump administration officials who are now ready to go into his second administration.",
      "The ballroom was full of Trump allies of big and small names.",
      "Musk sat at a table at the front of the ballroom with Burgum, Ramawamy, Howard Lutnick and others named as Trump's senior White House officials, like Dan Scavino, Stephen Miller and James Blair. Gaetz was seen chatting with Kennedy.",
      "Reps. Ronny Jackson of Texas and Byron Donalds of Florida, whom Trump called a \"star\" in his speech, were seen seated together at a table farther back, while former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal was spotted mingling in the crowd ahead of the program.",
      "Donald Trump Jr., Kimberly Guilfoyle, Kellyanne Conway, Tulsi Gabbard and House Speaker Mike Johnson also attended the event.",

    "summary": "Across hours of interviews, defense secretary pick Pete Hegseth has articulated his plan for a \"frontal assault\" to reform the Department of Defense from the top down.",
    "story": [
      "Trump announced Hegseth as his nominee for Secretary of Defense on Tuesday.",
      "Across hours of podcast and television interviews, Army veteran and Fox News host Pete Hegseth has articulated his plan for a \"frontal assault\" to reform the Department of Defense from the top down, including by purging \"woke\" generals, limiting women from some combat roles, eliminating diversity goals and utilizing the \"real threat of violence\" to reassert the United States as a global power.",
      "As President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for the Secretary of Defense, Hegseth, 44, could have the chance to implement that vision, commanding the country's more than a million active duty soldiers.",
      "An infantry officer in the U.S. Army National Guard, Hegseth deployed to Guantanamo Bay, Iraq and Afghanistan before leaving the service with the rank of major, according to military records. Hegseth has worked for Fox News since 2014, where he co-hosts \"FOX & Friends Weekend.\" Once a critic of Trump's foreign policy and military stances during Trump's 2016 campaign, Hegseth grew to become one of Trump's fiercest on-air defenders.",
      "\"Pete is tough, smart and a true believer in America First. With Pete at the helm, America's enemies are on notice - Our Military will be Great Again, and America will Never Back Down,\" Trump said announcing the nomination.",
      "A New York Times best-selling author, Hegseth has frequently commented on military policy and suggested one of his first orders of business would be firing any generals who supported the Pentagon's diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.",
      "\"First of all, you got to fire the Chairman Joint of the Chiefs and obviously going to bring in a new Secretary of Defense, but any general that was involved -- general, admiral, whatever -- that was involved in, any of the DEI woke s---, has got to go,\" Hegseth said during a recent interview on the \"Shawn Ryan Show\" podcast. \"Either you're in for warfighting, and that's it. That's the only litmus test we care about.\"",
      "Hegseth had preemptively defended the move, saying it would be a return to normalcy for soldiers rather than a \"MAGA takeover.\"",
      "While Hegseth has described countries like Russia and China as threats, he has framed the military's biggest threat as an internal one, arguing that \"wokeness\" divided the military internally and created an issue that adversaries can exploit.",
      "\"I think our biggest threat is internal. I think we're committing cultural suicide, and we've lost complete focus on the basics and building blocks of what made Western civilization in America exceptional, fruitful, prosperous, strong, free,\" Hegseth said on the podcast.",
      "Hegseth has proposed a wholesale purge of military officials who have supported DEI policies, urging a \"frontal assault right back at what's been done to this military from the top and to the bottom.\"",
      "\"The dumbest phrase on planet Earth in the military is our diversity is our strength,\" Hegseth said on the podcast, arguing that uniformity between soldiers is a key to the military's strength.",
      "\"Every time I hear a military leader say [diversity is our strength], I throw up in my mouth a little bit more, because if they believe it, it shows you how sideways and how indoctrinated they are,\" Hegseth said on \"The Right Take With Mark Tapson\" podcast.",
      "While 17.5% of active-duty military personnel are women, Hegseth has argued that military leaders should acknowledge that their main constituency is \"strong, normal men,\" rebuffing efforts to diversify the ranks of the armed services.",
      "\"There aren't enough lesbians in San Francisco to staff the 82nd Airborne like you need, you need the boys in Kentucky and Texas and North Carolina and Wisconsin,\" Hegseth said on Tapson's podcast earlier this year.",
      "Hegseth was on the \"Take It Outside with Jay Cutler and Sam Mackey\" podcast and said that transgender soldiers are \"not deployable\" because they are \"reliant on chemicals\" and suggested that women should not serve in certain combat roles.",
      "\"Everything about men and women serving together makes the situation more complicated, and complication in combat means casualties are worse,\" Hegseth said on Ryan's podcast, arguing that men are \"more capable\" in combat roles because of biological factors.",
      "An ardent defender of the president-elect, Hegseth has argued that the United States military under Trump was more effective by posing both \"uncertainty\" and the \"real threat of violence.\"",
      "\"At least under Trump, there were missiles falling on terrorists' heads,\" Hegseth said on the \"Man of War\" podcast with Rafa Conde. \"They knew he meant business. Kim Jong Un, even though it didn't work, knew Trump meant business. Fire and fury was a real thing. Uncertainty is a real thing. The real threat of violence is a real thing, and none of that exists under these globalists who think they can sanction their way.\"",
      "He has also criticized international institutions like the United Nations as a \"farce\" and \"giant joke\" while advocating a military policy that aims to end long-term conflicts through decisive action.",
      "\"We expect this clinically sanitized, you know, no civilian casualties. Everything's going to be perfect. No one's going to get hurt, everything. It's just not how war operates, and that's unfortunate,\" Hegseth said on \"The Way I Heard It with Mike Rowe\" podcast. \"But if we try to do it with kid gloves or with surgical gloves, we're never really going to get rid of, actually exterminate the enemies that we need to defeat to create a peace on the other side.\"",

      "Trump said that Kennedy will \"restore\" the agencies under HHS \"to the traditions of Gold Standard Scientific Research, and beacons of Transparency, to end the Chronic Disease epidemic, and to Make America Great and Healthy Again!\"",
      "HHS oversees major health agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, among others.",
      "The job requires Senate confirmation.",

      "Kennedy has broadly advised Trump and the transition team on health related-appointments, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News. Kennedy had also been spotted at Mar-a-Lago multiple times and had been engaging in presentations that included candidates for specific Cabinet and health related jobs, sources said. Kennedy and multiple advisors, including daughter-in-law Amaryllis Fox and spokeswoman Stefanie Spear, were at Mar-a-Lago Thursday afternoon, a person familiar with their movements told ABC News.",
      "Kennedy has been an anti-vaccine activist and founded the Children's Health Defense, a prominent anti-vaccine nonprofit that has campaigned against immunizations and other public health measures like water fluoridation. Medical experts expressed concerns about a rise in medical misinformation through Kennedy's candidacy. Notably, Kennedy has falsely claimed that childhood vaccines cause autism, despite the retraction of the study that originally suggested this link, and numerous subsequent high-quality studies disproving this theory.",
      "Earlier this month, Kennedy claimed in an NPR interview that he has \"never been anti-vaccine.\"",
      "\u201cIf vaccines are working for somebody, I\u2019m not going to take them away. People ought to have a choice, and that choice ought to be informed by the best information. So, I\u2019m going to make sure scientific safety studies and ethics are out there, and people can make individual assessments about whether that product is going to be good for them,\" Kennedy told NPR.",
      "Kennedy has said publicly that he wants to reduce government overreach, which he often frames as an issue of medical freedom.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump touted Kennedy's role in helping him \"straighten out our health,\" but joked that he's worried about his strong stance on the environment, Trump saying he wants to keep drilling.",
      "Trump first floated the idea of Kennedy leading his administration's health efforts during the Al Smith Dinner last month. He said Kennedy will \"make us a healthier place.\"",
      "\"We're gonna let him go wild for a little while, then I'm gonna have to maybe rein him back, because he's got some pretty wild ideas, but most of them are really good,\" Trump said at the dinner. \"I think he's a he's a good man, and he believes, he believes the environment, the healthy people. He wants healthy people, he wants healthy food. And he's going to do it. He's going to have a big chance to do it, because we do need that.\"",
      "Trump and Kennedy haven't always gotten along with both hurling insults throughout their campaigns.",
      "When Kennedy first signaled plans to jump into the 2024 race, Trump said he felt confident that Kennedy would take votes away from President Joe Biden, labeling him a far-left liberal.",
      "\"Kennedy is a Radical Left Democrat, and always will be!!! It's great for MAGA, but the Communists will make it very hard for him to get on the Ballot,\" Trump posted on his social media platform in March.",

      "New York City Mayor Eric Adams dodged questions by the hosts of \"The View\" Friday about a potential pardon from President-elect Donald Trump over his ongoing federal investigators.",
      "However, he had a lot to say about how Trump won the election and how both sides of the aisle needed to rethink their toxic rhetoric.",
      "Adams has been in the hot seat for over a year as federal investigators have probed several of his closest confidants and deputies, leading to mass resignations and scandals that all came to a head in September when Adams became the first sitting New York City mayor to be indicted on bribery charges.",
      "The mayor has pleaded not guilty and maintained his innocence and has had the backing of Trump who claimed Adams was unjustly charged by federal prosecutors.",
      "When asked by \"The View\" co-host Sunny Hostin about allegations that he was cozying up to the president-elect to help make a potential pardon a possibility, Adams did not answer. Instead, he reiterated his previous claims that he intends to work for the city as his legal team fights the charges.",
      "\"My job is to do what I have been doing since Jan. 1, 2022,\" he said.",
      "Federal prosecutors charged Adams with one count of wire fraud, one count of conspiracy, two counts of solicitation of a contribution from a foreign national and one count of bribery.",
      "The indictment stems from alleged gifts, including upgraded airline flights and luxury hotel stays, given by Turkish businessmen and officials in exchange for preferential treatment by the mayor.",
      "The trial against Adams is slated to begin in April. The investigation is ongoing and prosecutors have indicated there could be more people charged.",
      "While Adams said his lawyers will handle the case, he said he and his officials are already preparing for various scenarios that Trump may inflict on the city.",
      "Adams went into more detail about Trump's mass deportation proposal. The mayor said that New York has always welcomed immigrants and law-abiding immigrants and families will be protected, but stressed that the nation's immigration system is broken and the best solutions would stem from addressing those underlying issues.",
      "He said the migrant crisis cost the city billions of dollars, and no one has provided it with the means or resources to deal with the over 200,000 migrants who were shipped to the city from other states.",
      "\"I'm not allowed to let them work (legally),\" he said. \"I'm not allowed to get them to participate in our tax system.\"",
      "Adams said both sides of the political aisle needed to turn down the rhetoric and name-calling that has perpetuated the discourse for years. The mayor implied that the toxic rhetoric was a reason behind Trump's victory, especially in the city where the former president gained ground among the electorate.",
      "\"What you saw in this city and a city becoming redder is because we stopped talking about broken class issues,\" Adams said.",
      "\"They're not talking about fascism, they're talking about finance. They're not talking about Hitler, they're talking about housing,\" the mayor added, referencing the statements from Trump opponents that he was a fascist.",

      "In the podcast interview, Hegseth said that the decision to allow women to serve in ground combat units has lowered the physical standards for those wishing to serve in those units.",
      "Panetta recalled that in the lead-up to his decision, he pushed back on the notion that allowing women to serve in combat units would lower physical standards.",
      "\"We shouldn't lower the standards. We should require that women have to meet exactly the same standards as men do, and that's what they do,\" he says he argued at the time. \"They wouldn't be in those positions if they weren't able to be able to meet the standards that are required.\"",
      "Panetta said, \"The mere fact that that has just not become an issue at all in terms of how the military has performed, is a reflection that the simple reason is because both men and women are living up to the same standards when it comes to fighting for America.\"",
      "Of the more than one million active-duty military personnel, 17.5% are women according to the Pentagon's latest statistics.",
      "The process of integrating women into combat units was a gradual one that began in 1993 when Defense Secretary Les Aspin issued an order that allowed women to fly in combat.",
      "But women were not allowed to serve in ground combat units until 2013, when Panetta rescinded the ban that was subsequently enhanced in 2015 by Defense Secretary Ash Carter who cleared the path for women to serve in the jobs that were still limited to men, including some in special operations.",
      "By 2019, more than 600 female Sailors and Marines were serving in combat arms units previously restricted to men, while more than 650 women held Army combat roles and over 1,000 had accessed Army combat specialties.",
      "Currently more than 2,500 women serve in previously closed ground combat jobs, 152 women have passed the elite Ranger School test, and 10 of them serve as Rangers in the 75th Ranger Regiment, according to a review of military personnel information compiled by Retired Army Col. Ellen Haring, with the Service Women's Action Network.",
      "Haring points out that the full integration of women into combat units actually occurred during President Trump's first term and that standards have never been lowered to accommodate women.",
      "\"Women have been serving in combat jobs for almost 10 years now and there is absolutely no evidence that women have harmed combat units,\" she told ABC News. \"In fact, many standards had to be established when they were considering admitting women because they had previously been loosely defined.\"",
      "\"Those who claim they have been lowered have no actual knowledge of the training requirements or how women have been held to the exact same requirements,\" she said. \"If they think standards have changed or are different for women then I challenge them to go to Fort Moore today and watch the execution of training.\"",
      "Twenty years ago, Allison Jaslow headed a convoy security unit in Iraq that regularly came under smalls arms fire and was exposed to explosions from roadside bombs.",
      "\"Women have not only been in combat for some time, but many are tougher than many of their male counterparts. Need proof? Look at the women who've graduated from Ranger School, which is so grueling that around half of the men who enter it fail out,\" said Jaslow in a statement issued in her role as the CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.",
      "\"Those women deserve a Secretary of Defense who is aware of that reality and also ensures that the culture in the military embraces that reality - especially as we still continue to confront a recruitment crisis,\" she added.",
      "Garrett Jordan, a former Army captain, served in integrated combat units, and counts some of his female classmates at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point as among those who are now Army Rangers or have commanded infantry and armor companies.",
      "\"Women have served in combat arms units, in both command and enlisted positions, and continue to do so and excel,\" he said.",
      "As a former Army officer, Jordan said he is \"well aware of the physical endurance, technical competence, and mental fortitude that it takes to serve in a tank unit and to perform the duties and responsibilities as a soldier in a combat arms branch.\"",
      "Jordan said women in the training classes he commanded \"maintained the standard, just as much as their male counterparts,\" he said.",
      "\"Ultimately, gender does not determine whether or not someone has the physical strength, or competency to serve in these units,\" said Jordan. \"There is a standard, and if soldiers, regardless of gender are meeting it, then they should have the opportunity to serve in these units.\"",

      "The ancient Roman Colosseum will be the venue of gladiator fights for the first time in two millennia under a $1.5 million sponsorship deal with Airbnb",
      "ROME -- The ancient Roman Colosseum will be the venue of gladiator fights \u2014 albeit staged \u2014 for the first time in two millennia under a $1.5 million sponsorship deal with Airbnb that aims to promote \u201ca more conscious tourism.\u201d",
      "But some visitors to the monument Thursday, as well as housing activists, were skeptical about the value of the arrangement, citing ongoing controversies in many cities over the role of short-term rental platforms in fueling overtourism and limiting affordable housing for residents and students.",
      "Under the deal announced by Airbnb and the Colosseum on Wednesday, the sponsorship by the short-term rental giant will cover the renewal of an educational program inside the ancient Roman amphitheater covering the history of the structure and gladiators.",
      "Eight of the platform's users and their plus-ones will be able to participate in faux gladiator fights after the Colosseum's closing time on May 7-8, taking the same underground route used by gladiators in ancient Rome to reach the arena. People can apply for the experience on Nov. 27 at no cost, and the \u201cgladiators\u201d will be chosen by lottery.",
      "The superintendent of the Colosseum Archaeological Park, Alfonsina Russo, told The Associated Press that the deal is in conjunction with the release of Ridley Scott's new film \u201cGladiators II,\" which opened in Italy on Thursday.",
      "Russo characterized the sponsorship arrangement as one of the many such deals to help finance projects at the park.",
      "The Italian fashion brand Tod's, for example, has funded a multimillion renovation of the Roman monument, including a cleaning, replacing the locking system of arches with new gates and redoing the subterranean areas.",
      "Alberto Campailla, the coordinator of the Nonna Roma nonprofit organization that focuses on housing and food for the poor, called the campaign with Airbnb \u201ca disgrace,\u201d and a form of \u201ctouristification.\u201d",
      "Airbnb and other platforms offering short-term rentals \u201care literally driving people out of not only the city center, but also the outskirts and suburban neighborhoods,\u201d Campailla said.",
      "Tourists from other European cities grappling with overtourism also took issue with the deal.",
      "\u201cIt seems to me that the purpose of the Colosseum today is to be a tourist attraction, but not to create an amusement park within it,\u201d said Jaime Montero, a tourist visiting from Madrid. \u201cIn the end, tourism eats the essence of the cities, here in Rome, as in other capitals.\u201d",
      "Visiting from Naples, Salvatore Di Matteo saw the deal as \u201cyet another takeover of the territory\u201d by big companies.",
      "\"If they start to touch sacred monuments such as the Colosseum here in Rome, it is obviously something that should make us think and is, in any case, a bit worrying,\" he said.",
      "The Colosseum is the most important and largest amphitheater constructed by the ancient Romans. Built in the 1st century, it was the center of popular entertainment, hosting hunts and gladiator games, until the 6th century.",

      "The city of Florence is taking new measures to crack down on overtourism",
      "ROME -- The city of Florence took new measures Tuesday to crack down on overtourism, just as the Italian government hosts the Group of Seven tourism ministers in the Renaissance city and seeks to significantly boost the country\u2019s place as a top visitor destination.",
      "Mayor Sara Funaro\u2019s Cabinet approved a 10-point plan that, among other things, would ban key boxes on buildings in Florence\u2019s historic center as well as the use there of loudspeakers by tour guides, a statement from City Hall said.",
      "The keyboxes \u2014 small boxes with a digital pad that are used by owners of short-term rental apartments to easily leave keys for visitors \u2014 have become something of the symbol of local Florentine anger at tourists, whose numbers have rebounded after COVID-19.",
      "In a recent protest, Florentines taped red Xs over the keyboxes, outraged at the transformation of the city center and its magnificent palazzi and narrow streets into a collection of short-term vacation rentals that have displaced local residents and the long-standing businesses that served them.",
      "According to national statistics bureau ISTAT, 2023 saw the most visitors ever in Italy with 134 million arrivals and 451 million people staying in hotels or other registered lodgings. The number of visitors opting for non-hotel lodging grew nearly 17% compared to 2022, ISTAT said in a June report.",
      "Italy ranks fourth on the U.N. World Tourism Barometer of international tourist destinations, after France, Spain and the United States. The tourism industry contributed some 10.5% of Italy\u2019s gross domestic product in 2023, according to Statista research.",
      "Florence, long run by the center-left, last year announced a ban on new short-term private rentals in the center in hopes of stemming the exodus of locals. It has repeatedly pressed for a special regulation from the national government, currently headed by right-wing Premier Giorgia Meloni, to cap the number of days a property can be rented out at 120.",
      "To date, only Venice has been permitted to limit short-term rentals. The lagoon city has been drowning under overtourism for years and this year began imposing a day-tripper tax to try to regulate tourist flows.",
      "The right-left political divide over Florence and its tourism woes could come to a head precisely as Italy hosts the G7 tourism ministers starting Wednesday in Florence.",
      "At a warm-up event this weekend, Tourism Minister Daniela Santanche acknowledged some art cities were suffering from too many visitors. But she said that overall Italy is hardly taking advantage of its tourism potential and needed 50 million visitors more a year.",
      "Lamenting Italy\u2019s fourth-place position on the list of the world's top destinations, she said Italy needed to sustainably grow its tourism potential with quality offerings.",
      "\u201cWe can grow much more, we can develop much more and the industry of tourism can truly become the leading industry of our nation,\u201d she said.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A tech consultant charged with murder in Cash App founder Bob Lee\u2019s stabbing death sparred with the lead prosecutor at trial Thursday, interrupting questions asked of him with his own questions as he was grilled on his testimony.",
      "Nima Momeni, 40, had to be told several times by the judge to provide responsive answers.",
      "He broke his public silence after 18 months when he took the witness stand Wednesday to explain how Lee was found staggering on a deserted downtown San Francisco street at 2:30 a.m. on April 4, 2023, dripping a trail of blood and calling for help. He later died at a hospital.",
      "Momeni testified Lee, 43, suddenly pulled a knife on him after he cracked a \u201cbad joke\u201d suggesting Lee should spend his last night in the city with family instead of trying to visit a strip club. He said Lee later walked away, showing no signs he was injured.",
      "His testimony stunned Lee's father, brother and ex-wife, who have been a steadfast presence in the criminal trial. They say Lee was big-hearted and gentle, and close to his two children and ex-wife.",
      "\u201cWhat you have seen is Nima be aggressive on the stand, you\u2019ve seen him just trying to take control of this room, his arrogance and his entitlement are on full display here,\u201d said the victim's brother, Timothy Oliver Lee, speaking with reporters outside the court room Thursday.",
      "\u201cThis is insane,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of this is ridiculous.\u201d",
      "The trial is in its fifth week. Momeni faces 26 years to life if convicted.",
      "Lee\u2019s death stunned the tech community as fellow executives and engineers penned tributes to the charismatic entrepreneur\u2019s generosity and brilliance. He was chief product officer of cryptocurrency platform MobileCoin when he died.",
      "Prosecutors say Momeni planned the April 4 attack after a dispute over his younger sister, Khazar Momeni, with whom Lee was friends. Momeni had picked up his sister from the home of a drug dealer introduced to her by Lee, and she said she may have been sexually assaulted after ingesting a date-rape drug called GHB.",
      "They say Momeni was angry with Lee so he took a knife from his sister\u2019s condo, and after the pair was kicked out of her place at 2 a.m., he drove Lee to a secluded area and stabbed him three times and then fled.",
      "Omid Talai, the assistant district attorney, grilled Momeni on Thursday on details of exactly how the attack unfolded. He asked Momeni why he did not call police after the attack and learning Lee had died, and why he did not respond to his sister's text asking where he had dropped off Lee.",
      "Momeni said he did not learn of Lee\u2019s death until the following day and was puzzled by his sister\u2019s query. He said he thought Lee could have been stabbed by someone else shortly after he saw him walk off, unharmed.",
      "In response to questions, Momeni said he didn't know what the prosecutor was getting at, accused him of misrepresenting his statements and said he had already answered.",
      "At one point, San Francisco Superior Court Judge Alexandra Gordon said that the prosecutor had no obligation to provide him with a printout of the texts he was questioning him about or to put them on the multimedia screen.",
      "\u201cGotcha,\u201d said Momeni, dressed in a blue suit and tie. \u201cThank you for clarifying.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors have video showing Lee and Momeni leaving Khazar Momeni's condo after 2 a.m. and driving off together in Momeni\u2019s BMW. Video also shows the two men getting out of the car in an isolated spot by the Bay Bridge.",
      "Prosecutors say that is where Momeni stabbed Lee, while the defense says that is where Lee attacked Momeni, erratic and aggressive from a multi-day bender of cocaine, ketamine and drinking.",
      "A knife recovered from the area where Lee was stabbed showed Momeni's DNA on the handle, but the defense said the handle should have been tested for fingerprints, namely Lee\u2019s.",
      "Momeni said he and Lee were on friendly terms when they left his sister's condo, but prosecutors say the defendant grilled the entrepreneur earlier in the evening about what might have happened to his sister at the drug dealer's apartment.",
      "The prosecutor pointed out multiple times Thursday that Momeni was questioning him the way he grilled Lee.",
      "Nima Momeni was 14 when his mother, Mahnaz Tayarani, took him and Khazar to the U.S., fleeing Iran and a husband who had inflicted years of abuse and violence on the family, she wrote in a letter submitted to the court in support of her son\u2019s pre-trial release.",
      "She has sat on one side of the courtroom while Lee's family members sit on the other."

      "After a resounding election victory, President-elect Donald Trump and Republicans say they have a mandate to govern",
      "WASHINGTON -- After a resounding election victory, delivering what President-elect Donald Trump and Republicans said is a mandate to govern, an uneasy political question is emerging: Will there be any room for dissent in the U.S. Congress?",
      "Trump is laying down a gauntlet even before taking office challenging the Senate, in particular, to dare defy him over the nominations of Matt Gaetz, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other controversial choices for his Cabinet and administration positions.",
      "The promise of unified government, with the Republican Party\u2019s sweep of the White House and GOP majorities in the House and Senate, is making way for a more complicated political reality as congressional leaders confront anew what it means to line up with Trump\u2019s agenda.",
      "\u201cThis is going to be a red alert moment for American democracy,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said on CNN after Trump tapped Gaetz for attorney general.",
      "Trump is returning to the White House at the height of his political power, having won both the Electoral College and the popular vote for his party for the first time in decades. The trifecta in Washington offers a tantalizing political opportunity for Republicans, opening up a universe of political and policy priorities \u2014 from tax cuts to mass deportations to the gutting of the regulatory and federal bureaucracy, along with Trump's vows to seek vengeance and prosecution of his perceived enemies and pardon those who attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "But for Congress, it\u2019s also a potentially existential moment, one that is testing whether its status as a co-equal branch of U.S. government can withstand a second Trump administration.",
      "\u201cOne of the possible futures for Congress is that it becomes a rubber stamp,\u201d said Phillip Wallach, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, who writes extensively about Congress.",
      "Wallach said the threat to Congress has been on his mind, but he also believes it would be more pronounced if Republicans had won larger majorities. The House, in fact, may end up with slimmer numbers, and the Senate's 53-seat advantage, while more than the simple majority needed to confirm nominees, can hardly be seen as mandates.",
      "Besides, \u201cthey\u2019re not wimps,\u201d he said of elected lawmakers. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for them to just turn themselves into a doormat.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a changed Washington from Trump\u2019s first term. Congress has been purged of his strongest critics. At the same time, the Supreme Court has shifted dramatically rightward, with three Trump-appointed justices, and a majority decision over the summer that granted the president broad immunity from prosecution.",
      "Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks are posing the biggest early test for Congress.",
      "While Trump's choice of Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., for secretary of state is expected to have somewhat broad support, including from Democrats, others like Kennedy, Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence and Pete Hegseth as defense secretary are raising more scrutiny.",
      "The choice of Gaetz, a fierce Trump loyalist who talks about the wholesale upheaval of the Justice Department, is all the more troubling for senators because of a House ethics probe over alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. He denies the allegations but submitted his resignation from Congress as soon as he was nominated, effectively shutting down the probe.",
      "Sen. Dick Durbin, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which would consider the Gaetz nomination, called on the House to \u201cpreserve and share their report\" with the panel.",
      "Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, a Republican member of the Judiciary committee, said he expects \u201cany and all\u201d information on the nominees will be made available.",
      "Other Republicans in the House and Senate stood with Gaetz, supporting his effort to take on the Justice Department over what they see as perceived bias, particularly over its prosecutions of Trump for trying to overturn the 2020 election ahead of the Capitol attack and for hoarding classified documents.",
      "\"I know the Democrats are clutching their pearls right now, and they\u2019re very, very upset about everything,\" said Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., on Fox News.",
      "\u201cBut if you think about how they have weaponized the DOJ, this is a situation that needs serious reform,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s President Trump\u2019s prerogative to choose who he wants to nominate.\u201d",
      "Incoming Senate GOP Leader John Thune said confirming Trump's nominations will be a priority next year and senators \u201cshould expect an aggressive schedule until his nominees are confirmed.\u201d",
      "Complicating the matter for senators is the Trump campaign's decision to not engage, so far, in the traditional transition process, having declined to sign agreements with the federal government that would launch FBI background checks of nominees, among other standard steps before confirmation hearings.",
      "Senators may be forced to consider nominees that have not been vetted in the traditional ways.",
      "Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., a former member of the House Intelligence Committee, worried Americans may be left in the dark about their top officials. \u201cPeople have a right to know who\u2019s leading critical aspects of their government,\u201d he said.",
      "Intensifying his demands on the Senate, Trump suggested it should consider so-called recess appointments of his nominees \u2014 a highly unorthodox request that essentially asks the Senate to drop its constitutional advise-and-consent role and allow his nominees to be installed without a vote.",
      "Wallach said if senators chose that route it would be \u201can act of extreme institutional self-sabotage.\u201d",
      "Congress has been here before, in the first Trump administration, when the White House tested the limits of its executive power.",
      "One of the most significant confrontations of that earlier Trump era was over his promised border wall, when the White House tried to poach congressionally approved funds for military base construction projects and repurpose them for the wall between the U.S. and Mexico.",
      "Congress largely won that round, after long fights, but it's about to be tested in new ways.",
      "Trump is planning a series of executive orders on Day One of the new administration to launch his mass deportations and other priorities.",
      "Trump allies, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and influential commentator Charlie Kirk, have warned of consequences in the form of primary challenges to senators who fail to confirm nominees.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the on-again-off-again Trump ally, said he typically confirms a president's nominees, regardless of party, and intends to be a yes vote again.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump's vision for education revolves around a single goal: to rid America\u2019s schools of perceived \u201c wokeness \u201d and \u201cleft-wing indoctrination.\u201d",
      "The president-elect wants to forbid classroom lessons on gender identity and structural racism. He wants to abolish diversity and inclusion offices. He wants to keep transgender athletes out of girls\u2019 sports.",
      "Throughout his campaign, the Republican depicted schools as a political battleground to be won back from the left. Now that he\u2019s won the White House, he plans to use federal money as leverage to advance his vision of education across the nation.",
      "Trump\u2019s education plan pledges to cut funding for schools that defy him on a multitude of issues.",
      "On his first day in office, Trump has repeatedly said he will cut money to \u201cany school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content on our children.\u201d On the campaign trail, Trump said he would \u201cnot give one penny\u201d to schools with vaccine or mask requirements.",
      "He said it would be done through executive action, though even some of his supporters say he lacks the authority to make such swift and sweeping changes.",
      "Trump\u2019s opponents say his vision of America\u2019s schools is warped by politics \u2014 that the type of liberal indoctrination he rails against is a fiction. They say his proposals will undermine public education and hurt the students who need schools' services the most.",
      "\u201cIt's fear-based, non-factual information, and I would call it propaganda,\u201d said Wil Del Pilar, senior vice president for Education Trust, a research and advocacy organization. \u201cThere is no evidence that students are being taught to question their sexuality in schools. There is no evidence that our American education system is full of maniacs.\u201d",
      "Trump's platform calls for \u201cmassive funding preferences\u201d for states and schools that end teacher tenure, enact universal school choice programs and allow parents to elect school principals.",
      "Perhaps his most ambitious promise is to shut down the U.S. Education Department entirely, a goal of conservative politicians for decades, saying it has been infiltrated by \u201cradicals.\u201d",
      "America\u2019s public K-12 schools get about 14% of their revenue from the federal government, mainly from programs targeting low-income students and special education. The vast majority of schools' money comes from local taxes and state governments.",
      "Colleges rely more heavily on federal money, especially the grants and loans the government gives students to pay for tuition.",
      "Trump's strongest tool to put schools' money on the line is his authority to enforce civil rights \u2014 the Education Department has the power to cut federal funding to schools and colleges that fail to follow civil rights laws.",
      "The president can't immediately revoke money from large numbers of districts, but if he targets a few through civil rights inquiries, others are likely to fall in line, said Bob Eitel, president of the conservative Defense of Freedom Institute and an education official during Trump's first term. That authority could be used to go after schools and colleges that have diversity and inclusion offices or those accused of antisemitism, Eitel said.",
      "\u201cThis is not a Day One loss of funding,\u201d Eitel said, referencing Trump's campaign promise. \u201cBut at the end of the day, the president will get his way on this issue, because I do think that there are some real legal issues.\u201d",
      "Trump also has hinted at potential legislation to deliver some of his promises, including fining universities over diversity initiatives.",
      "To get colleges to shutter diversity programs \u2014 which Trump says amount to discrimination \u2014 he said he \u201cwill advance a measure to have them fined up to the entire amount of their endowment.\u201d",
      "His platform also calls for a new, free online university called the American Academy, to be paid for by \u201ctaxing, fining and suing excessively large private university endowments.\u201d",
      "During his first term, Trump occasionally threatened to cut money from schools that defied him, including those slow to reopen during the COVID-19 pandemic and colleges he accused of curbing free speech.",
      "Most of the threats came to nothing, though he succeeded in getting Congress to add a tax on wealthy university endowments, and his Education Department made sweeping changes to rules around campus sexual assault.",
      "Universities hope their relationship with the administration won\u2019t be as antagonistic as Trump\u2019s rhetoric suggests.",
      "\u201cEducation has been an easy target during the campaign season,\u201d said Peter McDonough, general counsel for the American Council on Education, an association of university presidents. \u201cBut a partnership between higher education and the administration is going to be better for the country than an attack on education.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s threats of severe penalties seem to contradict another of his education pillars \u2014 the extraction of the federal government from schools. In closing the Education Department, Trump said he would return \u201call education work and needs back to the states.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to end education coming out of Washington, D.C.,\u201d Trump said on his website last year. In his platform, he pledged to ensure schools are \u201cfree from political meddling.\u201d",
      "Rather than letting states and schools decide their stance on polarizing issues, Trump is proposing blanket bans that align with his vision.",
      "Taking a neutral stance and letting states decide wouldn't deliver Trump's campaign promises, said Max Eden, a senior fellow at AEI, a conservative think tank. For example, Trump plans to rescind guidance from President Joe Biden's administration that extended Title IX protections to LGBTQ+ students. And Trump would go further, promising a nationwide ban on transgender women in women's sports.",
      "\u201cTrump ran on getting boys out of girls' sports. He didn\u2019t run on letting boys play in girls' sports in blue states if they want to,\u201d Eden said.",
      "Trump also wants a say in school curriculum, vowing to fight for \u201cpatriotic\u201d education. He promised to reinstate his 1776 Commission, which he created in 2021 to promote patriotic education. The panel created a report that called progressivism a \u201cchallenge to American principles\u201d alongside fascism.",
      "Adding to that effort, Trump is proposing a new credentialing body to certify teachers \u201cwho embrace patriotic values.\u201d",
      "Few of his biggest education goals can be accomplished quickly, and many would require new action from Congress or federal processes that usually take months.",
      "More immediately, he plans to nullify executive orders issued by Biden, including one promoting racial equity across the federal government. He's also expected to work quickly to revoke or rewrite Biden\u2019s Title IX rules, though finalizing those changes would require a lengthier rulemaking process.",
      "Trump hasn\u2019t detailed his plans for student loans, though he has called Biden\u2019s cancellation proposals illegal and unfair.",
      "Most of Biden\u2019s signature education initiatives have been paused by courts amid legal challenges, including a proposal for widespread loan cancellation and a more generous loan repayment plan. Those plans could be revoked or rewritten once Trump takes office.",

      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Three former Memphis police officers charged with murder in the beating of Tyre Nichols will go on trial in April, a judge decided Friday.",
      "Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith have pleaded not guilty to state charges of second-degree murder in the death of Nichols, who was punched, kicked and hit with a police baton after he fled a traffic stop in January 2023.",
      "During a hearing Friday, Shelby County Judge James Jones Jr. scheduled their trial in state court for April 28. Jones also set a Nov. 25 hearing to discuss motions filed by defense attorneys to have the officers stand trial separately.",
      "The three were found guilty Oct. 3 of federal witness tampering charges in the death of Nichols, 29, whose beating was caught on police video that has been released to the public. Haley was also convicted on two federal civil rights violations and a charge of conspiracy to witness tamper. They are scheduled for sentencing on the federal convictions in January.",
      "The three, along with Emmitt Martin and Desmond Mills Jr., were part of a crime suppression team called the Scorpion Unit that was disbanded after Nichols' beating.",
      "Mills and Martin pleaded guilty ahead of the federal trial, and they testified for prosecutors. Their sentences are pending. Mills and Martin also are expected to change their pleas in state court, which allows them to avoid a murder trial.",
      "Nichols, who was Black, had run from a traffic stop despite being hit with pepper spray and a Taser. He died Jan. 10, 2023, three days after the beating. The five officers, who also are Black, were fired and then indicted in the death, which sparked national protests and calls for broad changes in policing.",
      "After officers caught up to Nichols, police body cameras and a security camera captured officers pummeling Nichols in a struggle just steps from his home as he cried out for his mother.",
      "The video shows the officers milling about, talking and laughing as Nichols struggles with his injuries. An autopsy report shows he died from blows to the head. The report describes brain injuries, along with cuts and bruises on his head and other areas.",
      "Attorneys for Bean and Smith have filed motions asking U.S. District Judge Mark S. Norris to throw out their federal convictions. Norris has not ruled on the motions."

      "NEW YORK -- A federal judge in Texas has blocked a new rule from the Biden administration that would have expanded access to overtime pay to millions more salaried workers across the U.S.",
      "On Friday, U.S. District Judge Sean Jordan sided with the state of Texas and a group of business organizations that argued the Labor Department exceeded its authority when it finalized a rule earlier this year to significantly expand overtime pay for salaried workers \u2014 ruling that the department could not prioritize employee wages over job duties when determining eligibility.",
      "Under the federal law, nearly all hourly workers in the U.S. are entitled to overtime pay after 40 hours a week. But many salaried workers are exempt from that requirement \u2014 unless they earn below a certain level.",
      "The Labor Department\u2019s now-scuttled rule would have marked the biggest increase to that cap in decades. Employers were required pay overtime to salaried workers who make less than $43,888 a year in certain executive, administrative and professional roles as of July 1 \u2014 and that was set to rise to $58,656 next year.",
      "The Labor Department estimated that an additional 4 million lower-paid salary workers would become eligible for overtime protections in the first year under the new rule. An additional 292,900 higher-compensated workers were also expected to get overtime entitlements through separate threshold increases.",
      "Now, the previous threshold of $35,568 \u2014 which was set in 2019 under the Trump administration \u2014 is poised to go back into effect.",
      "A spokesperson for the Labor Department did not immediately comment when reached by The Associated Press Friday. It was unclear if the department would attempt to appeal the decision from Jordan, who was nominated to his seat by Republican President-elect Donald Trump during his first term.",
      "At the time of the rule's finalization in April, acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su stated that the administration was \u201cfollowing through on our promise to raise the bar\" \u2014 noting that it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d for lower-paid salaried workers to do the same job as their hourly counterparts with no additional pay.",
      "Following the finalization of this year's rule, legal challenges bubbled up. A handful of trade groups argued the move would harm businesses and lead to costs that would potentially result in employers' needing to cut jobs or limit their workers' hours.",
      "David French, executive vice president of government relations for the National Retail Federation \u2014 one of the groups that challenged the Labor Department's rule \u2014 maintained in a statement Friday that the changes \u201cwould have curtailed retailers\u2019 ability to offer the most flexible, generous and tailored benefits packages to lower-level exempt employees across the industry.\u201d",
      "Friday\u2019s ruling is a bit of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In 2016, an Obama-era effort to similarly expand overtime pay eligibility was ultimately shot down in court after facing pushback from some business leaders and Republican politicians.",
      "The Trump adminstration later brought a smaller raise through, marking the first increase since 2004. Advocates pushing for higher overtime pay have stressed that it's far from enough \u2014 arguing that too many salaried workers are still cheated out of their time \u2014 but potential changes under Trump's upcoming second term are unlikely to meet the level of those demands."

      "Disgruntled X users are once again flocking to Bluesky, a newer social media platform that grew out of the former Twitter before billionaire Elon Musk took it over in 2022",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Disgruntled X users are again flocking to Bluesky, a newer social media platform that grew out of the former Twitter before billionaire Elon Musk took it over in 2022. While it remains small compared to established online spaces such as X, it has emerged as an alternative for those looking for a different mood, lighter and friendlier and less influenced by Musk.",
      "Championed by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Bluesky was an invitation-only space until it opened to the public in February. That invite-only period gave the site time to build out moderation tools and other features. The platform resembles Musk\u2019s X, with a \u201cdiscover\u201d feed and a chronological feed for accounts that users follow. Users can send direct messages and pin posts, as well as find \u201cstarter packs\u201d that provide a curated list of people and custom feeds to follow.",
      "Bluesky said in mid-November that its total users surged to 15 million, up from roughly 13 million at the end of October, as some X users look for an alternative platform to post their thoughts and talk to others online. The post-election uptick in users isn\u2019t the first time Bluesky has benefited from people leaving X. The platform gained 2.6 million users in the week after X was banned in Brazil in August \u2014 85% of them from Brazil, the company said. About 500,000 new users signed up in one day in October, when X signaled that blocked accounts would be able to see a user\u2019s public posts.",
      "Across the platform, new users \u2014 among them journalists, left-leaning politicians and celebrities \u2014 have posted memes and shared that they were looking forward to using a space free from advertisements and hate speech. Some said it reminded them of the early days of Twitter more than a decade ago.",
      "Despite Bluesky\u2019s growth, X posted after the election that it had \u201cdominated the global conversation on the U.S. election\u201d and had set new records.",
      "Bluesky, though, has bigger ambitions than to supplant X. Beyond the platform itself, it is building a technical foundation \u2014 what it calls \u201ca protocol for public conversation\u201d \u2014 that could make social networks work across different platforms \u2014 also known as interoperability \u2014 like email, blogs or phone numbers.",
      "Currently, you can\u2019t cross between social platforms to leave a comment on someone\u2019s account. Twitter users must stay on Twitter and TikTok users must stay on TikTok if they want to interact with accounts on those services. Big Tech companies have largely built moats around their online properties, which helps serve their advertising-focused business models.",
      "Bluesky is trying to reimagine all of this and working toward interoperability."

      "Louisiana House lawmakers have postponed a vote on a key plank in Gov. Jeff Landry's tax reform package",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Louisiana lawmakers on Thursday postponed a vote on a key bill in Gov. Jeff Landry's sweeping and complex tax reform package.",
      "Most of Landry's proposed bills, granting approximately $2 billion in income and corporate tax cuts, have moved smoothly through the House of Representatives during the state's third special legislative session of the year. But lawmakers have raised more resistance to a sales tax on dozens of services such as lawnmowing, getting tattoos and using coin-operated laundry machines.",
      "Tabling the bill, which would have raised an estimated $500 million to plug the revenue hole created by the tax cuts, raises questions about whether Landry and his allies have rounded up enough support. The GOP-dominated House requires 70 of its 105 members to vote in support of the bill.",
      "\u201cI think the bill is on life support if it isn\u2019t dead already,\u201d said Republican Rep. Joe Stagni.",
      "Exiting the House chamber on Thursday evening, Landry denied there were not enough votes to pass the bill.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t ever go in the kitchen halfway through the meal being cooked, judge it once it\u2019s cooked,\" Landry said.",
      "Rep. Julie Emerson, who is responsible for several of the tax reform bills, said some of her colleagues were opposed outright to the entire bill increasing taxes on services, while others had issues with specific services being taxed.",
      "In committee hearings, lobbyists have argued the proposed services to be taxed, including for property repairs and maintenance, would raise costs for small businesses and elevate insurance rates.",
      "But House lawmakers voted 71-23 to make a temporary 0.40% sales tax increase permanent. Lawmakers shaved off 0.05% to bring the state\u2019s proposed overall sales tax rate down to 4.40%. They also planned to repeal dozens of tax breaks, but would keep household groceries from being taxed.",
      "That sales tax expansion would raise around $820 million in annual revenue.",
      "\u201cWith a sales tax, a person has a choice,\" said Republican Rep. Mark Wright, who sponsored the increased sales tax bill. \u201cWith an income tax, there is no choice.\u201d",
      "Some fiscal conservatives have indicated opposition to levying new sales taxes on services, with a small group of Republicans voting against making the sales tax increase permanent.",
      "A group of Democratic lawmakers have also argued that the sales tax expansion will weigh more heavily on lower-income households.",
      "Louisiana\u2019s tax system is one of the most regressive in the nation, with lower-income families paying a higher percentage of their earnings toward income and sales taxes than wealthier households, according to research from the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. A study funded by a coalition of non-partisan economic policy groups found the proposed reforms would make the existing system modestly more progressive, but did not factor in potential increases in local sales taxes.",
      "Landry has said the tax reform is modeled after policies adopted by states like North Carolina and Texas, which he says are out-competing Louisiana economically. He has said passing the tax reform package will make the state more attractive for job-generating businesses, and his allies point out that the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank, currently ranks Louisiana as 40th in terms of tax competitiveness.",
      "Some lawmakers have questioned whether the proposed taxes on numerous services can be effectively enforced.",
      "Republican Rep. R. Dewith Carrier, representing several southwest Louisiana parishes, said in a committee hearing on Nov. 13 that he did not believe his constituents would fully comply with the new sales taxes.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t count on my district to do it, them boys they take cash, they\u2019ll trade it for a fifth ... of vodka or food stamps,\u201d he said.",
      "On Wednesday, the House passed a bill to reduce corporate income tax from a 7.5% to 3.5% flat rate and another to add new taxes on digital goods and services like online streaming sites, expected to bring in around $40 million a year. They have also passed bills to eliminate the 0.275% corporate franchise tax \u2014 worth more than $500 million in annual revenue \u2014 and to flatten the individual income tax to 3%, costing the state approximately $1.3 billion in revenue.",

      "SALISBURY, Md. -- Police in Maryland have arrested three more Salisbury University students on hate crime charges following an attack in which investigators say a man was lured to an off-campus apartment, beaten and called a homophobic slur.",
      "The latest arrests brought the number of defendants to 15 in the Oct. 15 attack, after a dozen others were arrested earlier this month. Police in Salisbury, a city of about 35,000 in the state\u2019s Eastern Shore region, said in a statement Thursday that they don\u2019t expect to make further arrests.",
      "In addition to assault and false imprisonment, the defendants face hate crime charges for allegedly targeting the victim because he\u2019s gay, police said. According to charging documents, one of the defendants made a fake account on a dating app and promised the victim sex with a 16-year-old.",
      "The man\u2019s age is not included in court documents. The legal age of consent in Maryland is 16 in most cases.",
      "Court records don\u2019t list attorneys for two of the three newest defendants. A lawyer for the other one declined to comment about the case.",
      "The Salisbury Police Department started investigating after two witnesses told campus police that they had seen a video of the assault, according to charging documents. Police said the victim received a broken rib and extensive bruising.",
      "Steve Rakow, an attorney for one of the students who was arrested previously, vehemently rejected the hate crime designation. He said the man never reported what happened because he was trying to have sex with a teenage boy.",
      "Salisbury University leaders have condemned the attack and pledged to make sure members of the LGBTQ+ community feel safe on campus. They held a unity walk on Monday to show their support."

      "As part of his sentence, Fariss has lost the right to hold statewide public office in Virginia or own and possess firearms, reports show.",

      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- Former President Donald Trump has chosen North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum to head the Interior Department. Some things to know about the two-term Republican governor of a sparsely populated state:",
      "Burgum, 68, grew up in tiny Arthur, North Dakota, population 328. He earned a bachelor's degree from North Dakota State University and his master\u2019s of business administration from the Stanford University Graduate School of Business.",
      "He went on to become a wealthy software executive. He led Great Plains Software, which Microsoft acquired for $1.1 billion in 2001. Burgum stayed on as a vice president until 2007. He's also led other companies in real estate development and venture capital.",
      "In 2016, Burgum ran for governor, his first campaign for elected office. He touted a message of \u201creinventing\u201d government as the state dealt with a massive revenue shortfall.",
      "In a major upset, Burgum defeated North Dakota's longtime attorney general in the Republican gubernatorial primary. He handily won his first term in the strong Republican state, which has about 784,000 residents.",
      "He was easily reelected in 2020.",
      "Burgum has taken a business-oriented bent as governor of North Dakota, where agriculture and oil are the main industries. He's pushed income tax cuts, reduced regulations, and changes to animal agriculture laws and higher education governance. Burgum also emphasized a \u201cdata-driven\u201d approach to governing, advocated for a Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library in the state and prioritized engagement with tribal nations.",
      "Burgum and his wife, Kathryn, have been public about her recovery from addiction, and as governor he has prioritized resources for addiction treatment.",
      "Burgum is known as a policy wonk who works long hours and is highly inquisitive.",
      "He has largely resisted wading into social issues, such as anti-LGBTQ measures pushed by members of his own party, vetoing a few such bills in 2021 and 2023. But also in 2023, as he was planning a run for president, he signed a pile of bills opponents said targeted transgender people. They included a ban on gender-affirming medical treatments for transgender kids, sports bans for transgender athletes, and transgender restrictions in schools.",
      "Burgum ran for president from June to December 2023. He campaigned on priorities of energy, economy and national security, but dropped out after his bid failed to resonate.",
      "He appeared in two Republican debates \u2014 including the first, which he attended after hurting his Achilles tendon playing basketball. He drew attention for his campaign offering $20 gift cards to people who would donate $1 to his campaign so he would have enough individual donors to make the debate stage.",
      "In January, before the Iowa caucuses, he endorsed Trump. The same month, he declined to seek a third term as governor.",
      "When he entered office in December 2016, he dealt with the final months of the sometimes-chaotic protests of the Dakota Access oil pipeline. He's led the state through terrible droughts and crippling storms.",
      "He was the face of North Dakota's response to the coronavirus pandemic, holding dozens of press conferences, many of them daily in early 2020, including an emotional plea about face masks. He and his wife publicly received their COVID vaccinations in 2021.",
      "Last year, amid his presidential campaign, Burgum called a special session for the Legislature to deal with a budget mess weeks after the state Supreme Court voided a crucial bill, putting some state funding in jeopardy.",

This time, Zepeda recorded Green painting the words \u201cHonor Them\u201d on the wall next to \u201cThe Shaw 54th Regiment Memorial,\u201d a mural that commemorates one of the first Black regiments of the Civil War.",
      "\u201cHe has been committing these very crimes his entire adult life. Indeed, he has made engaging in these types of offenses his profession,\u201d a prosecutor wrote.",
      "Defense attorney Stephen Brennwald said Zepeda was shocked to learn how much it cost to clean up the mess that he helped make.",
      "\u201cBut he has come to accept that what he intended as a dramatic moment meant to shake the world awake from its climate slumber and stupor turned into something else completely,\u201d the lawyer wrote."

      "Judge James Jones Jr. set Kelly's trial for July 14 during a brief hearing.",

      "At least three witnesses saw Kelly shoot Tunstall during a gathering at a Memphis home at about 1 a.m. on Sept. 7, 2022, according to a police affidavit. Clark and Parker were shot later that day, as Kelly was driving around Memphis, livestreaming some of his activities, authorities said.",
      "Police said three other people were wounded in the shootings. An indictment also charges Kelly with reckless endangerment with a deadly weapon, commission of an act of terrorism, theft of property and evading arrest.",

      "In February of that year, Kelly, then 17, was charged as an adult with attempted first-degree murder and other crimes in two shootings committed a few hours apart. Both victims survived but did not cooperate with prosecutors, according to court records, and Kelly pleaded guilty to reduced charges of aggravated assault in April 2021.",

      "Friday was the deadline for counties in the battleground state to finalize election results. All 17 counties met the deadline to forward election results for final approval later this month by Democratic Secretary of State of Cisco Aguilar and the Nevada Supreme Court. Losing candidates have until Nov. 20 to request a recount.",

      "Washoe, Nevada's swing county, voted 3-1 on Friday to certify its election results after more than two hours of heated public comment that included unsubstantiated claims of unsecure piles of ballots and scanners subject to internet hacking. One woman warned commissioners that \u201cPresident Trump will be coming for you\u201d if they certified the vote.",
      "Commissioner Jeanne Herman cast the lone dissenting vote on Friday but didn\u2019t provide an explanation.

Some approached the mic with stacks of paper in their hands that they said contained proof the election was rigged, saying it wasn\u2019t believable that Trump and Sam Brown, the Republican candidate for Senate, lost in the county despite Trump\u2019s victory statewide.",
      "Lorena Portillo, the top election official in Clark County, told commissioners they discovered about 1,600 ballots while preparing for Friday's meeting that had been processed but not counted. The ballots have since been counted and added to the county's election results, but the additional ballots did not affect the outcome of any race, Portillo said.",

      "A school district in northwest Oregon has put its superintendent and high school principal on leave and accepted the school board chair's resignation",
      "ST. HELENS, Ore. -- A school district in northwest Oregon has put its superintendent and high school principal on leave, accepted the school board chair's resignation and temporarily canceled classes in response to an uproar over the arrests of a teacher and former teacher on sexual abuse charges.",
      "The St. Helens Police Department said in a statement that officers this week arrested one current and one retired St. Helens High School teacher on allegations of sexually abusing students. Police said the arrests came after a two-month investigation.",
      "The district canceled classes and after-school events on Thursday and Friday following demonstrations at the school during which students called for St. Helens School District Superintendent Scot Stockwell, High School Principal Katy Wagner and all school board members to resign or be removed.",
      "Wagner has since been placed on paid leave and Board Chair Ryan Scholl resigned from his position, district officials said in a post on social media Friday. Stockwell was placed on paid leave during a school board meeting Friday afternoon, according to another district social media post.",
      "Protesting parents and students told Oregon Public Broadcasting that their anger stemmed from the appearance that school officials knew about and failed to act on allegations against the teachers for years.",
      "Choir teacher Eric Stearns, 46, is facing seven counts of second-degree sex abuse and one count of third-degree sex abuse involving six students, according to police. Stearns pleaded not guilty to the charges in Columbia County Circuit Court on Wednesday, KATU-TV reported.",
      "Recently retired math teacher Mark Collins, 64, pleaded not guilty on Thursday to two counts of second-degree sex abuse and one count of attempted second-degree sex abuse. The allegations against Collins involve three students, police said.",
      "Attempts by The Associated Press to find contact information for Stearns and Collins on Friday were unsuccessful, and no attorneys were listed for them in jail records.",
      "St. Helens Acting Police Chief Joseph Hogue told the media outlet Friday that his department subpoenaed the district in October and found historical reports made by students detailing allegations against the teachers. State law requires school districts to inform law enforcement or state officials about such reports, Hogue said.",
      "\u201cThere were multiple historical reports made to high school administration from 2019 to 2023 and this also corroborated the victim statements that (detectives) had previously received,\u201d he said.",
      "Columbia County District Attorney Joshua Pond said Friday his office is investigating whether the district broke any laws by not forwarding the reports to law enforcement.",
      "On Friday evening, district officials said the high school would remain closed Monday while staff makes what officials called necessary arrangements for a safe return to school Tuesday.",
      "\u201cOur goal is to ensure a safe and positive learning environment, with clear steps toward addressing the concerns of our students, families, and community members,\u201d the district statement said.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 22:32:19 GMT",
    "summary": "Lenders have been raising the cost of fixed-rate deals creating a headache for buyers and those remortgaging.",
    "story": [
      "Mortgage costs are rising - with the average rate on a two-year fixed deal now at 5.5% - despite a recent cut in interest rates.",
      "A string of lenders, including Barclays, HSBC, NatWest and Nationwide, have increased the rates charged on new fixed deals in recent days.",
      "That has created a headache for borrowers hoping costs were on a consistent downward trend, especially in light of the Bank of England cutting the benchmark interest rate earlier this month.",
      "Recent events, such as the Budget, mean that borrowing costs in general have increased, which may have a knock-on effect for those searching for a home loan.",
      "How mortgage rates affect borrowers",
      "Some tracker and variable rate mortgages move fairly closely in line with the Bank's base rate. However, more than eight in 10 mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals.",
      "The interest rate on this kind of mortgage does not change until the deal expires, usually after two or five years, and a new one is chosen to replace it.",
      "About 800,000 fixed-rate mortgages, currently with an interest rate of 3% or below, are expected to expire every year, on average, until the end of 2027.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of potential first-time buyers also hope to get a place of their own with their first mortgage. All would welcome low mortgage rates.",
      "There have been two significant spikes in the last couple of years, with the average rate peaking at 6.85% in August 2023, according to the financial information service Moneyfacts.",
      "Rates are lower now, but the cost of deals has been moving up either side of the Budget.",
      "The average rate on a two-year deal now stands at 5.5%, and the average on a five-year deal is 5.22%.",
      "Nearly all of the cheapest deals on the market, often for those able to offer a large deposit, have risen back above a rate of 4%.",
      "Why are interest rates down but mortgage rates up?",
      "On 7 November, the Bank of England cut the base rate - which influences the wider cost of borrowing for businesses, individuals and the government - from 5% to 4.75%.",
      "This had been widely expected, so the markets had already factored the cut into their calculations. In other words, it was so widely anticipated that borrowing costs had already been adjusted accordingly.",
      "However, the Bank of England also said that future interest rate cuts may not come as often and as quickly as previously thought.",
      "In the words of one mortgage broker, that was because the Budget delivered by Chancellor Rachel Reeves \"threw a spanner in the works\". Spending pledges risked inflating some prices, something high interest rates are designed to control.",
      "Bank governor Andrew Bailey said rates were likely to \"continue to fall gradually from here\u201d, but cautioned they could not be cut \"too quickly or by too much\u201d.",
      "Lenders price their mortgages not only on where interest rates are at any one time but where they, and the financial markets, expect them to be in the future.",
      "Brokers say the outlook had changed for lenders given the Bank's latest view on interest rates, prompting the most recent mortgage rate moves.",
      "\u201cThe slew of rate changes in recent weeks has continued to push [mortgage] rates higher, reflecting the higher costs for lenders, as the market outlook for rates has edged toward a \u2018higher for longer\u2019 expectation,\" said David Hollingworth, from mortgage broker L&C.",
      "\"Unwelcome as it is for borrowers, it\u2019s important to note that there\u2019s no sign of rates skyrocketing as they have in recent years. The Bank of England base rate is still expected to fall over time, but markets are questioning if the pace will be as rapid.\"",
      "A Treasury spokesman said that the Budget was \"putting the public finances on a sustainable path\" and that was \"essential to ensuring steady mortgage rates for all homeowners\".",
      "What goes up might come down",
      "The general trend of interest rates is expected to be down, but timing can be tough for borrowers.",
      "That is made harder because mortgage deals currently have a relatively short shelf-life, owing to the uncertainty.",
      "\"Any stand out best-buy deals are not lasting very long,\" said Aaron Strutt, from broker Trinity Financial.",
      "\"If your mortgage is due for renewal and you are sticking with your existing lender, you need to keep an eye on the rates because the lenders don\u2019t tend to tell borrowers when they are going up.\"",
      "Ways to make your mortgage more affordable",
      "Make overpayments. If you still have some time on a low fixed-rate deal, you might be able to pay more now to save later.Move to an interest-only mortgage.

      "The number of households on social tariffs has risen by a fifth since last year to a record 1.6 million. Spending on them rose by a quarter, according to CCW data.",
      "It said the increase was down to companies doing more to promote their support schemes, data sharing between the government and councils helping to identify customers in need, and the cost of living leading to more households seeking help.",
      "But there are concerns that support is not the same across the country and that people could be missing out on help simply because of where they live.",
      "Each company\u2019s social tariff scheme differs based on things like household income, benefits received, individual water bills and how much people have in savings.",

      "Morgan, 25, adds: \u201cWe were over \u00a34,000 in debt. We had to do so many payment plans and it was getting to the point where we had to get a payment plan for another payment plan.\u201d",

      "Data from the CCW suggests that among the 10 biggest water and sewerage firms, the average bill reduction in 2023-24 ranged from \u00a3287 for people supplied by Welsh Water (D\u0175r Cymru) down to \u00a3110 for customers of Southern Water.",

      "'Postcode lottery'",
      "Andy White, senior leader for the CCW, said it was good that more people than ever were getting help through social tariffs.",
      "\u201cHowever, it also shines a light on the fact that there are significant differences in the support that is available to customers depending who serves them as a water company,\u201d he said, describing it as a \u201cpostcode lottery\u201d.",

      "The CCW wants companies to have one social tariff for people who cannot afford their water and to all contribute to a shared pot so that the costs do not fall heaviest on the poorest areas.",
      "Water UK, which represents water companies, said: \u201cUltimately it is up to Government to set the guidance on social tariffs, but water companies offer significantly higher reductions than other utilities such as energy.\"",

      "Welsh Water, which is not for profit, offers support if someone in the household receives at least one means-tested benefit and has different income thresholds depending on how many people live there.",
      "Social tariffs are not the only form of support on offer. The CCW data also showed an additional \u00a366m went to more than 200,000 accounts on a separate scheme called Watersure, which caps bills for people on meters who claim certain benefits and have a high water use.",

      "After months of evidence, the Post Office Inquiry heard from its final witnesses this week.",
      "Closing statements will follow next month before inquiry chair Sir Wyn Williams publishes his final report next year.",
      "Much of the evidence centred around who knew what and when, so what did we learn from the key players? And what questions still need to be answered?",
      "What did Paula Vennells know about IT problems?",
      "Paula Vennells was the chief executive of the Post Office from 2012 to 2019. Her appearance before the inquiry, over three days in May, was hotly anticipated.",
      "The key questions were: what did she know about problems with Horizon, and when did she find out about them?",
      "In the end, we got plenty of tears, as she appeared to repeatedly wilt under probing questioning, but few concrete answers. There was a great deal she claimed she couldn\u2019t remember, and even more she said she had never been told.",
      "\u201cYou are not responsible for everything that happens underneath you. You have to rely on the advice of internal and external experts,\u201d she argued.",
      "A lawyer for the sub-postmasters accused her of living in \u201ca cloud of denial\u201d. The inquiry\u2019s own lead counsel asked sardonically whether she was \u201cthe unluckiest CEO in history\u201d.",
      "There were lots of questions about whether she had been more focused on protecting the Post Office brand than its people, with her attitude towards press coverage placed under a harsh spotlight.",
      "We saw scathing text messages from Dame Moya Greene, the former head of Royal Mail, which cast doubt on Ms Vennells\u2019 honesty. But amid all the tears and apologies, there were few certainties.",

      "In July 2013 the Post Office received bombshell legal advice that Mr Jenkins was \u201cin plain breach of his duty as an expert witness\", and this put the Post Office \u201cin breach of its duty as a prosecutor\u201d.",
      "After this the Post Office paused its prosecutions and decided to replace Mr Jenkins as an expert witness. Which Fujitsu executives knew about this?",
      "When asked at the inquiry, former Fujitsu chief executive Duncan Tait said he had never recalled being told of any issues with Mr Jenkins.",
      "However, a Post Office briefing from November 2013 seen by the BBC suggests that Post Office executives did plan to raise the issue of Gareth Jenkins with him, and a subsequent meeting had been planned between Fujitsu and the Post Office to discuss finding \u201can independent expert to give evidence about the Horizon system\".",
      "If Fujitsu executives knew about concerns over Mr Jenkins' past evidence, it raises serious questions about why Fujitsu used Mr Jenkins in the 2019 Bates v Post Office trial.

      "Several said they weren\u2019t given a true picture by the Post Office executives they met with, or by civil servants. Former Minster Jo Swinson told the inquiry she has since found out what was really happening during her time in power and realised it was \u201cactually the opposite of what I was being told\u201d.",

Ministers would come into their posts without a knowledge of the Horizon issues - and just as they were beginning to grasp them, an election or a reshuffle would intervene and they would leave the role.",
      "One of the barristers representing sub-postmasters pointed to the problems caused by this \u201crevolving door of ministers\u201d, as he listed the eight business secretaries in the last five years alone.",

      "Sir Wyn has also been asking witnesses about how the Post Office should be run, and even if it is worth saving at all.",
      "The new boss jumped the gun somewhat by announcing his plans this week. Nigel Railton said they are all about putting sub-postmasters at the \u201cheart\u201d of the business. It could involve job cuts and branch closures.",
      "The problem? One: sub-postmasters have heard this before. Two: money. These plans are dependent on government cash. Replacing Horizon will be particularly expensive.",

      "The main difference is Bluesky is decentralised - a complicated term which basically means users can host their data on servers other than those owned by the company.",
      "This means that rather than being limited to having a specific account named after Bluesky, people can (if they like) sign up using an account they themselves own.",
      "But it is worth stating that the vast majority of people don't do that and a new joiner will most likely have a \".bsky.social\" at the end of their username.",

      "Why is it gaining in popularity?",

      "That let the developers deal with all the kinks behind-the-scenes, to try and stabilise it before opening the doors to the wider public.",
      "The plan has worked, somewhat. But the flurry of new users has been so significant in November that there continue to be issues with outages.",
      "It is no coincidence that the number of new Bluesky users spiked following Donald Trump's success in the US elections in November.",
      "X's owner, Mr Musk, was a big backer of Trump during his campaign, and will be heavily involved in his administration.",
      "Inevitably, this has led to a political division, with some people leaving X in protest.",
      "But others have cited different reasons, such as the Guardian newspaper which has chosen to stop posting there as it called X \"a toxic media platform\".",
      "Meanwhile, Bluesky's app continues to pick up significant downloads worldwide and on Thursday was the top free app in the Apple App Store in the UK.",
      "Several celebrities, from pop singer Lizzo to Taskmaster's Greg Davies, have announced they are joining the platform and limiting their use of - or in some cases leaving altogether - X.",

    "story": [
      "As the world waits to see how the return of Donald Trump will reshape relations between Washington and Beijing, China has just taken decisive action to entrench its position in Latin America.",
      "Trump won the US presidential election on a platform that promised tariffs as high as 60% on Chinese-made goods. Further south, though, a new China-backed megaport has the potential to create whole new trade routes that will bypass North America entirely.",
      "President Xi Jinping himself attended the inauguration of the Chancay port on the Peruvian coast this week, an indication of just how seriously China takes the development.",
      "Xi was in Peru for the annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum (Apec). But all eyes were on Chancay and what it says about China's growing assertiveness in a region that the US has traditionally seen as its sphere of influence.",
      "As seasoned observers see it, Washington is now paying the price for years of indifference towards its neighbours and their needs.",
      "\"The US has been absent from Latin America for so long, and China has moved in so rapidly, that things have really reconfigured in the past decade,\" says Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.",
      "\"You have got the backyard of America engaging directly with China,\" she tells the BBC. \"That's going to be problematic.\"",
      "Even before it opened, the $3.5bn (\u00a32.75bn) project, masterminded by China's state-owned Cosco Shipping, had already turned a once-sleepy Peruvian fishing town into a logistical powerhouse set to transform the country's economy.",
      "China's official Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, called it \"a vindication of China-Peru win-win co-operation\".",
      "Peru's President Dina Boluarte was similarly enthusiastic, describing the megaport as a \"nerve centre\" that would provide \"a point of connection to access the gigantic Asian market\".",
      "But the implications go far beyond the fortunes of one small Andean nation. Once Chancay is fully up and running, goods from Chile, Ecuador, Colombia and even Brazil are expected to pass through it on their way to Shanghai and other Asian ports.",
      "China already has considerable appetite for the region's exports, including Brazilian soybeans and Chilean copper. Now this new port will be able to handle larger ships, as well as cutting shipping times from 35 to 23 days.",
      "However, the new port will favour imports as well as exports. As signs grow that an influx of cheap Chinese goods bought online may be undermining domestic industry, Chile and Brazil have scrapped tax exemptions for individual customers on low-value foreign purchases.",
      "As nervous US military hawks have pointed out, if Chancay can accommodate ultra-large container vessels, it can also handle Chinese warships.",
      "The most strident warnings have come from Gen Laura Richardson, who has just retired as chief of US Southern Command, which covers Latin America and the Caribbean.",
      "She has accused China of \"playing the \u2018long game\u2019 with its development of dual-use sites and facilities throughout the region\", adding that those sites could serve as \"points of future multi-domain access for the [People's Liberation Army] and strategic naval chokepoints\".",
      "Even if that prospect never materialises, there is a strong perception that the US is losing ground in Latin America as China forges ahead with its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).",
      "Outgoing US President Joe Biden was among the leaders at the Apec summit, on his first and last visit to South America during his four-year term. Media commentators remarked that he cut a diminished figure next to China's Xi.",
      "Prof \u00c1lvaro M\u00e9ndez, director of the Global South Unit at the London School of Economics, points out that while the US was taking Latin America for granted, Xi was visiting the region regularly and cultivating good relations.",
      "\"The bar has been set so low by the US that China only has to be a little bit better to get through the door,\" he says.",
      "Of course, Latin America is not the only part of the world targeted by the BRI. Since 2023, China's unprecedented infrastructure splurge has pumped money into nearly 150 countries worldwide.",
      "The results have not always been beneficial, with many projects left unfinished, while many developing countries that signed up for Beijing's largesse have found themselves burdened with debt as a result.",
      "Even so, left-wing and right-wing governments alike have cast aside their initial suspicions of China, because \"their interests are aligned\" with those of Beijing, says the Peterson Institute's Ms de Bolle: \"They have lowered their guard out of sheer necessity.\"",
      "Ms de Bolle says the US is right to feel threatened by this turn of events, since Beijing has now established \"a very strong foothold\" in the region at a time when president-elect Trump wants to \"rein in\" China.",
      "\"I think we will finally start to see the US putting pressure on Latin America because of China,\" she says, adding that most countries want to stay on the right side of both big powers.",
      "\"The region doesn't have to choose unless it's put in a position where they are forced to, and that would be very dumb.\"",
      "Looking ahead, South American countries such as Peru, Chile and Colombia would be vulnerable to pressure because of the bilateral free trade agreements they have with the US, which Trump could seek to renegotiate or even tear up.",

      "Whatever happens, Prof M\u00e9ndez of the LSE feels that the region needs more co-operation.",
      "\"It shouldn't be that all roads lead to Beijing or to Washington. Latin America has to find a more strategic way, it needs a coherent regional strategy,\" he says, pointing to the difficulty of getting 33 countries to agree a joint approach.",

    "story": [
      "Plans for a major shake-up of pension funds have been announced by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves.",
      "She wants to create pension \"megafunds\" by merging the UK's 86 council schemes, using the set-up in Canada and Australia as a model.",
      "Other proposals suggest pension schemes need to reach a certain size or pool together. Larger funds could then be invested in UK infrastructure projects, the government says.",
      "So, will this affect people with pension savings?",
      "Which pension funds are involved?",
      "The government says the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) can get more from investments - while tackling a \u00a32bn bill for fees - by joining together.",
      "There are 86 local government pension funds in England and Wales, which are mainly paid into by local government workers.",
      "These individually managed funds are divided by local authority, making it more costly, because each fund is paying its own management and administration fees.",
      "Between them, they have 6.5 million members and manage assets worth \u00a3354bn.",
      "The schemes are all part of the LGPS which is the seventh-largest in the world, according to the UK government.",
      "Most of its participants are low-paid women.",
      "Under Reeves\u2019 plans, the funds would be consolidated in some way, although at present it is unclear exactly how.",
      "She may ask them to pool their assets and resources, or she may ask them to merge with one another to create a smaller number of larger funds, which would benefit from greater financial firepower and fewer costs.",
      "The LGPS is a defined benefit scheme which means that, when it is time to draw their pensions, its savers get an agreed amount based on their salary, no matter what the fund is worth at the time.",
      "So drawing scheme into \"megafunds\" will make little, or no, difference to what they receive.",
      "That is different to private pension pots, which rise and fall in value depending on how investments perform.",
      "Why copy Canada and Australia?",
      "The \u201cMaple 8\u201d is a group of vast Canadian pension funds, including the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, which manages assets worth C$247.5bn (\u00a3141.8bn), and the Canada Pension Plan, whose assets are worth C$409.6bn.",
      "While UK pension schemes tend to invest more in assets like equities and bonds, their Canadian rivals focus more on private markets.",
      "The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, for example, only has 7% of its assets in listed equities, compared with 60% for traditional pension funds.",
      "Instead, it skews its investments towards private markets, including infrastructure (including a 25% stake in British energy giant SSE), real estate and private equity deals.",
      "This kind of model is not without risk, however.",
      "The Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System is the largest investor in the troubled Thames Water, which has been highlighted by those questioning Reeves' plans.",
      "Why is bigger supposed to be better?",
      "Individually, the UK\u2019s 86 local government pension schemes vary in size, from Greater Manchester\u2019s massive \u00a330bn fund all the way down to several schemes which are \u201csub-\u00a31bn\u201d, according to Joanne Donnelly, board secretary at the Local Government Pension Scheme Advisory Board.",
      "Running these schemes costs money. Each one must pay administration, governance and management costs, which can build up \u2013 last year, they increased by \u00a328m.",
      "Like her predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, who also announced plans for a Canadian-style model, the chancellor believes consolidation would save money.",
      "That would in turn \u201cdeliver better returns for savers and unlock billions of pounds of investment\u201d.",
      "Other chancellors have aimed to make similar moves, including George Osborne who, in 2015, set out plans for local government schemes to pool resources,",
      "Does everyone agree with the idea?",
      "Tracy Blackwell, chief executive of Pension Insurance Corporation, told the BBC: \"I think by having the scale and the right expertise internally to invest in a wide range of assets, they'll be able to invest in a lot more than what they can invest in now.\"",

      "A bid by the department for rural affairs to soften changes to inheritance tax for farms - possibly by exempting some older farmers - has been rejected by the Treasury.",
      "The Treasury said there would be no change or mitigations to the policy, which will see an end to inheritance tax exemption for some farms.",
      "From April 2026, farms worth more than \u00a31m will face an effective inheritance tax rate of 20% - half the usual rate of 40%.",
      "BBC Newsnight understands that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), which represents the interests of farmers in government, believes it was not properly consulted over the change.",
      "How many farms will be affected by Budget tax rises?",
      "Most farmers won't pay inheritance tax, PM insists",
      "Farmers 'betrayed' by \u00a31m inheritance tax relief cap",
      "The department was informed about the policy the night before it was announced in the Budget.",
      "The move has been branded \"disastrous\" by the National Farmers' Union (NFU), with some farmers warning it would decimate the countryside.",
      "Defra suggested softening the policy to exempt some older people, possibly those over the age of 80.",
      "The April 2026 start for the policy means they may not have time to make use of existing rules to skip inheritance tax by passing on an asset seven years before death.",
      "But this suggestion has been dismissed by the Treasury, which said it had taken \"a fair and balanced approach\".",
      "Since its introduction in 1984, agricultural property relief (APR) has allowed small family farms \u2013 including land used for crops or rearing animals, as well as farm buildings, cottages and houses - to be exempt from inheritance tax.",
      "The Treasury said 40% of APR had been going to \"the 7% wealthiest claimants\", and that it had \"made a difficult decision to ensure the relief is fiscally sustainable\".",
      "It put this against a backdrop of \u201cpublic services crumbling [and] a \u00a322bn fiscal hole inherited from the previous government\".",
      "\u201cAround 500 claims each year will be impacted and farm-owning couples can pass on up to \u00a33m without paying any inheritance tax - this is a fair and balanced approach,\" a spokesperson added.",
      "There are divisions in government over the change.",
      "Some ministers believe it will only have an impact on relatively wealthy farmers - a couple using all their inheritance tax benefits will be able to pass on a \u00a33m farm tax free. Any inheritance tax charge on farms can be paid over 10 years.",
      "But other ministers believe the chancellor is in danger of undermining Labour\u2019s relations with rural Britain while raising a relatively small amount of money.",
      "The change could raise around \u00a3560m.",
      "Some sources in government have expressed concerns that the chancellor is creating unnecessary grief over a change that is not, in relative terms, a huge money spinner.",
      "There are concerns that the change - which has proved controversial among farmers since its announcement - could become \u201ctotemic\u201d in rural Britain.",
      "Protests",
      "The NFU warned it would \u201csnatch away the next generation\u2019s ability to carry on producing British food\u201d and see farmers forced to sell land to pay the tax.",
      "A rally to protest against the plan will be held in Whitehall next Tuesday.",
      "There is also a dispute around the figures used to calculate the changes.",
      "Farmers' leaders have been told by Defra that the figures come from the Treasury and not their department.",
      "Tom Bradshaw, the president of the NFU, said that Defra figures showed the changes would have an impact on 66% of estates.",
      "The Treasury said the figure was 28%.",
      "Clive Bailey, founder of the Farming Forum which is also organising a protest in central London next week, said on Thursday that any change to the new rules \u201cwould be a step forward\u201d.",
      "Mr Bailey, who farms in Staffordshire, said the suggested exemption should cover people much younger than 80.",
      "Compared with the wider population, farming sees \"a lot of people who should have retired already still working\u201d, he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.",
      "He called the inheritance rules \u201cso poorly thought out\u201d.",
      "The cost of running a viable farm exceeded \u00a31m, he said, arguing that the government needed to sit down \"with real family farmers or agricultural economists\".",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not special, but the economic circumstances of farming are very different to other industries.\"",
      "'The policy will not change'",
      "During rural affairs questions in the Commons, Conservative shadow environment minister Robbie Moore accused the government of \"arrogance\" and urged ministers to publish a full impact assessment of the change.",
      "Environment minister Daniel Zeichner reiterated the government's figures that fewer than 500 farms a year would be affected.",
      "He added there were ways the change could \"be managed\" and called on Conservatives to \"join me in reassuring British farmers about their future\".",
      "Another Tory MP, former cabinet minister Sir Jeremy Wright, asked if ministers had considered limiting inheritance tax exemptions to those who could prove a farm had been in family ownership for \"a certain number of years\".",
      "Zeichner replied that the issue was \"complicated\", adding \"in future we will have further discussions\".",
      "Lib Dem environment spokesman Tim Farron said the tax rise would be a \"disaster for family farms\".",
      "\"Rather than blocking pleas from Defra to rethink, the chancellor must urgently meet with the farming community and NFU to better understand their heartfelt concerns and reverse the tax hike\".",
      "A Defra spokesperson said: \u201cWith public services crumbling and a \u00a322bn fiscal hole inherited from the previous government, we have made the difficult decision to reform Agricultural Property Relief in a balanced and fair way.",
      "\u201cAll ministers support the policy and it will not change.\u201d",
      "How are the inheritance tax rules changing?",

      "Inflation in the US picked up last month, as progress toward stabilising prices appeared to stall.",
      "Consumer prices rose 2.6% over the 12 months to October, driven by higher housing and food costs, the Labor Department said.",
      "That marked a slight uptick from 2.4% the month before.",
      "The latest figures added to speculation that the US central bank might not lower rates as much as had been expected in the months ahead.",
      "The Federal Reserve wants to see inflation, the rate at which prices rise, fall back to about 2%.",
      "It started cutting interest rates in September, noting the significant improvement since June 2022, when prices were surging at a rate of more than 9%.",
      "But analysts are warning of new risks, as President-elect Donald Trump promises a mix of tax cuts, tariffs and migrant deportations that some say are likely to keep pressure mounting on businesses and consumers.",

      "Mr Jamner said he did not expect to see significant market shifts as a result of the latest data, which were in line with expectations.",
      "Prices advanced 0.2% from September to October, the same pace as in the previous three months.",

      "Price increases in recent years have caused significant public concern, helping Trump to victory in the presidential election this month.",
      "Over the last 12 months, housing costs, including rents, rose 4.9%, the Labor Department said. In part because housing is heavily weighted in the US price index, that accounted for the majority of inflation over the past year.",

      "Train operators have a number of tools to deal with passengers who have underpaid or not bought a ticket at all.",
      "It is understood the government is not seeking to strip firms of powers to prosecute criminals who deliberately avoid paying. But there has been growing concern over action taken against people who misunderstand the ticketing system.",
      "The independent review the government has announced will examine how clear ticketing terms and conditions are and how they are communicated to train users.",
      "The most serious sanction is prosecution for fare evasion, which can land passengers with a magistrates court appearance and a serious criminal record.",
      "A key question for the Office for Rail and Road will be when prosecution is the right step.",
      "The Transport Secretary told a committee of MPs on Wednesday it was clear \"people who\u2019ve made genuine mistakes shouldn\u2019t be prosecuted\".",
      "\"Make no mistake, deliberate fare-dodging has no place on our railways and must be tackled, but innocent people shouldn't feel like a genuine mistake will land them in court,\" Haigh added in a statement.",

      "Last month, government-owned Northern dropped all action against engineering graduate Sam Williamson, who was reported to the operator's prosecutions and debt recovery department for using his 16-25 railcard for travel on a service to Manchester.",
      "Mr Williamson faced prosecution for paying \u00a31.90 less than he should have done despite admitting his error and offering to pay a fine or a new fare, prompting widespread criticism of Northern.",
      "The Department for Transport instructed the company to review its ticketing policy to ensure it was clear and fair to passengers and asked it to examine details of similar cases.",
      "Northern responded by withdrawing all live prosecutions against those pursued in similar circumstances and promised to review historical cases.",
      "The terms and conditions of Mr Williamson's railcard specified the discount was only valid for on-peak services where the original fare was \u00a312 or more. However, despite the small-print, he was able to buy a ticket that informed him he could travel at \"anytime\".",
      "Stephanie Tobyn, ORR director of strategy, policy and reform, welcomed the review.",
      "\"It is important passengers are treated fairly and dealt with consistently and proportionately when ticketing issues arise, whilst also balancing the legitimate revenue protection interests of operators and taxpayers,\" she added.",

      "Tesla shares have surged roughly 35% since 4 November.",

      "One of the innovations at this year's Paris Olympics was supposed to be an electric flying taxi service.",
      "Germany's Volocopter promised its electric-powered, two-seater aircraft, the VoloCity, would be ferrying passengers around the city.",
      "It never happened. Instead the company ran demonstration flights.",
      "While missing that deadline was embarrassing, behind the scenes a more serious issue was playing out - Volocopter was urgently trying to raise fresh investment to keep the firm going.",
      "Talks to borrow \u20ac100m (\u00a383m; $106m) from the government failed in April.",
      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",
      "Volocopter is one of dozens of companies around the world developing an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) aircraft.",
      "Their machines promise the flexibility of a helicopter, but without the cost, noise and emissions.",
      "However, faced with the massive cost of getting such novel aircraft approved by regulators and then building up manufacturing capabilities, some investors are bailing out.",
      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",
      "Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.",
      "The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.",
      "It was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.",
      "As recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium\u2019s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely burning through cash,\" he told the BBC. \u201cBut this is a good sign, because it means we are producing the aircraft. We\u2019re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised \u20ac1.5bn\u201d.",
      "But then the money ran out.",
      "Lilium had been attempting to arrange a loan worth \u20ac100m from the German development bank, KfW. However, that required guarantees from national and state governments, which never materialised.",
      "In early November, the company put its main operating businesses into insolvency proceedings, and its shares were removed from the Nasdaq stock exchange.",
      "For the moment, work on the new aircraft is continuing, as the company works with restructuring experts to sell the business or bring in new investment. However, getting the new e-jet into production is looking more challenging than ever.",
      "The high-profile British player in the eVTOL market is Vertical Aerospace. The Bristol-based company was founded in 2016 by businessman Stephen Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy.",
      "Its striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be \u201c100 times\u201d safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.",
      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",
      "In May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.",
      "Ambitions remain sky high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year, and to be breaking even in cash terms.",
      "Yet financial strains have been intensifying. Mr Fitzpatrick invested an extra $25m into the company in March. But a further $25m, due in August if alternative investment could not be found, has not been paid. As of September, Vertical had $57.4m on hand \u2013 but it expects to burn through nearly double that over the coming year.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 00:09:24 GMT",
    "summary": "With its rich resources, uranium mining companies want Canada to play a key role in fuelling nuclear reactors worldwide.",
    "story": [
      "Uranium is making a comeback thanks to a renewed focus on nuclear energy as a climate crisis solution. Canada, rich with high-grade deposits, could become a nuclear \u201csuperpower\u201d. But can its potential be realised?",
      "Leigh Curyer had been working in uranium mining for nearly two decades when he noticed a striking shift.",
      "In 2011, the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in Japan badly damaged the world's view of nuclear power, and the price for the heavy metal - a critical component for nuclear fuel - cratered.",
      "But the last five years has seen a reversal, with the global price of uranium spiking by more than 200%, becoming one of this year's top-performing commodities.",
      "Mr Curyer, an Australian-born businessman, credits this to a changing attitude that began soon after Microsoft founder Bill Gates touted nuclear energy as \u201cideal for dealing with climate change\u201d in 2018.",
      "Four years later, then-UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson pushed forward a policy of generating at least 25% of the country\u2019s energy from nuclear.",
      "Shortly after, the European Union voted to declare nuclear energy climate-friendly.",
      "These events were \u201ccatalytic\u201d for the uranium industry and a turning point for Mr Curyer's company NexGen, which is behind the largest in-development uranium mine in Canada.",
      "His phone began to ring with calls from investors worldwide - something that \u201chad never happened in my previous 17 years in the industry\u201d, he said.",
      "NexGen, whose project is located in Canada's remote, uranium-rich Athabasca Basin in northern Saskatchewan, is now worth nearly $4bn (\u00a32.98bn), despite the fact that the mine won\u2019t be commercially operational until at least 2028.",
      "If fully cleared by regulators, NexGen\u2019s project alone could push Canada to become the world\u2019s largest producer of uranium over the coming decade, knocking Kazakhstan out of the number one spot.",
      "Other companies have also rushed to Saskatchewan to capitalise on the boom, starting their own exploration projects in the region, while existing players re-opened dormant mines.",
      "With its rich resources, Canada\u2019s mining companies see the country playing a major role in the future of nuclear energy, meeting a demand for uranium that is poised to rise after nearly two dozen countries committed in COP28 climate conference to tripling their nuclear energy output by 2050.",
      "Nuclear energy is often hailed for its low carbon emissions compared to other sources like natural gas or coal.",
      "The World Nuclear Association estimates that 10% of power generated worldwide comes from nuclear sources, while more than 50% is still generated by gas or coal.",
      "At this year's COP29, the focus has been on ramping up funding for nuclear projects in the wake of a recent UN report indicating that current policies and investments fall short of what is needed to slow global temperature rise.",
      "Canada\u2019s role in supplying the commodity is made more urgent by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, particularly for the US, which had relied heavily on Russian-supplied enriched uranium to fire up its commercial nuclear reactors.",
      "Mr Curyer believes his mine could prove to be \u201cabsolutely critical\u201d to America\u2019s nuclear energy future, as the US is now hunting for alternatives to Russia, including by ramping up exploration on its own soil.",
      "Uranium can be found around the world, though it is heavily present in Canada, Australia and Kazakhstan.",
      "But what makes Canada\u2019s Athabasca Region unique is that its uranium is especially high grade, said Markus Piro, a professor of nuclear engineering at McMaster University.",
      "Canada has set strict rules for the sale of its uranium to other countries, Prof Piro said, and mandates it only be used for nuclear power generation.",
      "The country is also referred to as a \u201ctier-one nuclear nation\u201d, he said, due to its capability to produce nuclear fuel from the mining to the manufacturing stage.",
      "Once mined, uranium is milled to produce what is called calcined yellowcake. It can then be enriched, if needed, at facilities overseas to create fuel for nuclear reactors.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got a one-stop shop here in Canada, not every nation\u2019s like that,\u201d Prof Piro said.",
      "Canada is currently the world\u2019s second largest producer of uranium, accounting for roughly 13% of the total global output, according to the Canadian government. NexGen anticipates that once its mine is operational, it will boost that to 25%.",
      "Meanwhile, Cameco, which has been mining uranium in Saskatchewan since 1988 that supplies 30 nuclear reactors around the world, re-opened two of its mines in late 2022 to increase output.",
      "CEO Tim Gitzel told the BBC that he believes \u201cCanada could be a nuclear superpower around the world\u201d.",
      "But enthusiasm around nuclear energy is not without its critics.",
      "Some environmental groups worry nuclear projects are too costly and come with timelines that do not meet the urgency of the climate crisis.",
      "Data from the UK-based World Nuclear Association shows that 65 nuclear reactors are under construction across 16 countries, most of them in China, and a further 90 are in the planning stages.",
      "Some are expected to come online this year - others won\u2019t be ready until at least the end of the decade.",
      "Meanwhile, more than 100 nuclear plants have been closed in the last two decades around the world, including the sole nuclear power plant near New York City, which was retired in 2021 due to high operating costs and environmental and safety concerns.",
      "Plants were also shuttered in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Quebec, Canada.",
      "And not all of Canada is on board with the country\u2019s uranium industry.",
      "British Columbia sits on its own supply of uranium but has not allowed any nuclear plants or uranium mines to operate in the province since 1980.",
      "Critics have also expressed concern about radioactive waste nuclear reactors leave behind for future generations.",
      "Others fear another Fukushima-scale disaster, where a tsunami disabled three reactors, causing the release of highly radioactive materials and forcing mass evacuations.",
      "\u201cThe risk is not zero, that is for sure\u201d though it can be reduced, said Prof Piro.",
      "\u201cEven though amongst the general public there are mixed feelings about it, the reality is that it has produced very safe, very reliable and affordable electricity worldwide.\u201d",
      "The industry maintains the technology is both promising and viable.",
      "Mr Gitzel of Cameco said the industry has learned from past safety errors.",
      "\u201cAnd the public is buying on,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you that we have in Canada great public support for nuclear power.\u201d",
      "A 2023 Ipsos poll indicates that 55% of Canadians support nuclear energy.",
      "Still, past uranium booms in Canada have turned into dramatic busts.",
      "North of NexGen\u2019s proposed mine stands Uranium City, once home to 2,500 residents in its mid-20th Century heyday. In 1982, a major local mining firm shuttered operations over high costs and a soft market for uranium.",
      "Now, Uranium City\u2019s population is 91 people.",
      "But investors argue that there is a true global burgeoning demand for the commodity that poses a golden opportunity for Canada.",
      "NexGen anticipates that construction on its mine - which is awaiting clearance from Canada\u2019s federal nuclear regulator - will begin early next year.",
      "Mr Gitzel says around 100 other companies are now actively exploring Saskatchewan for deposits.",
      "As to when it will be on the market remains unclear.",
      "Mr Gitzel cautioned that some companies have started explorations in the past that never reached production stage. The timeline to get mining projects approved in Canada can also be lengthy.",
      "\u201cBuilding a mine is going to take five to 10 years, and so far, the only ones in operation are ours, so we will wait and see how it plays out,\u201d he said.",
      "For Mr Curyer, it is crucial that his project and others are realised in the next four years, for both Canada and the world.",

      "Mr Duffy lives in a traditional stone-walled detached house in Sheffield. He estimates that he spends \u00a33,100 every year on heating and electricity.",
      "Despite being someone who cares about climate change, and keen to retrofit his property to make it more efficient, there\u2019s a problem.",
      "\u201cThe whole question of how to better insulate the house is a real mystery to me,\u201d says Mr Duffy, a director of sustainability think-tank Citizen Network. \u201cI don\u2019t know where the expertise for that is.\u201d He also adds that he\u2019s also not sure whether he could install solar panels, given that he lives in a conservation area.",
      "Millions of homeowners across the country could be facing the same dilemma.",
      "Around 29 million British homes require retrofitting by 2050, according to the UK Green Building Council, an industry body.",
      "Retrofitting might involve measures such as improving your home\u2019s insulation, upgrading the heating system, or installing energy-generating devices such as solar panels, or even a private wind turbine.",
      "These adjustments can cost thousands of pounds up front, but, if properly executed, they could improve comfort and reduce people\u2019s bills in the long-run.",
      "Plus, increased energy efficiency ought to cut carbon emissions from homes, especially if property owners switch away from gas or oil-fired boilers, for example.",
      "Roughly one fifth of the UK\u2019s total emissions comes from residential buildings.",
      "Amy Peace and her husband live in the northwest of England, near Warrington. The pair both work in sustainability, advising businesses on their path to net zero.",
      "They were keen to improve the quality of their home and apply the principles they promote at work to their own lives \u2013 but they too faced challenges when deciding on how to go about it.",
      "\u201cEven though we\u2019ve got this background, and we\u2019re engineers as well, what we weren\u2019t entirely clear on was where was best to spend the money,\u201d says Mrs Peace.",
      "The couple spoke to multiple consultants, but Mrs Peace found the advice they received was often geared towards meeting Passivhaus standards \u2013 an ultra-energy efficient type of building.",
      "\u201cThere weren\u2019t many in that pragmatic middle space where you are literally saying, \u2018We\u2019ve got this much money, where would we be best putting it?\u2019,\u201d Mrs Peace adds.",
      "Perseverance during the past three years paid off, however, and the couple\u2019s 1930\u2019s detached house now has improved insulation, a heat pump, and an electric car charging point. Solar panels and battery will follow shortly, if all goes to plan.",
      "Conscious of the confusion around approaches to retrofit, some organisations are moving to improve the advice available to homeowners. Among them is Ecofurb.",
      "\u201cWe can model all the different options that are available, suitable for your home and your budget, and identify a package of measures,\u201d says Liz Lain\u00e9, of Parity Projects, a housing data analysis company, which runs Ecofurb.",
      "The firm offers this initial consultation for free, but full plans, with personalised input from a retrofit coordinator, start at \u00a3470. Ecofurb can also oversee any works as they are carried out by contractors to avoid \u201chorror stories\u201d, says Ms Lain\u00e9.",
      "There are many other organisations that offer to help homeowners plan a retrofit.",
      "The work often involves carrying out a heat-loss survey, to spot cold areas that require insulation, and to better understand a property\u2019s heating demand. Experts might also advise on the suitability of solar panels for your home, for example.",
      "There\u2019s the Get a Heat Pump website, launched by the charities Nesta and The MCS Foundation, which explains what heat pumps are and how they might fit into a home renovation plan.",
      "RICS, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, has also just launched a new retrofit standard for its members \u2013 essentially, it encourages surveyors with the appropriate training to offer their services to homeowners planning or undergoing a retrofit.",
      "The RICS website will soon include a range of retrofit advice and a tool to help homeowners find a suitable surveyor in their local area, says Steve Lees, from the RICS retrofit project team.",
      "Improving the energy efficiency of homes is \u201cessential\u201d for decarbonisation, says Gerald Charles, head of housing retrofit at the Centre for Sustainable Energy, but he adds that the current lack of good advice remains a genuine problem.",
      "\u201cThe industry as a whole don\u2019t appreciate the importance of good retrofit advice,\u201d he says.",
      "One entrepreneur who has noticed a knowledge gap in the market is James Major, founder and chief executive of HubbPro, which helps architects plan energy efficient buildings. Architects don\u2019t always have the latest information about how to incorporate energy-saving technologies into their designs, notes Mr Major.",
      "\u201cClean tech isn\u2019t part of what they do or what they should know \u2013 that\u2019s an engineering function,\u201d he says. And yet architects\u2019 clients increasingly ask about such tech when planning a new home or an extension.",
      "Through an initiative called MyHubb, Mr Major is now offering architects detailed reports that estimate the carbon reduction potential and payback period on retrofitted measures - such as heat pump-based heating systems or solar panels, for instance.",
      "He says these reports cost around \u00a31,000, though he adds that this price is not yet finalised.",
      "Mr Duffy says he will keep looking for solutions to his own retrofit conundrum. But he makes another point. So much of the currently available technology and advice is tailored to individual homeowners.",

      "Moreover, the Save the Student money advice website said the latest rise in tuition fees would make \"little difference to overall levels of student debt, and will have no impact whatsoever on the amount a graduate repays each month\".",
      "But borrowing more will, inevitably, mean students leave university with more debt.",
      "The government's latest announcement also only stipulates fees and loans in the 2025-26 academic year. Vice-chancellors and students alike will want to know what the government\u2019s plans are beyond that.",

      "Davina McCall is recovering from surgery she underwent to remove a rare brain tumour, her partner has said.",
      "The TV presenter, 57, earlier posted a video on Instagram to say she had been diagnosed with a type of benign tumour called a colloid cyst.",
      "In an update on Friday evening, Michael Douglas said McCall was \"out of surgery\" and recovering in hospital - and thanked well-wishers \"for all the love\". He added that McCall was \"utterly exhausted\".",
      "A benign tumour is not cancerous, but such cysts tend to grow slowly, according to the Brainstrust charity.",
      "In the statement, shared to McCall's 1.9 million Instagram followers, Douglas said a doctor had described the procedure as being \"textbook\".",
      "Prior to the surgery, McCall explained how the tumour had been found by chance.",
      "\"A few months ago, I did a menopause talk for a company and they offered me a health scan in return, which I thought I was going to ace,\" she said in the video.",
      "\"But it turned out I had a benign brain tumour called a colloid cyst, which is very rare - three in a million.",

      "What are colloid cysts?",
      "They typically form in a fluid-filled cavity in the centre of the brain, and are themselves filled with fluid, the Brains Trust says.",
      "They account for less than 2% of all primary brain tumours, and the rate of growth and symptoms can vary from person to person, according to the charity.",
      "They are often found during a scan for something else, and some surgeons recommend a watch and wait policy if the cyst is small and causing no symptoms.",
      "However, as they grow they can block the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), causing symptoms including headaches, vision problems, nausea and loss of consciousness. In extreme cases, without treatment they can cause coma and even sudden death.",
      "'We're grateful to Davina'",
      "The Brain Tumour Charity told BBC News: \"All of us wish Davina the best possible outcome for this procedure.",
      "\"As an inspiration to so many, we're grateful that she has chosen to raise awareness of this uniquely devastating disease.",
      "\"We are committed to funding pioneering research, campaigning for systemic change and offering support to all those whose lives are turned upside down by a brain tumour diagnosis.\"",
      "Will Jones, chief executive of Brainstrust, added: \"Brain tumours are indiscriminate, they can affect anyone and they are more common than people might think. Over 80,000 people in the UK are living with a brain tumour, and there are over 130 different diagnoses.\"",
      "He added they were also \"grateful to Davina\" for sharing her story \"openly and candidly\".",

      "Both cases are expected to go to trial in January 2025, with the 40-year-old prince alleging  journalists and private investigators working for NGN - which also published the now defunct News of the World - targeted him.",
      "NGN has previously denied unlawful activity happened at The Sun.",
      "Both sides returned to court to ask a judge to rule on preliminary issues ahead of the 2025 trial - including whether Prince Harry could be allowed access to emails sent between former NGN executives and members of the Royal Household between 2013 and 2019.",
      "His barrister, David Sherborne, said the emails were sent between five accounts of NGN employees and five employees of the Royal Household, who were \"involved in Royal Communications and the private secretaries to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II\".",
      "Mr Sherborne said the emails would be \"highly relevant in terms of providing the full picture not only as to the actual knowledge of the claimant but also as to the position in relation to constructive knowledge, based on what the Palace was being told by NGN\".",
      "Some of the emails had already been provided by former News UK chief executive Rebekah Brooks last year, the court heard, but Mr Sherborne said that these had been \"cherry-picked\".",
      "These included discussions between NGN and the Royal Household before Harry began legal action in 2019, and conversations about a possible apology being made by the publisher.",
      "Anthony Hudson KC, for NGN, opposed the bid, saying the emails were \"not relevant to the pleaded issues\" in the prince's case and were \"not necessary to ensure a fair trial will take place\".",
      "He added that \"extracting\" the emails would cost \u00a317,000.",
      "In a ruling, Mr Justice Fancourt said there was a \"degree of speculation whether any of the documents sought are going to assist the claimant's case\", but ultimately ruled there was \"sufficient justification\" for a limited number of emails to be provided.",
      "He said: \"In all the circumstances, therefore, it seems to me that there is a limited category of documents where despite the element of delay, and despite the relative lateness of the application, there is a credible case for saying a full picture is necessary in the interest of justice.",
      "\"I will, however, limit the documents that are being sought,\" the judge added.",
      "The judge also added it was \"unsatisfactory that so little progress has been made\" and that there needs to be \"further work done on both sides\".",
      "The court heard the trial is expected to last between six and eight weeks, and a further hearing is due to be held in December.",
      "Others who have settled their claims in recent years include actress Sienna Miller, ex-footballer Paul Gascoigne, and actor Hugh Grant.",
      "Grant previously claimed journalists had used private investigators to tap his phone and burgle his house - NGN denied the claims against it. He said in April that he \"did not want to accept\" the \"enormous sum of money\" he had been offered to settle but a trial was likely to prove \"very expensive\".",
      "A spokesperson for NGN said it published an apology in 2011 to \"victims of voicemail interception by the News of the World\", adding that the company had \"publicly committed to paying financial compensation\" and had since \"paid settlements to those with proper claims\".",
      "They added: \"It is common practice, and indeed encouraged in litigation, to seek to settle claims outside court where both parties agree without the cost of a trial.\""

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 12:43:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Tickets go on sale this week, so here are some tips to maximise your chances of securing entry.",
    "story": [
      "Tickets for the Glastonbury Festival go on sale this week, with millions of fans expected to fight it out for a chance to attend the event, which will run from 25-29 June 2025.",
      "No headliners have been announced yet, but demand is expected to be higher than ever because the festival will take a year off in 2026.",
      "Last year, all 210,000 tickets sold out in just 58 minutes as more than 2.5 million people tried to log on and secure a place.",
      "\"There aren't enough tickets for everybody,\" organiser Emily Eavis told the BBC's Sidetracked podcast earlier this year. \"It's one of the worst parts of the job [because] we can't do anything about it. We definitely can't do two weekends.",
      "\"But a lot of the time,\" she added, \"people who really, really want to come often get tickets through volunteering or through competitions.\"",
      "So there's always hope... But if you're brave enough to run the gauntlet of the online ticketing system, here are a few tips that might (might) help improve your chances.",
      "1) Check your registration",
      "As part of an ongoing (and successful) campaign to stop touts, anyone who wants to attend Glastonbury has to be registered in advance.",
      "The registration window closed on Monday, 11 November - so if you're not on the list already, it's too late.",
      "Everyone else is urged to check their details in advance, to make sure everything is up to date.",
      "You will need to have the registration number and postcode for each person you are buying a ticket for when the sale begins.",
      "2) Decide between coach or general entry",
      "Glastonbury tickets come in two flavours - standard weekend tickets and coach weekend tickets.",
      "Weekend tickets mean you can arrive under your own steam by train or car - although beware Glastonbury's legendary tailbacks, and how depleted your energy levels might be on the way home.",
      "Coach tickets are more environmentally friendly and, according to some, increase your chances of success, depending on how remote your starting point is. However, it's important to note that festival tickets are distributed on the coach itself, so you can't cheat the system.",
      "Ticket and coach packages will go on sale at 18:00 GMT on Thursday, 14 November.",
      "General admission tickets will go on sale at 09:00 on Sunday, 17 November.",
      "3) Team up with your friends",
      "You can purchase up to six tickets once you reach the booking stage, as long as you have the registration details for each attendee.",
      "Logically, the more people trying for tickets, the better the chances are of securing a space - so make sure all six of you are trying to log on when tickets go on sale (NB not in the same house... see below for why).",
      "Your syndicate doesn't have to be formed of people you're physically going to the festival with. It can be friends, colleagues, aunts, uncles, neighbours or Chris Martin from Coldplay. The point is that you're working together.",
      "Make a group chat so you can co-ordinate your efforts and, most importantly, put all of your registration numbers and postcodes in a shared document so the first person to reach the front of the queue is ready.",
      "4) Don't fall for scam websites",
      "The demand for Glastonbury tickets inevitably attracts scam artists and fraudsters, who prey on people's desperation to separate them from their money.",
      "Tickets are sold exclusively at glastonbury.seetickets.com. Avoid the temptation of buying from elsewhere.",
      "5) Log on early",
      "This year, Glastonbury has introduced a new queueing system that requires you to log on in advance.",
      "That way, when the ticket sale starts, you will be randomly assigned a place in the queue.",
      "People who join later will automatically be placed at the back of the line, so it pays to be punctual.",
      "Also, 09:00 on Sunday isn't the most sociable time of the week. Set an alarm. Set multiple alarms. Get an insomniac friend to come over to your house and poke you with a stick. Whatever works.",
      "If it's possible (and I apologise for this in advance), you could even drag yourself into work. No matter how good your wifi is at home, a work computer could have a more stable connection.",
      "6) Don't use multiple devices",
      "Using multiple devices and browser tabs can result in errors and may even get you kicked out of the queue, which you definitely don't want.",
      "Sticking to one device per household also makes the process more fair, according to the Glastonbury website.",
      "\"Whilst we understand that everyone wants to have the best possible chance of booking a ticket, running multiple devices simultaneously to attempt to access the website is a waste of valuable resources, and doesn\u2019t reflect the ethos of the festival.",
      "\"Please stick to one device and one tab, so that you can focus on entering your details without confusing your browser and help us make the ticket sale as quick and stress free as possible for all.\"",
      "7) Familiarise yourself with the booking process",
      "A limited number of people will be given access to the booking system at any one time. Before that, you will be held in a queue.",
      "When (or if) you get through, you will be asked to enter the registration number and postcode for the lead booker and up to five other people. Copy and paste them, instead of entering manually, to avoid errors.",
      "When you proceed, the next page will summarise the details you entered. Check them carefully because they cannot be changed.",
      "If you are booking a coach package, the next step will be to choose the time, date and place you will depart from. It is only possible to book tickets from one departure town in a single transaction.",

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 03:55:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Before Tupac's murder, producer Quincy Jones brought stars together to try to end violence in hip-hop.",
    "story": [
      "Before the east and west coast rap beef of the 1990s boiled over with the murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious BIG, legendary producer Quincy Jones called a secret meeting at which he appealed for an end to the violence.",
      "As hip-hop rose from the streets to the mainstream in the 90s, the rappers and hustlers that broke through had few role models who had trodden that path before them.",
      "There was one man, though, who had been there, and done pretty much everything.",
      "Quincy Jones had been in gangs and had been stabbed at the age of seven in 1930s Chicago, before becoming a major force in American music thanks to his work with legends like Ray Charles, Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson.",
      "He was at the heart of revolutions in jazz, swing, soul, funk, disco and pop - but one aspect of his career that got less attention when he died last week at the age of 91 was his place in hip-hop.",
      "Jones was revered in all corners of music, including rap. Unlike most in the old guard and the media, he immediately realised the scene's artistic and cultural importance.",
      "Hip-hop reminded him of the bebop jazz of his youth. \"I feel a kinship there because we went through a lot of the same stuff,\" he said.",
      "\"Quincy understood it and got it right away,\" says pioneering artist, rapper and presenter Fab 5 Freddy.",
      "Jones worked with leading rappers in the 80s, and in the 90s he recognised risks including a volatile rivalry that had begun to erupt between competing labels and stars.",
      "So he brought artists, executives and elder black American statesmen together for a secret summit in 1995, hoping it would be a turning point.",
      "The east coast was hip-hop's spiritual home. In 1992, Sean Combs - then known as Puffy and later as P Diddy - launched his Bad Boy record label in New York with artists including Notorious BIG, aka Biggie Smalls.",
      "Meanwhile, across America, Los Angeles was coming into its own as the capital of gangsta rap, led by menacing mogul Suge Knight's Death Row Records, which had Dr Dre and Tupac.",
      "In 1994, Tupac was shot and injured during a robbery in the lobby of a studio. He later implied that his former friend Biggie may have known about the attack in advance. Biggie then released the track Who Shot Ya?, which Tupac thought was about him.",
      "The beef continued at the Source magazine awards on 3 August 1995, when Knight goaded Combs and Bad Boy Records from the stage.",
      "Jones, who had his own magazine, Vibe, held his summit three weeks later.",
      "Quincy Jones: From 'street rat' to music mastermind",
      "Quincy Jones: His brilliance explained in 10 songs",
      "'He changed my life': Stars remember Quincy Jones",
      "The brewing east-west beef wasn't the only reason Jones called it - it was mainly intended to discuss the state of hip-hop and let the new generation hear life and business advice from a group of highly successful black executives.",
      "But rap's negative image and the burgeoning tensions were a big talking point.",
      "\"He knew this was a bubbling issue, and so his idea was to bring together a symposium,\" says Fab 5 Freddy, who was hosting Yo! MTV Raps at the time and was the event's moderator.",
      "Jones told the summit: \"The thing that really provoked me to say it's time to pay attention now is Tupac.\"",
      "Tupac was missing, however - he was in jail for sexual assault at the time. Suge and Dre were there, as were Combs and Biggie.",
      "Jones had already experienced his own beef with Tupac - the rapper criticised the producer in a 1993 edition of Source for marrying white women.",
      "\"We finally hooked up, even though it was tension conditions in the beginning,\" Jones said at the event.",
      "\"We finally talked to each other, and he said nobody had talked to him like that before.",
      "\"And I said, I can't take it any more. Because we can no longer afford to be non-political, and I'm talking to the hip-hop nation now.\"",
      "About 50 influential artists and executives were in the room, including Public Enemy's Chuck D, members of A Tribe Called Quest, MC Lyte, Kris Kross, Jermaine Dupri and Boyz n the Hood film-maker John Singleton.",
      "Jones wrote in his now-out-of-print 2001 autobiography: \"I had been concerned about the potentially volatile diversity of a group who'd never been in the same room together.\"",
      "They were joined by veteran executives Clarence Avant and Ahmet Ertegun, plus Colin Powell, the former national security adviser and head of the US military who would go on to become the first African-American secretary of state.",
      "Powell had presidential ambitions - that was why the summit was held in secret. Jones wanted to save Powell from being associated with the negative publicity that surrounded rap music.",
      "He switched venues at the last minute to throw press off the scent, and confiscated the recordings.",
      "\"Rest assured that my discretion is based on a deep respect for you and a valued friendship,\" Jones wrote to Powell in an unpublished letter held at Indianapolis University Library.",
      "\"I know that we are going to make a difference at this conference. Thanks for the way you handled the situation. Maybe we can turn the battleship an inch or two.\"",
      "Jones later wrote in his book: \"Some of the younger rappers didn't even know who he was. When addressing some of the more confrontational comments from the floor, Powell maintained his South Bronx demeanour and authoritative cool throughout.\"",
      "Fab 5 Freddy remembers one exchange between Powell and Knight. \"There was an encounter where he [Knight] had something to say, and Colin Powell responded.",
      "\"Here you have this guy who was a four-star general talking to Suge Knight, and he pretty much put Suge in his place.\"",
      "Jones finally released a clip of the event for a 2018 Netflix documentary about his life.",
      "\"We've got to seriously talk about what you are going to deal with,\" he is seen telling the assembled attendees.",
      "\"They are not playing, there's real bullets out there, believe me. Maybe literally and figuratively.",
      "\"It's a very emotional thing,\" he added, his voice cracking. \"I want to see you guys live to at least my age.\"",
      "\"Quincy did get emotional,\" Fab 5 Freddy recalls, \"because he sensed what could happen.",
      "\"And the worst, unfortunately, did happen.\"",
      "Who was Tupac Shakur?",
      "Ex-gang leader pleads not guilty to Tupac murder",
      "Diddy accused of 'revenge' rape over Tupac claims",
      "Jones had ended up reconciling with Tupac. After Tupac's 1993 comments, Jones's 17-year-old daughter Rashida - who would go on to star in US sitcom The Office - wrote an irate letter to Source attacking the rapper.",
      "When Tupac bumped into one of Jones's other daughters, Kidada, he apologised, thinking she was Rashida. But Tupac and Kidada hit it off and began a relationship.",
      "\"Though we got off to a rocky start, as I came to know and feel him I saw his enormous potential and sensitivity as an artist and as a human being,\" Quincy Jones wrote.",
      "There have also been claims that Tupac was planning to leave Death Row for Jones's record label.",
      "But in September 1996, a year after the summit, Tupac was shot and killed.",
      "A former gang leader, Duane \"Keffe D\" Davis, was charged with his murder last year. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Then in 1997, Notorious BIG was shot dead outside a party thrown by Jones's record label and magazine. No-one has ever been charged.",
      "Meanwhile, today Knight is in prison for a hit-and-run, while Combs is awaiting trial on charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, which he denies.",
      "The violence in the 90s \"wasn't necessary\" and was caused by \"wannabes and gang-related troublemakers\" on the edges of the music industry, according to Fab 5 Freddy.",
      "\"Also, the east/west coast beef was mainly ignited by jealousy. It was an ashtray fire fanned into a big deal by media outlets that led to Biggie and Tupac getting killed.\"",
      "Despite his stature, not even Jones could alter the forces of power and pride that were at work and prevent the bloodshed.",
      "Freddy believes some lessons were learned at the summit, however, and that it deserves a place in hip-hop history.",
      "\"It was incredible and electric to be in that room.",
      "\"It was a thrilling moment. And then it became even more legendary because it was never released, so the only people that really knew about it were the people that were there.\""

      "On Wednesday, the Spanish-language musical is released worldwide on Netflix as the film awards race continues to heat up ahead of the Oscars in March.",
      "Selena Gomez, Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n and Adriana Paz launched the movie at the London Film Festival last month, where it continued to build its momentum.",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez follows a dangerous Mexican Cartel leader (played by Gasc\u00f3n), who asks a high-powered lawyer named Rita (Salda\u00f1a) to help him fake his own death.",
      "But the reason he wants to retire and disappear from the world of crime isn't what you might expect - the drug baron wants to change gender and live a new life as a woman.",
      "The rest of the film focuses on four women, including the newly-transitioned Emilia P\u00e9rez, as they each pursue their own version of happiness in modern-day Mexico.",
      "P\u00e9rez is portrayed by Spanish trans actress Gasc\u00f3n, who has been tipped as a possible best actress contender in the forthcoming awards race.",
      "French director Jacques Audiard came up with the idea for the film after reading a chapter in Boris Razon's 2018 novel \u00c9coute about a drug lord who changes identity.",
      "Audiard went one step further for the film, and made it a story of changing gender.",
      "\"I was less interested in a change of identity to evade competitor drug barons, and more interested in the change of identity for the sake of the person she was and is,\u201d the director tells BBC News. \"I was more interested in the past and what led to that transition.\"",
      "The role required someone very specific \u2013 a trans actress, who was a Spanish speaker, who could also sing and dance.",
      "Recalling the casting process, Gasc\u00f3n explains: \u201cI was contacted when I was in Mexico by a production team, and was told 'We need an actress as crazy as you - you're the only one who can do this role, but you need to learn five songs for tomorrow!'",
      "\u201cAnd I was like 'OK, let's record the whole album and we'll go on tour as soon as you want!\u2019\" she jokes. \u201cBut I did say, \u2018this is going to be difficult, I'm not a singer'. But the team in the film, they worked with me incredibly, they really helped me with all the songs and made it so that we could do the best work possible.\u201d",
      "Asked about Gasc\u00f3n's casting, Audiard adds simply: \u201cWithout her, there would be no film.\u201d",
      "Interestingly, Gasc\u00f3n campaigned to play both the male and female roles \u2013 in other words, the character both before and after transition.",
      "Audiard had originally intended for a different actor to play the male drug lord Manitas, because, the director explains, he was \"uncomfortable asking [Gasc\u00f3n] to revisit something she was moving away from\".",
      "But, Gasc\u00f3n recalled: \u201cI said to Jacques, I want to play this role in the complete arc, because for me it is important to do the full part. It wouldn't be the same film if another actor played [Manitas].\"",
      "That meant using effects and make-up such as a fake beard, so she could play the drug baron in the first section of the musical.",
      "\"This film is this film because the same actress played the complete performance,\" Gasc\u00f3n continues. \"It's that kind of role you have once in your life and I didn't want to lose the opportunity to play this.\u201d",
      "The ongoing debate about whether actors should have lived experience of characters they play is complex, and Gasc\u00f3n herself says: \"I prefer that all actors have the full opportunities. When you chose this career, it's because you want to express another life that's not like your life.",
      "\"But,\" she continues, \"obviously when you are closer to the role of the character, it's better. In this case, I think it's beautiful, because I give all of myself to this role.\"",
      "Gasc\u00f3n has been described as a \"wonderful discovery\" by the Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney, who said she gives \"a magnificent performance\".",
      "\"The warmth, the joyous self-realisation, the complexity and authenticity... that illuminate her characterisation no doubt owe much to the parallels in the Spanish star\u2019s life - in her own words, she was an actor before becoming an actress, a father before becoming a mother.\"",
      "Gomez plays the drug lord's wife, who is kept in the dark about her former lover's new identity, while Paz portrays Emilia's new romantic interest after transitioning.",
      "Reviews of Emilia P\u00e9rez, which is released on Netflix next month, have been generally positive so far.",
      "\"It's a wild, gritty, glitter-soaked ride that defies convention and classification,\" said Entertainment Weekly's Maureen Lee Lenker.",
      "She praised the film's performances, commenting: \"Selena Gomez is a welcome surprise, shedding any remaining hints of her Disney Channel origins in her portrayal of a hard-loving wife of a narco.",
      "\"The film's climax in particular allows Gomez to shine as a dramatic actress in new ways. She conveys heartache and anguish through a tortured physicality that propels her into the unpredictable state of a woman on the verge of something dangerous.\"",
      "Asked by the BBC's Graham Norton if it was comfortable going back to the world of singing and dancing for the musical, Gomez said: \"No, because this was completely different.",
      "\"It was intricate dance moves I never knew my body could do, and it was also me playing a character so if anything I tried to avoid what I was comfortable with.\"",
      "The Telegraph's Tim Robey described the film as \"amazingly confident \u2013 it\u2019s clever, earnest, ridiculous, knowing, forceful and absolutely bonkers\", while Hoai-Tran Bui of Inverse said it was \"an emotionally fulfilling triumph\".",
      "Not all critics were as enthusiastic about the film, however.",
      "\"Emilia P\u00e9rez was originally intended to be an opera, which perhaps partly explains its saccharine sentimentality, repetitive lyrics, and diverging story branches. But that doesn\u2019t excuse its almost random, whiplash-inducing tonal pivots,\" said Slant's Kyle Turner.",
      "However, Lauren Bradshaw of Fangirl Freakout said: \"Emilia P\u00e9rez is a magnificent, genre-bending thrill ride that transcends the typical movie construct, breathing a fresh burst of excitement into the way we think about film.\"",
      "As an actress, Gomez is best known for starring in Only Murders in the Building, but also has a successful singing career with hits including Back To You, Wolves and Love You Like a Love Song.",
      "Her co-star Salda\u00f1a, meanwhile, has starred in a large number of blockbusters in the last two decades, with roles in the Avatar and Guardians of the Galaxy franchises.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Emilia P\u00e9rez could be a big awards player, but Academy voters may see an opportunity to recognise Salda\u00f1a's box office success via this more critically acclaimed work.",
      "Their co-star Adriana Paz is a Mexican actress whose credits include Not Forgotten, Hilda and La Caridad, while Gasc\u00f3n also had a successful acting career before transitioning in 2018.",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez has already been selected as France's entry for the best international feature category at the Oscars, which take place in March.",
      "But despite the film's awards traction, Paz tells BBC News: \u201cI never think about that, really. I get into a project because I'm interested in the topic, character, director or actors, you do it because it really matters to you.\u201d",
      "She adds that the attention in recent months is unlike anything she's experienced in her career. \"It's been a lot,\" she says, \"because I've been working in Spain and have a long career in Mexico, and people have a recognition of my work, but not like [it's been] since Cannes.",
      "\"In my country they feel very proud of me, and there was a lot of people that didn't know about my work, and now thanks to Emilia they are getting to know my work... and they see 'we feel so proud as Mexicans that you won this award.'\"",
      "After the success of Emilia Perez, Paz says she would \"love to\" appear in more musicals in future, and loves singing.",
      "But Gasc\u00f3n has a slightly different take. \"I don't like musicals!\" she laughs, adding that she hopes casting directors aren't too enthusiastic about her performance.",
      "\"I don't like to sing, I don't want to be compared to Shakira or something like that, and I don't like dancing, so please don't call me!\"",

    "story": [
      "Folic acid is to be added to non-wholemeal wheat flour in the UK to help prevent birth defects.",
      "Adding folic acid to flour could prevent around 200 cases of neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, every year, and improve the health of pregnant women, says the government, which is giving manufacturers until the end of 2026 to conform to the new legal requirement.",
      "Expectant mothers and women trying to conceive should continue to take supplementary folic acid -  the synthetic version of the vitamin folate - as currently advised by medical practioners.",
      "Folic acid is particularly important in early pregnancy, aiding proper development of the baby's brain, skull and spinal cord.",
      "Experts, many of whom have called for the move for a number of years, have welcomed the government's decision.",
      "The announcement follows health improvements in other countries, such as Australia and Canada, where the practice is already carried out.",
      "Some say the change doesn't go far enough, however, and more foods should be included.",
      "Prof Neena Modi, professor of neonatal medicine at Imperial College London, said: \"This will disadvantage groups such as women who are sensitive to gluten, eat rice in preference to bread, and products made from wholemeal flour - excluding them and their babies from benefiting, and thus adding to the considerable health inequities that already exist in the UK.\"",
      "The vitamin folate, also known as vitamin B9, is found in everyday foods such as beans and some green vegetables, meaning most people receive a sufficient dose  from eating a regular, healthy diet.",
      "In addition, the NHS recommends women who are trying for a baby take folic acid supplements for approximately three months before getting pregnant, and for at least 12 weeks after becoming pregnant. This recommendation will remain in place.",
      "It is estimated that half of all pregnancies in the UK are unplanned. The fortification of flour will therefore help boost intake of folic acid across the population, and, indirectly, better protect unborn babies.",
      "The government's independent advisory body has looked at all the evidence and is satisfied that fortification is the right course of action for society as a whole.",
      "Small-scale millers (producing less than 500 metric tonnes of flour a year) will be exempt.",
      "Flour is already fortified with calcium, niacin, thiamine and iron as a means of improving public health."

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 20:08:55 GMT",
    "summary": "The TV presenter has a colloid cyst, which is not cancerous but could cause problems if it grows.",
    "story": [
      "Davina McCall is recovering from surgery she underwent to remove a rare brain tumour, her partner has said.",
      "The TV presenter, 57, earlier posted a video on Instagram to say she had been diagnosed with a type of benign tumour called a colloid cyst.",
      "In an update on Friday evening, Michael Douglas said McCall was \"out of surgery\" and recovering in hospital - and thanked well-wishers \"for all the love\". He added that McCall was \"utterly exhausted\".",
      "A benign tumour is not cancerous, but such cysts tend to grow slowly, according to the Brainstrust charity.",
      "In the statement, shared to McCall's 1.9 million Instagram followers, Douglas said a doctor had described the procedure as being \"textbook\".",
      "Prior to the surgery, McCall explained how the tumour had been found by chance.",
      "\"A few months ago, I did a menopause talk for a company and they offered me a health scan in return, which I thought I was going to ace,\" she said in the video.",
      "\"But it turned out I had a benign brain tumour called a colloid cyst, which is very rare - three in a million.",
      "\"And so I slightly put my head in the sand for a while, and then I saw quite a few neurosurgeons. I got lots of opinions, and I realised that I have to get it taken out.",
      "\"It's big for the space. It fills the space. It's 14mm wide, and it needs to come out because if it grows, it would be bad. So I'm having it removed via a craniotomy.\"",
      "A craniotomy is an operation where a surgeon removes part of the skull to take out the tumour.",
      "\"Get the cyst, empty it, take it out, Bob's your uncle,\" McCall said.",
      "Speaking alongside her partner Douglas, she added: \"I'm OK. It's been up and down, obviously. We've been through a lot, yes.\"",
      "She said she expected to spend about nine days in hospital after the operation.",
      "She told followers: \"I don't want you to worry about me. I'm doing that enough.",
      "\"But I'm not worrying too much and I am in a good space. I have all the faith in the world in my surgeon and his team, and I am handing the reins over to him.",
      "\"He knows what he's doing, and I'm going to do the getting better bit after. I'll see you on the other side.\"",
      "Douglas said then that he would temporarily take over her social media.",
      "What are colloid cysts?",
      "They typically form in a fluid-filled cavity in the centre of the brain, and are themselves filled with fluid, the Brains Trust says.",
      "They account for less than 2% of all primary brain tumours, and the rate of growth and symptoms can vary from person to person, according to the charity.",
      "They are often found during a scan for something else, and some surgeons recommend a watch and wait policy if the cyst is small and causing no symptoms.",
      "However, as they grow they can block the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), causing symptoms including headaches, vision problems, nausea and loss of consciousness. In extreme cases, without treatment they can cause coma and even sudden death.",
      "'We're grateful to Davina'",
      "The Brain Tumour Charity told BBC News: \"All of us wish Davina the best possible outcome for this procedure.",
      "\"As an inspiration to so many, we're grateful that she has chosen to raise awareness of this uniquely devastating disease.",
      "\"We are committed to funding pioneering research, campaigning for systemic change and offering support to all those whose lives are turned upside down by a brain tumour diagnosis.\"",
      "Will Jones, chief executive of Brainstrust, added: \"Brain tumours are indiscriminate, they can affect anyone and they are more common than people might think. Over 80,000 people in the UK are living with a brain tumour, and there are over 130 different diagnoses.\"",
      "He added they were also \"grateful to Davina\" for sharing her story \"openly and candidly\".",
      "\"This will help hundreds of people living with a colloid cyst to feel acknowledged and less alone,\" he said.",
      "McCall's long TV presenting career includes Channel 4's Big Brother, ITV's Long Lost Family, and My Mum, Your Dad, along with Comic and Sport Relief for the BBC.",
      "Earlier this year she won a special recognition award at the National TV Awards, for her contributions to the TV industry over her career.",
      "She also campaigns on menopause awareness, after her changing hormones prompted her to  highlight women's experiences with her work.",
      "Last year she won the top prize at the British Book Awards for 2022's Menopausing, which she co-wrote with Dr Naomi Potter.",

      "Screening men born with a high risk of developing prostate cancer, once they reach the age of 45, makes financial sense, a cancer charity says.",
      "But Prostate Cancer Research also acknowledges more accurate tests would be needed to justify screening all men.",
      "There is no prostate cancer screening programme in the UK, unlike those for breast, bowel and cervical cancer.",
      "Instead, the onus is on men to request a blood test from their GP once they are over 50.",
      "Following his recent terminal cancer diagnosis, Olympic cyclist Sir Chris Hoy has called for more, younger men to be tested - including those with a family history of the disease - and the government has asked the NHS to examine the evidence again.",
      "Oliver Kemp, head of the charity Prostate Cancer Research, said the current system is not working.",
      "He told the BBC's Today Programme: \"Not everyone is even aware that they have a prostate, never mind that they are at higher risk.",
      "\"Not as many people are turning up to their doctors as they should be.\"",
      "The BBC's Inside Health has been looking at the issue.",
      "More men dying",
      "The debate around prostate screening revolves around an imperfect test and the trade-off between finding some men\u2019s aggressive cancers earlier and the harms of diagnosing and treating slow-growing tumours that would never have affected a man\u2019s health or lifespan.",
      "The case for and against is constantly reviewed in the UK, with the most recent report from the National Screening Committee, in 2020, saying the harms were too great.",
      "Further updates are expected this year.",
      "Despite more men dying from prostate cancer than women from breast cancer, there is no reliable test for the disease.",
      "The blood test men over 50 can request from their GP measures prostate-specific antigen (PSA), released by the prostate, a small gland located below the bladder involved in the production of semen.",
      "But PSA levels can be high for a variety of reasons - including an enlarged prostate, inflammation or infection, recent vigorous exercise or sex - or remain normal despite cancer.",
      "What are the symptoms of prostate cancer?",
      "I'm more grateful for each day - Sir Chris Hoy",
      "And there are many different kinds of prostate cancer - not all deadly.",
      "\"There are prostate cancers that are so slow-growing that they will not affect a man's lifespan,\" GP Dr Margaret McCartney says.",
      "These are found in one in three men over 50.",
      "\"And then you have a small number of very aggressive prostate cancers which do move quickly and cause harm,\" Dr McCartney says.",
      "Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and a tissue biopsy can help  narrow down which men have cancer and need treatment - but some still end up being treated for something that would never cause a problem.",
      "\"Far more men have tests done to try to work out what kind of prostate cancer it is, than are going to benefit from it - there's the problem,\" Dr McCartney says.",
      "Conflicting results",
      "Clinical trials have produced conflicting results about screening.",
      "One, in Europe, says it saves lives.",
      "Another, in the UK, shows a more marginal benefit.",
      "And a third, in the US, says it does not.",
      "Prof Hashim Ahmed, chair of urology at Imperial College London, says: \u201cWe need to screen 570 men to prevent one death - that\u2019s a lot of men to counsel.\u201d",
      "Screening means aggressive cancers can be treated before symptoms appear.",
      "But trials show there are harms to testing large numbers of healthy men - and once a cancer is spotted, even a low-risk one, it needs to be followed up.",
      "Many men with a low-risk cancer are simply monitored or begin \u201cwatchful waiting\u201d - but a cancer diagnosis and the invasive tests it involves have a psychological impact.",
      "One in 10 of these men opts for radical surgery rather than live with the anxiety of wondering whether their cancer will grow, Prof Ahmed says.",
      "But this can leave them unable to maintain an erection - and a third spend the rest of their life needing a pad because they leak urine.",
      "\u201cAt the age of 47-48, if we're talking about testing and diagnosing men at that age, that's two or three decades of those kinds of symptoms,\" Prof Ahmed told BBC Radio 4's Inside Health programme.",
      "\"So I would rather avoid finding low-risk disease.\u201d",
      "Much research in the field has focused on refining the process to minimise the harms of screening.",
      "And Prof Ahmed is running the Transform trial, starting next year, to compare the most promising technologies.",
      "But the results could be 10 years away.",
      "In the meantime, Prostate Cancer Research's report says, screening 45-69-year-olds at high risk - black men and those with a family history of the disease or particular gene mutations - would deliver an economic benefit, after factoring in the cost of treatment and the impact on working lives and carers.",
      "\"Finding and treating cancers early outweighs the harms of over-treatment by four times,\" the charity's chief executive, Oliver Kemp, says.",
      "And another charity, Prostate Cancer UK, says the report supports its call to overhaul \"dangerously outdated NHS guidance that is leading to too many men receiving a late, incurable diagnoses\".",
      "Prof Frank Chinegwundoh, a consultant urological surgeon at Barts Health NHS Trust, says: \"It\u2019s very difficult to weigh up the risks and benefits.\"",
      "But he often sees men who could have been diagnosed earlier - and they can be relatively young, he says.",
      "\"We can do a lot better than we are currently doing,\" Prof Chinegwundoh told Inside Health.",
      "And he says black men - who have double the risk of the disease - should consider having a PSA test at 40, particularly if they have a strong family history of the cancer.",
      "But earlier this year, concerns were raised black men were at greater risk than other men of being harmed by a cancer diagnosis that did not need to be treated, because they have naturally higher PSA levels.",

      "If passed, the landmark bill would offer this choice to those who are expected to die within six months - provided their decision is approved by doctors.",
      "They would need to be satisfied that a patient's choice has been made without pressure or coercion.",
      "But the debate has raised questions about how terminally ill people could be safeguarded and coercion avoided - with criticism of the proposal coming from both Labour and Conservative politicians.",
      "BBC News has spoken to two people who have terminal conditions, Elise Burns, who supports assisted dying, and Nik Ward, who hopes the bill does not pass.",
      "Nik has motor neurone disease, and says he probably would have chosen assisted dying three years ago if it had been legal.",
      "The 53-year-old has been told for the past five years that he is terminally ill and knows he could die tomorrow by choking on food or on his own saliva.",
      "\"I prided myself on my health and fitness,\" says Nik, who now uses a motorised wheelchair and breathing apparatus.",
      "\"Twenty years ago, if you were to say to me that I'd be in a wheelchair, I'd be like 'Nah mate, it's all right. I'd rather go.'\"",
      "Assisted dying bill has strict safeguards, MP says",
      "Assisted dying could lead to coercion - Streeting",
      "What is assisted dying and how could the law change?",
      "Now Nik says his attitude to life - and death - has changed and he is grateful to have seen his children grow up. His eldest daughter is engaged to be married.",
      "Under the proposed law, Nik is concerned that other people suffering terminal illnesses would choose an assisted death and miss out on the joys that more life could bring - even if they are less physically able.",
      "The private members' bill was put forward by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater but the deeply sensitive nature of this issue has split politicians in all major parties.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has promised his party will be allowed to vote freely with their conscience.",
      "Many people living with terminal illnesses have said the bill offers them hope that they may not have to experience a painful or prolonged death.",
      "Elise Burns lives in constant pain due to terminal breast cancer that has spread to her bones, lungs and liver. She has been told she might have only two years to live.",
      "The 50-year-old relies on two different forms of morphine and a high-strength co-codamol to manage the pain. Some days \"they don\u2019t touch the sides\", leaving her barely able to move.",
      "The pain is worst in her thigh, where she had a metal rod inserted after cancer rotted her femur.",
      "Elise says the pain will only get worse as her body becomes more tolerant of painkillers \u2013 making them less effective.",
      "\"I'm not scared to die but I am scared of a bad death \u2013 a long, drawn-out, brutal, horrific death. That terrifies me.\"",
      "There has been particular concern among critics of the bill about how people who have been left vulnerable by life-threatening illness will be safeguarded.",
      "Some believe the existence of assisted dying legislation could create an implicit pressure on terminally ill people - even if no-one is actively trying to coerce them.",
      "Nik describes this possibility as a \"very subtle but very insistent background noise\".",
      "He thinks people who may feel like a burden to their loved-ones might, for example, choose to \"end their lives because they feel like they ought to for their children's sake\".",
      "\"It's the people that are most thoughtful, most considerate \u2013 they're the very people that I'm worried about,\" he adds.",
      "But Nik acknowledges that, though MND has robbed him of his active body, he is not enduring constant pain like Elise and some other terminally ill people.",
      "\"I fully respect their position,\" he says. \"I'm living in a fairly privileged situation, in some senses.\"",
      "Elise disagrees that the bill would coerce people into prematurely ending their lives, as this option would only be available to those with six months to live.",
      "As a safeguard, the person's request to die would need to be approved by two doctors and a judge.",
      "Elise accepts that those opposed to the bill have questions about the effectiveness of these safety measures, and the ethics of assisted dying.",
      "\"It's such a complex issue and I don't have all the answers. What I would say is that everyone should have the choice to do what they wish with their bodies.\"",
      "Elise knows she will die soon but says having a choice about when this happens would bring her comfort and reassurance.",
      "She believes it is likely that, if the bill is approved, it will come too late to help her.",
      "Instead, she plans to use the assisted dying service offered by the Swiss firm Dignitas.",
      "She says their process requires a lot of paperwork beforehand and will cost her between \u00a312,000-\u00a315,000.",
      "She says she is fortunate enough to be able to afford the sum but that the high prices involved are another reason why the law should be changed \u2013 so that assisted dying is possible for every terminally ill person who chooses it, not just those who can afford it.",
      "If the bill does pass, Elise wishes she could \"be there to see it\".",

    "story": [
      "Boris Johnson\u2019s government blocked a request to fund another 10,000 hospital beds at the height of the Covid pandemic, the chief executive of NHS England has said.",
      "Amanda Pritchard told the UK Covid-19 Inquiry the decision, made by the Treasury in July 2020, had been \u201cvery disappointing\u201d.",
      "Extra beds and staff would have been used to cut waiting lists for planned care and \u201cbuild resilience\u201d going into a second winter wave of the pandemic, she said.",
      "The government has said it cannot comment while the inquiry is in progress.",
      "Health ministers from the time are expected to give evidence later this month, to the third section of the inquiry, looking at Covid's impact on the NHS and healthcare systems across the UK.",
      "Ms Pritchard served as NHS England\u2019s chief operating officer from 2019 until she was promoted to chief executive, in August 2021.",
      "In her evidence, she said a request had been made to the government, for 10,000 extra permanent, staffed hospital beds, in July 2020.",
      "\u2018Very disappointing\u2019",
      "The demand had been based on modelling the spread of the virus, along with the need to deal with other pressures that coming winter and resume more planned, or elective, surgery and other treatments for non-Covid patients.",
      "But the inquiry heard the Treasury and the prime minister\u2019s private office had refused the request, saying they wanted more use made of temporary Nightingale hospitals along with the private sector.",
      "And Ms Prichard had been told the decision would be looked at again as part of a wider spending review expected in the autumn of 2021.",
      "She called the decision \u201cvery disappointing\u201d, saying waiting lists for planned NHS treatment in England would be in \u201cquite a different position\u201d today had the extra funding been agreed.",
      "\u201cIf we had had that capacity, we could certainly have treated thousands more patients\u2026 as well as being more resilient going into the second wave of the pandemic and into winter more generally,\u201d Ms Prichard said.",
      "In the summer of 2020, the NHS in England had a total permanent bed capacity to treat about 95,000 patients in acute hospitals.",
      "That was increased by another 4,000 from winter 2023, under a recovery plan agreed by then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.",
      "\u2018Completely overwhelming\u2019",
      "Later in her evidence, Ms Pritchard said the health service had faced a period of \u201cextreme pressure\u201d in the winter of 2020-21, as another wave of Covid spread across the country.",
      "By that point, new treatments had been discovered, including the cheap steroid dexamethasone, and the first Covid vaccines were starting to be rolled out in small numbers.",
      "But the level of community transmission at the time meant some intensive-care units were still being pushed \u201cto the brink\u201d and were \u201cright on the edge\u201d of running out of bed space.",
      "Nationally, the health service had never had to \u201csystematically limit\u201d access to treatments because hospitals could not cope with demand, Ms Pritchard said.",
      "\u201cThat does not mean, though, that it did not feel completely overwhelming to staff at this time in those places - and it does not mean that the kind of care that was being provided was anything like normal,\u201d she added.",
      "'Field hospitals'",
      "Ms Pritchard was also asked about the seven temporary Nightingale hospitals built quickly, in March and April 2020, across England to treat Covid patients.",
      "Data seen by the inquiry shows the total cost to the taxpayer, including setting up and decommissioning, is now estimated at \u00a3358.5m.",
      "The hospitals \u2013 in Birmingham, Bristol, Exeter, Harrogate, London, Manchester and Sunderland \u2013 treated 141 Covid patients in the first wave of the virus and 1,097 Covid and other patients in the second wave.",
      "In total, \u00a350.4m was spent on one site, Birmingham, which was never used by patients in the pandemic.",
      "The site in Bristol also carried out 6,554 assessments for patients from the eye hospital in the city.",
      "Ms Pritchard told the inquiry the programme had still been \u201cuseful\u201d, as the sites had been envisaged as \u201cmilitary field hospitals\u201d at the time.",
      "\u201cWe thought we were doing it to avoid a northern Italy situation,\u201d she said, referring to scenes in Lombardy, where intensive-care units had been overwhelmed.",

      "He apologised for his \"weakness\", resigned the Conservative whip and stood down from his posts on two parliamentary committees. He had already announced he would not stand in the next general election.",
      "\"When I found out some of the things that had been going on, I just felt enormous guilt, enormous remorse,\" he tells me. \"My mood just plummeted.\"",

      "The Westminster catfishing operation was sophisticated, and had been under way for many months before Wragg became involved. But he concedes that his actions led to friends and colleagues also becoming victims.",
      "Wragg says he feels \"great regret\" and has \"sought to apologise\", adding: \"I hope I can explain it in the context of the almost sense of control, the influence this person had over me.\"",
      "However, one former MP who believes his number was passed on by Wragg told the BBC: \"None of us to my recollection have ever received an apology from Will\u2026 It might be an idea for him to apologise to those he dropped in the dirt.\"",
      "Contrary to some early speculation, police have said they do not think any other foreign state was involved. In June a member of the Labour Party in his mid-20s was arrested in London on suspicion of harassment and offences under the Online Safety Act. He has been bailed until late November.",
      "Seven months on from the height of the scandal, Wragg has left the world of Westminster behind. He is much happier, he says, but still talks of the \"shame\" he feels and the \"havoc\" the catfisher wrought.",
      "\"I have no bitterness or anger left in me,\" he says, when I ask how he feels about the catfisher. \"Because I felt so wretched and awful in myself.\"",
      "He believes they were motivated by sexual kicks and by the power they held over others.",
      "\"My only wish for them is not to do it any more,\" he says. \"And to understand that impersonating or pretending to be somebody\u2026 it's not victimless. It is very real and its psychological impact is particularly strong.\"",
      "Wragg hopes by speaking out he may help others to spot the signs of catfishing, and report it. ActionFraud has received almost 7,500 reports of dating scams so far this year.",
      "\"It\u2019s a source of great shame that my time in Parliament ended in this way,\" he says.",
      "On his final day as an MP, Wragg had a consultation with a psychologist, which he jokes is \"a fitting summation\" of his nine years in the Commons.",
      "\"They have two mental health beds available at any one time for members of Parliament. And it's surprising how often they're occupied.\"",
      "The trauma of recent months has undoubtedly damaged his interest in dating. Does he think he\u2019ll find love? \"I hope so, yes,\" he says. \"But I'm being a bit more guarded at the moment.\"",

      "The Home Office \"cut corners\" and made \"poor decisions\", while under pressure to stop housing migrants in hotels, when it paid \u00a315m for an asbestos-contaminated derelict prison, the government's spending watchdog has said.",
      "The National Audit Office (NAO) said the amount paid for the Northeye site in East Sussex in 2023 under the Conservative government was more than twice what the seller paid in 2022.",
      "A report found \"corners [were] cut\" so the site could be acquired quickly to house asylum seekers despite an assessment deeming it \"high risk\".",
      "The Home Office said the report related to the last government's actions and it remained \"committed to ending the use of hotels\".",
      "In December 2022, then-prime minister Rishi Sunak delivered a statement in Parliament in which he vowed to end the use of hotels to house asylum seekers, saying that the government would \"work to achieve this as quickly as possible\".",
      "In its report, the NAO said the statement \"generated significant pressure within the Home Office to identify and secure sites for asylum accommodation at pace\".",
      "It added that, the following January, a decision to acquire Northeye was taken by a small group of ministers and officials from across Whitehall, despite the \"technical due diligence and approvals process not having been undertaken\".",
      "The group included the minister for immigration and the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the report said, positions then held by Robert Jenrick and Oliver Dowden.",
      "'High risk'",

      "The following month, Jenrick announced that Northeye would be developed to house 1,200 people, and the sale was completed in September 2023.",
      "The final price paid for the site was \u00a315.4m, including \u00a30.9m paid to the vendors - Brockwell Group Bexhill LLP - because the Home Office had underestimated how long it would take to complete the purchase.",
      "Brockwell had bought Northeye in August 2022 for \u00a36.3m.",
      "The costs of remediation because of the contamination at the site were estimated to be between \u00a31.1m and \u00a33.6m.",

      "Speaking to the NHS Providers conference in Liverpool, Streeting said: \"I've asked my department to look at the costs that would be associated with providing a new service to enable assisted dying to go forward.\"",
      "The department said it had not begun a formal review, but assessing the impact of potential new legislation was \u201cregular policy work\u201d.",
      "Streeting also said he was worried about a \"chilling slippery slope argument\" if people felt compelled to end their own lives as a cost-saving measure.",
      "But he added: \"Regardless of my own personal position or my own vote, my department and the whole government will respect the will of Parliament if people vote for assisted dying.\"",
      "'Implications'",
      "Streeting had earlier warned that financing assisted dying would come at the expense of other NHS services.",
      "Asked by Times Radio whether he would have to find money from elsewhere if the bill became law, Streeting said: \"Yep, to govern is to choose.",
      "\"If Parliament chooses to go ahead with assisted dying, it is making a choice that this is an area to prioritise for investment. And we'd have to work through those implications.\"",
      "He said the health service would \"need to work through with the medical profession what would be a very new way of working\".",
      "\"No one should be compelled, for example, to take part in assisted dying if they have got moral or ethical objections as clinicians. That certainly would be one of my red lines\".",

      "The prime minister's spokesperson said it was \"a matter for Parliament to decide\" after debating \"the issues surrounding the Bill\".",
      "Free vote",
      "The assisted dying bill has been introduced by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, who argues her legislation is the \"most robust\" in the world. She has said she expects hundreds of dying people to apply if it is available.",
      "Critics of her measure have raised fears of coercion and a slippery slope to wider legislation taking in more people.",
      "Speaking on Tuesday, Leadbeater rejected these claims, saying her bill had \u201cthree layers of scrutiny,\u201d requiring sign-offs from two doctors and a High Court judge, and made coercion punishable by up to 14 years in prison.",
      "Only terminally-ill adults with less than six months to live who have a settled wish to end their lives would be eligible under the new law.",
      "MPs are scheduled to debate and vote on the bill on 29 November.",
      "The prime minister, a former director of public prosecutions, has previously supported assisted dying, but the government has pledged to remain neutral on the issue, and MPs are being allowed to vote according to their conscience rather than along party lines.",
      "This will be the first Commons vote on assisted dying since MPs rejected allowing terminally ill adults to end their lives under medical supervision in 2015. As a backbench Labour MP, Streeting voted in favour of that measure.",
      "If the bill passes its first vote later this month, it will receive further scrutiny from MPs and peers, who could choose to amend it."

    "summary": "The chancellor says she wants to \u201cfire up the UK\u2019s economy\u201d with a \"Canadian-style\" pensions model.",
    "story": [
      "Plans for a major shake-up of pension funds have been announced by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves.",
      "She wants to create pension \"megafunds\" by merging the UK's 86 council schemes, using the set-up in Canada and Australia as a model.",
      "Other proposals suggest pension schemes need to reach a certain size or pool together. Larger funds could then be invested in UK infrastructure projects, the government says.",
      "So, will this affect people with pension savings?",
      "Which pension funds are involved?",
      "The government says the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) can get more from investments - while tackling a \u00a32bn bill for fees - by joining together.",
      "There are 86 local government pension funds in England and Wales, which are mainly paid into by local government workers.",
      "These individually managed funds are divided by local authority, making it more costly, because each fund is paying its own management and administration fees.",
      "Between them, they have 6.5 million members and manage assets worth \u00a3354bn.",
      "The schemes are all part of the LGPS which is the seventh-largest in the world, according to the UK government.",
      "Most of its participants are low-paid women.",
      "Under Reeves\u2019 plans, the funds would be consolidated in some way, although at present it is unclear exactly how.",
      "She may ask them to pool their assets and resources, or she may ask them to merge with one another to create a smaller number of larger funds, which would benefit from greater financial firepower and fewer costs.",
      "The LGPS is a defined benefit scheme which means that, when it is time to draw their pensions, its savers get an agreed amount based on their salary, no matter what the fund is worth at the time.",
      "So drawing scheme into \"megafunds\" will make little, or no, difference to what they receive.",
      "That is different to private pension pots, which rise and fall in value depending on how investments perform.",
      "Why copy Canada and Australia?",
      "The \u201cMaple 8\u201d is a group of vast Canadian pension funds, including the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, which manages assets worth C$247.5bn (\u00a3141.8bn), and the Canada Pension Plan, whose assets are worth C$409.6bn.",
      "While UK pension schemes tend to invest more in assets like equities and bonds, their Canadian rivals focus more on private markets.",
      "The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, for example, only has 7% of its assets in listed equities, compared with 60% for traditional pension funds.",
      "Instead, it skews its investments towards private markets, including infrastructure (including a 25% stake in British energy giant SSE), real estate and private equity deals.",
      "This kind of model is not without risk, however.",
      "The Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System is the largest investor in the troubled Thames Water, which has been highlighted by those questioning Reeves' plans.",
      "Why is bigger supposed to be better?",
      "Individually, the UK\u2019s 86 local government pension schemes vary in size, from Greater Manchester\u2019s massive \u00a330bn fund all the way down to several schemes which are \u201csub-\u00a31bn\u201d, according to Joanne Donnelly, board secretary at the Local Government Pension Scheme Advisory Board.",
      "Running these schemes costs money. Each one must pay administration, governance and management costs, which can build up \u2013 last year, they increased by \u00a328m.",
      "Like her predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, who also announced plans for a Canadian-style model, the chancellor believes consolidation would save money.",
      "That would in turn \u201cdeliver better returns for savers and unlock billions of pounds of investment\u201d.",
      "Other chancellors have aimed to make similar moves, including George Osborne who, in 2015, set out plans for local government schemes to pool resources,",
      "Does everyone agree with the idea?",
      "Tracy Blackwell, chief executive of Pension Insurance Corporation, told the BBC: \"I think by having the scale and the right expertise internally to invest in a wide range of assets, they'll be able to invest in a lot more than what they can invest in now.\"",
      "However, some argue megafunds would not invest so much in smaller projects while some claim the changes could bring risks for pension savers.",
      "\"Conflating a government goal of driving investment in the UK and people\u2019s retirement outcomes brings a danger because the risks are all taken with members\u2019 money,\" said Tom Selby at investment platform AJ Bell.",
      "He said the current system encourages trustees to deliver the best outcome for members rather than focus on UK-wide economic growth, which might mean investing outside the UK.",
      "Others question whether there are enough big UK projects to invest in.",
      "\"Large funds need substantial, reliable projects to generate returns, but the market may struggle to offer enough of these opportunities, especially in the infrastructure sector,\" said Jon Greer, head of retirement policy at wealth manager Quilter."

      "After weeks of stonewalling, an answer: no.",

      "In other words, what might have seemed like a mutually convenient layby into which Ms Gray could be shunted, ended up perpetuating a rather public soap opera.",
      "Some sceptics had seen the new gig as a non-job from the start. The government saying it isn\u2019t looking to fill the vacancy will do little to dispel that instinct from those who thought it all along.",

    "title": "What's so wrong with Right To Buy?",
    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 07:43:38 GMT",
    "summary": "The Labour government is expected to make major changes to the Right To Buy scheme launched in the 1980s.",
    "story": [
      "When Harold Wilson was Labour prime minister in the late 1960s, up to a third of people in England lived in a council house or flat.",
      "But by the time Keir Starmer became prime minister in July this year, the proportion of people in England living in social housing had fallen to about 16% of the population \u2013 about four million.",
      "About two million council-built properties have been sold to their tenants at significantly discounted prices under the Right To Buy (RTB) scheme since it was introduced by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Conservative government in the early 1980s.",
      "Michael Heseltine described the advent of RTB as \"laying the foundations of one of the most important social revolutions of the century\", but was selling off council houses more cheaply than new ones could be built simply laying the foundations of a housing crisis?",
      "Waiting lists",
      "Historically, money raised from selling off council houses has not gone far towards building new ones - new ones desperately needed, considering about 1.3 million people are on waiting lists for them in England.",
      "Across the north-west of England, for example, about 4,350 council houses have been sold off in the last 10 years, with the money made from the sales going towards building or buying just over 1,400 others, according to government data.",
      "While the \u00a3336,612,000 raised from those sales may sound a reasonable sum, it works out on average at about \u00a377,000 per house. And, generally, councils have not been allowed to keep the whole amount, instead having to hand a sizeable chunk back to the government.",
      "About 200,000 people are on waiting lists for social housing in the region.",
      "While housing associations may have built homes, and there may have been schemes funded by cash from other government pots, the fact that the money raised from selling off homes is nowhere near enough to rebuild or buy like-for-like has been a long-standing concern.",
      "And it would seem Labour deputy prime minister and minister for housing Angela Rayner \u2013 who famously bought her own council house in Stockport under RTB \u2013 has taken on board the views of RTB critics.",
      "Rayner has said recently she may impose restrictions so that people who move into newly built council houses will not be able to buy them in the future.",
      "It is a decision that is likely to be welcomed by Labour politicians in regions where the need for social housing is arguably as great as ever, but the amount of it available is very low.",
      "The Labour metro-mayors of both Liverpool and Manchester regions have both said they want to see more social housing built in their regions.",
      "In May, Andy Burnham, leader of Greater Manchester, called on the-then Conservative government to pause RTB on new builds after losing 500 social homes to the scheme in 2022.",
      "He argued that if planned homes could be bought by their tenants, it would be \"like trying to fill a bath without the plug in\".",
      "On Merseyside, virtually all former council housing stock was transferred to housing associations over the last two decades.",
      "But metro mayor Steve Rotheram says registered social landlords (RSLs) have inherited some of the problems that came with RTB.",
      "He says one Merseyside RSL had lost about a third of its homes through sales to tenants in the decade since the housing stock was transferred.",
      "People who are tenants of RSLs can buy their homes under \u201cpreserved\u201d RTB if they lived in their homes when the council owned them.",
      "And once someone has lived in an RSL property for three years, they can apply for the Right To Acquire.",
      "Rotheram says cheaper borrowing rates for RSLs and a moratorium on sales would help boost growth in social housing.",
      "\"You are not going to build a lot of houses for someone to come along in three or four years and buy it below market value,\" he says.",
      "\"How we deal with this is part of our growth plan going to the government, and we are now trying to see if we can work with [Rayner] to come up with proposals.\"",
      "Blackpool Council\u2019s cabinet member for economy and the built environment, Mark Smith, is clear that while the money generated from RTB sales is used to support various investments in housing, the RTB receipts his council receives are \"not sufficient to replace lost social rent housing\".",
      "And he says even with changes such as the government giving councils more flexibility to allow RTB receipts to be used alongside cash from other streams such as funds given by developers who get planning permission for private schemes, there is still some red tape in the way of using different types of funding together to build council housing.",
      "\"We do the best we can within the parameters of the policy as it exists currently but there is always room for improvement,\" he says.",
      "Under the new Labour government policies, councils and housing associations are being given \u201cmore freedom\u201d to decide how to use their RTB money.",
      "Previously, only 50% of the money a council received from a sale could go towards building or buying a new house.",
      "But in future councils will be able to use all that money, and put money received from private developers handed over as part of planning agreements into projects as well.",
      "These deals, known as Section 106 agreements, see developers give money to councils to mitigate any negative impacts their private schemes might have on local communities or housing markets.",
      "Sources within the social housing sector say that in the past the \"policy has never achieved anything like a one-for-one replacement ratio\".",
      "\"If it had then there would be a lot less concern about the policy,\" one says.",
      "\"Yes, a Right To Buy home continues to be a home after it\u2019s sold, but it contributes to a huge loss of social housing stock and contributes to housing waiting lists, or people having to live in unsuitable accommodation.\"",
      "'Serious shortage'",
      "The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils, says there is a \"serious housing shortage in this country\" and \"record numbers of people living in temporary accommodation\".",
      "Adam Hug, the LGA\u2019s housing spokesman, says: \u201cWhile the Right To Buy can and has delivered home ownership for many the scheme in its current form does not work.",
      "\"Rising discounts, alongside other measures that restrict councils\u2019 use of Right To Buy receipts, mean that the money raised from the sale of property is usually not sufficient to cover the building costs of replacing the property.",
      "\"We have long called for the removal of rules and restrictions which disincentivise local authorities from building social homes, at risk of losing them.",
      "\"Councils must be given the control, power and flexibility to use receipt monies in a way that works best for their local areas, which includes retaining 100 per cent of the receipts permanently.\"",
      "'Scandal'",
      "In 2012, the Conservative-led government increased the discount a tenant could receive when buying their home.",
      "Since coming to power, Labour has said the discount will be reduced to between \u00a316,000 and \u00a338,000, depending on the location \u2013 a significant reduction from the \u00a3136,000 discount currently available in London and the discount of just over \u00a3100,000 elsewhere.",
      "Rayner, who bought her Stockport council house under a RTB discount in 2007 and sold it several years later for \u00a348,000 more than she paid for it, said she wanted to see a \u201cfairer\u201d system.",
      "Her department says it is a \"scandal\" that only about one third of homes lost to RTB have been replaced since 2012, and that it was \"working at pace to reverse the continued decline of social rented homes\".",
      "But while the government stresses there are \"no plans to abolish the RTB\", the \"social revolution\" Lord Heseltine heralded nearly 45 years ago is clearly facing a radical change to everything but its name.",

      "The mystery as to why a beluga whale appeared off the coast of Norway wearing a harness may finally have been solved.",
      "The tame white whale, which locals named Hvaldimir, made headlines five years ago amidst widespread speculation that it was a Russian spy.",
      "Now an expert in the species says she believes the whale did indeed belong to the military and escaped from a naval base in the Arctic Circle.",
      "But Dr Olga Shpak does not believe it was a spy. She believes the beluga was being trained to guard the base and fled because it was a \"hooligan\".",
      "Seeking sanctuary for whale dubbed a Russian spy",
      "Russia has always refused to confirm or deny that the beluga whale was trained by its military.",
      "But Dr Shpak, who worked in Russia researching marine mammals from the 1990s until she returned to her native Ukraine in 2022, told BBC News: \u201cFor me it\u2019s 100% (certain).\u201d",
      "Dr Shpak, whose account is based on conversations with friends and former colleagues, features in a BBC documentary, Secrets of the Spy Whale, which is now on BBC iPlayer and being shown on BBC Two on Wednesday at 21:00 GMT.",
      "Secrets of the Spy Whale",
      "The mysterious whale first came to public attention five years ago when it approached fishermen off the northern coast of Norway.",
      "\u201cThe whale starts rubbing against the boat,\u201d Joar Hesten, one of the fishermen, says. \u201cI heard about animals in distress that instinctively knew that they need help from humans. I was thinking that this is one smart whale.\u201d",
      "The sighting was unusual because the beluga was so tame and they're rarely seen as far south. It was also wearing a harness, which had a mount for a camera, and bore the words, in English, \u201cEquipment St Petersburg\u201d.",
      "Mr Hesten helped to remove the harness from the whale, which then swam to the nearby port of Hammerfest, where it lived for several months.",
      "Seemingly unable to catch live fish to eat, it charmed visitors by nudging at their cameras and even on one occasion returning a mobile phone.",
      "\u201cIt was very obvious that this particular whale had been conditioned to be putting his nose on anything that looked like a target because he was doing it each time,\u201d says Eve Jourdain, a researcher from the Norwegian Orca Survey.",
      "\u201cBut we have no idea what kind of facility he was in, so we don\u2019t know what he was trained for.\u201d",
      "Captivated by the whale's story Norway made arrangements for the beluga to be monitored and fed. The name it was given \u2013 Hvaldimir - is a nod to hval which is Norwegian for whale, and the name of Russia's President, Vladimir Putin.",
      "Dr Shpak did not want to name her sources in Russia for their own safety but said she had been told that when the beluga surfaced in Norway, the Russian marine mammal community immediately identified it as one of theirs.",
      "\u201cThrough the chain of vets and trainers the message came back \u2013 that they were missing a beluga called Andruha,\u201d she says.",
      "According to Dr Shpak, Andruha/Hvaldimir had first been captured in 2013 in the Sea of Okhotsk in Russia's Far East. A year later it was moved from a facility owned by a dolphinarium in St Petersburg to the military programme in the Russian Arctic, where his trainers and vets remained in contact.",
      "\u201cI believe that when they started to work in open water, trusting this animal (not to swim away), the animal just gave up on them,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cWhat I've heard from the guys at the commercial dolphinarium who used to have him was that Andruha was smart, so a good choice to be trained. But at the same time, he was kind of like a hooligan - an active beluga - so they were not surprised that he gave up on (following) the boat and went where he wanted to.\u201d",
      "Satellite images from near the Russian naval base in Murmansk show what could have been Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s old home. Pens can clearly be seen in the water with what appear to be white whales inside.",
      "\u201cThe location of the beluga whales very close to the submarines and the surface vessels might tell us that they are actually part of a guarding system,\u201d says Thomas Nilsen, from Norwegian online newspaper The Barents Observer.",
      "Russia, for its part, has never officially addressed the claim that Hvaldimir/Andruha was trained by its army. But it does have a long history of training marine mammals for military purposes.",
      "Speaking in 2019, a Russian reserve colonel, Viktor Baranets, said: \"If we were using this animal for spying, do you really think we'd attach a mobile phone number with the message 'Please call this number'?\"",
      "Sadly, Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s incredible story does not have a happy ending.",
      "Having learned to feed himself, it spent several years travelling south along Norway\u2019s coast and in May 2023 was even spotted off the coast of Sweden.",

      "Had the long arm of Putin\u2019s Russia caught up with the reluctant beluga?",

      "They have also agreed to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems, and to treble renewable power by 2030.",
      "But while the authors of this letter recognise these achievements, they feel that the slow-moving COP process is \u201cno longer fit for purpose\u201d in dealing with a fast-moving climate crisis.",
      "\"Its current structure simply cannot deliver the change at exponential speed and scale, which is essential to ensure a safe climate landing for humanity,\" said its signatories. They include former UN Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon, former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres and former president of Ireland Mary Robinson.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 16:00:05 GMT",
    "summary": "The planet Uranus and its five biggest moons may not be the sterile worlds scientists have long thought.",
    "story": [
      "The planet Uranus and its five biggest moons may not be the dead sterile worlds that scientists have long thought.",
      "Instead, they may have oceans, and the moons may even be capable of supporting life, scientists say.",
      "Much of what we know about them was gathered by Nasa\u2019s Voyager 2 spacecraft which visited nearly 40 years ago.",
      "But a new analysis shows that Voyager's visit coincided with a powerful solar storm, which led to a misleading idea of what the Uranian system is really like.",
      "Uranus is a beautiful, icy ringed world in the outer reaches of our solar system. It is among the coldest of all the planets. It is also tilted on its side compared to all the other worlds \u2013 as if it had been knocked over \u2013 making it arguably the weirdest.",
      "We got our first close-up look at it in 1986, when Voyager 2 flew past and sent back sensational pictures of the planet and its five major moons.",
      "But what amazed scientists even more was the data Voyager 2 sent back indicating that the Uranian system was even weirder than they thought.",
      "The measurements from the spacecraft\u2019s instruments indicated that the planets and moons were inactive, unlike the other moons in the outer solar system. They also showed that Uranus\u2019s protective magnetic field was strangely distorted. It was squashed and pushed away from the Sun.",
      "A planet\u2019s magnetic field traps any gases and other material coming off the planet and its moons. These might be from oceans or geological activity. Voyager 2 found none, suggesting that Uranus and its five largest moons were sterile and inactive.",
      "This came as an enormous surprise because it was unlike the solar system\u2019s other planets and their moons.",
      "But the new analysis has solved the decades-long mystery. It shows that Voyager 2 flew past on a bad day.",
      "The new research shows that just as Voyager 2 flew past Uranus, the Sun was raging, creating a powerful solar wind that might have blown the material away and temporarily distorted the magnetic field.",
      "So, for 40 years we have had an incorrect view of what Uranus and its five largest moons are normally like, according to Dr William Dunn of University College London.",
      "\u201cThese results suggest that the Uranian system could be much more exciting than previously thought. There could be moons there that could have the conditions that are necessary for life, they might have oceans below the surface that could be teeming with fish!\u201d.",
      "Linda Spilker was a young scientist working on the Voyager programme when the Uranus data came in. She is now still serving as the project scientist for the Voyager missions. She said that she was delighted to hear about the new results, which have been published in the Journal Nature Astronomy.",
      "\u201cThe results are fascinating, and I am really excited to see that there is potential for life in the Uranian system,\u201d she told BBC News.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m also so pleased that so much is being done with the Voyager data. It\u2019s amazing that scientists are looking back at the data we collected in 1986 and finding new results and new discoveries\u201d.",
      "Dr Affelia Wibisono of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, who is independent of the research team, described the results as \u201cvery exciting\u201d.",
      "\u201cIt shows how important it is to look back at old data, because sometimes, hiding behind them is something new to be discovered, which can help us design the next generation of space exploration missions\u201d.",
      "Which is exactly what Nasa is doing, partly as a result of the new research.",
      "It has been nearly 40 years since Voyager 2 last flew past the icy world and its moons. Nasa has plans to launch a new mission, the Uranus Orbiter and Probe, to go back for a closer look in 10 years\u2019 time.",
      "According to Nasa\u2019s Dr Jamie Jasinski, whose idea it was to re-examine the Voyager 2 data, the mission will need to take his results into account when designing its instruments and planning the scientific survey.",
      "\u201cSome of the instruments for the future spacecraft are very much being designed with ideas from what we learned from Voyager 2 when it flew past the system when it was experiencing an abnormal event. So we need to rethink how exactly we are going to design the instruments on the new mission so that we can best capture the science we need to make discoveries\u201d.",
      "Nasa\u2019s Uranus probe is expected to arrive by 2045, which is when scientists hope to find out whether these far-flung icy moons, once thought of as being dead worlds, might have the possibility of being home to life."

    "summary": "Bluesky is picking up one million new users every day at its current rate.",
    "story": [
      "You may have seen the word \"Bluesky\" popping up on your social media pages recently and wondered what people are talking about.",
      "It is an alternative platform to Elon Musk's X and in terms of its colour and logo, it looks quite similar.",
      "Bluesky is growing rapidly and is currently picking up around one million new sign-ups a day.",
      "It had 16.7m users at the time of writing, but that figure will likely be outdated by the time you read this.",
      "So what is it - and why are so many people joining?",
      "What is Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky describes itself as \"social media as it should be\", although it looks similar to other sites.",
      "Visually, a bar to the left of the page shows everything you might expect - search, notifications, a homepage and so on.",
      "People using the platform can post, comment, repost and like their favourite things.",
      "To put it simply, it looks how X, formerly known as Twitter, used to look.",
      "The main difference is Bluesky is decentralised - a complicated term which basically means users can host their data on servers other than those owned by the company.",
      "This means that rather than being limited to having a specific account named after Bluesky, people can (if they like) sign up using an account they themselves own.",
      "But it is worth stating that the vast majority of people don't do that and a new joiner will most likely have a \".bsky.social\" at the end of their username.",
      "Who owns Bluesky?",
      "If you think it feels a lot like X, you won't be surprised to learn why. The former head of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, created it.",
      "He even once said he wanted Bluesky to be a decentralised version of Twitter that no single person or entity owns.",
      "But Mr Dorsey is no longer part of the team behind it, having stepped down from the board in May 2024.",
      "He deleted his account altogether in September.",
      "It is now run and predominantly owned by chief executive Jay Graber as a US public benefit corporation.",
      "Why is it gaining in popularity?",
      "Bluesky has been around since 2019, but it was invitation-only until February of this year.",
      "That let the developers deal with all the kinks behind-the-scenes, to try and stabilise it before opening the doors to the wider public.",
      "The plan has worked, somewhat. But the flurry of new users has been so significant in November that there continue to be issues with outages.",
      "It is no coincidence that the number of new Bluesky users spiked following Donald Trump's success in the US elections in November.",
      "X's owner, Mr Musk, was a big backer of Trump during his campaign, and will be heavily involved in his administration.",
      "Inevitably, this has led to a political division, with some people leaving X in protest.",
      "But others have cited different reasons, such as the Guardian newspaper which has chosen to stop posting there as it called X \"a toxic media platform\".",
      "Meanwhile, Bluesky's app continues to pick up significant downloads worldwide and on Thursday was the top free app in the Apple App Store in the UK.",
      "Several celebrities, from pop singer Lizzo to Taskmaster's Greg Davies, have announced they are joining the platform and limiting their use of - or in some cases leaving altogether - X.",
      "Other names you might recognise include Ben Stiller, Jamie Lee Curtis and Patton Oswalt.",
      "But this growth, while significant, will have to continue for a long time before Bluesky is able to mount a true challenge to its microblogging rival.",
      "X does not share its total user numbers but it is understood to be measured in the hundreds of millions, with Elon Musk previously saying the platform had 250 million users each day.",
      "How does Bluesky make money?",
      "It is the million dollar question, quite literally.",
      "Bluesky started off with funding from investors and venture capital firms and has raised tens of millions of dollars through these means.",
      "But with so many new users, it is going to have to find a way to pay the bills.",
      "Back in Twitter's heyday, the site made the vast majority of its money through advertising.",
      "Bluesky has said it wants to avoid this. Instead, it said it will continue to look into paid services, such as having people pay for custom domains in their username.",
      "That sounds complicated but it basically comes down to a person's username being even more personalised.",
      "For example, it may mean my username - @twgerken.bsky.social - could in the future be more official-sounding, such as @twgerken.bbc.co.uk.",
      "Proponents of this idea say it doubles-up as a form of verification as the organisation which owns the website would have to clear its use.",
      "If Bluesky's owners continue to avoid advertising, they may inevitably have to look to other broader options, such as subscription features, as a way of keeping the lights on.",
      "But if it is not making very much money, that would not be unusual for tech startups.",
      "In fact, Twitter, before it was purchased by Mr Musk in 2022, only made a profit twice in its eight years of being publicly traded.",
      "And we all know how that ended - a massive payday for investors when the world's richest man paid $44bn (\u00a334.7bn) for the privilege of owning it.",
      "For now, the future of Bluesky remains unknown, but if its growth continues, anything is possible.",

      "1. The mysterious creator of Bitcoin",

      "Earlier this year, a Canadian Bitcoin expert called Peter Todd strongly denied being Satoshi, while in London this month a British man, Stephen Mollah, claimed he was - but no-one believed him.",

      "The deal looks pretty bad for Lazlo now too. If he had held onto those coins they would now be worth hundreds of millions of dollars!",
      "3. Becoming legal tender",
      "In September 2021, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, central America, made Bitcoin legal tender.",
      "Hairdressers, supermarkets and other shops had to accept Bitcoin by law, alongside its main currency, the US dollar.",
      "Many Bitcoin enthusiasts and reporters visited the area, briefly boosting tourism to the country.",
      "While President Bukele hoped the move would increase investment in his country and cut costs for citizens exchanging money, it did not become as popular as he hoped.",
      "He is still hoping it will take off but for now the US dollar still remains king in the country.",
      "As well as the huge amount of public money President Bukele spent on trying to make people embrace Bitcoin he also, controversially, bought more than 6,000 bitcoins over the past few years.",
      "The president spent at least $120m buying up bitcoins at various prices in the hope of making a profit for his cash-strapped country.",

      "A website built by Dutch software engineer Elias Zerrouq is tracking the country's Bitcoin holdings and currently estimates that the coins have risen 98% in value.",
      "4. Kazakhstan's crypto boom and bust",
      "In 2021, Kazakhstan became a hotspot for Bitcoin mining - the process of crunching through the complex calculations that underpin crypto transactions.",
      "These days it takes warehouses full of the latest computers running all day and all night, but the reward is brand new bitcoins for those companies that take part.",

      "He told the BBC: \"It was a penny dropping moment and it was a sinking feeling.\"",
      "6. Crypto King fraudster",
      "No one has lost as much Bitcoin as former billionaire crypto mogul, Sam Bankman-Fried. The founder of the massive crypto firm FTX was nicknamed the Crypto King and loved by the community.",
      "FTX was a cryptocurrency exchange that allowed people to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "His empire was worth an estimated $32bn and he was flying high until everything came crashing down within days.",
      "Journalists had discovered that Bankman-Fried's company was financially shaky and had been illegally transferring FTX customer funds to prop up his other company, Alameda Research.",
      "Just before his arrest at his luxury apartment complex in the Bahamas in December 2022 he spoke to reporters. He told the BBC: \"I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was.\"",
      "After being extradited to the US he was found guilty of fraud and money laundering and was jailed for 25 years.",
      "7. Investment bank boom",
      "Despite all the turmoil, Bitcoin continues to attract attention from investors and big companies.",
      "In fact, in January 2024, some of the biggest financial firms in the world added Bitcoin to their official asset lists as Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These are like stocks and shares, linked to the value of Bitcoin but you don't have to personally own any.",
      "Customers have been pouring billions into these brand new products. Companies including Blackrock, Fidelity and GrayScale, have also been buying up Bitcoins in their thousands, pushing up its value to record highs.",
      "It is a huge milestone for crypto with some fans believing that Bitcoin is finally being taken as seriously as the mysterious Satoshi imagined.",

      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",
      "Volocopter is one of dozens of companies around the world developing an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) aircraft.",
      "Their machines promise the flexibility of a helicopter, but without the cost, noise and emissions.",
      "However, faced with the massive cost of getting such novel aircraft approved by regulators and then building up manufacturing capabilities, some investors are bailing out.",
      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",
      "Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.",
      "The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.",
      "It was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.",
      "As recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium\u2019s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely burning through cash,\" he told the BBC. \u201cBut this is a good sign, because it means we are producing the aircraft. We\u2019re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised \u20ac1.5bn\u201d.",
      "But then the money ran out.",
      "Lilium had been attempting to arrange a loan worth \u20ac100m from the German development bank, KfW. However, that required guarantees from national and state governments, which never materialised.",

      "For the moment, work on the new aircraft is continuing, as the company works with restructuring experts to sell the business or bring in new investment. However, getting the new e-jet into production is looking more challenging than ever.",
      "The high-profile British player in the eVTOL market is Vertical Aerospace. The Bristol-based company was founded in 2016 by businessman Stephen Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy.",
      "Its striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be \u201c100 times\u201d safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.",
      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",
      "In May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.",
      "Ambitions remain sky high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year, and to be breaking even in cash terms.",
      "Yet financial strains have been intensifying. Mr Fitzpatrick invested an extra $25m into the company in March. But a further $25m, due in August if alternative investment could not be found, has not been paid. As of September, Vertical had $57.4m on hand \u2013 but it expects to burn through nearly double that over the coming year.",
      "Hopes for the future appear to be pinned on doing a deal with the American financier Jason Mudrick, who is already a major creditor through his firm Mudrick Capital Management.",
      "He has offered to invest $75m into the business \u2013 and has warned the board of Vertical that rejecting his plan would inevitably lead to insolvency proceedings. But the move has been resisted by Mr Fitzpatrick, who would lose control of the company he founded.",
      "Sources close to the talks insist an agreement is now very close. The company believes if a deal can be done, it will unlock further fundraising opportunities.",

      "Around 29 million British homes require retrofitting by 2050, according to the UK Green Building Council, an industry body.",
      "Retrofitting might involve measures such as improving your home\u2019s insulation, upgrading the heating system, or installing energy-generating devices such as solar panels, or even a private wind turbine.",
      "These adjustments can cost thousands of pounds up front, but, if properly executed, they could improve comfort and reduce people\u2019s bills in the long-run.",
      "Plus, increased energy efficiency ought to cut carbon emissions from homes, especially if property owners switch away from gas or oil-fired boilers, for example.",
      "Roughly one fifth of the UK\u2019s total emissions comes from residential buildings.",
      "Amy Peace and her husband live in the northwest of England, near Warrington. The pair both work in sustainability, advising businesses on their path to net zero.",
      "They were keen to improve the quality of their home and apply the principles they promote at work to their own lives \u2013 but they too faced challenges when deciding on how to go about it.",

      "The couple spoke to multiple consultants, but Mrs Peace found the advice they received was often geared towards meeting Passivhaus standards \u2013 an ultra-energy efficient type of building.",
      "\u201cThere weren\u2019t many in that pragmatic middle space where you are literally saying, \u2018We\u2019ve got this much money, where would we be best putting it?\u2019,\u201d Mrs Peace adds.",
      "Perseverance during the past three years paid off, however, and the couple\u2019s 1930\u2019s detached house now has improved insulation, a heat pump, and an electric car charging point. Solar panels and battery will follow shortly, if all goes to plan.",

      "There are many other organisations that offer to help homeowners plan a retrofit.",
      "The work often involves carrying out a heat-loss survey, to spot cold areas that require insulation, and to better understand a property\u2019s heating demand. Experts might also advise on the suitability of solar panels for your home, for example.",
      "There\u2019s the Get a Heat Pump website, launched by the charities Nesta and The MCS Foundation, which explains what heat pumps are and how they might fit into a home renovation plan.",

      "The RICS website will soon include a range of retrofit advice and a tool to help homeowners find a suitable surveyor in their local area, says Steve Lees, from the RICS retrofit project team.",
      "Improving the energy efficiency of homes is \u201cessential\u201d for decarbonisation, says Gerald Charles, head of housing retrofit at the Centre for Sustainable Energy, but he adds that the current lack of good advice remains a genuine problem.",

      "One entrepreneur who has noticed a knowledge gap in the market is James Major, founder and chief executive of HubbPro, which helps architects plan energy efficient buildings. Architects don\u2019t always have the latest information about how to incorporate energy-saving technologies into their designs, notes Mr Major.",

      "Gabbard has routinely opposed American foreign policy, blaming Nato for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and meeting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad \u2013 then casting doubt on US intelligence assessments blaming Assad for using chemical weapons.",

      "What this tells us: Like Trump, Gaetz, Gabbard and Kennedy are aggressive challengers of the status quo. All three frequently tip over into conspiracy.",
      "They may be among the most determined supporters of Trump\u2019s plan to dismantle the bureaucratic \u201cdeep state\u201d. The president-elect has picked particular fights in each of the areas they would oversee - law enforcement, intelligence and health.",
      "But bomb-throwers can also make unruly subordinates. Kennedy wants stricter regulation across food and farming industries, which may collide with Trump\u2019s government-slashing agenda.",
      "Gaetz\u2019s views on some issues - he favours legalisation of marijuana - are outside the Republican mainstream.",

      "Domestically, they - and the wider incoming Trump administration - have called for a drastic uptick in deportations, beginning with those considered national security or public safety threats, and a return to workplace \u201cenforcement operations\u201d that were paused by the Biden administration.",
      "What it tells us: Aside from the economy, polls repeatedly suggested that immigration and the border with Mexico were primary concerns for many voters.",
      "The possibility of increased deportations and workplace raids, however, could put Trump on a collision course with Democratic-leaning states and jurisdictions that may decide to push back or not co-operate. Some Republican states - whose economies rely, in part, on immigrant labour - may also object.",

      "The three are likely to push through Trump\u2019s pledge for much higher tariffs on Chinese imports. They see Beijing as the top economic and security threat to the US. Waltz - picked for national security adviser - has said the US is in a \u201cCold War\u201d with the ruling communist party.",
      "Ratcliffe, Trump\u2019s nominee for CIA director who served as an intelligence chief in his first term, has likened countering China\u2019s rise to the defeat of fascism or bringing down the Iron Curtain.",
      "What it tells us: While Trump often signals his own hawkish economic views on China, he has also vacillated - which could spark tensions with his top foreign policy team.",
      "In his first term, Trump triggered a trade war with Beijing (attempts to de-escalate this failed amid the pandemic) and relations slumped further when he labelled Covid the \u201cChinese Virus\u201d.",
      "But he also heaped praise on President Xi Jinping as a \u201cbrilliant\u201d leader ruling with an \u201ciron fist\u201d.",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s lots of damage. Maybe 90% of houses have damage of some kind, glass smashed and cracks in the walls. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen when winter comes,\u201d says Jiries al-Alam, a farmer who also works as an undertaker with the town\u2019s church.",
      "\u201cWe are determined to stay but hardly anyone sleeps at night because of the air strikes. Thankfully, there\u2019s been no deaths among the residents so far, but 200 of my cattle died from the military flares,\u201d he adds.",

      "\u201cLots of families raised white flags on their homes and cars to say that they are peaceful and have no link to what is happening,\u201d says Father George al-Ameel, 44, a priest and teacher in the town.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had no guarantees of safety from any side,\u201d he says. \u201cOur town is peaceful, and our only cause is to stay for our identity and our country.\u201d",
      "Until the start of Israel\u2019s ground invasion, a Lebanese army unit had stayed in Rmeish and helped organise movement in and out of the town. But as Israeli forces moved to cross the border, the Lebanese army \u2013 which is not directly involved in the war \u2013 decided to pull out of Rmeish, much to the distress of locals.",
      "The Lebanese army said it rejected the description that they have \u2018withdrawn\u2019 from border locations, referring the BBC to a statement that the army is \u201crepositioning\u201d a number of military units in the south.",
      "Then at the end of October, the main route out of Rmeish itself was hit \u2013 leaving residents feeling further isolated and vulnerable. Since then, just one aid convoy has reached the town with the coordination of UN peacekeeping forces, the Unifil mission said.",

      "Over the past year, fleeing their country has become more perilous than ever before for Afghans, because Pakistan, Iran and Turkey have intensified their crackdown on illegal migration from Afghanistan along their borders, and have also carried out mass deportations.",
      "Azaan couldn\u2019t continue. He was in pain, and had barely eaten in days. The migrants were given just one boiled egg every morning and a cup of rice in the evening by smugglers who\u2019d charged them nearly $4,000 (\u00a33,150) for the journey to Europe.",
      "\u201cI had two friends \u2013 we had made a promise to not leave each other,\u201d he says. His friends tied scarves around him, hoisted him up the wall, back into Iran. Iranian police deported him to Afghanistan.",
      "It was Azaan\u2019s second failed attempt. The first time he returned from the Afghanistan-Iran border because he\u2019d taken his wife and young children along, and he realised they wouldn\u2019t be able to endure the journey.",

      "Once in Iran, migrants move to Tehran before going towards the Macu or Khoy counties, to attempt the crossing into Turkey, handed over from one smuggler to another.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 22:38:25 GMT",
    "summary": "A new China-backed megaport in Peru may create whole new trade routes that will bypass North America entirely.",
    "story": [
      "As the world waits to see how the return of Donald Trump will reshape relations between Washington and Beijing, China has just taken decisive action to entrench its position in Latin America.",
      "Trump won the US presidential election on a platform that promised tariffs as high as 60% on Chinese-made goods. Further south, though, a new China-backed megaport has the potential to create whole new trade routes that will bypass North America entirely.",
      "President Xi Jinping himself attended the inauguration of the Chancay port on the Peruvian coast this week, an indication of just how seriously China takes the development.",
      "Xi was in Peru for the annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum (Apec). But all eyes were on Chancay and what it says about China's growing assertiveness in a region that the US has traditionally seen as its sphere of influence.",
      "As seasoned observers see it, Washington is now paying the price for years of indifference towards its neighbours and their needs.",
      "\"The US has been absent from Latin America for so long, and China has moved in so rapidly, that things have really reconfigured in the past decade,\" says Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.",
      "\"You have got the backyard of America engaging directly with China,\" she tells the BBC. \"That's going to be problematic.\"",
      "Even before it opened, the $3.5bn (\u00a32.75bn) project, masterminded by China's state-owned Cosco Shipping, had already turned a once-sleepy Peruvian fishing town into a logistical powerhouse set to transform the country's economy.",
      "China's official Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, called it \"a vindication of China-Peru win-win co-operation\".",
      "Peru's President Dina Boluarte was similarly enthusiastic, describing the megaport as a \"nerve centre\" that would provide \"a point of connection to access the gigantic Asian market\".",
      "But the implications go far beyond the fortunes of one small Andean nation. Once Chancay is fully up and running, goods from Chile, Ecuador, Colombia and even Brazil are expected to pass through it on their way to Shanghai and other Asian ports.",
      "China already has considerable appetite for the region's exports, including Brazilian soybeans and Chilean copper. Now this new port will be able to handle larger ships, as well as cutting shipping times from 35 to 23 days.",
      "However, the new port will favour imports as well as exports. As signs grow that an influx of cheap Chinese goods bought online may be undermining domestic industry, Chile and Brazil have scrapped tax exemptions for individual customers on low-value foreign purchases.",
      "As nervous US military hawks have pointed out, if Chancay can accommodate ultra-large container vessels, it can also handle Chinese warships.",
      "The most strident warnings have come from Gen Laura Richardson, who has just retired as chief of US Southern Command, which covers Latin America and the Caribbean.",
      "She has accused China of \"playing the \u2018long game\u2019 with its development of dual-use sites and facilities throughout the region\", adding that those sites could serve as \"points of future multi-domain access for the [People's Liberation Army] and strategic naval chokepoints\".",
      "Even if that prospect never materialises, there is a strong perception that the US is losing ground in Latin America as China forges ahead with its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).",
      "Outgoing US President Joe Biden was among the leaders at the Apec summit, on his first and last visit to South America during his four-year term. Media commentators remarked that he cut a diminished figure next to China's Xi.",
      "Prof \u00c1lvaro M\u00e9ndez, director of the Global South Unit at the London School of Economics, points out that while the US was taking Latin America for granted, Xi was visiting the region regularly and cultivating good relations.",
      "\"The bar has been set so low by the US that China only has to be a little bit better to get through the door,\" he says.",
      "Of course, Latin America is not the only part of the world targeted by the BRI. Since 2023, China's unprecedented infrastructure splurge has pumped money into nearly 150 countries worldwide.",
      "The results have not always been beneficial, with many projects left unfinished, while many developing countries that signed up for Beijing's largesse have found themselves burdened with debt as a result.",
      "Even so, left-wing and right-wing governments alike have cast aside their initial suspicions of China, because \"their interests are aligned\" with those of Beijing, says the Peterson Institute's Ms de Bolle: \"They have lowered their guard out of sheer necessity.\"",
      "Ms de Bolle says the US is right to feel threatened by this turn of events, since Beijing has now established \"a very strong foothold\" in the region at a time when president-elect Trump wants to \"rein in\" China.",
      "\"I think we will finally start to see the US putting pressure on Latin America because of China,\" she says, adding that most countries want to stay on the right side of both big powers.",
      "\"The region doesn't have to choose unless it's put in a position where they are forced to, and that would be very dumb.\"",
      "Looking ahead, South American countries such as Peru, Chile and Colombia would be vulnerable to pressure because of the bilateral free trade agreements they have with the US, which Trump could seek to renegotiate or even tear up.",
      "They will be watching keenly to see what happens to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which is up for review in July 2026, but will be subject to negotiations during 2025.",
      "Whatever happens, Prof M\u00e9ndez of the LSE feels that the region needs more co-operation.",
      "\"It shouldn't be that all roads lead to Beijing or to Washington. Latin America has to find a more strategic way, it needs a coherent regional strategy,\" he says, pointing to the difficulty of getting 33 countries to agree a joint approach.",
      "Eric Farnsworth, vice-president at the Washington-based Council of the Americas, feels that there is still much goodwill towards the US in Latin America, but the region's \"massive needs\" are not being met by its northern neighbour.",
      "\"The US needs to up its game in the region, because people would choose it if there was a meaningful alternative to China,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Unlike many others, he sees some rays of hope from the incoming Trump administration, especially with the appointment of Marco Rubio as secretary of state.",
      "\"Rubio has a real sense of a need to engage economically with the Western Hemisphere in a way that we just haven't done for a number of years,\" he says.",
      "But for successive US leaders, Latin America has been seen primarily in terms of illegal migration and illegal drugs. And with Trump fixated on plans to deport record numbers of immigrants, there is little indication that the US will change tack any time soon.",
      "Like the rest of the world, Latin America is bracing itself for a bumpy four years - and if the US and China start a full-blown trade war, the region stands to get caught in the crossfire.",

      "As the streets are cleared of Maccabi Ultras stickers and tensions linger, there is concern about the damage done to relations between Amsterdam\u2019s Jewish and Muslim communities.",
      "The tensions have spilled over into Dutch politics too.",
      "The Netherlands' coalition government has been left hanging by a thread after a Moroccan-born junior minister resigned because of language used by coalition colleagues.",
      "Amsterdam had already seen protests and tensions because of the war in the Middle East, and local Rabbi Lody van de Kamp believes it was like a tinderbox: \"If you put 2,000 [Israeli] football supporters on to the streets, you know you are in trouble.\u201d",
      "Maccabi Tel Aviv fans had arrived in the city for a Europa League match against Ajax and footage was widely shared the night before showing a group of fans climbing up a wall to tear down and burn a Palestinian flag.",
      "An Amsterdam council report said taxis were also attacked and vandalised.",
      "Emine U\u011fur, a well-known columnist in the Muslim community, says underlying tensions surrounding the war in Gaza meant that the ensuing violence was \"a long time coming\".",
      "She speaks of a lack of acknowledgement of the pain felt by communities affected by a conflict that had left many without an outlet for their grief and frustration.",
      "The flag-burning incident as well as anti-Arab chants were seen as a deliberate provocation.",
      "But then messages calling for retaliation appeared on social media, some using chilling terms such as \"Jew hunt\".",
      "On the evening of the match, a pro-Palestinian protest was moved away from the Johan Cruyff arena, but it was in the hours afterwards that the violence erupted.",
      "The 12-page report by Amsterdam\u2019s authorities describes some Maccabi supporters \u201ccommitting acts of vandalism\u201d in the centre.",
      "Then it highlights \u201csmall groups of rioters\u2026 engaged in violent hit-and-run actions targeting Israeli supporters and nightlife crowd\u201d in locations across the city centre. They moved \u201con foot, by scooter, or car\u2026 committing severe assaults\u201d.",
      "The mayor of Amsterdam, Femke Halsema, described the incidents as deeply alarming, and noted for some they were a reminder of historical pogroms against Jews.",
      "For a few hours, swathes of the Jewish community in a European capital felt as though they were under siege.",

      "However, the chairman of the Central Jewish Committee, Chanan Hertzberger, warned that these measures alone might not suffice.",
      "He blamed in part an atmosphere where \u201cantisemitic rhetoric has gone unchecked since 7 October\", adding: \"Our history teaches us that when people say they want to kill you, they mean it, and they will try.\"",

      "Mayor Femke Halsema is adamant that antisemitism should not be followed by other forms of racism, emphasising that the safety of one group must not come at the expense of another.",
      "The violence has left Amsterdam questioning its identity as a diverse and tolerant city.",

      "It is unclear if the whereabouts of the other rioters are known.",
      "The Brazilian government believes the January 2023 riots were part of a coup attempt orchestrated by Bolsonaro following his defeat in a tightly contested presidential election the previous October. He denies any involvement.",

      "In the summer of 2022, Ms Fatima's childhood home - a yellow-brick two-storeyed house in the bustling depths of the city - was torn down by authorities overnight.",
      "The house was demolished after her father, a local politician named Javed Mohammad, was arrested and named as the \"key conspirator\" of a protest by Muslims, which had turned violent.",
      "He denies the allegations, and has never been found guilty of any crime linked to the June 2022 protests.",
      "The family is just one of many who have found themselves at the mercy of so-called \"bulldozer justice\" - when authorities swiftly demolish the homes of those accused of crimes - but hopefully among the last.",
      "On Wednesday, India's top court banned the practice which has been on the rise in recent years, particularly in states governed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).",
      "While the victims include Hindu families, critics say the action is mostly targeted at India's 200 million odd Muslims, especially after religious violence or protests - a charge the BJP denies.",
      "Chief ministers of several states have linked such demolitions with their government's tough stance on crime. Officially, however, the reason given is that these structures were illegally constructed.",
      "Experts have repeatedly questioned this, saying that there is no legal justification for it and that punishing someone for an alleged crime using laws meant for another makes no sense.",
      "Ms Fatima says that during the 20 months that Mr Mohammad spent in jail - he got bail earlier this year - she and her family moved houses twice in the city.",
      "It took some effort, but they finally feel settled. Still, there are times when their new house feels strangely unfamiliar to her, she says, like an \"adopted space\" which has not been lived in enough.",
      "\"It's not the same. I spent most of my life in our old house. There are no memories here, it feels empty,\" she says.",
      "So when the court was reading out its judgement this week, Ms Fatima was hopeful of finally getting some closure.",
      "But the outcome turned out to be bittersweet.",
      "Because, while the court has outlawed authorities from arbitrarily razing down homes and businesses of those accused or convicted of crimes, it did not mention any form of redressal to families like Ms Fatima's, who've been the victims of such demolitions in the past.",
      "\"We welcome the judgement, but what about those of us who have already lost our homes?\" she says.",
      "The practice had become commonplace: in 2022, authorities in five states bulldozed 128 structures in just three months \"as punishment\", a report by Amnesty international shows.",
      "In its order, which ran over 95 pages, the court came down heavily on the state governments, saying it cannot \"become a judge and decide that a person accused is guilty and, therefore, punish him\".",
      "Giving out such punishment \u201creminds one of a lawless state of affairs, where might was right\", the judgement added.",
      "The court then issued a set of guidelines, which make it mandatory for authorities to give at least 15 days' advance notice to an occupant before an illegal structure is torn down and to publicly explain the reason for the demolition. All public officials will also be personally held responsible under Indian laws if a demolition is carried out wrongfully, the judgement added.",
      "Rights groups, lawyers and opposition leaders have hailed the order as a \"turning point\" in tackling the unfair practice that has gone unchecked for years. \"Late is the hour in which these guidelines chose to appear \u2013 but better late than never!\" said Delhi-based lawyer Gautam Bhatia.",
      "Govind Mathur, a judge and former chief justice of a high court, agrees that the order does not mention anything about the victims, but adds that \"doesn't restrict any claim of compensation by such persons\".",
      "\"If an act is illegal, then the victim can always demand for compensation. The wrong committed will remain a wrong and the cost of that has to be paid by the wrong doers,\" he says.",
      "The order, Justice Mathur adds, is a \"strong message for state machinery to not align with political bosses but to act in accordance with law\".",
      "Ms Fatima, however, points out that the reality is not that simple.",
      "It's been more than two years since her family first challenged the demolition in a high court. But there hasn't been a single hearing, she says.",
      "She still remembers the day it all happened. Onlookers glued themselves to the corner to watch for the excavator as it came down on their house. Many of them held cameras and phones. Ms Fatima, who watched the demolition on her own phone from a relative's house, remembers going numb.",
      "She thought of her room and the sheer volume of keepsakes and furniture stored there. There were stories everywhere - precious everyday memories, like the time she spent with her sister and the lively family discussions around the dinner table. \"All of that was gone,\" she says.",
      "While Ms Fatima's family was able to rebuild their lives in some capacity, others say they are still stuck in limbo.",
      "\"We are practically on the streets, with nothing and no one,\" says Reshma, a daily wage worker in Rajasthan state. In September, Reshma's house in Udaipur city was demolished on grounds of illegal encroachment, a day after her eight-year-old brother allegedly stabbed his classmate.",
      "The child was taken into custody and sent to a juvenile home, while his father was arrested on the charges of abetment to murder. Since then, Reshma, her mother and sister have been living in a small shanty on the edges of the city.",
      "To them, the court ruling is meaningless, she says. \"We want actual help, some money or compensation to rebuild our lives, this changes nothing.\"",
      "Like Ms Fatima, Reshma's family has also challenged the demolition in court. Legal experts say that the Supreme Court's guidelines could potentially impact the way all such pending cases are heard in the future.",
      "\"This decision will change many things - courts will have to see whether legal processes were followed while carrying out these demolitions,\" senior Supreme Court lawyer CU Singh told BBC Hindi.",
      "Ms Fatima is not entirely sure whether the court's order would actually halt the demolitions.",
      "But her father, Mr Mohammad, is brimming with hope, she says.",
      "Sometimes, she catches her father thinking about their old home - the sofas and the rugs, the rows of books on the shelves, which he had painstakingly put together, probably still lying in the rubble.",
      "\"He did most of the improvements, from the curtains to the cushion covers. Losing the house broke his heart more than anyone else's,\" she says.",
      "But Mr Mohammad does not want to linger on the suffering and is already busy making fresh improvements to the house and his life. \"He keeps telling me, this is a historic order and we have to talk about it as much as we can,\" his daughter says.",
      "\"Just like this house, we are building lives again and renovating our memories.\"",

      "'It was a free event, why wouldn't I go?'",
      "Our fascination with celebrity lookalikes is nothing particularly new - Stars in Their Eyes, a show in which amateur lookalikes impersonate singers, ran on ITV for 16 years. The format was revived as Starstruck in 2022.",
      "But the latest competitions all have one thing in common: the celebrities are all young, attractive and male.",
      "Avani Johnson, who was at the Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet contest, says she believes the latest trend has taken off because \"women are relishing the opportunity to objectify men in a complete switch in power dynamics\".",

      "HRW has also accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields by operating inside homes and civilian infrastructure.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 13:57:52 GMT",
    "summary": "John Smyth, a known child abuser in the UK, went to Zimbabwe and set up Christian holiday camps.",
    "story": [
      "The sister of a 16-year-old boy who drowned while swimming naked at a Christian holiday camp in Zimbabwe run by child abuser John Smyth blames the Church of England for his death.",
      "\"The Church knew about the abuses that John Smyth was doing. They should have stopped him. Had they stopped him, I think my brother [Guide Nyachuru] would still be alive,\" Edith Nyachuru told the BBC.",
      "The British barrister had moved to Zimbabwe with his wife and four children from Winchester in England in 1984 to work with an evangelistic organisation.",
      "This was two years after an investigation revealed he had subjected boys in the UK, many of whom he had met at Christian holiday camps run by a charity he chaired that was linked to the Church, to traumatic physical, psychological and sexual abuse.",
      "The 1982 report, prepared by Anglican clergyman Mark Ruston, about the canings said \"the scale and severity of the practice was horrific\", with accounts of boys beaten so badly they bled, with one describing how he needed to wear nappies until his wounds scabbed over.",
      "Despite these shocking revelations, mainly involving boys from elite British public schools, the Ruston report was not widely circulated.",
      "A decade on, aged 50, Smyth had established himself as a respected member of the Christian community in Zimbabwe. He had set up his own organisation, Zambesi Ministries, with funding from the UK - and was meting out similar punishments at camps that he marketed at the country\u2019s top schools.",
      "Ms Nyachuru says her brother\u2019s trip had been an early Christmas present from one of his other sisters, who had picked up one of Smyth\u2019s brochures and been impressed with all the activities on offer for the week.",
      "As she looks at an old photograph of Guide, she says he was the youngest of seven siblings, and the only boy: \"He was very loved by everyone.",
      "\"A lovely boy... Guide was due to be made head boy the following year,\" she remembers, adding that he was \"an intelligent boy, a good swimmer, strong, healthy with no known medical conditions\".",
      "But within 12 hours of him being dropped at the camp at Ruzawi School in Marondera, 74km (46 miles) from the capital, Harare, on the evening of 15 December 1992, the family received a call to say he had died.",
      "Witnesses say that like all the boys, Guide had gone swimming naked in a pool before bed - a camp tradition. The other boys returned to the dormitory, but Guide\u2019s absence was not noticed - which his sister finds surprising - and his body was found at the bottom of the pool the next morning.",
      "His family rushed to the mortuary but Ms Nyachuru\u2019s shock was compounded by confusion when she was stopped by officers from viewing his body: \"They told me: 'You can\u2019t go in there because he is indecently dressed.'",
      "\"It was only my father, my brother-in-law and our pastor who went in and put him in the coffin.\"",
      "Nakedness appears to be something Smyth was fixated on at his camps. Camp attendees have told of how he would often parade around without clothes in the boys\u2019 dormitories - where he also slept, unlike other staff members.",
      "He would also shower naked with them in the communal showers and the boys were ordered not to wear underpants in bed.",
      "\"He promoted nakedness and encouraged the boys to walk around naked at the summer camp,\" a former student who attended a camp at Ruzawi in 1991 told the BBC.",
      "But his jocular manner put many of them at ease, he said.",
      "\"Smyth was very friendly, laid-back, approachable, he was really fun, always joking.",
      "\"Smyth would also walk the dorms and shower area wearing nothing but a towel slung over his shoulder.\"",
      "The reason given for the no-underwear-in-the-evening rule was \"because it would make them grow\", he recalled.",
      "Smyth gave talks on masturbation, would sometimes lead prayers in the nude and encouraged naked trampolining, an activity he described as \"flappy jumping\" - all behaviour noted in an investigation by Zimbabwean lawyer David Coltart that was launched in May 1993.",
      "It was the thrashings that Smyth was giving boys with a notorious table tennis bat, dubbed \"TTB\", that led a parent to the door of Coltart, who worked at a law practice in Zimbabwe's second city, Bulawayo.",
      "She wanted to know why one of her sons had returned from a holiday camp with bruises on his buttocks so severe that she took him to a doctor, who found a \"12cm x 12cm bruise\".",
      "\"She saw these and demanded to know what happened and then it came out that her son had been badly beaten in the nude, and she came to me for advice,\" Coltart, now mayor of Bulawayo, told the BBC.",
      "\"When I heard that this was a Christian organisation - I\u2019m an elder in the Presbyterian Church - I got hold of my pastor and we got hold of the Baptist Church, Methodist Church and two other churches in the city and then I was instructed by those churches to investigate the matter,\" he said.",
      "Forty-four-year-old Jason Leanders, who went on the camp that immediately followed Guide\u2019s death, said he was beaten three to four times a day by Smyth, who would put his hands into his pants to check he had not put on extra layers to cushion his buttocks.",
      "\"My bum was black,\" he told the BBC. \"But being a boy, you act tough.\"",
      "For many boarding school students, corporal punishment was regarded as \"normal\", former Zimbabwean cricketer Henry Olonga, who was attending the camp the night Guide died, said in his 2015 autobiography.",
      "But after Coltart managed to track down the Ruston report, the severity of the problem became apparent. He wrote to Smyth instructing him to immediately stop the Zambesi Ministries camps.",
      "\"It was calculated, he focused on boys. He groomed young men. He encouraged them to take showers in the nude with him. There was a pattern of violence,\" he said.",
      "But Coltart\u2019s dealings with Smyth proved difficult.",
      "\"He was a highly articulate man and quite aggressive in the meetings that I had with him. He employed all his skills as a barrister to seek to intimidate. He was older than me. I was then a relatively young lawyer in my 30s. He exploited the fact that he was an English QC [Queen's Counsel].\"",
      "Rather than comply with Coltart\u2019s various requests, he doubled down and in a letter to parents ahead of the August 1993 camps, described himself as \"a father figure to the camp\" and defended the nudity and corporal punishment, writing: \"I never cane the boys, but I do whack with a table tennis bat when necessary\u2026 although most regard TTB (as it is affectionately known) as little more than a joke.\"",
      "This time there appears to have been no cloaking of the beatings as \"spiritual discipline\" as had been the case in the UK. He also admitted to Coltart that he took photographs of naked boys, but said they were \"from shoulders up\" for publicity purposes.",
      "Coltart contacted two psychologists with his findings, both of whom advised that Smyth should stop working with children.",
      "His 21-page report was then published in October 1993, and circulated to head teachers and church leaders in Zimbabwe.",
      "\"The report was never published widely, conscious of the dangers of a defamation suit,\" Coltart said.",
      "However it \"basically stopped him in his tracks in Zimbabwe\" as the private schools were his harvesting ground, he said. Zambesi Ministries camps did continue in some guise, but not at schools or under Smyth\u2019s leadership",
      "Coltart then instructed another law firm to pursue a legal case against Smyth who was eventually charged with culpable homicide over Guide\u2019s death, as well as charges relating to the beatings.",
      "But, according to former BBC TV producer Andrew Graystone in his 2021 book about the abuse, the case was bedevilled with problems, police documents were missing and Smyth\u2019s legal prowess led to the prosecutor being removed - another one was never appointed, so the case was essentially shelved in 1997.",
      "Ms Nyachuru says no post-mortem was carried out at the time - Guide was buried on the day he drowned in the family's home village, with Smyth presiding over the funeral.",
      "Following the Coltart report, Smyth faced deportation from Zimbabwe but Graystone says he used his significant connections to avoid this, lobbying various cabinet ministers - some of whose sons had attended his camps - with suggestions that even then-President Robert Mugabe was approached by one of Smyth\u2019s associates.",
      "But from the time of Smyth\u2019s prosecution, the family were given temporary residency permits, which had to be renewed every 30 days.",
      "In 2001, having spent too long out of the country on a trip, Smyth and his wife Anne were refused re-entry, prompting their move to South Africa\u2019s coastal city of Durban and then a few years later to Cape Town, where the couple were living when the Church of England became fully aware in 2013 of the abuses he had committed in the UK.",
      "\"The Anglican church in Cape Town in which John Smyth worshipped\u2026 has reported that it never received any reports suggesting he abused or groomed young people,\" Thabo Makgoba, the archbishop of Cape Town, said in statement responding to this week's resignation of Justin Welby as Archbishop of Canterbury.",
      "Smyth was only excommunicated by his local church the year before his death in 2018, after he was named publicly as an abuser in a Channel 4 News report.",
      "Ms Nyachuru told the BBC it was not until 2021 that she received a written apology from Welby about the death of her brother, in which he admitted that Smyth was responsible and the church had failed her family.",
      "She wrote back describing the apology as \"too little, too late\" and is now calling for other senior church leaders who failed to intervene to prevent Smyth's abuse to resign: \"I just think people of the church, if they see something not going in the right direction, if it needs the police they should go to the police.\"",
      "Coltart feels it is not just the Church that is to blame, and suggests other institutions in the UK need to face up to their failure to warn people in Zimbabwe.",
      "He commended the Church of England\u2019s recent Makin report, saying it \"left no stone unturned\". The report estimates that around \"85 boys and young men were physically abused in African countries, including Zimbabwe\".",
      "Coltart urged the Church to reach out to them.",
      "\"I think possibly there are still victims in Zimbabwe, perhaps in South Africa, who are suffering from PTSD and I think the Anglican church has a responsibility to identify those individuals and to supply them with the medical assistance that they might require,\" he said.",
      "Mr Leanders says many of his friends are still \"so traumatised by the beatings they are not even prepared to talk about it\".",
      "\"Smyth was protected in England and he was protected in Zimbabwe. The protection went on for so long it robbed victims the chance to confront Smyth as adults.\"",

    "summary": "He has made his early priorities clear - and stunned some in Washington and around the world while doing so.",

      "Donald Trump has moved speedily since winning the US presidential election to set the foundations of his second term in the White House.",
      "He has made his early priorities clear - and stunned some in Washington and around the world while doing so.",
      "Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned from his rollercoaster first week as president-elect.",
      "1) He\u2019s building a loyal team to shake up government",
      "Trump started building his top team almost immediately, nominating cabinet picks for Senate approval and appointing White House advisers and other senior aides.",
      "But that doesn\u2019t tell the full story.",
      "His selections make clear that he plans a radical shake up of government, eschewing more conventional and experienced picks for those who are loyal to him and share his vision for a second term that will upend the status quo in Washington.",
      "His choice for defence secretary, for example, has called for a purge of military chiefs enacting \u201cwoke\u201d policies. His nominee for health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has said he wants to \u201cclear out corruption\u201d at America\u2019s health agencies and cut \u201centire departments\u201d at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",
      "And that\u2019s not to mention a promised \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201c helmed by advisers Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, which Trump says will focus on slashing regulations and historic cost-cutting.",
      "The bigger picture is that Trump\u2019s proposed team is almost universally loyal, and favour overhauling their respective government departments.",
      "You can take a deeper look at who\u2019s in the frame for his top team here.",
      "2) He\u2019ll have a friendly Congress on his side",
      "Republicans have won control of the House as well as the Senate, giving the party a crucial (albeit narrow) majority in both chambers for at least the next two years, when there will be the usual midterm elections.",
      "This is a major boost to Trump\u2019s agenda. It means he will be more easily able to pass legislation and gives his policy priorities a friendly path to becoming law.",
      "The Democratic Party will, naturally, be less able to block and resist his agenda too. And Trump should for now be able to avoid the kind of congressional investigations he faced in the second half of his first term.",
      "Ultimately, Republican control of Congress could prove key in pushing through his big pledges such as mass deportations, sweeping tariffs on foreign imports and the rolling back of environmental protections.",
      "It won\u2019t always be smooth sailing for Trump in Congress, however, as our correspondent Gary O\u2019Donoghue explains here.",
      "3) But Senate Republicans won\u2019t always roll over",
      "Trump\u2019s influence was put to the test earlier this week when Republicans in the Senate picked their new leader.",
      "While he did not weigh-in on the race directly, there had been a concerted effort from the president-elect\u2019s most vocal allies as well as favourable \u2018Maga\u2019 media outlets to get hard-line Trump loyalist Rick Scott elected.",
      "But he was defeated in the first round and Republicans opted for a more orthodox pick in John Thune, who has had a more rocky relationship with Trump.",
      "It\u2019s worth noting that this was a secret ballot, so it was far from a public repudiation of Trumpworld.",
      "There will be sterner tests of Trump\u2019s power on Capitol Hill to come, notably when confirmation hearings are held for his more divisive cabinet picks.",
      "Some Senate Republicans, for example, have already signalled their opposition to Trump's shock choice of Matt Gaetz to lead the justice department.",
      "4) Trump's criminal conviction could soon be wiped",
      "While much of the focus was on the president-elect\u2019s nominations and appointments, we also had a reminder that his legal troubles have been upended by his victory.",
      "In New York specifically, his criminal fraud conviction in the hush-money case lives on for at least a few more days.",
      "But it could soon be consigned to history. Earlier this week a judge delayed his decision as to whether Trump\u2019s conviction should be thrown out because of a Supreme Court ruling in the summer that expanded presidential immunity.",
      "That decision is now expected to come next week. And while it\u2019s not clear whether the conviction will be tossed out, Trump\u2019s scheduled sentencing on 26 November is likely to be delayed regardless.",
      "Here\u2019s a reminder of how Trump\u2019s election win impacts his cases.",
      "What are recess appointments and how will Trump administration picks be vetted?",
      "Trump's pick of Huckabee and Witkoff a clue to Middle East policy",
      "Trump picking Gaetz to head justice sends shockwaves - and a strong message",
      "Who has joined Trump's team so far?",
      "5) He has China firmly in his sights",
      "It\u2019s no secret that Trump views the world differently to Biden, and could drastically shift US foreign policy over the next few years.",
      "One clear theme that's emerged in recent days is the prominence of China hawks in his proposed team - those who believe Beijing poses a serious threat to US economic and military dominance and want to challenge this more forcefully.",
      "And they are present from the top down.",
      "His nomination for secretary of state - America\u2019s most senior diplomat - Marco Rubio, has described China as the \u201cmost advanced adversary America has ever faced\u201d.",
      "Mike Waltz, his national security adviser, has said the US is in a \u201ccold war\u201d with China. Other nominees such as his proposed ambassador to the UN, Elise Stefanik, have directly accused China of election interference.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first administration, relations with Beijing were tense, and they barely warmed under Biden. With tariffs, export controls and pointed rhetoric, the president-elect appears ready to take an even tougher stance this time around."

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of congressman Matt Gaetz to be his attorney general has arrived like a thunderclap in Washington.",
      "Of all the president-elect\u2019s picks for his administration so far, this is easily the most controversial - and sends a clear message that Trump intends to shake up the establishment when he returns to power.",
      "The shockwaves were still being felt on Thursday morning as focus shifted to a looming fight in the Senate over his nomination.",
      "Trump is assembling his team before he begins his term on 20 January, and his choice of defence secretary, Fox News host Pete Hegseth, and intelligence chief, former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, have also raised eyebrows.",
      "But it is Gaetz making most headlines. The Florida firebrand is perhaps best known for spearheading the effort to unseat then-Republican Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy last year. But he has a history of being a flamethrower in the staid halls of Congress.",
      "In 2018, he brought a right-wing Holocaust denier to the State of the Union, and later tried to expel two fathers who lost children in a mass shooting from a hearing after they objected to a claim he made about gun control.",
      "His bombastic approach means he has no shortage of enemies, including within his own party. And so Trump's choice of Gaetz for this crucial role is a signal to those Republicans, too - his second administration will be staffed by loyalists who he trusts to enact his agenda, conventional political opinion be damned.",
      "Gasps were heard during a meeting of Republican lawmakers when the nomination for America's top US prosecutor was announced, Axios reported, citing sources in the room.",
      "Republican congressman Mike Simpson of Idaho reportedly responded with an expletive.",

      "What top team picks tell us about Trump 2.0",
      "Could Musk really cut $2tn from government spending?",
      "Seven things Trump says he will do in power",
      "Gaetz does have some allies on Capitol Hill who share an unwavering loyalty to Trump. The Florida lawmaker has been one of the president-elect's most aggressive and relentless defenders - at congressional hearings, in press conferences and during television appearances.",
      "On Wednesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson, another devoted Trump loyalist, called Gaetz an \"accomplished attorney\".",
      "\"He's a reformer in his mind and heart, and I think that he'll bring a lot to the table on that,\" said Johnson.",
      "In a social media post, Trump spelled out how he intends to use Gaetz as a wrecking ball to radically change the US Department of Justice, which he has regularly blamed for his multiple legal troubles.",
      "\u201cMatt will root out the systemic corruption at the DOJ, and return the department to its true mission of fighting crime and upholding our democracy and constitution,\u201d he wrote.",
      "During the campaign, Trump promised retribution for the numerous investigations launched against him. Now, it appears, Gaetz will be at the frontlines of Trump\u2019s efforts to bring the justice department to heel.",
      "The department also investigated Gaetz himself.",
      "Last year, it declined to bring charges over allegations he violated sex-trafficking laws during a trip he took to the Bahamas with paid escorts.",
      "He was the subject of an ongoing ethics investigation in the House of Representatives into allegations of sexual misconduct, illicit drug use and misuse of campaign funds.",
      "But on Wednesday evening, reportedly just two days before a highly critical House report on the investigation, Johnson said Gaetz had resigned as a lawmaker, effectively ending the House probe since the committee only investigates members.",
      "On Thursday, top Senate Democrat Dick Durbin asked the House committee to preserve and share the findings of that report, saying the sequence and timings of the resignation raised questions.",
      "\"Make no mistake: this information could be relevant to the question of Mr Gaetz\u2019s confirmation as the next Attorney General of the United States.\"",

      "What Trump could do on day one in power",
      "Who Trump has appointed to his top team so far",
      "Why is Elon Musk Trump's efficiency tsar?",
      "According to CBS News, Gaetz had asked Trump for a pre-emptive pardon for any related crimes prior to the president leaving office in January 2021.",
      "All this makes him an unlikely choice for a position that typically goes to more senior politicians, well versed in law.",
      "Gaetz, 42, has a law degree and worked for a Florida law firm before his eight years in Congress. Joe Biden\u2019s attorney general, Merrick Garland, was a senior federal appellate court judge. Trump in his first term picked US Senator Jeff Sessions, and later Bill Barr, who had decades of experience in Republican presidential administrations.",
      "The Senate will be responsible for confirming Gaetz\u2019s nomination, and the Florida congressman has ruffled more then a few feathers in that chamber \u2013 including among Republicans. While his party has a majority, it would only take four \u201cno\u201d votes, joined by unified Democratic opposition, to sink his chances.",
      "Gaetz himself said last year that he would love to be attorney general while acknowledging it was unlikely.",
      "\u201cThe world is not ready, probably,\u201d he told Newsmax in an interview. \u201cCertainly Senate confirmation wouldn\u2019t be, but you know, a boy can dream.\u201d",
      "For the moment, however, Trump\u2019s closest supporters are celebrating his pick.",
      "\u201cThe hammer of justice is coming,\u201d Elon Musk posted about Gaetz on X.",
      "Regardless of the ultimate outcome of Gaetz\u2019s bid to be attorney general, Trump has fired a warning shot across the bow of US government. While his second term in office may be more organised than his first, it may end up being even more confrontational.",

      "Smotrich and Ben-Gvir have reason to be cheered by Huckabee\u2019s appointment. He has been a consistent supporter of many Israelis\u2019 ambitions to expand into territories that would form part of any future Palestinian state.",
      "Holding a press conference in 2017, shortly after a cornerstone-laying ceremony at one of the biggest Israeli settlements in the West Bank, Huckabee said: \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a settlement. They\u2019re communities, they\u2019re neighbourhoods, they\u2019re cities.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as an occupation.\u201d",
      "The following year, he said: \u201cI think Israel has title deed to Judea and Samaria,\u201d using the name used by many in Israel for the area which became the occupied West Bank when it was captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.",
      "The previous Trump administration declared in 2019 that it did not consider Israeli settlements illegal under international law, contradicting decades of US policy. Other decisions, including a 2020 peace plan greenlighting the annexation of Israeli settlements, were seen as more favourable to the settlers than any previous administration.",
      "The Israeli far right has indicated that it sees Huckabee\u2019s appointment as a sign that it will be able to further advance its agenda, including annexation of the West Bank, during the next Trump term.",
      "On Monday, Smotrich said that 2025 would be \"the year of sovereignty\" in the West Bank, adding that he had instructed Israeli authorities to begin preparatory work for annexation of the occupied territory.",
      "That happening is a genuine fear for Mustafa Barghouti, a West Bank-based veteran Palestinian politician who is leader of the Palestinian National Initiative political movement.",
      "\u201cYou can imagine the reaction of other powerful countries in the world would be, when the idea of annexing occupied territories, obtained by war, becomes legal and acceptable,\" he says. \"So it's not just about Palestinians and our suffering, it's about the international order.\u201d",
      "Whether Smotrich will get his wish remains to be seen. Tal Schneider, a political correspondent at the Times of Israel, says it is not a foregone conclusion that a pro-settler US ambassador will result in pro-settler policies in Washington.",
      "\u201cFour years ago, some of the people that surrounded Trump were very much pro-settlements and pro-annexing, but it didn't work like that last time. I predict it's not going to work like that this time around.\u201d",

      "\u201cWith President Trump, the Middle East experienced historic levels of peace and stability. Strength prevents wars. Iran\u2019s money was cut off which prevented their funding of global terror,\u201d he said.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s decision to nominate a hardline settler leader for Israeli ambassador to Washington three days after Trump\u2019s election also indicates that the prime minister believes the next administration will be receptive to right-wing arguments.",
      "US-born Yechiel Leiter, who was Netanyahu\u2019s chief of staff when he was finance minister, supports the annexation of the West Bank.

      "On election night, Donald Trump repeated the phrase: \"Promises made, promises kept.\"",
      "Now, Republicans have officially taken control of Congress and his \"promises\" are a whole lot easier to keep.",
      "In Washington political parlance, it's called \"a governing trifecta\", when the president's party also controls both chambers of Congress - the House of Representatives and the Senate.",
      "That control is what Donald Trump's Republican Party now has.",
      "Single-party control was once common, but in recent decades it has become rarer and shorter.  Often, the party in power loses seats when midterm congressional elections roll around two years later.",
      "Both Trump and Joe Biden enjoyed trifectas for their first two years in the White House, but they also saw that having such control is no guarantee a president can get their way.",

      "Who has Trump appointed to his top team so far?",
      "Why is Elon Musk Trump's efficiency tsar?",
      "In his first two years, Trump passed a signature tax bill - reducing corporate taxes from 35% to 21%, and cutting some taxes on individuals.",
      "But with some members of his own party resistant to his surprise ascent to the top in 2016, he struggled with other aims.",
      "His plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act (known as Obamacare) failed when a senator from his own party, John McCain, refused to vote for it. He also failed to pass an infrastructure bill as he had promised.",
      "In his first two years, when the Democrats controlled the House and the Senate, Biden succeeded in passing the American Rescue plan, the Investment and Jobs Act, and the Chips and Science Act. But he, too, had to significantly scale back his spending and investment plans - touted as the Build Back Better package - after opposition from one of his own senators.",
      "A major impediment to total control for either party is that Senate bills require a three-fifths majority, or 60 votes, to bypass the filibuster, which enables senators to delay legislation by keeping debate open-ended. That means that when a party has a simple majority in the Senate, it needs to reach across the aisle to get a bill passed.",
      "Even with a healthy majority in the Senate this time around, Trump will not have the magic 60 seats that would allow him to overcome opposition attempts to delay legislation.",
      "And on Wednesday, Republicans in the Senate selected John Thune as their majority leader over Florida's Rick Scott, the clear favourite in the Trump camp, in a sign some lawmakers may be reasserting their independence (Trump did not officially endorse Scott).",
      "That said, a trifecta, if astutely managed, does open the way for the possibility of major legislative initiatives.",
      "Trump's power advantage could be key in pushing through his big promises such as the largest deportation of migrants in history, sweeping tariffs on foreign imports, and the rolling back of environmental protections.",
      "Using legislation to achieve these ends will make such plans much harder to overturn in the courts - something Donald Trump was plagued by in his first term when he extensively used executive orders that were regularly and often successfully challenged.",
      "The judicial landscape also has changed in Trump's favour.",
      "The signature achievement of his first term was putting three conservatives on the Supreme Court - cementing a two-thirds majority for possibly decades to come.",
      "He also named more than four dozen judges to the federal appeals courts, flipping several circuits to a more conservative bent.",
      "The majority Republicans have in the Senate also provides a key advantage.",
      "Trump will be able to get his nominees for administration posts approved more easily, something he struggled with back in 2017 when internal resistance to him in the Republican Party was still significant.",
      "All this bodes for a busy and possibly turbulent next two years. But, as recent history indicates, these trifectas don't last all that long. The incoming administration will want to get a move on.",

      "Senate vetting: How does it work?",
      "More than 1,000 positions - including the 15 officials chosen to lead executive departments, known as the Cabinet - typically require Senate approval. This also includes ambassadors and even some lower-level positions.",
      "But many members of Trump's team, including those who work in the White House or posts like the national security adviser, don't require Senate approval. They still are vetted, however, by the administration and could face intensive FBI background checks.",

      "The Senate approval process requires nominees to submit financial disclosure forms, fill out a questionnaire - which differs based on the role - and testify before a Senate committee.",
      "These hearings can sometimes be contentious. They allow members from both political parties to question nominees about their backgrounds and plans for the post.",
      "After the hearing, the committee votes on the nomination. If it approves the candidate, the full Senate then votes on the nominee.",
      "Historically, the upper chamber has approved cabinet positions quickly - sometimes with little or no debate. But \"political and partisan conflicts between the president and senators have at times produced dramatic fights over cabinet nominees and led to their ultimate withdrawal or rejection\", the Senate's historical website notes.",
      "Bitter political brawls over Trump's picks could be limited somewhat because Republicans will control both chambers of Congress when the president-elect takes office in January.",
      "But some Republicans already have questioned at least one Trump choice, Florida congressman Matt Gaetz, the nominee for post of attorney general, or top prosecutor in the US.",
      "What are recess appointments?",
      "The vetting and approval process for nominees can be lengthy, but it was included in the US Constitution to provide a check on presidential power. It is also designed to rule out corrupt or unqualified nominees.",
      "There is, however, an exception to this process - recess appointments - which Trump appears intent to use to ensure his appointments are able to take office.",
      "Basically, the process says that when Congress is in recess - meaning it's not in session for a duration of time - the president can make appointments temporarily without congressional approval or vetting.",
      "Sen Thune warned on Fox that while recess appointments are an option for nominees, it is also not a certainty. First, all senators would need to vote to recess, he said, adding that the same senators with concerns about a nominee might also oppose a recess.",
      "The recess process was created when Congress didn't meet as often as it does today, and was to be used in emergencies so presidents would be able to fill positions without delay.",
      "It is also supposed to be a temporary appointment and expires at the end of a congressional session - so at most, one year.",
      "Trump recently said the Senate \"must agree\" to recess appointments, otherwise \"we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner\". He noted that in his past administration, some of his nominees took multiple years to be confirmed.",
      "Trump's plan to use recess appointments, along with the announcement that Republican senators' support bypassing the Senate vetting process, is not without precedent.",
      "Some past presidents have employed the method liberally, often as a way of circumventing political divides that would slow nominations.",
      "George W Bush made 171 recess appointments, Bill Clinton made 139 and Barack Obama made at least 32, according to the Congressional Research Service (CRS).",

      "While other presidents have used them, Prof Chafetz says: \"I can't think of an instance in which the Senate majority has triggered a recess simply so that a president could make recess appointments.\"",
      "When can Trump make recess appointments?",
      "According to Professor Chafetz, there are two paths Trump could take to making recess appointments.",
      "The first would involve the Senate agreeing to recess for 10 days or more by majority vote.",
      "The second would involve the House voting for a longer recess than the Senate, which would allow Trump to invoke a never-used constitutional power to adjourn both chambers of Congress.",
      "According to the US Constitution, \"in Case of Disagreement\" a president can adjourn both chambers of Congress until \"such Time as he shall think proper\" - which would then provide Trump an opportunity to make recess appointments.",
      "Trump previously threatened to use this power when he was in the White House.",
      "In 2020, during a pandemic briefing, Trump said that he would \"exercise my constitutional authority to adjourn both chambers of Congress\u201d to make recess appointments if his nominees before Congress were not approved.",
      "Professor Chafetz stressed that this route has never been used before in US history, and so \"no-one is quite sure how it would work\".",
      "He added that Trump cannot make any recess appointments until he is president. His inauguration is scheduled for 20 January.",
      "If Trump wishes for the Senate to recess for a period longer than 10 days, he would require the unanimous consent of all 100 lawmakers.",
      "But the chamber includes 47 Democrats, all or most of whom will vote to block the change.",
      "In order to override that blockade, Republicans need a 60-vote majority, which means winning support from all 53 of their members and at least seven Democrats.",
      "With Republicans unlikely to reach that threshold, they will be faced with rolling back a procedural tool known as the filibuster. Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune, like his predecessor Mitch McConnell, has already indicated he does not support setting such a precedent.",

      "It's not clear how Trump plans to achieve this policy. He has pledged an executive order but birthright citizenship is explicitly guaranteed by the US Constitution, meaning it can only be altered under specific circumstances.",

      "What's less clear is who might get a pardon.",

      "He formally endorsed Trump this year after an assassination attempt, ultimately donating more than $100m (\u00a379m) to Trump's 2024 presidential campaign and appearing at numerous rallies.",
      "Prof Phelps describes Musk's relationship with Trump as \"transactional\", adding that the new role \"gives him a lot of symbolic clout - and possibly the clout to get the things that matter most to him done\".",
      "As the South African-born billionaire is not a US citizen by birth, Musk cannot become president - something that has frustrated other famous faces who became involved in politics in the past.",
      "But he can have an influence on US policy, and Trump will have a sympathetic adviser to call upon.",
      "\"Trump is looking to surround himself with loyalists in his new administration, and there\u2019s no-one who\u2019s been more loyal than Musk since he announced his endorsement for Trump,\" says Prof Gift.",
      "\"Not only did Musk go 'all in' in supporting Trump personally and financially during the campaign, but he\u2019s also evolved into a trusted adviser on topics as diverse as technology policy to the war in Ukraine.\"",
      "In an early sign of the influence the tech entrepreneur may be rewarded with for his loyalty, Musk was party to a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky following the election. The war in Ukraine will be a major foreign policy concern when Trump takes office.",
      "\"That is actually quite extraordinary,\" says Prof Waddan. \"Normally, even your biggest donors wouldn\u2019t get that kind of access.\"",
      "What is the Department of Government Efficiency?",
      "Musk first raised the idea of a cost-cutting effort while hosting Trump on X this summer. The official name is a winking reference to a meme featuring a Shiba Inu dog, which then gave its name to the cryptocurrency Dogecoin, a favourite of Musk that has seen its value soar since the election.",
      "Prof Phelps says the name is \"a nod to crypto deregulation being part of what they\u2019ll do\".",
      "But it is not clear how much of Musk's talk of cutting might actually become reality.",
      "For one thing, the new department will not have an official role, but provide \"advice and guidance from outside government\", according to the announcement.",
      "Experts have also warned that cuts of the scale discussed could be enormously disruptive - and face pushback in Congress - depending on how rapidly they are implemented.",
      "Musk himself acknowledged the risks, saying Americans should be ready to stomach temporary hardship for long-run gain.",
      "The way he has run his own firms may hint at what Americans can expect.",
      "After his October 2022 takeover of the social media platform Twitter - which he branded as X - Musk introduced radical changes, including the reduction X's workforce from around 8,000 to 1,500 in a matter of weeks.",
      "\"His idea of efficiency was to let a lot of people go,\" says Alex Waddan, a professor of US politics at the University of Leicester.",
      "Musk also loosened content moderation, stopped verifying accounts and welcomed users back to the platform who had been banned for violating its rules on hate speech and disinformation.",
      "Among the users he reinstated was Trump, who had been banned following the Capitol riot in January 2021 after continuing to claim the 2020 election had been rigged against him.",
      "Critics argue his changes have given prominence to hate-speech and misinformation - though Musk maintains the site is politically neutral.",
      "The overhaul also prompted an exodus of advertisers - the main way the site has made money. Though Musk has introduced new ways to raise revenue, such as paid subscriptions, the company today is worth far less than the $44bn Musk paid for it just two years ago.",
      "His record at his other big companies - Tesla and SpaceX - is stronger.",
      "Among car companies, Tesla stands out for making electric vehicles at a large profit, thanks in part to streamlined operations. His rocket firm SpaceX is credited with enabling rocket launches at significantly lower cost.",
      "\"As a serial entrepreneur, Musk has been relentless in trying to improve institutional efficiency at his own enterprises,\" Prof Gift says.",
      "He adds that though Musk's primary role will be \"slashing through the thicket of red tape that is the US federal government\", his position will also give him influence in the new administration.",
      "\"While his role in the Department of Government Efficiency will be a more informal one, there\u2019s no doubt that he\u2019s got Trump's ear - at least for the moment.\"",

He also made comments to the media and on social media that highlight what his priorities will be upon taking office in January, with a special focus on immigration and foreign policy.",

      "A hard-line immigration team in place",
      "Some of Trump\u2019s newly revealed appointments suggest that the president-elect\u2019s campaign promise to deport millions of undocumented migrants living in the US is no exaggeration.",
      "Stephen Miller, who has been Trump\u2019s close adviser and speechwriter since 2015, is Trump\u2019s choice for White House deputy chief of staff for policy.  He will likely shape any plans for mass deportations - and pare back both undocumented and legal immigration. During Trump's first term, Miller was involved in developing some of the administration's strictest immigration policies.",
      "Thomas Homan, acting director of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency in Trump\u2019s first term, supported the president\u2019s policy of separating undocumented families detained at the US-Mexico border. Now he\u2019s back with an even broader portfolio, as Trump\u2019s \u201cimmigration tsar\u201d.",
      "\u201cI will run the biggest deportation force this country has ever seen,\u201d Homan said at a conservative conference in July.",
      "Critics have warned that Trump\u2019s mass deportation plan could cost upwards of $300bn. In an interview with NBC News last week, however, the president-elect said cost was not an issue.",
      "\u201cWhen people have killed and murdered, when drug lords have destroyed countries, and now they\u2019re going to go back to those countries because they\u2019re not staying here,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no price tag.\u201d",

      "How would Trump\u2019s promise of mass deportations of migrants work?",
      "China hawks take flight",
      "Many conservatives believe that China poses the single greatest threat to continued US global dominance, both economically and militarily. While Trump has been more circumspect, limiting most of his China critiques to the realm of trade, he is filling his foreign policy team with vocal China critics.",
      "The president-elect picked Florida Congressman Mike Waltz, a retired Army colonel, as his national security adviser \u2013 a key foreign policy post within the White House. Waltz has said the US is in a \u201ccold war\u201d with China and was one of the first members of Congress to call for a US boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.",
      "In October, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, Trump\u2019s pick for US ambassador to the UN, accused China of \u201cblatant and malicious election interference\u201d amid reports that China-backed hackers attempted to gather information from the former president\u2019s phones.",
      "While Trump has yet to officially name his choice for secretary of state, Florida Senator Marco Rubio \u2013 another China hawk \u2013 appears to be the leading contender for the top diplomatic job. In 2020, Rubio was sanctioned by the Chinese government after he pushed measures to punish the nation for its crackdown on pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong.",
      "US-China relations were often rocky during Trump's first term, amidst trade disputes and the Covid pandemic. The Biden administration, which kept many of Trump's China tariffs and imposed some new ones, only somewhat calmed the waters. Now it looks like the next Trump administration will pick up where the last one left off.",

      "Musk's new role",
      "While the list of Trump\u2019s political appointees grows, there\u2019s another group that stays small \u2013 and exceedingly influential.",
      "Elon Musk, the wealthiest man in the world, has been a full-time presence at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago transition headquarters. According to media reports, he is advising the president-elect on cabinet nominees and even joined a conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week.",
      "On Tuesday night, Trump announced that he was assigning Musk to work with tech entrepreneur and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy in a \"department of government efficiency\" tasked with identifying new budget cuts.",
      "Musk has regularly offered his political opinions on his social media platform X, including endorsing Florida Senator Rick Scott\u2019s bid to be the next Senate majority leader.",
      "Musk\u2019s political action committee spent around $200m to help Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, and he promises to continue to fund the group\u2019s efforts to advance the president-elect\u2019s agenda and help Republican candidates in upcoming congressional elections.",
      "Meanwhile, it remains to be seen where Robert F Kennedy Jr, another key figure, lands. Trump has said that he plans to give the former Democrat and vaccine sceptic, who abandoned his independent bid and endorsed the Republican, a role in making America \u201chealthy\u201d again.",
      "\u201cHe wants to do some things, and we\u2019re going to let him go to it,\u201d Trump said in his election victory speech.",
      "Prioritising presidential power over Congress",
      "As Trump takes office, Republicans have control of the Senate and could still take the House, albeit by a slim margin. However, the president-elect\u2019s early actions suggest he is more concerned with exercising his presidential power than working with the legislative branch.",
      "Last week, he posted on social media that the Senate\u2019s Republican leadership should smooth the way for more presidential \u201crecess appointments\u201d \u2013 allowing him to fill top administration jobs without Senate approval when Congress is not in session. The move would strengthen presidential power by undercutting the chamber\u2019s constitutional role to \u201cadvise and consent\u201d on political appointees.",
      "Meanwhile, the president-elect keeps chipping away at those narrow congressional majorities. Senators who move to administration roles can quickly be replaced by appointment from the governor of their home state. But any House vacancies \u2013 such as ones created by Stefanik and Waltz\u2019s departures \u2013 require special elections that can take months to schedule.",
      "Some of Trump\u2019s advisers, including Musk, have warned that the president-elect could be endangering his legislative agenda if he plucks too many more Republicans from the chambers.",
      "Even in the best of circumstances, congressional legislation takes time, effort and compromise. Executive action, such as new immigration enforcement, can be done with the stroke of a presidential pen.",
      "Trump\u2019s actions indicate he is, at least at the moment, more focused on the latter.",
      "Rewarding loyalists",
      "Trump has only just begun filling out the thousands of jobs that open up with a new presidential administration, not including the senior-level career bureaucrats he has said he will replace.",
      "In 2016, as a political newcomer, he had to rely on more establishment Republicans for key roles. This time, he has a wealth of prospective candidates with proven track records of supporting him and after eight years, Trump loyalists are the Republican establishment.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump named South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as homeland security secretary, and Fox News host and conservative author Pete Hegseth as defence secretary.",
      "The latter has been particularly controversial, given his lack of experience navigating the sprawling US military bureaucracy and penchant for inflammatory remarks. For Trump, however, status as an outsider and a willingness to lean into hot-button cultural issues are a strength, not a flaw.",
      "And above all else, Hegseth and Noem have been fierce Trump defenders from the start.",
      "Some of Trump\u2019s other picks, like Rubio and Stefanik, were critics of Trump early in his first presidential bid, but they have now spent years demonstrating that their harsh words are a thing of the past.",
      "Rubio, who ran for president against Trump in 2016, may still have White House ambitions, however. Trump often soured on appointees who seemed drawn to the limelight during his first term, and even the warmest of relationships could go bad.",
      "Trump may be placing a premium on loyalty with his early staff announcements, but the pressures of governing ultimately will reveal whether his second four years in office end up different from his first.",

      "Veteran immigration official Tom Homan will be in charge of the country's borders following Trump's inauguration in January.",
      "With a decades-long career in law enforcement and at the border, all eyes will be on how he plans to cut down on illegal immigration into the US - a flagship policy of Trump's election campaign.",
      "So how will he approach the task?",
      "Homan - an ex-policeman and former acting US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) director - has described immigration at the US border as \"the biggest national security vulnerability this nation has seen since 9/11 and we have to fix it.\"",
      "Addressing illegal immigrants in the US during the Republican National Convention in the summer, he said: \u201cYou better start packing now.\u201d",
      "But it is not yet clear how his role as \"border tsar\" will take shape, as managing immigration involves coordination among several government agencies.",
      "He has however, provided some ideas on how he would approach the border.",
      "Reversing Biden policies",
      "In an interview with CBS News's 60 Minutes in October, prior to Trump's election, Homan indicated he would seek to target non-criminal immigrants who are in the country illegally, after first prioritising \"public safety threats\" and \"national security threats\".",
      "Such an approach would reverse Biden administration policies that direct Ice to focus on deporting serious criminals, national security threats and recent border crossers.",
      "The current Biden policy helps protect undocumented immigrants who have been living in the US and have not committed crimes.",
      "Targeted arrests to facilitate deportations",
      "Homan has said he would use a targeted approach would be used when carrying out arrests and deportations.",
      "Asked in the same October interview how deportations would be carried out, Homan said: \"It's not gonna be a mass sweep of neighbourhoods. It's not gonna be building concentration camps. I've read it all. It's ridiculous.\"",
      "\"They'll be targeted arrests. We'll know who we're going to arrest, where we're most likely to find 'em based on numerous... investigative processes,\" he added.",
      "Deporting families together",
      "Homan played a role in Trump\u2019s controversial \"zero tolerance\" policy, which separated thousands of migrant children from their parents.",
      "The policy sparked backlash when children were sent to shelters while their parents were prosecuted with no plans to reunite them.",
      "Homan has said he didn\u2019t write the policy memo that led to the separations, but he was one of three officials who signed it. He said he signed it \u201choping to save lives\u201d.",
      "Homan indicated that he would not seek to re-instate that policy.",
      "Rather, he has said families could be \"deported together\", when asked whether deportations could be carried out without separating families.",
      "Workplace mass immigration arrests",
      "Homan also has pointed to reviving mass immigration arrests at workplaces - what he refers to as work-site enforcement operations, which Biden discontinued in 2021.",
      "\u201cAs far as the people going to push back on deporting, what is the option?,\u201d he said on Fox News's Fox & Friends on Monday.",
      "\u201cYou have the right to claim asylum. You have a right to see a judge. We make that happen. But at the end of that due process if the judge says you must go home, then we have to take them home.\u201d",

      "\u201cI was a border patrol agent. I wore the uniform,\u201d he told Fox & Friends on Monday. \u201cI'm proud that I wore the uniform... I was the first Ice director to come up through the ranks.\u201d",
      "Former President Barack Obama appointed him to head Ice\u2019s deportation branch in 2013. It marked a time when the agency conducted a record number of deportations.",
      "Homan\u2019s work won him the Presidential Rank Award, the highest civil service recognition.",
      "Trump appointed Homan as acting director of Ice during his second week in office in 2017, a role he continued in until 2018.",
      "Trump later nominated him to become the agency\u2019s permanent director, but the Senate never moved on the nomination.",

      "Soon after, she entered politics, serving as a White House domestic policy adviser under President George W Bush and eventually becoming a senior aide to Bush chief of staff Joshua Bolten.",
      "Stefanik later became a top campaign adviser for Paul Ryan when he ran for vice-president alongside Mitt Romney. When Romney lost, the then-30-year-old moved back to upstate New York and ran for Congress, flipping a Democratic-controlled seat with a win by over 20 points.",
      "Stefanik once billed herself to voters as a traditional conservative, but emerged as  one of Trump's most ardent defenders during the first impeachment trial against him in 2019. Her support for Trump has not wavered since.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m proud to be a top surrogate,\u201d Stefanik said earlier this year of her support for the president-elect. \u201cI would proudly serve in a future Trump administration.\u201d",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 00:46:38 GMT",
    "summary": "A new study finds that caste plays a vital role in high rates of stunting in children in India.",
    "story": [
      "Decades of caste discrimination have contributed to India having higher levels of child stunting rates than across Sub-Saharan Africa, new research has revealed.",
      "The two regions together are home to 44% of the world\u2019s under-five population but account for about 70% of stunted children globally - a key indicator of malnutrition.",
      "But, while both have made significant strides in recent years, India\u2019s rate stands at 35.7%, with the average across Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s 49 countries at 33.6%.",
      "A child is considered stunted when they fall short of the expected height for their age - a clear sign of critical nutritional gaps.",
      "However, the study by Ashwini Deshpande (Ashoka University) and Rajesh Ramachandran (Monash University, Malaysia) found that focusing only on the height gap - or why Indian children are shorter than children in Sub-Saharan Africa - overlooks an important factor: the crucial role of social identity, especially caste, in child malnutrition in India.",
      "The first 1,000 days of a child's life, often called the \"golden period\", are pivotal: by age two, 80% of the brain develops, laying the foundation for lifelong potential. In these early years, access to healthcare, good nutrition, early learning, and a safe environment profoundly shapes a child's future.",
      "India and Sub-Saharan Africa, both with rapidly growing middle classes, young populations and significant workforce potential, share longstanding comparisons. In 2021, the World Bank reported, \u201cSub-Saharan Africa and South Asia [including India] account for over 85% of the global poor,\u201d underscoring similar challenges in poverty and development.",
      "Using official data, the authors looked at the most recent estimates of the stunting gaps between India and a sample of 19 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.",
      "Official data shows that more than 35% of India\u2019s 137 million children under five are stunted, with over a third also underweight. Globally, 22% of children under five are stunted.",
      "Then they examined six broad socially disadvantaged groups in India. Among them are adivasis (tribespeople living in remote areas) and Dalits (formerly known as untouchables), who alone comprise more than a third of the under-five population.",
      "The economists found that children from higher-ranked, non-stigmatised caste groups in India stood at 27% - markedly lower than the Sub-Saharan African rate.",
      "They also found that children from higher-ranking caste groups in India are some 20% less likely to experience stunting compared with those from marginalised groups, who occupy the lowest tiers of the caste hierarchy.",
      "This conclusion remains significant even after accounting for factors like birth order, sanitation practices, maternal height, sibling count, education, anaemia and household socio-economic status.",
      "This difference is despite seven decades of affirmative action, India's caste system - a four-fold hierarchy of the Hindu religion - remains deeply entrenched.",
      "\u201cThis should not be surprising given that children from better-off groups in India have access to more calories and face a better disease environment,\u201d the authors say.",
      "The reasons behind high stunting rates among Indian children have sparked a complex debate over the years.",
      "Some economists have argued that the differences are genetic - that Indian children are genetically disposed to lower heights.",
      "Others believe that improved nutrition over generations has historically closed height gaps thought to be genetic.",
      "Some studies have found that girls fare worse than boys and others just the opposite, using different global standards.",
      "To be sure, stunting has decreased across social groups - a separate 2022 study found that improvements in health and nutrition interventions, household living conditions and maternal factors led to reduction in stunting in four Indian states. (More than half of India's under-five children were stunted, according to a federal family health survey of 1992-93).",
      "Children from marginalised groups like adivasis are likely to be more malnourished.",
      "In Africa, the rate of stunting has also fallen since 2010, although the absolute number increased.",
      "But what is clear is that children from poor families, with less-educated mothers, or from marginalised groups, are especially vulnerable to stunting in India.",
      "\u201cThe debate on the height gap between Indian and Sub-Saharan African children has resulted in overlooking the role of social identity, especially caste status,\u201d the authors say.",
      "\u201cThis is a crucial dimension to understanding the burden of child nutrition in India.\u201d",
      "The analysis uses data from demographic and health surveys. For India, it includes the latest data from 2019-21, and for Sub-Saharan Africa, it includes data from 19 countries with surveys from 2015 onwards. The dataset covers anthropometric - measurements related to the physical dimensions and composition of the human body- outcomes for 195,024 children under five in India and 202,557 children under five in Sub-Saharan Africa."

      "It never happened. Instead the company ran demonstration flights.",
      "While missing that deadline was embarrassing, behind the scenes a more serious issue was playing out - Volocopter was urgently trying to raise fresh investment to keep the firm going.",
      "Talks to borrow \u20ac100m (\u00a383m; $106m) from the government failed in April.",
      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",
      "Volocopter is one of dozens of companies around the world developing an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) aircraft.",
      "Their machines promise the flexibility of a helicopter, but without the cost, noise and emissions.",
      "However, faced with the massive cost of getting such novel aircraft approved by regulators and then building up manufacturing capabilities, some investors are bailing out.",
      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",
      "Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.",
      "The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.",
      "It was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.",
      "As recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium\u2019s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely burning through cash,\" he told the BBC. \u201cBut this is a good sign, because it means we are producing the aircraft. We\u2019re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised \u20ac1.5bn\u201d.",
      "But then the money ran out.",
      "Lilium had been attempting to arrange a loan worth \u20ac100m from the German development bank, KfW. However, that required guarantees from national and state governments, which never materialised.",
      "In early November, the company put its main operating businesses into insolvency proceedings, and its shares were removed from the Nasdaq stock exchange.",
      "For the moment, work on the new aircraft is continuing, as the company works with restructuring experts to sell the business or bring in new investment. However, getting the new e-jet into production is looking more challenging than ever.",
      "The high-profile British player in the eVTOL market is Vertical Aerospace. The Bristol-based company was founded in 2016 by businessman Stephen Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy.",
      "Its striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be \u201c100 times\u201d safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.",
      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",
      "In May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.",
      "Ambitions remain sky high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year, and to be breaking even in cash terms.",
      "Yet financial strains have been intensifying. Mr Fitzpatrick invested an extra $25m into the company in March. But a further $25m, due in August if alternative investment could not be found, has not been paid. As of September, Vertical had $57.4m on hand \u2013 but it expects to burn through nearly double that over the coming year.",
      "Hopes for the future appear to be pinned on doing a deal with the American financier Jason Mudrick, who is already a major creditor through his firm Mudrick Capital Management.",

    "story": [
      "Forty years after they began the task \u2013 and nearly four hundred years after receiving their first commission \u2013 sages in Paris have finally produced a new edition of the definitive French dictionary.",
      "The full ninth edition of the Dictionnaire de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise was formally presented to President Macron this afternoon in the plush surroundings of the 17th century Coll\u00e8ge des Quatre-Nations on the left bank of the Seine.",
      "This is where the 40 wise men and women of the French Academy \u2013 so-called immortels (immortals) chosen for their contributions to French language and literature \u2013 have met since the body was first created by Cardinal Richelieu in 1635.",
      "Their task at the start was to \u201cgive certain rules to our language, to render it pure and eloquent\u201d \u2013 to which end they set about writing their first dictionary.",
      "However, the job has proved so slow \u2013 the first book was not produced until 1694 and today it takes more than a year to get through a single letter of the alphabet \u2013 that the relevance of the enterprise is increasingly in question.",
      "\u201cThe effort is praiseworthy, but so excessively tardy that it is perfectly useless,\u201d a collective of linguists wrote in the Liberation newspaper on Thursday.",
      "This ninth edition replaces the eighth, which was completed in 1935.  Work started in 1986, and three previous sections \u2013 up to the letter R \u2013 have already been issued.",
      "Today the end section (last entry Zzz) has been added, meaning the work is complete.",
      "In its press release, the Academy said the dictionary is a \u201cmirror of an epoch running from the 1950s up to today,\u201d and boasts  21,000 new entries compared to the 1935 version.",
      "But many of the \u201cmodern\u201d words added in the 1980s or 90s are already out of date.  And such is the pace of linguistic change, many words in current use today are too new to make it in.",
      "Thus common words like tiktokeur, vlog, smartphone and \u00e9moji \u2013 which are all in the latest commercial dictionaries \u2013 do not exist in the Acad\u00e9mie book.  Conversely its \u201cnew\u201d words include such go-ahead concepts as soda, sauna, yuppie and sup\u00e9rette (mini-supermarket).",
      "For the latest R-Z section, the writers have included the new thinking on the feminisation of jobs, including female alternatives (which did not exist before) for positions such as ambassadeur and professeur. However print versions of the earlier sections do not have the change, because for many years the Acad\u00e9mie fought a rear-guard action against it.",
      "Likewise the third section of the new dictionary \u2013 including the letter M \u2013 defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman, which in France it no longer is.",
      "\u201cHow can anyone pretend that this collection can serve as a reference for anyone?\u201d the collective asks, noting that online dictionaries are both bigger and faster-moving.",
      "Under its president, the writer Amin Maalouf, the dictionary committee meets every Thursday morning and after discussion gives its ruling on definitions that have been drawn up in preliminary form by outside experts.",
      "Among the \u201cimmortals\u201d is the English poet and French expert Michael Edwards, who told Le Figaro newspaper how he tried to get the Academy to revive the long-forgotten word improfond (undeep).",

      "Before the east and west coast rap beef of the 1990s boiled over with the murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious BIG, legendary producer Quincy Jones called a secret meeting at which he appealed for an end to the violence.",
      "As hip-hop rose from the streets to the mainstream in the 90s, the rappers and hustlers that broke through had few role models who had trodden that path before them.",
      "There was one man, though, who had been there, and done pretty much everything.",
      "Quincy Jones had been in gangs and had been stabbed at the age of seven in 1930s Chicago, before becoming a major force in American music thanks to his work with legends like Ray Charles, Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson.",
      "He was at the heart of revolutions in jazz, swing, soul, funk, disco and pop - but one aspect of his career that got less attention when he died last week at the age of 91 was his place in hip-hop.",
      "Jones was revered in all corners of music, including rap. Unlike most in the old guard and the media, he immediately realised the scene's artistic and cultural importance.",
      "Hip-hop reminded him of the bebop jazz of his youth. \"I feel a kinship there because we went through a lot of the same stuff,\" he said.",
      "\"Quincy understood it and got it right away,\" says pioneering artist, rapper and presenter Fab 5 Freddy.",
      "Jones worked with leading rappers in the 80s, and in the 90s he recognised risks including a volatile rivalry that had begun to erupt between competing labels and stars.",
      "So he brought artists, executives and elder black American statesmen together for a secret summit in 1995, hoping it would be a turning point.",
      "The east coast was hip-hop's spiritual home. In 1992, Sean Combs - then known as Puffy and later as P Diddy - launched his Bad Boy record label in New York with artists including Notorious BIG, aka Biggie Smalls.",
      "Meanwhile, across America, Los Angeles was coming into its own as the capital of gangsta rap, led by menacing mogul Suge Knight's Death Row Records, which had Dr Dre and Tupac.",
      "In 1994, Tupac was shot and injured during a robbery in the lobby of a studio. He later implied that his former friend Biggie may have known about the attack in advance. Biggie then released the track Who Shot Ya?, which Tupac thought was about him.",
      "The beef continued at the Source magazine awards on 3 August 1995, when Knight goaded Combs and Bad Boy Records from the stage.",
      "Jones, who had his own magazine, Vibe, held his summit three weeks later.",
      "Quincy Jones: From 'street rat' to music mastermind",
      "Quincy Jones: His brilliance explained in 10 songs",
      "'He changed my life': Stars remember Quincy Jones",
      "The brewing east-west beef wasn't the only reason Jones called it - it was mainly intended to discuss the state of hip-hop and let the new generation hear life and business advice from a group of highly successful black executives.",
      "But rap's negative image and the burgeoning tensions were a big talking point.",
      "\"He knew this was a bubbling issue, and so his idea was to bring together a symposium,\" says Fab 5 Freddy, who was hosting Yo! MTV Raps at the time and was the event's moderator.",
      "Jones told the summit: \"The thing that really provoked me to say it's time to pay attention now is Tupac.\"",

      "Jones had already experienced his own beef with Tupac - the rapper criticised the producer in a 1993 edition of Source for marrying white women.",
      "\"We finally hooked up, even though it was tension conditions in the beginning,\" Jones said at the event.",
      "\"We finally talked to each other, and he said nobody had talked to him like that before.",
      "\"And I said, I can't take it any more. Because we can no longer afford to be non-political, and I'm talking to the hip-hop nation now.\"",
      "About 50 influential artists and executives were in the room, including Public Enemy's Chuck D, members of A Tribe Called Quest, MC Lyte, Kris Kross, Jermaine Dupri and Boyz n the Hood film-maker John Singleton.",
      "Jones wrote in his now-out-of-print 2001 autobiography: \"I had been concerned about the potentially volatile diversity of a group who'd never been in the same room together.\"",
      "They were joined by veteran executives Clarence Avant and Ahmet Ertegun, plus Colin Powell, the former national security adviser and head of the US military who would go on to become the first African-American secretary of state.",
      "Powell had presidential ambitions - that was why the summit was held in secret. Jones wanted to save Powell from being associated with the negative publicity that surrounded rap music.",
      "He switched venues at the last minute to throw press off the scent, and confiscated the recordings.",
      "\"Rest assured that my discretion is based on a deep respect for you and a valued friendship,\" Jones wrote to Powell in an unpublished letter held at Indianapolis University Library.",
      "\"I know that we are going to make a difference at this conference. Thanks for the way you handled the situation. Maybe we can turn the battleship an inch or two.\"",
      "Jones later wrote in his book: \"Some of the younger rappers didn't even know who he was. When addressing some of the more confrontational comments from the floor, Powell maintained his South Bronx demeanour and authoritative cool throughout.\"",
      "Fab 5 Freddy remembers one exchange between Powell and Knight. \"There was an encounter where he [Knight] had something to say, and Colin Powell responded.",
      "\"Here you have this guy who was a four-star general talking to Suge Knight, and he pretty much put Suge in his place.\"",
      "Jones finally released a clip of the event for a 2018 Netflix documentary about his life.",
      "\"We've got to seriously talk about what you are going to deal with,\" he is seen telling the assembled attendees.",
      "\"They are not playing, there's real bullets out there, believe me. Maybe literally and figuratively.",
      "\"It's a very emotional thing,\" he added, his voice cracking. \"I want to see you guys live to at least my age.\"",
      "\"Quincy did get emotional,\" Fab 5 Freddy recalls, \"because he sensed what could happen.",
      "\"And the worst, unfortunately, did happen.\"",
      "Who was Tupac Shakur?",
      "Ex-gang leader pleads not guilty to Tupac murder",
      "Diddy accused of 'revenge' rape over Tupac claims",
      "Jones had ended up reconciling with Tupac. After Tupac's 1993 comments, Jones's 17-year-old daughter Rashida - who would go on to star in US sitcom The Office - wrote an irate letter to Source attacking the rapper.",
      "When Tupac bumped into one of Jones's other daughters, Kidada, he apologised, thinking she was Rashida. But Tupac and Kidada hit it off and began a relationship.",
      "\"Though we got off to a rocky start, as I came to know and feel him I saw his enormous potential and sensitivity as an artist and as a human being,\" Quincy Jones wrote.",
      "There have also been claims that Tupac was planning to leave Death Row for Jones's record label.",
      "But in September 1996, a year after the summit, Tupac was shot and killed.",
      "A former gang leader, Duane \"Keffe D\" Davis, was charged with his murder last year. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Then in 1997, Notorious BIG was shot dead outside a party thrown by Jones's record label and magazine. No-one has ever been charged.",
      "Meanwhile, today Knight is in prison for a hit-and-run, while Combs is awaiting trial on charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, which he denies.",
      "The violence in the 90s \"wasn't necessary\" and was caused by \"wannabes and gang-related troublemakers\" on the edges of the music industry, according to Fab 5 Freddy.",
      "\"Also, the east/west coast beef was mainly ignited by jealousy. It was an ashtray fire fanned into a big deal by media outlets that led to Biggie and Tupac getting killed.\"",
      "Despite his stature, not even Jones could alter the forces of power and pride that were at work and prevent the bloodshed.",
      "Freddy believes some lessons were learned at the summit, however, and that it deserves a place in hip-hop history.",
      "\"It was incredible and electric to be in that room.",
      "\"It was a thrilling moment. And then it became even more legendary because it was never released, so the only people that really knew about it were the people that were there.\""

    "story": [
      "The mystery as to why a beluga whale appeared off the coast of Norway wearing a harness may finally have been solved.",
      "The tame white whale, which locals named Hvaldimir, made headlines five years ago amidst widespread speculation that it was a Russian spy.",
      "Now an expert in the species says she believes the whale did indeed belong to the military and escaped from a naval base in the Arctic Circle.",
      "But Dr Olga Shpak does not believe it was a spy. She believes the beluga was being trained to guard the base and fled because it was a \"hooligan\".",
      "Seeking sanctuary for whale dubbed a Russian spy",
      "Russia has always refused to confirm or deny that the beluga whale was trained by its military.",
      "But Dr Shpak, who worked in Russia researching marine mammals from the 1990s until she returned to her native Ukraine in 2022, told BBC News: \u201cFor me it\u2019s 100% (certain).\u201d",
      "Dr Shpak, whose account is based on conversations with friends and former colleagues, features in a BBC documentary, Secrets of the Spy Whale, which is now on BBC iPlayer and being shown on BBC Two on Wednesday at 21:00 GMT.",
      "Secrets of the Spy Whale",
      "The mysterious whale first came to public attention five years ago when it approached fishermen off the northern coast of Norway.",
      "\u201cThe whale starts rubbing against the boat,\u201d Joar Hesten, one of the fishermen, says. \u201cI heard about animals in distress that instinctively knew that they need help from humans. I was thinking that this is one smart whale.\u201d",
      "The sighting was unusual because the beluga was so tame and they're rarely seen as far south. It was also wearing a harness, which had a mount for a camera, and bore the words, in English, \u201cEquipment St Petersburg\u201d.",
      "Mr Hesten helped to remove the harness from the whale, which then swam to the nearby port of Hammerfest, where it lived for several months.",
      "Seemingly unable to catch live fish to eat, it charmed visitors by nudging at their cameras and even on one occasion returning a mobile phone.",
      "\u201cIt was very obvious that this particular whale had been conditioned to be putting his nose on anything that looked like a target because he was doing it each time,\u201d says Eve Jourdain, a researcher from the Norwegian Orca Survey.",
      "\u201cBut we have no idea what kind of facility he was in, so we don\u2019t know what he was trained for.\u201d",
      "Captivated by the whale's story Norway made arrangements for the beluga to be monitored and fed. The name it was given \u2013 Hvaldimir - is a nod to hval which is Norwegian for whale, and the name of Russia's President, Vladimir Putin.",
      "Dr Shpak did not want to name her sources in Russia for their own safety but said she had been told that when the beluga surfaced in Norway, the Russian marine mammal community immediately identified it as one of theirs.",
      "\u201cThrough the chain of vets and trainers the message came back \u2013 that they were missing a beluga called Andruha,\u201d she says.",
      "According to Dr Shpak, Andruha/Hvaldimir had first been captured in 2013 in the Sea of Okhotsk in Russia's Far East. A year later it was moved from a facility owned by a dolphinarium in St Petersburg to the military programme in the Russian Arctic, where his trainers and vets remained in contact.",
      "\u201cI believe that when they started to work in open water, trusting this animal (not to swim away), the animal just gave up on them,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cWhat I've heard from the guys at the commercial dolphinarium who used to have him was that Andruha was smart, so a good choice to be trained. But at the same time, he was kind of like a hooligan - an active beluga - so they were not surprised that he gave up on (following) the boat and went where he wanted to.\u201d",
      "Satellite images from near the Russian naval base in Murmansk show what could have been Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s old home. Pens can clearly be seen in the water with what appear to be white whales inside.",
      "\u201cThe location of the beluga whales very close to the submarines and the surface vessels might tell us that they are actually part of a guarding system,\u201d says Thomas Nilsen, from Norwegian online newspaper The Barents Observer.",
      "Russia, for its part, has never officially addressed the claim that Hvaldimir/Andruha was trained by its army. But it does have a long history of training marine mammals for military purposes.",
      "Speaking in 2019, a Russian reserve colonel, Viktor Baranets, said: \"If we were using this animal for spying, do you really think we'd attach a mobile phone number with the message 'Please call this number'?\"",
      "Sadly, Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s incredible story does not have a happy ending.",
      "Having learned to feed himself, it spent several years travelling south along Norway\u2019s coast and in May 2023 was even spotted off the coast of Sweden.",
      "Then on September 1 2024 its body was found floating at sea, near the town of Risavika, on Norway's south-western coast.",
      "Had the long arm of Putin\u2019s Russia caught up with the reluctant beluga?",
      "It appears not. Despite some activist groups suggesting that the whale had been shot, that explanation has been dismissed by the Norwegian police.",
      "They say there was nothing to suggest that human activity directly caused the beluga\u2019s death. A post-mortem examination revealed that Hvaldimir/Andruha died after a stick became lodged in his mouth."

    "summary": "Gary O'Donoghue looks at Trump's \"trifecta\" of power, and how far it will help him keep his promises.",
    "story": [
      "On election night, Donald Trump repeated the phrase: \"Promises made, promises kept.\"",
      "Now, Republicans have officially taken control of Congress and his \"promises\" are a whole lot easier to keep.",
      "In Washington political parlance, it's called \"a governing trifecta\", when the president's party also controls both chambers of Congress - the House of Representatives and the Senate.",
      "That control is what Donald Trump's Republican Party now has.",
      "Single-party control was once common, but in recent decades it has become rarer and shorter.  Often, the party in power loses seats when midterm congressional elections roll around two years later.",
      "Both Trump and Joe Biden enjoyed trifectas for their first two years in the White House, but they also saw that having such control is no guarantee a president can get their way.",

      "When does he become president again?",
      "Who has Trump appointed to his top team so far?",
      "Why is Elon Musk Trump's efficiency tsar?",
      "In his first two years, Trump passed a signature tax bill - reducing corporate taxes from 35% to 21%, and cutting some taxes on individuals.",
      "But with some members of his own party resistant to his surprise ascent to the top in 2016, he struggled with other aims.",
      "His plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act (known as Obamacare) failed when a senator from his own party, John McCain, refused to vote for it. He also failed to pass an infrastructure bill as he had promised.",
      "In his first two years, when the Democrats controlled the House and the Senate, Biden succeeded in passing the American Rescue plan, the Investment and Jobs Act, and the Chips and Science Act. But he, too, had to significantly scale back his spending and investment plans - touted as the Build Back Better package - after opposition from one of his own senators.",
      "A major impediment to total control for either party is that Senate bills require a three-fifths majority, or 60 votes, to bypass the filibuster, which enables senators to delay legislation by keeping debate open-ended. That means that when a party has a simple majority in the Senate, it needs to reach across the aisle to get a bill passed.",
      "Even with a healthy majority in the Senate this time around, Trump will not have the magic 60 seats that would allow him to overcome opposition attempts to delay legislation.",
      "And on Wednesday, Republicans in the Senate selected John Thune as their majority leader over Florida's Rick Scott, the clear favourite in the Trump camp, in a sign some lawmakers may be reasserting their independence (Trump did not officially endorse Scott).",
      "That said, a trifecta, if astutely managed, does open the way for the possibility of major legislative initiatives.",
      "Trump's power advantage could be key in pushing through his big promises such as the largest deportation of migrants in history, sweeping tariffs on foreign imports, and the rolling back of environmental protections.",
      "Using legislation to achieve these ends will make such plans much harder to overturn in the courts - something Donald Trump was plagued by in his first term when he extensively used executive orders that were regularly and often successfully challenged.",
      "The judicial landscape also has changed in Trump's favour.",
      "The signature achievement of his first term was putting three conservatives on the Supreme Court - cementing a two-thirds majority for possibly decades to come.",
      "He also named more than four dozen judges to the federal appeals courts, flipping several circuits to a more conservative bent.",
      "The majority Republicans have in the Senate also provides a key advantage.",
      "Trump will be able to get his nominees for administration posts approved more easily, something he struggled with back in 2017 when internal resistance to him in the Republican Party was still significant.",
      "All this bodes for a busy and possibly turbulent next two years. But, as recent history indicates, these trifectas don't last all that long. The incoming administration will want to get a move on.",

It will mark the first time Tyson (50-6, 44 KOs) has entered the ring for a pro bout since retiring from the sport in 2005.",
      "Paul (10-1, 7 KOs) will be fighting for the third time in 2024 in what is easily his highest-profile bout to date. The match-up between the 58-year-old Tyson and 27-year-old Paul was initially scheduled for July 20 but was rescheduled to give Tyson time to recover from medical issues stemming from a stomach ulcer.",
      "Here's what you need to know about tonight's big fight, including when and how to watch.",
      "What time is the Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul fight tonight?",
      "The Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul televised fight card\u00a0began at 8 p.m. ET (5\u00a0p.m. PT) on Netflix. There will be three professional boxing fights before Tyson and Paul enter the ring.

      "How many rounds will the Tyson vs. Paul fight have?",
      "The Tyson-Paul fight is scheduled for eight, two-minute rounds. That's slightly shorter than the typical three-minute rounds most professional men's boxing fights are scheduled for. Both men will also wear heavier boxing gloves than heavyweights often do, sporting 14-ounce gloves versus the traditional 10-ounce versions.",
      "How to watch the Tyson vs. Paul fight",
      "The Tyson vs. Paul fight will be broadcast live on Netflix and will be free for subscribers.",
      "What is Mike Tyson's boxing background?",
      "Mike Tyson is one of the most famous \u2014 and infamous \u2014 boxers in sports history. A Hall of Fame inductee, Tyson burst onto the world stage in the 1980s when he became the youngest heavyweight champion in boxing history. Combining speed and power, Tyson possessed an uncanny ability to intimidate opponents before they even entered the ring. He won his first world title in 1986 and became the undisputed champion in the years that followed. He lost his belts to Buster Douglas in 1990 in one of the biggest upsets in sports history and was incarcerated on a rape conviction from 1992 to 1995.",
      "Tyson won the World Boxing Council (WBC) and World Boxing Association (WBA) titles upon his return to the ring in the mid-1990s but then lost to Evander Holyfield in a major upset in November 1996. A highly-anticipated rematch between the two in June 1997 led to Tyson getting disqualified after he bit off a chunk of Holyfield's ear.",
      "His subsequent performances in the ring after that were largely overshadowed by bizarre antics both during the fight and in between matches. He lost his final title fight against then-heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis in June 2002 and he retired following consecutive knockout losses to other opponents in 2004 and 2005. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. He last fought in an exhibition (non-professional) match against former champion Roy Jones Jr. in November 2020.",
      "What is Jake Paul's boxing background?",
      "Jake Paul was best known as a popular YouTuber and former Disney star before he decided to become a professional boxer in 2020. He fought his second professional fight on the undercard of Tyson's fight against Jones but has since promoted himself to main event status. Loquacious and promotable, Paul currently has 27 million followers on Instagram, 18.2 million followers on TikTok and 4.6 million on X.",
      "He's been able to morph that social media success into the boxing ring, entering tonight's fight with just a single loss against 10 wins, with seven of those victories via knockout. The lone loss came against undefeated Tommy Fury, the younger brother of former undisputed heavyweight champion Tyson Fury (who, ironically, was named after Paul's opponent tonight).",
      "Who do experts predict will win the Tyson vs. Paul fight?",
      "Expert predictions for tonight's match-up vary. Former opponents Lewis and Jones are both predicting a Tyson victory as is his namesake, Tyson Fury. Former boxing champion Oscar De La Hoya also likes Tyson but former heavyweight champ Anthony Joshua is going with Paul as is Paul's brother, Logan. Oddsmakers have had Paul as the slight favorite but the betting line has been moving more toward Tyson throughout fight week, according to ESPN.",

That bout lasted less than two minutes, with Tyson knocking out the previously undefeated Spinks in 91 seconds.",

      "PREFACE",
      "Los Angeles, Summer 1956",
      "Staring at the television open-mouthed, I let my peanut butter and jelly sandwich drop onto the plate in my lap as chills ran up and down my body.",
      "Home alone after school, I was sitting cross-legged (my favorite position, still) on the floor in front of the TV enjoying the peace and quiet and watching my favorite show, American Bandstand. \"And now, ladies and gentlemen, Ray Charles,\" Dick Clark announced as the camera panned to a handsome man in sunglasses sitting at a piano.",
      "\"Georgia, Georgia . . . ,\" he began, and I burst into tears. I couldn't believe he was singing a song about my mom. As tears dripped onto my sandwich, I'd never felt more connected to anything in my life. Ray Charles's voice and the melody seemed to express exactly how I felt.",
      "It took me weeks to get over seeing him sing, and in some ways, I never did, but then someone whose songs I first heard on the radio blew a hole in my understanding of the world and I was never, ever the same. As I stared at the TV with my mom watching The Ed Sullivan Show, a popular young singer named Elvis Presley filled the screen. Mom and I were two of the sixty million Americans who witnessed that historic performance in September 1956.",
      "Even though Elvis was dressed quite traditionally that Sunday night, he looked and moved differently than any performer I'd ever seen. He began by singing \"Don't Be Cruel,\" and by the time he broke into \"Love Me Tender,\" I felt as if he was singing only to me. I wanted to jump right into the TV and be Elvis.",
      "When I heard a year later that he was giving a concert at the Pan-Pacific Auditorium in Los Angeles, I rushed home with stars in my eleven-year-old eyes. \"Mom, Mom! Elvis is going to be at the Pan-Pacific! Can we go? . . . Please?\" I was convinced that I had to be there. Secretly, I thought that he would spot me in the crowd and pick me, although I'm sure that's what every girl thought.",
      "Luckily for me, my thirty-one-year-old mother was as crazy about Elvis as I was, a fact that impressed my friends because their moms didn't approve of his raw sexuality. To this day I don't know where she found the money, but somehow Georgia did. Mom and I dressed up and made our way into town, more like sisters than mother and daughter. Feeling the tension grow the closer we got to the Fairfax District, we soon found ourselves caught up in a pulsing mob of nine thousand noisy girls.",
      "We were swept inside the auditorium on a wave of pure adrenaline. Our folding seats were about halfway back in the audience, but that was fine by me. Looking around at all the girls gazing in anticipation at the darkened stage, I could feel my heart pounding inside my flat little chest\u2014a sensation I was to become all too familiar with later in life.",
      "The stage was dark, but when the spotlights hit him, Elvis was there and he was magic. There was a roar from the crowd that was like nothing I had ever heard. An explosion of flashbulbs went off. I only wished I'd brought our little Kodak Brownie. Elvis was standing there in his famous gold suit, which was shimmering and changing color in the spotlights.",
      "He was so handsome with that amazing smile and lustrous black hair, exactly the same color as mine. Everyone around us jumped to their feet and started screaming so hysterically that we could hardly hear a word of \"Heartbreak Hotel.\" But, boy, we could see his moves\u2014the way he gyrated his hips and shook his legs so that they quivered. Not content with making as much noise as they could, the girls began jumping up onto their chairs for a better view, which meant that from then on, we could only see Elvis's head and shoulders.",
      "Being in the middle of that shrieking crowd was like being caught up in a massive swivel-hipped tidal wave, swept along with the hysteria toward the stage. I had no idea why everyone was acting so insane. I was too young to get that part of it, truthfully (but if I had been three years older and my mom had been three years younger, we would have fainted). It was the most exciting experience I'd ever had because I knew that I wanted to be on that stage in the spotlight one day too.",
      "When I looked over at my mother, she was down for the count. We were both mesmerized. She looked so beautiful dressed in some amazing outfit that of all the girls in the place, including me, I felt sure that Elvis would have picked her.",
      "Pressing my mouth to her ear so that she could hear, I cupped my hand over it and yelled, \"Mom, can we stand on our seats and scream, too?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" she replied, grinning like a teenager and taking off her high heels. \"Come on, let's do it!\" So we did, straining on our tip-toes to see him.",
      "Glowing with happiness, I tried to work out if Elvis would be too old to marry me by the time I was grown, so that he could sing to me every day. Dreaming of being Mrs. Presley, I couldn't stop talking to Mom about Elvis for weeks as I floated around on a gold lam\u00e9 cloud.",

      "TMZ Sports obtained the document on Tuesday. Valenzuela died on Oct. 22 at age 63, a few weeks after stepping away from his job on the Dodgers' Spanish-language television broadcast and days before the Dodgers began their run to the team's eighth World Series championship. No cause of death was provided at the time.",
      "The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's office listed septic shock as the immediate cause of death. It is a life-threatening condition that occurs when organs malfunction, leading to dangerously low blood pressure. Each year, at least 350,000 people in the U.S. die of the condition, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The medical examiner listed decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis cirrhosis as underlying causes. Also listed as a significant condition contributing to Valenzuela's death was \"probable\" Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rapidly progressive brain disorder.",
      "The document also shows Valenzuela was cremated. A public Mass was held last week at Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in downtown Los Angeles.",
      "He was a native of Etchohauquila, Sonora, Mexico and known affectionately to fans across the baseball world as \"El Toro.\"",
      "The man behind \"Fernandomania,\" which took Los Angeles by storm during the 1980s, spent 11 of his 17 seasons in Major League Baseball with the Dodgers, leading them to a World Series title in 1981."

      "The honorees rose to the top in voting by a panel of experts and the public from among 12 finalists. This year's field included: the party game Apples to Apples, balloons, \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" gamebooks, Hess Toy Trucks, Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game, remote-controlled vehicles, Sequence, the stick horse and trampoline.",
      "\"These are three very deserving toys that showcase the wide range of how people play,\" Christopher Bensch, vice president for collections and chief curator, said in a statement. \"But for My Little Pony in particular, this year is extra validating. The beloved toy was a finalist seven times before finally crossing the finish line!\"",

      "Regular new Transformers characters keep collectors coming back, Bensch said, \"but the toys are also popular because they are so suited to the ways kids play. The toy line feeds kids' imaginations and fantasy play.\"",
      "Phase 10",
      "Also inducted was Phase 10, which was introduced by inventor and entrepreneur\u00a0Ken Johnson\u00a0in 1982.

      "Anyone can nominate a toy for the Hall of Fame. Museum staff narrows the field to 12 finalists each year. Fans can cast votes online for their favorites and their results are counted alongside ballots from a national advisory committee of historians, educators and others with industry expertise.",

    "title": "Women suing over Idaho abortion ban said they felt like \"medical refugees\"",
    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 15:45:31 -0500",
    "summary": "One couple took out a loan to cover the out-of-network costs of an abortion and drove eight hours to a hospital in the neighboring state.",
    "story": [
      "Four women suing over Idaho's strict abortion ban told a judge Tuesday how excitement over their pregnancies turned to grief and fear after they learned their fetuses were not likely to survive to birth \u2014 and how they had to leave the state to get abortions amid fears that pregnancy complications would put their own health in danger.",
      "\"We felt like we were being made refugees, medical refugees,\" said Jennifer Adkins, one of the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "The women, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, aren't asking for the state's abortion ban to be overturned. Instead, they want the judge to clarify and expand the exceptions to the strict ban so that people facing serious pregnancy complications can receive abortions before they are at death's door.",
      "Currently, the state's near-total ban makes performing an abortion a felony at any stage of pregnancy unless it is \"necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\"",
      "Adkins' fetus had a severe medical condition that meant the fetus would not survive the pregnancy. The illness also put Adkins at risk of developing \"mirror syndrome,\" a dangerous syndrome that can cause fatally high blood pressure and other issues, she said.",
      "Adkins and her husband, John, decided to seek an abortion, and learned, after another ultrasound showed the fetus still had a heartbeat, that they would have to go out of state to get one.",
      "Idaho law prohibits a woman from getting an abortion when a fetal heartbeat is detected, with the exception of cases of rape, incest or a \"medical emergency,\" defined by the law as \"a condition that, in reasonable medical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\"",
      "\"No parent wants to wish that when they look at an ultrasound they don't see their baby's heartbeat, yet here I was hoping that I wouldn't,\" Adkins said. \"I wanted the decision to be made for us, and I wanted to end her suffering, so it was really hard to see that and know that we had the challenges ahead of us that we did.\"",
      "\"I was not willing to watch my son suffer\"",
      "Kayla Smith cried as she told the judge how she found out she was pregnant for a second time on Mother's Day of 2022, and how she and her husband chose the name \"Brooks\" for their son. She was around 18 or 20 weeks along in her pregnancy when the sonographer grew quiet during a routine anatomy scan, Smith said.",
      "Brooks' heart had fatal anomalies, and the young family could not find a pediatric cardiologist willing to attempt an operation. The veins supplying Brooks' lungs were also abnormal, Smith said, and he would not survive birth.",
      "Smith had developed dangerously high blood pressure during a previous pregnancy, and she was at risk of developing the condition called preeclampsia again.",
      "\"If I were to continue pregnancy not only would I risk my life with preeclampsia, I was not willing to watch my son suffer and potentially gasp for air,\" Smith said, crying.",
      "Idaho's abortion ban went into effect two days before Brooks' diagnosis, she said, making it impossible for her to get an abortion in her home state.",
      "\"We wanted to meet our son \u2014 that was really important to us \u2014 so we needed to do it in a hospital,\" she said.",
      "They took out a loan to cover the estimated $16,000 to $20,000 out-of-network cost for the procedure and drove more than eight hours to a hospital where doctors induced labor.",
      "\"All four of these women were overjoyed to be pregnant with their second child and all four of them received the worst news a mother can imagine,\" attorney Gail Deady, with the Center for Reproductive Rights, told 4th District Judge Jason D. Scott during opening arguments. All of them sought abortions \"to protect their health, to spare their babies from pain and suffering, and to remain alive and healthy to protect their young children.\"",
      "James Craig, a division chief with the Idaho Attorney General's office, said the women and their attorneys are relying on hypotheticals rather than concrete facts to make their case. Under their proposal, a pregnant woman could receive her abortion for something as minor as stepping on a rusty nail \u2014 even though the risk of infection in that scenario could be easily treated by receiving a tetanus booster shot, Craig said.",
      "\"Unborn children have a fundamental right to life, and protecting the lives of children is a legitimate and fundamental government interest,\" Craig said.",
      "The state also has the same interest in protecting the lives of women, Craig said \u2014 and the abortion ban laws do both, he contended.",
      "In the \"rare circumstances where abortion is necessary\" to prevent the death of the mother, Idaho law allows that to occur, Craig said. The women suing are trying to \"usurp the role of the Legislature\" by asking the judge to rewrite the law, he said, and that is not the proper role of the court.",
      "Dr. Emily Corrigan, an ob-gyn who works in emergency medicine at Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center who is also a plaintiff in the case, told the judge how Idaho's multiple abortion bans have created confusion for physicians and made it difficult to treat pregnant patients who need emergency care.",
      "Doctors have had to \"basically guess which pregnancy conditions would fall under the state medical exception,\" Corrigan said.",
      "\"I have had other hospital staff refuse to participate in the care of my patients because of the lack of understanding of the laws, and this has caused patient care delays,\" she said. \"I have personally cared for several patients who have been denied stabilizing abortion care at other hospitals in Idaho. By the time they arrive at my institution, their conditions have deteriorated and have lead to increased complications that I need to manage.\"",
      "Several conditions can put the health of pregnant people at risk, she said. Some are caused by pregnancy like preeclampsia, and others \u2014 including some chronic illnesses and cancers \u2014 can be made worse by pregnancy, she said. In those cases, delaying an abortion might not cause immediate death but can cause a shortened life span or have dramatic effects on a person's health, Corrigan said.",
      "\"We are not trained to wait until things become urgent or emergent. We are trained to prevent harm to our patients,\" she said.",

      "The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission on Thursday issued an urgent warning about portable adult bed rails, saying the devices are behind the suffocation deaths of 18 people since 2021.",
      "The agency's safety alert coincided with the ninth recall of portable bed rails in three years. Medical King of Brooklyn, New York, is recalling about 220,000 adult portable bed rails due to entrapment and asphyxia risks. The recall follows the death of a 66-year-old man who became trapped between a mattress and a bed rail in November at a residential care facility in South Carolina.",
      "The recall involves three models of Medical King Bed Assist Rail with Adjustable Heights (model numbers 7007 and 7057) and the Bed Assist Rail Without Legs (model number 7037). The recalled rails sold online for about $40 on Amazon.com, eBay, Kohls.com, medicalkingusa.com and Target Plus from January 2020 through March 2024.",
      "People who purchased the products, which are made in China, should stop using them and contact Medical King for a repair kit or replacement bed rail, depending on the model.",
      "Medical King can be reached at 888-334-1142 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, Monday through Friday. To register for a repair kit, go to\u00a0https://medicalkingusa.com/products/recalls\u00a0or\u00a0https://medicalkingusa.com\u00a0and click on \"Register Here.\"",
      "The recall is the ninth issued by the CPSC in the last three years. The recalls and two product warnings impacted more than 3 million units and are associated with serious injuries from head, neck or chest entrapment and 18 deaths, the federal agency stated.",
      "CPSC data shows that 92% of fatalities associated with adult portable bed rails are from entrapment, usually of the head or neck.",
      "The agency issued new mandatory safety standards for adult portable bed rails in January 2023.",
      "Often purchased for sick or frail older people, the side rails or metal bars are used on hospital beds and in home care with the idea of helping patients pull themselves up or to keep them from falling out of bed. But these products \u2014 which are marketed as safety devices and sold by retailers including\u00a0Amazon\u00a0and\u00a0Walmart, as well as by\u00a0medical supply\u00a0stores \u2014 have shown to be unsafe for many, with thousands of elderly and disabled patients injured by them.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 10:11:06 -0500",
    "summary": "Allowing enhanced subsidies for health insurance bought through ACA marketplaces to expire would cause premiums to soar, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "With Republicans edging closer to gaining control of Congress, millions of Americans may be at risk of losing enhanced subsidies that currently underwrite the cost of health insurance bought through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces, according to industry experts and the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The November 5 election gave control of the Senate to Republicans, while control of the House remains in limbo Monday as votes in several critical races continue to be tallied. Currently, Democrats are projected to win at least 210 House seats and Republicans 215 seats, with a party needing 218 seats in order to have the majority.",
      "If Republicans gain control of Congress, they are widely expected to allow the enhanced ACA subsidies to expire at the end of 2025, depriving many people who buy coverage through the ACA and who currently receive these subsidies of that financial assistance, according to health care policy experts.",
      "So-called enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which lower the cost of health plans for millions of Americans and were passed under the Biden administration, will expire unless lawmakers renew them. During his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump backed efforts by Republican lawmakers to repeal the ACA, but hasn't yet revealed his plans for the program, commonly known as Obamacare, for his second term in office.",
      "Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a campaign stop last week just before the Nov. 5 election that \"the ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we've got a lot of ideas on how to do that.\"",
      "Who is eligible for enhanced ACA subsidies?",
      "Americans with incomes over 400% of poverty \u2014 those who make just above four times the poverty level, or $103,280 for a family of four \u2014 are eligible for the enhanced ACA insurance subsidies. They also increase financial help for those who were already eligible for assistance under the ACA.",
      "KFF, an independent health policy nonprofit, estimates\u00a0the subsidies have cut premiums for eligible enrollees by 44%, or $705 annually. The organization says that if the tax credit expires, average premiums for subsidized enrollees in 12 states would at least double.",
      "In 2024, of the 21.6 million Americans who purchased health insurance plans from ACA marketplaces, 20.1 million received enhanced subsidies,\u00a0according\u00a0to the CBO.",
      "People most at risk of losing ACA coverage if the enhanced subsidies lapse are those who live in states where health insurance premiums are particularly high, including in rural parts of the U.S. Middle-income households that depend on the enhanced subsidies could see a sharp rise in premiums, Cynthia Cox, vice president and ACA policy researcher at KFF, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"They could go from paying no more than 8.5% of their income to easily paying 20% or more,\" she said. \"I imagine a lot of those folks would drop coverage.\"",
      "Without enhances subsidies, many middle income ACA Marketplace enrollees with incomes just above four times poverty would be priced out of health insurance coverage, according to Cox.",
      "Subsidies remain for 2025",
      "Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at\u00a0healthinsurance.org, noted that 93% of people who buy health insurance through ACA marketplaces receive enhanced subsidies. A sharp increase in their premiums would lead many to drop their coverage, leaving them uninsured, she said.",
      "The CBO\u00a0estimates\u00a0that 22.8 million total Americans will enroll in ACA marketplace health insurance plans in 2025. The agency expects enrollment to drop sharply, from 22.8 million to 18.9 million, in 2026 if the subsidies are not renewed. By 2030, enrollment could dip to 15.4 million people without the enhanced subsidies.",
      "For now, the subsidy enhancements will remain in place through the end of 2025.",
      "\"If people are signing up now during open enrollment, their coverage will take effect in January, and it will cover them for the whole year. Their premiums won't change \u2014 they're good for 2025,\" Norris said.",
      "The enhanced subsidies, which were first passed in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, will have been in place for roughly five years when they expire in 2025, or about half as long as the ACA marketplace has existed, Cox said.",
      "Enrollment in ACA plans has roughly doubled since the enhance subsidies have been in place, she noted, with most of that growth coming from low-income enrollees. \"That's one group you might expect to see, if they have to start making a higher premium payments, would drop their coverage,\" she said.",
      "Making the enhanced subsidies permanent would cost $335 billion over 10 years,\u00a0according to\u00a0the CBO.",

      "A deadly E. coli outbreak linked to slivered onions on McDonald's Quarter Pounder burgers has sickened 104 people in 14 states, federal health officials said in an update on Wednesday.",
      "At least 34 people have been hospitalized, and four developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a serious condition that can cause kidney failure. An 88-year-old man who resided in Grand Junction, Colorado, died, as previously reported. The illnesses began at the end of September, and the most recent onset of illness occurred as of October 21, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.",

      "The hamburger chain pulled the burgers from restaurants in several states after the outbreak was announced.",
      "The FDA and Colorado officials have collected onion and environmental samples from McDonald's stores and distribution centers. One sample of recalled onions tested positive for E. coli, but did not match the outbreak strain.",
      "Onion supplier Taylor Farms recalled yellow onions in the wake of the outbreak, and McDonald's has reintroduced slivered onions from a different supplier.",
      "\"There does not appear to be a continued food safety concern related to this outbreak at McDonald's restaurants,\" the FDA stated.",

      "\"Over the past week, these restaurants resumed the sale of Quarter Pounder burgers with slivered onions,\" McDonald's said.",

    "summary": "Overdose deaths have slowed 18% since a peak last year, the CDC estimates.",
    "story": [
      "Opioid overdose deaths have now slowed to the lowest levels nationwide since 2020, according to new estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This marks the 12th straight month of decline since a peak last year.",
      "Around 70,655 deaths linked to opioids like heroin and fentanyl were reported for the year ending June 2024, the CDC now estimates, falling 18% from the same time in 2023.",
      "Almost all states, except for a handful in the West from Alaska through Nevada, are now seeing a significant decrease in overdose death rates. Early data from Canada also suggests overdose deaths there might now be slowing off of a peak in 2023 too.",
      "\"While these data are cause for optimism, we must not lose sight of the fact that nearly 100,000 people are still estimated to be dying annually from drug overdose in the U.S.\" said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, in a statement.",
      "Other types of drug overdoses beyond opioids are also slowing. While they make up a smaller share of overall deaths, overdoses linked to drugs like methamphetamine and cocaine are also showing signs of dropping nationwide following a peak last year.",
      "\"We are encouraged by this data, but boy, it is time to double down on the things that we know are working. It is not a time to pull back, and I feel very strongly, and our data shows, that the threat continues to evolve,\" Dr. Allison Arwady, head of the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, told CBS News.",
      "Arwady pointed to a long list of factors that officials hope are contributing to the decline, ranging from broader availability of the overdose reversing spray naloxone, also known as Narcan, to efforts to ease gaps in access to medications that can treat opioid use disorder.",
      "Trends in what health officials call \"primary prevention\" have also improved in recent years \u2014 meaning fewer people using the drugs to begin with. As an example, Arwady cited CDC surveys showing a clear decline in high school students reporting that they have tried illegal drugs.",
      "The CDC and health departments have also gotten faster at gathering and analyzing data to respond to surges in overdoses, Arwady said, often caused by new so-called \"adulterants\" that are mixed in. Health authorities study this by testing blood and drug samples taken in the wake of surges, in search of potential emerging drug threats.",
      "Agency researchers are now looking closer at what could be behind gaps in communities that are still not seeing slowdowns, Arwady said.",
      "\"Unfortunately, for the most affected groups, namely Native Americans and Black American men, the death rates are not decreasing and are at the highest recorded levels,\" said Volkow.",
      "Why are drug overdose deaths declining?",
      "In the months since CDC data first began showing real signs of a nationwide change to the deadly record wave of opioid overdose deaths, experts have floated a number of theories to explain what caused the change.",
      "\"We had been seeing the numbers go down, on the national aggregate level, since last April, and we were skeptical and kind of holding our tongues. Then we started hearing from a lot of folks on the ground, frontline providers,'\" said Nabarun Dasgupta, a senior scientist at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill who studies opioid overdose deaths.",
      "Dasgupta led an analysis in September by the university's Opioid Data Lab illustrating the nationwide scope of the downturn and probing a number of theories that might explain it.",
      "Some explanations they dismissed as unlikely, like stepped-up law enforcement operations. Other ideas they judged as plausible, but complicated to prove, like a so-called \"depletion of susceptibles\" \u2014 essentially the epidemic burning itself out, as users either found ways to survive the influx of fentanyl or died \u2014 or the wider availability of naloxone.",
      "Dasgupta said they received a flood of interest since their initial post proposing more theories, like new scanners that were deployed on the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "There are likely a number of factors all playing a role in the shift, Dasgupta says. But he said early data from research they are wrapping up now supports one leading explanation: a shift in the illegal drug supply.",
      "\"Our hypothesis is that something has changed in the drug supply. This kind of pronounced shift, something that happens suddenly, if numbers had suddenly shot up, we would definitely be pointing to a change in the drug supply to explain it,\" said Dasgupta.",
      "Amid its downsides, xylazine's rise might have led to less injection drug use, they speculate. Its longer high could also be reducing the number of times people use fentanyl each day.",
      "\"We're not in our offices celebrating. We're still losing too many people that we love. So I just want it to be very clear that with like a hundred thousand people still dying, that's obscenely high,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has outlined a number of promises to \"Make America Healthy Again\" under President-elect Donald Trump, vowing to combat an \"epidemic\" of chronic diseases that he has described as an \"existential\" threat to America's future.",
      "All are under the banner of fighting what Kennedy sees as a common thread behind a broad swath of ailments: that Americans have been \"mass poisoned by big pharma and big food,\" and that federal agencies have failed to stop it. In response, he has also floated a number of specific policy ideas to remake the federal government's public health institutions.",
      "\"[Trump] asked me to end the chronic disease epidemic in this country. And he said, I want to see results, measurable results in the diminishment of chronic disease within two years. And I said, Mr. President, I will do that,\" Kennedy said on Nov. 2.",
      "Authority for a MAHA agenda",
      "Kennedy's allies say Trump's election is also a mandate for their platform of health proposals, which they say delivered key votes for the president-elect. Trump has promised to let Kennedy \"go wild\" on health issues.",
      "\"The American people re-elected President Trump by resounding margins because they trust his judgement and support his policies, including his promise to Make America Healthy Again alongside well-respected leaders like RFK Jr.,\" Karoline Leavitt, Trump-Vance Transition spokeswoman, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "Some ideas in Kennedy's wide-ranging platform have evolved since his original longshot\u00a0presidential campaign. He has acknowledged Trump does not agree with him on every policy.",
      "The president-elect has listed oil and gas as one off-limits issue for Kennedy. In the past, Kennedy has been critical of \"big oil\" and natural gas, over the fatal toll of fossil fuel pollution and climate change.",
      "Several of Kennedy's ideas would require presidential or congressional action to implement, though it is possible that they could be supercharged by emergency powers.",
      "\"I'm going to urge President Trump on day one to do the same thing they did in COVID, which is to declare a national emergency, but not for infectious disease, but for chronic disease,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 26.",
      "Staff changes at federal agencies",
      "Kennedy claims a number of health issues have worsened due to federal inaction, including autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, sleep disorders, infertility rates, diabetes and obesity.",
      "He aims to address that by replacing many staff throughout the agencies, which Kennedy has accused of being too sympathetic to large food and drug companies. As a co-chair of Trump's transition, Kennedy has been vetting a slate of staffers who could fill top positions throughout the Trump administration.",
      "Kennedy has said Trump tasked him with returning agencies \"to their rich tradition of gold-standard, evidence-based science.\" He has also said \"medical expertise\" is not the priority for all staff picks.",
      "\"What we don't really need at HHS is more medical expertise. What we need is an expertise on decoupling the agency from institutional corruption. Because it's the corruption that has distorted the science,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",
      "Kennedy has said he hopes \"to have every nutritional scientist\" across the Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture \"fired on Day One.\"",
      "Kennedy himself has been floated to head the Department of Health and Human Services, though some allies say he could be more effective in a \"czar\" type role out of the White House.",
      "\"Get the chemicals out\" of food",
      "When talking about his platform, Kennedy often lampoons products like McDonald's French fries or Fruit Loops cereal as examples of how foods sold in the U.S. are made with ingredients that are banned or discouraged abroad, or have changed for the worse.",
      "\"It's easy to fix. We have a thousand ingredients in our foods that are illegal in Italy and other countries in Europe,\" he said on Oct. 29.",
      "Trump agrees with his plans to \"get the chemicals out\" of America's food supply, Kennedy says, which also includes upending the use of common pesticides and herbicides by American farmers.",
      "Kennedy has described the food in the U.S. as \"just poison,\" citing his own anecdotal experience with his son struggling with eczema while eating pasta in the U.S.",
      "\"When he ate any kind of pasta in this country, he would get these terrible, terrible outbreaks, you know, really agonizing. And he moved to Italy and he lived off of pasta for a year and a half and he never got a case,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 19.",
      "Kennedy suspects that was caused by glyphosate, used in Roundup brand weed-killers, which Italy moved to start restricting in 2016. Italy's decision was over worries that it could pose a cancer risk, and some advocacy groups in the U.S. have also voiced similar concerns.",
      "Agricultural trade associations have defended glyphosate as \"one of the safest, most effective\" tools farmers have to manage weeds and support \"important conservation practices.\"",
      "Kennedy's plea to crack down on food additives and chemicals comes as the FDA is in the middle of launching its own new effort \u2014 and is calling on Congress to step up funding for \u2014 scrutinizing chemicals currently allowed in foods.",
      "Food industry groups have generally voiced support for the FDA to step up its vetting of chemicals in food, in hopes that it \"negates the ill advised and disruptive state by state patchwork\" of legislatures drawing up their own restrictions.",
      "Reducing unhealthy and processed foods in federal programs",
      "Kennedy has also promised to \"get processed food out of school lunch immediately\" and voiced frustration over the amount of federal food assistance for low-income Americans that goes towards sugary drinks and processed food.",
      "One way Kennedy could try to get at this issue is through the federal dietary guidelines process, jointly run by the USDA and HHS, which is in the final stages of crafting the next edition of recommendations that influence a broad range of government nutrition programs.",
      "\"Kids shouldn't be eating grains. They should definitely not be eating seed oils. And they for sure should not be eating sugar. And yet that is what we're forcing them to eat,\" he said on Sept. 26.",
      "On seed oils, Kennedy has claimed that the switch away from oils like beef tallow which were high in saturated fats in favor of vegetable oils was a mistake, and is to blame for a rise in obesity rates. That puts him at odds with longstanding recommendations to limit saturated fats.",
      "\"The guidance around this has been reviewed many times since, and has only become stronger in its conclusion for the role of saturated fat, particularly in its relationship with higher risks of cardiovascular disease,\" Deirdre Tobias, a researcher on this year's Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, said last month.",
      "Grains have been more divisive at this year's committee and the broader scientific community, which has debated setting lower limits to overall grain consumption alongside recommendations to switch from refined to whole grains.",
      "Setting new limits is difficult, scientists on the panel have said, because the only source of some key nutrients for many Americans is cereals and breads fortified with vitamins.",
      "Kennedy has also been critical of the panel of outside researchers put together to create the scientific report underpinning the recommendations, but acknowledges broader changes will also be needed to move the needle.",
      "While Kennedy says he personally would \"never eat anything in a package\" as a rule of thumb, he acknowledges \"most people don't have access to the resources I have.\"",
      "\"We need to start forcing these companies to internalize their costs. So the illusion of cheap food goes away, right? Because if you're drinking Coke and it seems cheap and it gives you diabetes over the long run, that's not very cheap,\" he said on Sept. 30.",
      "Curbing the influence of drugmakers",
      "Kennedy has called for a \"review\" of guidelines that govern advertising by pharmaceutical companies.",
      "The FDA currently regulates advertising about prescription drugs, going after drugmakers that misrepresent their products. Responsibility for some other medical products is shared between the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "Kennedy has urged Trump to go further, saying he is advising the president-elect to \"ban pharmaceutical advertising on TV\" over concerns that it is influencing news coverage of health issues.",
      "He has also urged reform of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which charges pharmaceutical companies millions of dollars for the cost of the FDA vetting their applications to decide whether to approve new drugs.",
      "\"We need to end the corruption. 50% of FDA's budget comes not from the taxpayer, but from the pharmaceutical industry,\" he said on Sept. 26.",
      "Kennedy has not said how Congress or the Trump administration would make up the difference from the fees if they were cut, which amount to around $3 billion out of FDA's budget.",
      "Undoing the fees could leave taxpayers effectively subsidizing a hefty bill previously paid for by drugmakers \u2014 or a return to the significant delays for new medications that initially spurred the creation of the fees.",
      "Promoting alternatives to drugs",
      "Kennedy has accused the FDA of waging a \"war on public health\" which he says includes \"aggressive suppression\" of anything \"that advances human health and can't be patented by Pharma.\"",
      "In his view, that includes treatments like psychedelics, which recently fell short of FDA approval, and foods like raw milk, which officials have stepped up warnings against amid this year's unprecedented bird flu outbreak on dairy farms.",
      "Kennedy has also praised the dietary supplement industry for a court win against the FDA, after the agency tried to take action against what it said was an illegally marketed anti-aging drug.",
      "Also on Kennedy's list are things like \"clean foods\" and exercise, which he wants to allow Medicare and Medicaid to cover.",
      "The promise has echoes of the \"food is medicine\" initiative, which has called for the health care system to offer more financial support for healthier lifestyle habits.",
      "\"If a doctor's patient has diabetes or obesity, the doctor ought to be able to say, I'm going to recommend gym membership, and I'm going to recommend, good food and Medicaid ought to be able to finance those things the same as they would Ozempic,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",
      "Kennedy has also promised to promote healthier lifestyles in other ways, ranging from requiring nutrition classes in federally funded medical schools to reviving the presidential fitness test in schools.",
      "\"Informed choices\" on vaccines",
      "Kennedy has a long record criticizing the safety of vaccines, including recent misleading claims that shots have an \"exemption from pre-licensing safety testing\" before they are approved.",
      "In fact, the FDA requires new vaccines be studied for their safety and efficacy in large trials, results of which are published in peer-reviewed journals and publicly disclosed.",
      "His activism on the issue dates back decades, including a now-retracted article he published in Rolling Stone in 2005 claiming a link between autism and an ingredient called thimerosal that had been used in vaccines before 2001 \u2014 which medical research has disproven. His focus has broadened since then.",
      "\"This doesn't mean vaccines is the only cause of autism. Our kids today are swimming around in a toxic soup coming mainly from their foods that operate along the same biological pathways. But some of it's coming from pharmaceutical drugs,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 19.",
      "Kennedy has insisted that is not \"anti-vaccine\" and would not seek to ban them under Trump, instead saying he wants to \"restore the transparency\" around them \u2014 echoing lawsuits by the group he chaired, Children's Health Defense, over its Freedom of Information Act requests.",
      "\"[Trump] doesn't want me to take vaccines away from people. If you want to take a vaccine, you ought to be able to take it. We believe in free choice in this country. You ought to know the risks and benefits of everything you take,\" Kennedy said on Nov. 2.",
      "But Kennedy has also asserted \"there's no vaccine that is safe and effective,\" and encouraged people to \"resist\" CDC guidelines on vaccines for kids \u2014 raising concern among public health officials, who point to the success of vaccination in saving millions of children worldwide from debilitating illness or premature death from preventable diseases.",
      "Opposing water fluoridation",
      "Ahead of the election, Kennedy said one of Trump's first acts in the White House would be to \"advise all U.S. water systems to remove fluoride from public water.\"",
      "While a number of health risks have been tied to higher levels of fluoride, most are extremely rare in the U.S. and involve far greater exposure than what is added to drinking water.",
      "Fluoride has been incorporated into a majority of U.S. water systems for decades. The American Dental Association estimates that the practice has reduced tooth decay by about 25%, though some research suggests modern use of toothpaste with fluoride has reduced the policy's benefits.",
      "Kennedy's announcement does come as the Environmental Protection Agency is now under a federal court order to take action over one specific risk: the concern that fluoride might lower children's IQ \"at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States,\" stemming in large part from a report published by the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Beyond influencing what rule the Trump administration's EPA ends up pursuing in response to the order, Kennedy could also take aim at fluoride through another route: changing the CDC's widely-cited statement about the practice, which hails water fluoridation as one of the greatest \"public health achievements of the 20th century.\"",
      "Kennedy himself has described fluoride as \"a poison\" and praised the nonprofits for suing over the issue.",
      "\"The simple answer is I don't like it,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",

      "Efrati says they're inducing repair mechanisms in the body and brain inside these pressurized chambers, where it feels like you're scuba diving down to 30 feet. Patients breathe in pure oxygen, which under such high-pressure conditions the body can absorb at up to 16 times the normal level. Then, masks are removed for five-minute intervals.",

Another reported that PTSD remission lasted at least two years, which is higher than other established treatments. \"We want to evaluate everything objectively,\" said Efrati.",
      "It's conclusive enough for the Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, to ask Efrati's team to stop testing and start treating. The doctor says that while you can always ask for more data, \"You see the evidence in front of you.\"",
      "Shachar Mizrhai was one of those IDF veterans referred in 2018 for the initial clinical trial. He was a soldier during a 2014 Israeli offensive in Gaza and was in an armored vehicle when it was ambushed. In the short term, he was thinking about survival; the suffering came later. \"I can't sleep at night,\" he said. \"In the moment I put [on] the uniform, I feel like I want to die. I smell blood. I smell war.\"",
      "He'd tried drugs, therapy and sleeping pills. He contemplated suicide. \"Nothing really helped to get back to life,\" he said. \"And I heard that this might be help, and maybe this is my last chance before I finish my life.\"",
      "Dr. Keren Doenyas-Barak, who heads the PTSD program at the Sagol Center, followed Mizrhai through his 60 sessions, and showed us his brain scans from June 2018, and March 2019, highlighting activation of areas used to effectively regulate emotion, or process information. The later brain scan images were lighting up; that wasn't happening before the treatment.",
      "\"Many people tend to look at PTSD as a psychological phenomenon, not as a biological phenomenon,\" Doenyas-Barak said. \"So, we treat PTSD very similar to other brain conditions.\"",
      "For Mizrhai, the treatment changed everything:\" \"It's the first time that I was feeling again. I begin to sleep at night, I was less afraid. It's make me feel alive again. \u2026 I was a dying man, and after this, I'm a living man.\"",
      "North Carolina Republican Congressman and medical doctor Greg Murphy said, \"If it's being offered in Israel and they're getting such good results, why the hell are we not offering it in the United States?\"",
      "That's a question Murphy \u2013 a member of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs \u2013 is raising in the halls of Congress. One in 10 of his constituents is a veteran. \"I love our VA,\" he said. \"But we're not reaching a certain segment of our veterans if we're having 22 commit suicide every day. And if we're doing something and there is a treatment that has shown definitive results, I believe it's medical malpractice not to offer that to our veterans.\"",
      "In 2023 he introduced the Veterans' National Traumatic Injury Treatment Act. \"We just basically want the VA to do a pilot study within their own confines to see whether they show that hyperbaric oxygen works or not,\" he said.",
      "And what is he hearing from the VA? \"They just don't want to do anything; it's just hands up,\" he said. \"The reasons that we've heard is, 'Well, the results are mixed.' Fine. Look at the results in the last 15 years. Look at the studies in Israel. We are seeing an absolute effect in this, and other disorders, for Parkinson's, migraines, some even MS, neurological disorders.\"",
      "\"Sunday Morning\" requested an interview with the Department of Veterans Affairs, but they declined to comment.",
      "In Salt Lake City, Utah, we met Dr. Lin Weaver, who runs Hyperbaric Medicine at Intermountain Health. They treat about 20 patients a day, which puts into perspective the huge numbers - 350 daily \u2013 being treated in Israel. \u00a0He says they use their hyperbaric chambers for PTSD patients rarely, because it is expensive, but he has seen positive results: \"I've had patients that I've treated. Every one has got surprisingly better,\" Weaver said.",
      "But insurance companies say there is not enough proof it works for PTSD. And in the U.S., out-of-pocket costs soar above $50,000.",
      "\"What's necessary is like a drug trial,\" Weaver said. \"But these trials take years to accomplish. It all rests with, 'Is there an initiative? And is there a funding source?'\"",
      "Doane asked, \"But if doctors like you feel so strongly that this works, why isn't there enough push coming from folks like you to say, 'Prove this'?\"",
      "\"Well, believe me, we've tried,\" Weaver replied. \"I have submitted proposals to extramural funding agencies. So far, they haven't accepted them.\"",
      "Doane asked Dr. Efrati, \"You are out on the frontier here of medicine. Is there a danger in that?\"",
      "\"As a scientist, I will always tell you I need more study, I need more data,\" he replied. \"But as a physician, when I'm sitting in front of you looking at your eyes, you have a problem now. This is our job as a physician.\"",
      "Idit Negrin says this treatment is giving her hope she can move past that nightmare at the Nova Music Festival. She hopes, with the therapy, she can move on with her life.",
      "But she wears a reminder \u2013 a Nova necklace \u2013 while she gets treatment. \"I don't get her off my neck,\" she said.",
      "Her progress is motivation for Dr. Efrati to keep innovating, thinking about the future so his patients can process the past.",
      "Doane said, \"Some people are gonna listen to this and say it sounds too good to be true.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I know,\" said Negrin. \"But it's fact.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 18:31:51 -0500",
    "summary": "Americans looking to purchase EVs may want to do so quickly, as the incoming administration is likely to axe a $7,500 tax credit.",
    "story": [
      "With President-elect Donald Trump vowing to pull the plug on the $7,500 tax credit for buyers of electric vehicles, one EV maker and its billionaire owner are fully behind the idea and even stand to profit from it.",
      "\"Take away the subsidies, it will only help Tesla,\" Tesla owner Elon Musk posted in July on X, the social media platform he owns.",
      "The credit granted to buyers of EVs helped make the case for buying the climate-friendlier vehicles, and when an earlier version of the tax credit was done away with several years ago, Tesla cut prices on its cars by about half of the credit its buyers were no longer receiving.",
      "Tesla is the sole automaker to be generating a profit on its U.S. sales. Manufacturing EVs is a losing proposition for Big Three vehicle makers like Ford and General Motors, who sell a fraction of EVs compared with Tesla.",
      "Once the EV tax credit is vanquished, the price of EVs overall might drop, cutting into Tesla's profits, as opposed to increasing the company's red ink as it could for legacy automakers still working to get a firmer footing in the EV market. Should traditional automakers scale back on their EV production and sales to curtail the losses, EV shoppers would have even fewer options, benefiting Tesla.",
      "As Musk touted his support for axing the EV tax credit, Tesla's auto industry rivals signaled the opposite.",
      "The Alliance for Automotive Innovation urged that the tax credit continue, telling lawmakers in an October letter that U.S. manufacturers count on it as they vie with Chinese EV production. Around the world, vehicle makers have poured billions into transitioning to electric cars.",
      "Further, the Zero Emission Transportation Association on Friday called on Trump to reconsider, saying the tax credit has bolstered employment in states that voted Republican, including Ohio, Kentucky, Michigan and Georgia.",
      "\"If the United States is going to continue to fight to bring those jobs here and actually compete to win against China, there needs to be a demand signal \u2014 like the New Clean Vehicle Tax Credit \u2014 aligned with that goal, otherwise we would be undercutting those investments and hurting American job growth,\" ZETA Executive Director Albert Gore stated on Friday.",
      "\"The potential elimination of the federal tax credit for electric vehicles by the Trump administration \u2014 without another form of incentive to replace it \u2014 could derail the trajectory of EV sales in the United States,\" offered Edmunds analysts.",
      "Trump repeatedly vowed to eliminate what he labeled President Joe Biden's \"EV mandate\" as he campaigned for the White House.",
      "While there is no such mandate in federal law, the Inflation Reduction Act passed during President Biden's term revived the credit for many EV purchases, while also granting low interest loans to manufacturers constructing EV and battery plants.",
      "Trump's transition team intends to knock out the credit as part of a broader tax-reform measure, according to a Thursday report by Reuters, which cited two sources with direct knowledge of the matter.",
      "The president-elect during his first term attempted to repeal the EV tax credit, which was expanded by President Biden in 2022.",
      "Analysts who track Tesla concurred with Musk's view that the credit's demise would only help his company.",
      "\"This is a clear negative for the EV industry at first look and would particularly hurt GM, Ford, Stellantis and Rivian,\" wrote Wedbush Securities tech analyst Daniel Ives. Conversely, \"this will enable Tesla to further fend off competition from Detroit as pricing/scale/scope is an apples-to-oranges when compared to the rest of the auto industry once the EV tax credit disappears.\"",
      "Americans looking to buy an electric car should do so sooner rather than later, advised Ivan Drury, Edmunds' director Insights.",
      "\"The federal tax credit combined with slashed prices due to slowed sales momentum has contributed to electric vehicles becoming labeled as some of the best deals on the market in 2024. Now, with production cuts shrinking supply and a fresh wave of demand from those seeking a deal while they still can, it can be all but assured that the price for that EV you've been eyeing is going up in the coming months,\" Drury stated.",

    "summary": "The Social Security Fairness Act, which would increase benefits for 2.8 million retirees, has bipartisan support but time running out.",
    "story": [
      "Efforts to get the Senate to vote on a bill to expand Social Security benefits are intensifying, as the House-passed Social Security Fairness Act enjoys rare bipartisan support but has only a short window of time \u2014 six weeks \u2014 to be passed.",
      "\"We're guardedly optimistic,\" Shannon Benton executive director of The Senior Citizens League, or TSCL, an advocacy group devoted to protecting retirement benefits, said. \"There is so much momentum, if it doesn't get passed now, a lot of people will lose hope.\"",
      "Decades in the making, the legislation would eliminate a provision that reduces Social Security payments to some retirees who also collect a pension from jobs that aren't covered by the retirement program, such as state and federal workers including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. It would also end a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members.",
      "Various forms of the measure have been introduced over the years, but like many legislative proposals, they had failed to get enacted.",
      "\"I've been working at the league 25 years, and I don't remember ever not having a version,\" said Benton.",
      "Introduced by Reps. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., and Garret Graves, R-La., the bill was passed by the House in a 327-75 vote late Tuesday night, after a last-ditch effort to derail it by members of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus failed.",

      "The bill \"dies December 31, at the end of the second session of Congress,\" Benton said. \"Not only would this bill have to start from scratch, but a new person would have to introduce it.\"",
      "The Republican and Democratic lawmakers who introduced the measures in their respective bodies either did not run for reelection or lost their reelection bid, as was the case with Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, who introduced the bill in the Senate.",
      "If the Social Security Fairness Act comes up for a vote in the Senate, it's expected to pass, having already secured 62 co-sponsors \u2014 surpassing the majority needed to send it to President Joe Biden for his signature.",
      "If signed into law, the changes would be effective for benefits payable after December 2023.",
      "What does the Social Security Fairness Act do?",
      "The legislation would cut two provisions that curtail retirement payments for public workers and their surviving spouses and family members, the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO), which Spanberger and Graves argue are tantamount to theft of those workers' benefits.",
      "\"For more than 40 years, the Social Security trust funds have been artificially propped up by stolen benefits that millions of Americans paid for and that their families deserve,\" they said in a Nov. 13 statement.",
      "As things stand now, the WEP reduces the Social Security benefits of workers who also receive a public pension from a job not covered by Social Security. For instance, that would include teachers who don't earn Social Security through their public school positions but who work part-time or during the summer in jobs that are covered by Social Security, even though they pay into the system over enough quarters to qualify.",
      "The GPO impacts the spousal benefits of people who work for federal, state or local governments \u2014 including police officers, firefighters and teachers \u2014 if the job is not covered by Social Security. The GPO cuts by two-thirds the benefit received by surviving spouses who also collect a government pension, often offsetting benefits entirely.",
      "For instance, under the GPO, someone who receives a $900 spousal benefit from Social Security but who also has a $1,000 non-covered pension would see their Social Security benefit cut by $667. That would leave them with a $233 remaining spousal benefit from Social Security.",
      "Under the Social Security Fairness Act, the same person would receive the entire $900 spousal benefit.",
      "\"Workers should be able to count on the retirement benefits they've earned,\" said Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, an original cosponsor of the bill. \"It's time to pass the Social Security Fairness Act so government workers and their families and people with disabilities are not punished for earning multiple sources of retirement income.\"",
      "What is the chance of the Social Security Fairness Act passing?",
      "The biggest opposition to the bill is its cost. The Congressional Budget Office estimates it would cost upward of $190 billion over a decade.",
      "\"It would hasten the combined trust funds shortfall by six months to a year, when it's already in trouble,\" said Benton, who said TSCL supports reforming Social Security to resolve its projected insolvency in 2033 to 2034.",
      "\"The long-term solvency of Social Security is an issue that Congress must address \u2014 but an issue that is wholly separate from allowing Virginians, Louisianans, and Americans across our country who did their part and contributed their earnings to retire with dignity,\" Graves and Spanberger said in their joint statement.",

      "Regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time, 58-year-old Mike Tyson has an estimated net worth of $10 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. That is a modest sum compared with the hundreds of millions of dollars \"Iron Mike,\" as he is known, accumulated in career earnings, including $400 million in fight purses, according\u00a0to\u00a0Forbes.

That bout lasted less than two minutes, with Tyson knocking out the previously undefeated Spinks in 91 seconds.",

      "At a news conference on Wednesday, Paul wore a diamond-spiked ear cover, a pointed reference to the incident. But when it comes to making light of the ear biting, Tyson has beat Paul to the punch, having launched ear-shaped marijuana edibles\u00a0(with Holyfield's consent) through his company, Tyson 2.0, a premium cannabis brand he launched in 2021. The brand generated an estimated $150 million in revenue in 2023, according to Forbes Australia.",

    "summary": "Pregnant women say health care providers are billing them to deliver their babies earlier than expected. Patient advocates say that's unethical.",
    "story": [
      "In April, just 12 weeks into her pregnancy, Kathleen Clark was standing at the receptionist window of her OB-GYN's office when she was asked to pay $960, the total the office estimated she would owe after she delivered.",
      "Clark, 39, was shocked that she was asked to pay that amount during this second prenatal visit. Normally, patients receive the bill after insurance has paid its part, and for pregnant women that's usually only when the pregnancy ends. It would be months before the office filed the claim with her health insurer.",
      "Clark said she felt stuck. The Cleveland, Tennessee, obstetrics practice was affiliated with a birthing center where she wanted to deliver. Plus, she and her husband had been wanting to have a baby for a long time. And Clark was emotional, because just weeks earlier her mother had died.",
      "\"You're standing there at the window, and there's people all around, and you're trying to be really nice,\" recalled Clark, through tears. \"So, I paid it.\"",
      "On online baby message boards and other social media forums, pregnant women say they are being asked by their providers to pay out-of-pocket fees earlier than expected. The practice is legal, but patient advocacy groups call it unethical. Medical providers argue that asking for payment up front ensures they get compensated for their services.",
      "How frequently this happens is hard to track because it is considered a private transaction between the provider and the patient. Therefore, the payments are not recorded in insurance claims data and are not studied by researchers.",
      "Patients, medical billing experts, and patient advocates say the billing practice causes unexpected anxiety at a time of already heightened stress and financial pressure. Estimates can sometimes be higher than what a patient might ultimately owe and force people to fight for refunds if they miscarry or the amount paid was higher than the final bill.",
      "Up-front payments also create hurdles for women who may want to switch providers if they are unhappy with their care. In some cases, they may cause women to forgo prenatal care altogether, especially in places where few other maternity care options exist.",
      "It's \"holding their treatment hostage,\" said Caitlin Donovan, a senior director at the Patient Advocate Foundation.",
      "Medical billing and women's health experts believe OB-GYN offices adopted the practice to manage the high cost of maternity care and the way it is billed for in the U.S.",
      "When a pregnancy ends, OB-GYNs typically file a single insurance claim for routine prenatal care, labor, delivery, and, often, postpartum care. That practice of bundling all maternity care into one billing code began three decades ago, said Lisa Satterfield, senior director of health and payment policy at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. But such bundled billing has become outdated, she said.",
      "Previously, pregnant patients had been subject to copayments for each prenatal visit, which might lead them to skip crucial appointments to save money. But the Affordable Care Act now requires all commercial insurers to fully cover certain prenatal services. Plus, it's become more common for pregnant women to switch providers, or have different providers handle prenatal care, labor, and delivery \u2014 especially in rural areas where patient transfers are common.",
      "Some providers say prepayments allow them to spread out one-time payments over the course of the pregnancy to ensure that they are compensated for the care they do provide, even if they don't ultimately deliver the baby.",
      "\"You have people who, unfortunately, are not getting paid for the work that they do,\" said Pamela Boatner, who works as a midwife in a Georgia hospital.",
      "While she believes women should receive pregnancy care regardless of their ability to pay, she also understands that some providers want to make sure their bill isn't ignored after the baby is delivered. New parents might be overloaded with hospital bills and the costs of caring for a new child, and they may lack income if a parent isn't working, Boatner said.",
      "In the U.S., having a baby can be expensive. People who obtain health insurance through large employers pay an average of nearly $3,000 out-of-pocket for pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum care, according to the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker. In addition, many people are opting for high-deductible health insurance plans, leaving them to shoulder a larger share of the costs. Of the 100 million U.S. people with health care debt, 12% attribute at least some of it to maternity care, according to a 2022 KFF poll.",
      "Families need time to save money for the high costs of pregnancy, childbirth, and child care, especially if they lack paid maternity leave, said Joy Burkhard, CEO of the Policy Center for Maternal Mental Health, a Los Angeles-based policy think tank. Asking them to prepay \"is another gut punch,\" she said. \"What if you don't have the money? Do you put it on credit cards and hope your credit card goes through?\"",
      "Calculating the final costs of childbirth depends on multiple factors, such as the timing of the pregnancy, plan benefits, and health complications, said Erin Duffy, a health policy researcher at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics. The final bill for the patient is unclear until a health plan decides how much of the claim it will cover, she said.",
      "But sometimes the option to wait for the insurer is taken away.",
      "During Jamie Daw's first pregnancy in 2020, her OB-GYN accepted her refusal to pay in advance because Daw wanted to see the final bill. But in 2023, during her second pregnancy, a private midwifery practice in New York told her that since she had a high-deductible plan, it was mandatory to pay $2,000 spread out with monthly payments.",
      "Daw, a health policy researcher at Columbia University, delivered in September 2023 and got a refund check that November for $640 to cover the difference between the estimate and the final bill.",
      "\"I study health insurance,\" she said. \"But, as most of us know, it's so complicated when you're really living it.\"",
      "While the Affordable Care Act requires insurers to cover some prenatal services, it doesn't prohibit providers from sending their final bill to patients early. It would be a challenge politically and practically for state and federal governments to attempt to regulate the timing of the payment request, said Sabrina Corlette, a co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. Medical lobbying groups are powerful and contracts between insurers and medical providers are proprietary.",
      "Because of the legal gray area, Lacy Marshall, an insurance broker at Rapha Health and Life in Texas, advises clients to ask their insurer if they can refuse to prepay their deductible. Some insurance plans prohibit providers in their network from requiring payment up front.",
      "If the insurer says they can refuse to pay up front, Marshall said, she tells clients to get established with a practice before declining to pay, so that the provider can't refuse treatment.",
      "Clark said she met her insurance deductible after paying for genetic testing, extra ultrasounds, and other services out of her health care flexible spending account. Then she called her OB-GYN's office and asked for a refund.",
      "\"I got my spine back,\" said Clark, who had previously worked at a health insurer and a medical office. She got an initial check for about half the $960 she originally paid.",
      "In August, Clark was sent to the hospital after her blood pressure spiked. A high-risk pregnancy specialist \u2014 not her original OB-GYN practice \u2014 delivered her son, Peter, prematurely via emergency cesarean section at 30 weeks.",
      "It was only after she resolved most of the bills from the delivery that she received the rest of her refund from the other OB-GYN practice.",
      "This final check came in October, just days after Clark brought Peter home from the hospital, and after multiple calls to the office. She said it all added stress to an already stressful period.",
      "\"Why am I having to pay the price as a patient?\" she said. \"I'm just trying to have a baby.\"",

    "title": "What to know about Trump's DOGE, led by Musk and Ramaswamy",
    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 21:45:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will head an effort, dubbed DOGE, to reduce wasteful federal spending. Here's what it's about.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump is vowing to reduce wasteful federal spending by tapping two billionaires \u2014 Tesla CEO Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy \u2014 to spearhead the initiative, which the president-elect is calling the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",
      "The appointments, announced by Trump on Tuesday, raise a host of questions about the effort, including whether Musk and Ramaswamy will have the authority to make changes in federal outlays, given that Congress authorizes the nation's spending, as well as where the businessmen might look to cut spending. Under the plan, meanwhile, DOGE is not an official government department, raising questions about its powers and how it will operate.",
      "Speaking Thursday night at Mar-a-Lago at a gala hosted by the right-leaning think tank the America First Policy Institute, Ramaswamy thanked Trump \"for making sure that Elon Musk and I are in a position to start the mass deportations of millions of unelected federal bureaucrats out of the D.C. bureaucracy.\"",
      "\"And I don't know if you've got to know Elon yet, but he doesn't bring a chisel, he brings a chainsaw, and we're going to be taking it to that bureaucracy,\" Ramaswamy added. \"It's going to be a lot of fun.\"",
      "The announcement comes a week after Trump won a second term\u00a0as president, with voters expressing their dissatisfaction with the economy under the Biden administration. As part of his campaign vows, Trump promised to slash government spending. Musk's bio on X, the social media platform he bought in 2022, now reads, \"The people voted for major government reform.\"",
      "\"Frankly, it does need to be done again, so every few decades you really need to look at everything,\" Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution who managed the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review, an effort to cut government spending in the 1990s, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "But Kamarck harbors reservations about Musk and Ramaswamy's mandate, especially after the former recently suggested he could find more than $2 trillion in savings \u2014 almost one-third of the federal government's $6.7 trillion in annual spending. Two-thirds of that spending is mandatory through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense.",
      "\"This is the first warning sign that this is going to be a failed operation,\" Kamarck said. \"That's insane.\"",
      "Speaking on transformational change within government and organizations, Michael Morris, a professor at Columbia University's Columbia Business School, noted there are two models: a bottom-up, grassroots effort and a top-down strategy \u2014 sometimes called a shock-change approach. DOGE likely belongs to the latter, according to Morris, who is also author of the nonfiction book \"Tribal,\" about how people form and relate to each other through group dynamics.",
      "\"Unless you have a new leader with incredible legitimacy and the status quo with no legitimacy, you rarely have people responding well to shock therapy,\" he said. \"It's hard to see it happening in this case \u2014 I don't think Musk is going to be able to form a deep knowledge of government.\"",
      "The Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "What is the Department of Government Efficiency?",
      "Trump announced the DOGE in a statement on Tuesday, describing it as an effort to \"slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies.\"",
      "The name is a nod to Musk's support for a cryptocurrency called dogecoin, which was created as a joke by two software engineers and uses the image of a smiling Shiba Inu dog. (Dogecoin has more than tripled in price during the last month, and now trades at 38 cents.)",
      "Trump said Musk and Ramaswamy's work \"will conclude no later than July 4, 2026,\" or by the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Trump only outlined the initiative's contours and didn't disclose how it will be staffed or funded. The Trump campaign didn't respond to a request about the DOGE's funding or whether Musk or Ramaswamy will be paid for their work on the effort.",
      "On Thursday, an X account for DOGE said the group is accepting resumes from \"super high-IQ small-government revolutionaries willing to work 80+ hours per week on unglamorous cost-cutting.\" In a separate post, Musk said \"compensation is zero.\"",
      "Can the DOGE actually cut federal spending?",
      "At the moment, that appears unlikely given that the DOGE isn't a real government department, which would need to be created by congressional approval. Federal spending is authorized by Congress, and senators and House representatives may hesitate to support cuts to major programs like Social Security or Medicare, which are popular with millions of voters, or to the nation's military.",
      "It's also not clear how the organization will operate. It could come under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which dictates how external groups that advise the government must operate and be accountable to the public.",
      "Trump described Musk and Ramaswamy's role as providing \"advice and guidance from outside of government.\"",
      "That doesn't amount to much, Kamarck said.",
      "\"They have no authority \u2014 none whatsoever,\" she added, while noting that the backing of the president can help convince lawmakers to throw their support behind efficiency efforts.",
      "However, Trump's aides are reportedly working on a way to enact some of DOGE's spending recommendations without requiring congressional approval, the Washington Post reported.",
      "What have Musk and Ramaswamy said about federal spending?",
      "Musk, the world's richest person with a net worth of $319 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has described the U.S. government as bloated and said it its spending is unsustainable. The Tesla founder also said he wants to reduce the number of federal agencies to 99, down from more than 400.",
      "\"There are so many [agencies] that people have never heard of, and that have overlapping areas of responsibilities,\" Musk\u00a0said earlier this month.",
      "While on the campaign trail with Trump, Musk also\u00a0said\u00a0he could cut \"at least $2 trillion\" from the annual budget. \"Your money is being wasted, and the Department of Government Efficiency will fix that,\" Musk said.",
      "Musk is known for cost-cutting at his own companies, slashing\u00a0most of X's workforce after he bought the business two years ago as well as focusing on manufacturing costs at Tesla. Even so, those efforts have had mixed results, with X's valuation falling by about 80% since his purchase. Tesla's stock price, meanwhile, has surged 48% in the past year, bumping its value above $1 trillion.",
      "Ramaswamy, whom Forbes says has a net worth of about $1 billion, dropped out of the presidential race in January after running on an \"anti-woke\"\u00a0campaign. He also advocated for government cuts by eliminating the Department of Education, a goal shared by President-elect Trump.",
      "Have administrations previously tried to cut costs?",
      "Yes, both Republican and Democratic presidents have created efforts to cut government spending.",
      "In 1982, President Ronald Reagan created the Grace Commission, led by wealthy businessman J. Peter Grace, the CEO of W. R. Grace & Company, a chemicals business. About 150 business people volunteered for the commission, which ultimately recommended 2,500 reforms, according to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.",
      "\"Most of the recommendations, especially those requiring legislation from Congress, were never implemented,\" the library notes. \"However, the Commission's work provided a starting point for many conservative critiques of the federal government.\"",
      "In the 1990s, President Bill Clinton created the National Performance Review with the goal to create a government that would work better and cost less, Kamarck said. The group was staffed with civil servants who understood the bureaucracy, and many of whom had frustrations with it, she added.",
      "The group had some successes in streamlining operations and paring costs, eventually cutting more than 300,000 jobs, according to a study from the Congressional Research Service. Kamarck noted that the group also focused on integrating technology into departments at a time when the internet was just emerging, leading to efficiencies such as online tax filing.",
      "Where could the Trump administration cut spending?",
      "While experts are skeptical of Musk's claim he can cut $2 trillion in spending, they also point out there are opportunities to look at efficiencies.",
      "Eliminating Medicare fraud is one area that could result in savings, according to the Citizens Against Government Waste, a nonpartisan group that looks at government spending. Its recommendations also include reducing the nation's contributions to the U.N. and ending subsidies for some agricultural products, like dairy and sugar. Its projected savings: $377 billion in the first year, or about 19% of the $2 trillion that Musk is eyeballing.",
      "But efficiency goes beyond cost-cutting, Kamarck noted. It's also about understanding how the bureaucracy works.",
      "\"Every single thing in the federal government is big and complicated, and there are layers and layers of complexity,\" she noted. \"Al Gore and I relied on hundreds of experienced civil servants to tell us how this worked \u2014 and if you don't do this, which I suspect they won't because Musk is an arrogant billionaire, you will fail.\"",
      "Does Musk have conflicts of interest?",
      "Yes, as Musk's SpaceX works with the Department of Defense and NASA, with the federal government pledging $3 billion to his companies last year, according to the New York Times. Tesla, meanwhile, has been investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, as well as by other agencies.",
      "Federal employees are generally required to disclose their financial assets and entanglements to ward off any potential conflicts of interest, and to divest significant holdings relating to their work. Because Musk and Ramaswamy would not be formal federal workers, they would not face those requirements or ethical limitations.",
      "Then there's also the question of Musk's ability to juggle another major role, given that he is also running several businesses, from Tesla to SpaceX, Columbia Business School's Morris noted.",
      "\"The whole question of Elon coming into government, that he's going to be this sort of roving efficiency expert, like a McKinsey consultant looking over the shoulders of the entire government \u2014 it's absurd on so many levels,\" Morris said. \"He's already the CEO of companies that are very demanding of his time.\"",
      "He added, \"To do work in government of this sort, you have to be process-oriented in a way that he has never been before.\"",

      "Sealed bids were opened Wednesday at the auction, which had been\u00a0approved by a bankruptcy court earlier this year to allow the Sandy Hook families to receive payments from Jones. The conspiracy theorist and his company filed for bankruptcy in 2022 after losing defamation and emotional distress lawsuits by Sandy Hook families after he repeatedly called the Connecticut school shooting a hoax staged by \"crisis actors.\"",
      "The purchase was confirmed by conspiracy theorist Jones, who posted a video on X saying that The Onion bought his company. \"The Connecticut Democrats with the Onion newspaper bought us,\" he said in the post, describing the bidding as \"competitive.\"",

      "The women, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, aren't asking for the state's abortion ban to be overturned. Instead, they want the judge to clarify and expand the exceptions to the strict ban so that people facing serious pregnancy complications can receive abortions before they are at death's door.",
      "Currently, the state's near-total ban makes performing an abortion a felony at any stage of pregnancy unless it is \"necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\"",
      "Adkins' fetus had a severe medical condition that meant the fetus would not survive the pregnancy. The illness also put Adkins at risk of developing \"mirror syndrome,\" a dangerous syndrome that can cause fatally high blood pressure and other issues, she said.",
      "Adkins and her husband, John, decided to seek an abortion, and learned, after another ultrasound showed the fetus still had a heartbeat, that they would have to go out of state to get one.",
      "Idaho law prohibits a woman from getting an abortion when a fetal heartbeat is detected, with the exception of cases of rape, incest or a \"medical emergency,\" defined by the law as \"a condition that, in reasonable medical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\"",
      "\"No parent wants to wish that when they look at an ultrasound they don't see their baby's heartbeat, yet here I was hoping that I wouldn't,\" Adkins said. \"I wanted the decision to be made for us, and I wanted to end her suffering, so it was really hard to see that and know that we had the challenges ahead of us that we did.\"",
      "\"I was not willing to watch my son suffer\"",
      "Kayla Smith cried as she told the judge how she found out she was pregnant for a second time on Mother's Day of 2022, and how she and her husband chose the name \"Brooks\" for their son. She was around 18 or 20 weeks along in her pregnancy when the sonographer grew quiet during a routine anatomy scan, Smith said.",
      "Brooks' heart had fatal anomalies, and the young family could not find a pediatric cardiologist willing to attempt an operation. The veins supplying Brooks' lungs were also abnormal, Smith said, and he would not survive birth.",
      "Smith had developed dangerously high blood pressure during a previous pregnancy, and she was at risk of developing the condition called preeclampsia again.",
      "\"If I were to continue pregnancy not only would I risk my life with preeclampsia, I was not willing to watch my son suffer and potentially gasp for air,\" Smith said, crying.",
      "Idaho's abortion ban went into effect two days before Brooks' diagnosis, she said, making it impossible for her to get an abortion in her home state.",
      "\"We wanted to meet our son \u2014 that was really important to us \u2014 so we needed to do it in a hospital,\" she said.",
      "They took out a loan to cover the estimated $16,000 to $20,000 out-of-network cost for the procedure and drove more than eight hours to a hospital where doctors induced labor.",
      "\"All four of these women were overjoyed to be pregnant with their second child and all four of them received the worst news a mother can imagine,\" attorney Gail Deady, with the Center for Reproductive Rights, told 4th District Judge Jason D. Scott during opening arguments. All of them sought abortions \"to protect their health, to spare their babies from pain and suffering, and to remain alive and healthy to protect their young children.\"",
      "James Craig, a division chief with the Idaho Attorney General's office, said the women and their attorneys are relying on hypotheticals rather than concrete facts to make their case. Under their proposal, a pregnant woman could receive her abortion for something as minor as stepping on a rusty nail \u2014 even though the risk of infection in that scenario could be easily treated by receiving a tetanus booster shot, Craig said.",
      "\"Unborn children have a fundamental right to life, and protecting the lives of children is a legitimate and fundamental government interest,\" Craig said.",
      "The state also has the same interest in protecting the lives of women, Craig said \u2014 and the abortion ban laws do both, he contended.",
      "In the \"rare circumstances where abortion is necessary\" to prevent the death of the mother, Idaho law allows that to occur, Craig said. The women suing are trying to \"usurp the role of the Legislature\" by asking the judge to rewrite the law, he said, and that is not the proper role of the court.",
      "Dr. Emily Corrigan, an ob-gyn who works in emergency medicine at Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center who is also a plaintiff in the case, told the judge how Idaho's multiple abortion bans have created confusion for physicians and made it difficult to treat pregnant patients who need emergency care.",
      "Doctors have had to \"basically guess which pregnancy conditions would fall under the state medical exception,\" Corrigan said.",
      "\"I have had other hospital staff refuse to participate in the care of my patients because of the lack of understanding of the laws, and this has caused patient care delays,\" she said. \"I have personally cared for several patients who have been denied stabilizing abortion care at other hospitals in Idaho. By the time they arrive at my institution, their conditions have deteriorated and have lead to increased complications that I need to manage.\"",
      "Several conditions can put the health of pregnant people at risk, she said. Some are caused by pregnancy like preeclampsia, and others \u2014 including some chronic illnesses and cancers \u2014 can be made worse by pregnancy, she said. In those cases, delaying an abortion might not cause immediate death but can cause a shortened life span or have dramatic effects on a person's health, Corrigan said.",
      "\"We are not trained to wait until things become urgent or emergent. We are trained to prevent harm to our patients,\" she said.",

Medical King of Brooklyn, New York, is recalling about 220,000 adult portable bed rails due to entrapment and asphyxia risks. The recall follows the death of a 66-year-old man who became trapped between a mattress and a bed rail in November at a residential care facility in South Carolina.",

      "The auction house said the necklace, composed of three rows of diamonds finished with a diamond tassel at each end, had emerged \"miraculously intact\" from a private Asian collection to make its first public appearance in 50 years.",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump claims he can unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs on U.S. imports. The reality is more complicated, according to trade experts.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump, who recently described \"tariff\" as\u00a0\"the most beautiful word in the dictionary,\" has proposed a range of taxes on imports from other countries. The president-elect's stated aim: to reduce American companies' use of foreign goods and parts by raising their cost, a policy he contends would strengthen the U.S.' international trade position and boost job growth at home.",
      "Trump has also claimed that he doesn't need Congress' support to impose sweeping tariffs. The reality is more complicated, according to economists and foreign trade experts.",
      "What has Trump proposed?",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump proposed tariffs of up to 60% on Chinese goods. He's offered few additional details, however, such as whether the tariffs would apply to all goods or just certain categories of products.",
      "He's also proposed much broader tariffs of 10% to 20% on all imports, including those from key allies and trade partners, and has promised retaliatory levies on any country that imposes taxes on American-made goods.",
      "Can Trump unilaterally impose tariffs?",
      "Once he takes office, President-elect Trump has several possible pathways for implementing tariffs.",
      "The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the authority to impose tariffs in Article 1, Section 8, which states that \"The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties\u2026To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.\" But Congress can also selectively delegate tariff-setting authority to the president, which it has done for decades.",
      "In his first term as president from 2017-2021, Trump freely exercised this presidential authority to increase tariffs: Total duties paid on U.S. imports doubled from roughly $37 billion in 2015 to $74 billion in 2020, according to the\u00a0Congressional Research Service.",
      "\"Looking at his previous four years in office, he seems to believe he has the authority to impose tariffs,\" said Jake Colvin, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, a group dedicated to advocating for U.S. companies in international commerce. \"If they decide on day one that they want to use executive authority to put tariffs on Chinese goods, they could probably go ahead and do that.\"",
      "Colvin added that it will be important for the incoming Trump administration to provide businesses with more specifics so that companies can plan accordingly. \"A lot has been proposed in the course of the campaign, so it's important for the administration to give a signal about the path it intends to pursue, for clarity and planning purposes for American businesses,\" he said.",
      "How fast is Trump likely to move?",
      "The president has authority to impose a range of trade restrictions on foreign nations, said Inu Manak, a trade policy fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\"It seems pretty clear that he would pursue tariffs soon after taking office. During his last term, tariffs were a tool of choice in the trade war against China and against allies, too. So I believe that is a strategy he'll replicate in his next term,\" Manak told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Manak added that he would likely be able to do so without support from Congress. \"The president has quite a bit of discretion to do what he wants,\" she said.",
      "Legal powers at Trump's disposal include Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, under which the president may impose retaliatory tariffs when \"an act policy, or practice of a foreign country \u2026 violates, or is inconsistent with, the provisions of, or otherwise denies benefits to the United States under, any trade agreement, or \u2026 is unjustifiable and burdens or restricts United States commerce.\"",
      "Trump previously\u00a0invoked\u00a0Section 301 to impose tariffs on China in 2018 and 2019 \u2014 many of which have been continued under the Biden administration \u2014 and he could simply expand upon existing tariff actions he's already taken, according to Manak.",
      "\"That would require no action from Congress because they are already in place,\" she said.",
      "What other power Trump does have?",
      "In his previous term as president, he also made use of\u00a0Section 232\u00a0of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. It grants the president the authority to adjust imports, including by imposing tariffs, when they are deemed a threat to national security.",
      "There's also the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), although it hasn't used to restrict trade since President Richard Nixon was in office. The act says: \"Any authority granted to the President by ... this title may be exercised to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat ... to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the President declares a national emergency with respect to such threat.\"",
      "\"The authorities granted to the President ... may only be exercised to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency ...\" it adds in part.",
      "In other words, in order to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, Trump would have to declare a national emergency through an executive order, claiming that a U.S. trading partner posed a major threat.",
      "Alan Wm. Wolff, former deputy director-general of the World Trade Organization and a distinguished visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), is skeptical that Trump has the authority to impose sweeping tariffs under IEEPA.",
      "\"Can it be used against trade with all countries, our allies and friends in Europe and Asia, in the Americas, not to mention the poorest countries in Africa? That would simply be too large a power grab to have been within what Congress intended in this statute,\" he wrote in a recent blog post.",
      "Manak also said Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930 could conceivably give the president the authority to unilaterally raise tariffs. The rarely used act allows the president to impose duties of up to 50% of a product's value, and is triggered when a president finds that a foreign country has imposed an unreasonable charge on, or discriminated against, U.S. commerce.",
      "Typically, though, that has to be determine by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC). \"But the statute's language is ambiguous in terms of what that would look like, and I would imagine he could pursue this without a final finding from ITC, or pursue it while a finding is being made,\" Manak said.",
      "How would sweeping tariffs affect U.S. consumers?",
      "Some companies have already said they're aiming to move production out of China to avoid Trump's proposed tariffs. Shoemaker Steve Madden, for example, said last week week it plans to import fewer goods made in China and replace them with items made in other countries.",
      "If imposed, the proposed tariffs on imports could lead to consumers losing between $46 billion and $78 billion in spending power each year on products including apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods, according to the National Retail Federation.",
      "By another estimate, a 20% general tariff on all imported goods, combined with a 60% tariff on goods imported from China, would cost the typical U.S. households more than $2,600 a year. If Trump instead imposed a 10% across-the-board tariff, that would cost families $1,700 more, according to PIIE.",
      "Experts expect the incoming Trump administration to impose some proposed tariffs quickly, while perhaps phasing in or threatening to apply other levies over time in a bid to gain trade concessions.",
      "\"We would imagine that within a few months of him taking office, we would see the first tranche of tariffs taking effect,\" Manak said.",

    "summary": "The Federal Reserve began cutting its benchmark rate in September amid cooling inflation.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. inflation rose 2.6% on an annual basis last month, representing an uptick from September when the Federal Reserve began cutting interest rates amid signs of cooling prices and a weaker labor market.",
      "That matched forecasts from economists polled by FactSet that the Consumer Price Index rose 2.6% in October. The CPI rose 2.4% in September, when the Fed ushered in a jumbo rate cut of 0.5 percentage points, followed by a second rate cut this month.",
      "The slight rise on a month-over-month basis signals that the Fed's battle to tame inflation to its goal of a 2% annual rate might take a bumpy path over the next months. Some types of goods and services, from housing to insurance products, are still experiencing sharply higher prices, crimping consumers' budgets and creating economic headwinds.",
      "\"Looking ahead to the next six months, we foresee consumers and businesses still spending but doing so more prudently amid still-elevated costs and rates,\" noted EY chief economist Gregory Daco in a November 11 research note.",
      "A key driver of last month's inflation bump was the housing market, with shelter prices rising 0.4% in October, contributing about half of the monthly increase, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Wednesday. Transportation costs also rose due to higher airfares and a 14% annual jump in auto insurance, the report said.",
      "Despite the monthly uptick in prices, the Federal Reserve is forecast to cut rates for a third time this year at its December meeting, with two-thirds of economists polled by FactSet predicting a 0.25 percentage point cut. The latest CPI report isn't likely to derail that, given that the inflation numbers were in line with expectations, noted Lindsay Rosner, head of multi sector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management in an email.",
      "\"Bang in-line core inflation leaves the Fed on track to cut rates in December,\" Rosner wrote. \"After a run of unseasonably hot autumn data, today's number cools fears of an imminent slowdown in the pace of rate cuts.\"",
      "Trump's policies and inflation",
      "The inflation report marks the first since the November 5 election, which handed former President Donald Trump another win. But the president-elect's economic policies, which include a broad-based tariff on all imports and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants, could prove inflationary, economists say.",
      "Trump's plans could boost the inflation rate by as much 1 percentage point, bringing it to an annual rate of about 3.6% \u2014 above the Fed's 2% goal \u2014 some Wall Street experts have forecast.",
      "If that occurs, the Fed would likely slow its pace of rate cuts in order to battle ongoing elevated inflation, experts note.",
      "\"Still, with uncertainty over fiscal and trade policies high there is a risk that the Fed may opt to slow the pace of easing as the New Year chill sets in,\" Rosner added.",

      "Meanwhile, at least 11 states have passed privacy laws that would require customers' consent before their genetic data is transferred.",
      "Still, experts say a new owner could change 23andMe's privacy terms following a sale, potentially putting the onus on consumers to push back against any move to share their data.",
      "23andMe said that roughly 80% of its customers consent to participate in the company's research program, which it said has generated more than 270 peer-reviewed publications uncovering new genetic insights into disease. Any data that shared is anonymized and cannot be traced back to individual customers, according to the company.",
      "Still, users can can take additional steps to protect their data, including deleting their 23andMe accounts \u2014 a process that is automated and straightforward.",
      "\"If, at any time, you are no longer interested in participating in our Services, you may delete your 23andMe account directly within your Account Settings,\" the company states on its website.",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump has called the Biden administration's student loan relief efforts a \"total catastrophe.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Joe Biden made student loan forgiveness a central issue to his administration, rolling out efforts to forgive debt as well as to lower repayments for millions of borrowers. But with President-elect Donald Trump returning to the White House in January, the future of those efforts is now in question.",
      "During the presidential debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump described Mr. Biden's efforts to forgive student borrowers as \"a total catastrophe.\" While he hasn't explicitly addressed his plans for student loans, he's called for eliminating the Department of Education, which manages the $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio.",
      "It's unclear which agency or group would manage those loans if the Education Department were to be eliminated, a step that would require approval from Congress. The Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about Trump's plans for student debt relief.",
      "There's a lot on the line for the 46 million Americans who hold $1.7 trillion in student loans, a financial burden that about half of borrowers say has impacted their life choices, delaying home purchases or starting their families, according to a 2021 Morning Consult study. Mr. Biden's term is drawing to an end with two of his key relief efforts tied up in the courts, adding to the uncertainty about what Trump's second presidency will mean for those plans.",
      "\"We know what is in Project 2025, and we know what we saw in the first Trump administration,\" Persis Yu, managing counsel for the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for people with student loans. \"We just should be very concerned about what the next administration will mean for borrowers.\"",
      "The next Trump administration may be unlikely to continue the Biden administration's effort to fight against ongoing lawsuits targeting current student debt relief efforts, according to NerdWallet lending expert Kate Wood in an email. That could mean an end to those programs, experts say.",
      "\"Programs that the Biden administration created or expanded access to via regulatory changes could be easily rolled back,\" she added.",
      "What has Trump said about student loan relief?",
      "During his September debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump bashed the Biden administration's efforts.",
      "\"When they said they're going to get student loans terminated and it ended up being a total catastrophe. He went out, got rejected again by the Supreme Court,\" Trump said, referring to the high court's 2023 decision\u00a0that blocked Mr. Biden's initial student loan forgiveness program, which would have provided up to $20,000 in relief per borrower.",
      "\"So all these students got taunted with this whole thing about \u2014 this whole idea. And how unfair that would have been. Part of the reason they lost,\" he added.",
      "What does Project 2025 say about student loans?",
      "Project 2025\u00a0\u2014 an initiative overseen by the conservative Heritage Foundation to guide the next Republican president in an overhaul of the executive branch \u2014 calls for the abolishment of the Department of Education, and says student loans should be handled by the private sector. It also advocates for scuttling student loan relief.",
      "\"The new administration must end the practice of acting like the federal student loan portfolio is a campaign fund to curry political support and votes,\" Project 2025 says. \"The new administration must end abuses in the loan forgiveness programs. Borrowers should be expected to repay their loans.\"",
      "It's unclear whether Trump agrees with those views, although he has called for an end to the Education Department. While on the campaign trail, Trump distanced himself from Project 2025, calling some of the proposals \"abysmal.\"",
      "What is the status of Biden's student loan relief plans?",
      "Currently, there are two student loan relief plans that are tied up in court, both of which are being challenged by Republican-led states.",
      "The\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, is an income-driven repayment program, which pegs a borrower's monthly payment to their income, lowering their financial costs. Some lower-income borrowers in SAVE have monthly payments of $0.",
      "The plan's 8 million enrollees are now in limbo, however, after court rulings blocked the Biden administration from implementing the plan. Currently, those borrowers are in forbearance through April, meaning that their loans are essentially paused while the Biden administration defends the plan in court.",
      "Separately, another Biden administration plan to use\u00a0the Higher Education Act to erase all or some of the student debt held by 30 million borrowers has also hit a legal roadblock, with a court putting that plan on hold in October.",
      "In the latter case, the Republican states argued that Mr. Biden's plan sought to \"unlawfully mass cancel up to hundreds of billions of dollars in student loans.\" The Education Department vowed to defend both plans.",
      "What could happen to these programs under Trump?",
      "Bob Eitel, who served during the first Trump administration as a senior counselor to the education secretary, said he expects the president-elect will move to rescind the proposed loan cancellation regulations.",
      "\"The Trump administration may pursue different avenues of loan relief, but it will not be the mass, blanket types of forgiveness that the current administration has pursued,\" said Eitel, president and co-founder of the Defense of Freedom Institute for Policy Studies.",
      "Some other student loan relief programs may remain, such as the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which would be tougher to eliminate but could become less accessible, said NerdWallet's Wood.",

      "The honorees rose to the top in voting by a panel of experts and the public from among 12 finalists. This year's field included: the party game Apples to Apples, balloons, \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" gamebooks, Hess Toy Trucks, Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game, remote-controlled vehicles, Sequence, the stick horse and trampoline.",
      "\"These are three very deserving toys that showcase the wide range of how people play,\" Christopher Bensch, vice president for collections and chief curator, said in a statement. \"But for My Little Pony in particular, this year is extra validating. The beloved toy was a finalist seven times before finally crossing the finish line!\"",
      "Hasbro's mini-horses, distinguishable by different \"cutie marks\" on their haunches, were introduced in the 1980s and reintroduced in 2003, outselling even Barbie for several years.",

      "Transformers",
      "Transformers came along in the 1980s, when Hasbro bought the rights to several existing Japanese toy lines featuring transforming robots. They were first marketed with a cartoon and have since graduated to a series of live-action films. Social media sites allow for debates over which figures are must-haves, as well as demonstrations of the sometimes complex process of manipulating them from robot to vehicle or other alternate form.",
      "Regular new Transformers characters keep collectors coming back, Bensch said, \"but the toys are also popular because they are so suited to the ways kids play. The toy line feeds kids' imaginations and fantasy play.\"",
      "Phase 10",
      "Also inducted was Phase 10, which was introduced by inventor and entrepreneur\u00a0Ken Johnson\u00a0in 1982. Today, Mattel sells 2 million decks of the card game annually in 30 countries and more than 20 languages. That makes it one of the bestselling card games in the world, according to the Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, where the Toy Hall of Fame is housed.",
      "In the style of rummy, the game challenges players to collect groups of cards to complete 10 phases in sequential order before their opponents.",
      "\"Whether played in its original form or in one of its variations, Phase 10 has become an iconic game title that continues to encourage multigenerational social and competitive play,\" said Mirek Stolee, the museum's curator of board games and puzzles.",
      "Anyone can nominate a toy for the Hall of Fame. Museum staff narrows the field to 12 finalists each year. Fans can cast votes online for their favorites and their results are counted alongside ballots from a national advisory committee of historians, educators and others with industry expertise.",

      "Pete Hegseth, the Army veteran turned Fox News host selected by President-elect Donald Trump to be defense secretary during his second term, was investigated for an alleged sexual assault in 2017, officials in Monterey, California, confirmed.",
      "In response to multiple public record requests to the city, including one from CBS News, officials released a public statement late Thursday evening about a 2017 police investigation into Hegseth. The statement from the City Manager's Office and Monterey Police Department contained few details about the case and said they would not make any other public statements related to the investigation.",
      "The incident allegedly occurred somewhere between a minute before midnight on Oct. 7, 2017 and 7 a.m. on Oct. 8, 2017 at 1 Old Golf Course Road, the location of the Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel. A police report was filed with Monterey Police Department three days later, on Oct. 12, 2017.",
      "Police did not disclose the name or age of the alleged victim but did describe the injuries as \"Contusions to right thigh.\"",
      "The statement said no weapons were involved.",
      "News of the allegation was revealed on Thursday by Vanity Fair when the magazine reported that Trump's incoming chief of staff, Susie Wiles, was briefed about the alleged sexual misconduct by Hegseth involving a woman, citing unnamed sources \u2014 one of whom reportedly said the incident took place in Monterey.",
      "The allegation prompted a discussion among Wiles, Trump's legal team and Hegseth, who described the allegation as a consensual encounter and a classic case of he-said, she-said, the magazine reported.",
      "Hegseth's attorney, Timothy Parlatore, a former Trump lawyer who frequently represents current and former members of the U.S. military, told CBS News: \"This allegation was already investigated by the Monterey police department and they found no evidence for it.\"",
      "In a statement Friday morning, Trump communications director Steven Cheung said: \"President Trump is nominating high-caliber and extremely qualified candidates to serve in his Administration. Mr. Hegseth has vigorously denied any and all accusations, and no charges were filed. We look forward to his confirmation as United States Secretary of Defense so he can get started on Day One to Make America Safe and Great Again.\"",

      "Disagreement over Hegseth's qualifications",
      "Following Trump's Tuesday night announcement that he would nominate Hegseth to be his defense secretary, many have questioned whether the 44-year-old co-host of \"Fox & Friends Weekends\" can handle managing the Defense Department, which has a budget of $842 billion, almost 3 million employees and 750 military installations around the world.",
      "\"The Pentagon is in need of real reform, and they're getting a leader who has grit to make it happen,\" said Trump's pick for national security adviser, Republican Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida, in a post on the social media platform X. Waltz is a former Army Green Beret colonel.",
      "Democratic Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado, who served in the Army's elite 75th Ranger Regiment in Iraq and Afghanistan, said Hegseth was not \"remotely qualified\" to be defense secretary.",
      "\"The SecDef [secretary of defense] makes life-and-death decisions daily that impact over 2 million troops around the globe. This is not an entry-level job for a TV commentator,\" Crow said on X. \"The Senate should do its job and deny this nomination.\"",
      "Hegseth's controversial views",
      "Hegseth is a longtime conservative and staunch Trump ally who has talked about changes Trump should make at the Pentagon.",

It's the first goal listed in the education section of Project 2025's \"mandate for leadership,\" a book that lays out a plan for Trump's new administration. Trump has publicly disavowed the project, but its goals \u2014 and the people behind it \u2014 remain influential in his orbit.",
      "The smallest of all Cabinet agencies, the Department of Education is responsible for distribution of federal financial aid for education, collecting and disseminating data and research related to schools, and prohibiting discrimination in schools. Its funds account for less than 10% of the nation's public school funding, which is primarily driven by state and local taxes.",
      "Shuttering the agency won't be easy, according to Michigan State University professor Joshua Cowen.",
      "\"This is a real thing. They really want to do this,\" said Cowen, a professor of education policy. \"It's more realistic than ever, but I don't want to overstate the possibility. It's going to be hard.\"",
      "Cowen said even though Republicans control both houses of Congress and the presidency, a wholesale closure of the Department of Education might not be palatable to some of the party's legislators.",
      "\"They realize some of the things that the education department oversees and funds are popular,\" said Cowen, adding that the Senate would need a 60-vote filibuster-proof majority to push through a bill to close the department.",
      "Instead, he said, Republicans are likely to focus on rolling back funding for programs geared toward \"equity, inclusion, or programs that could be particularly beneficial toward migrant communities\" \u2014 lightning rod issues for conservative politicians.",
      "Another target would likely be Title I funding, which provides school districts with funding geared toward low-income students, according to Columbia University professor Aaron Pallas.",
      "\"One thing that Project 2025 called for that is perhaps most doable and, and most threatening perhaps to local education agencies is a proposal to phase out federal funding for Title I, shifting that to be the responsibility of states and and local governments,\" Pallas said.",
      "Pallas said that plan also calls for many of the department's responsibilities to be shifted to other federal agencies.",
      "\"It's really just kind of rearranging in order to continue to provide congressionally mandated services to students. Even if the functions get moved to other agencies, there's going to have to be people available to administer them,\" Pallas said.",
      "Trump also promised in the campaign video to \"give all parents the right to choose another school for their children if they want.\" But part of the calculus GOP legislators might need to consider is that enthusiasm for dismantling the Education Department may not be as widespread as they think. On Nov. 5, three states \u2014 including two where Trump won handily \u2014 rejected ballot measures that would've shifted money away from public education.",
      "Voters rejected efforts in Kentucky, Colorado and Nebraska to strengthen school choice and voucher programs, in which state funds help foot the bill for parents who choose to forgo their local public schools.",
      "\"Rural Republicans have long resisted school choice schemes, especially vouchers, for the simple reason they just don't have very many private schools in their districts,\" said Cowen, whose book \"The Privateers\" examines the role of wealthy donors in politicians' push for school voucher programs.",
      "He said politicians who serve rural school districts might have one other big reason to avoid supporting legislation that strips away funding.",
      "\"I'm no Karl Rove or James Carville, but I know that you don't get reelected by voting against the biggest employer in your district,\" Cowan said.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 14:46:30 -0500",
    "summary": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's pick\u200b to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, has raised controversy on topics ranging from vaccines to fluoride to food.",
    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, is coming into the nomination process in an unusual position: a long list of his own policy priorites\u00a0separate from the president-elect's, and a public promise by Trump to let him \"go wild\" on his ideas.",
      "CBS News medical contributor Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, the editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, answers questions below about the role Kennedy has been tapped to take on and some of the ideas in the sweeping \"Make America Healthy Again\" platform he may try to push through.",
      "Q: What is the role of the Department of Health and Human Services, and how much power does the HHS secretary have over its work?",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services comprises several agencies and offices including the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Office of the Surgeon General and much more.",
      "There is a big difference between political appointees and career civil servants. Political appointees set strategic priorities and align their department or agency's policies with the current administration's objectives. Civil servants have the institutional knowledge to know how to get things done and have specialized scientific or technical expertise. Scientific questions require specialized expertise. This is why there are career scientists who advise the HHS secretary, NIH director, CDC director and FDA commissioner.",
      "The HHS secretary has the authority to establish regulations that govern health, including food and drug safety, public health and health care quality. The HHS secretary can declare public health emergencies and coordinate federal responses to health crises, such as disease outbreaks or natural disasters. The secretary wields significant influence over the department's policies and its constituent agencies, which include the CDC, FDA, NIH and others.",
      "The HHS secretary is also in a position to shape public opinion if given a platform to do so by the media. Absent media attention, their influence on public opinion is more limited. We in the media have a responsibility to fact-check their statements and hold those in power accountable \u2014 regardless of who is in power.",
      "Q: One of Kennedy's most controversial stances is his criticism of vaccines, promoting the idea that they cause autism, among other conditions, and claiming \"there's no vaccine that is safe and effective.\" What is the reality?",
      "Extensive research has conclusively shown that vaccines do not cause autism. The \"research\" behind these claims was retracted due to ethical violations and sloppy work. The doctor who originally made those claims lost his medical license as a result of his professional misconduct.",
      "For parents whose kids have autism or people who have autism, this matters. For too long, claims about the safety of vaccines have not only put people at unnecessary risk of getting illnesses that vaccines can prevent, but have also been a red herring, distracting people from the real causes of autism and how to diagnose them and treat them. That distraction is unproductive and harmful.",
      "Secondly, nothing in this world is 100% safe and effective. It's all about weighing risks, the pros and cons. Is one choice more beneficial or more risky? Do the pros of wearing a seatbelt in the car outweigh the risks? Do the pros of exercising regularly outweigh the risks of not exercising? You could get injured while exercising. Do the pros of vaccinating instead of allowing infectious diseases to spread in the community outweigh the cons? Yes, yes and yes.",
      "Q: Kennedy has said he wants to leave it up to individuals to decide whether to vaccinate themselves or their children. What impact could that have?",
      "Increasingly, people are formulating opinions about vaccines based not on science, but on Google searches, social media, what family and friends think and personal observation. That is not research. Research is formulating a hypothesis and trying to disprove that hypothesis. It means you understand how to differentiate correlation from causation. And it means doing repeated experiments to show consistency, not just a chance or random result.",
      "This isn't a question of whether people are smart or not. But most people don't have the training, experience and context to objectively assess the pros and cons of vaccination. You wouldn't want me repairing your car's transmission or brake system. I'm not stupid, but I have no training or experience in this.",
      "The risk of leaving these decisions to untrained individuals is that these decisions won't be made on science. They will be made based on emotion and confirmation bias, which is to say, Google searches looking for opinions that line up with your preexisting beliefs or inclinations. This will put kids at risk, and because vaccines protect against transmissible infectious diseases this will put others in the community at risk, especially other kids and people who are immunocompromised.",
      "Q: Kennedy has also said chemicals in food are tied to autism as well as psychotic episodes and depression. What do we know about the connection between food and mental health?",
      "He's not wrong that there is a relationship between diet and autism as well as diet and mental health. These are areas of ongoing research. No diet has been proven to cure or universally improve autism or mental health symptoms, but certain dietary interventions improve symptoms in some people. These dietary changes may include elimination of ultra-processed foods, eliminating gluten and avoiding certain food additives or preservatives.",
      "Q: Kennedy has said one of the Trump administration's first acts will be to work to remove fluoride from drinking water, arguing it's connected to cancer, IQ loss, thyroid disease and other health problems. Why is fluoride in drinking water, and is it safe?",
      "Fluoride is put in the water to reduce the risk of cavities, especially in kids.",
      "As with many things, fluoride safety is all about dose. Drinking a few glasses of water a day is healthy. Drinking from a fire hydrant all day would land you in the hospital. The level of fluoride in U.S. water is safe and protects against tooth decay.",
      "When municipalities stopped putting fluoride in the water, cavity rates went up. This was observed, for example, in Calgary, Canada, and in Juneau, Alaska.",
      "There are parts of the world, including India, China and East Africa, where fluoride levels 30 to 40 times higher than levels in the U.S. have been found to be harmful. But we don't have anywhere near those levels of fluoride in our water.",
      "But Kennedy's statement demonstrates a common misunderstanding about public health authorities in the U.S. We are the United States of America \u2014 public health powers reside at the state level. The federal government has the authority to tax and spend and to regulate commerce across state lines, and federal government authorities derive from that.",
      "The CDC provides scientific guidance to help state and local authorities to make informed decisions. The CDC does not mandate fluoridation. The EPA sets the maximum allowable fluoride concentration in public water systems. But states have the authority to mandate fluoridation or can leave it up to local jurisdictions.",
      "Q: Kennedy has criticized multiple public health agencies he could now lead. He's said the FDA's \"war on public health is about to end,\" claiming the agency suppresses anything that \"advances human health and can't be patented\" by pharmaceutical companies. What do you make of these criticisms?",
      "This again demonstrates a misunderstanding of federal agency authority. Congress has passed laws that give the FDA specific authority to regulate drugs, supplements and food, and those laws grant the FDA different powers over drugs, supplements and food.",
      "If anything, given the Supreme Court's \"major questions doctrine,\" the courts can determine that agencies may not make regulations on issues of significant economic or political importance unless Congress has clearly authorized such actions. For example, in the case FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. (2000), the Supreme Court concluded that the FDA lacked the power to regulate tobacco. In 2009, Congress passed the\u00a0Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, granting the FDA the authority to regulate tobacco.",
      "Drugs require FDA approval before they can be marketed. Under the law, drugs are defined as substances used to diagnose, treat or prevent disease.",
      "Supplements don't need FDA approval before they are sold. The FDA monitors dietary supplements once they are on the market and can take action if they are unsafe or if they make claims about diagnosis, treatment or prevention of disease.",
      "Dietary supplement manufacturers often choose not to seek FDA approval to market their products as drugs because:",
      "There are less stringent requirements on dietary supplements than on drugs.The FDA approval process is expensive and lengthy. Clinical trials take years to conduct and cost millions of dollars. Manufacturers foot the bill for clinical trials.Dietary supplements can be sold directly to consumers without a prescription.",
      "There are less stringent requirements on dietary supplements than on drugs.",
      "The FDA approval process is expensive and lengthy. Clinical trials take years to conduct and cost millions of dollars. Manufacturers foot the bill for clinical trials.",
      "Dietary supplements can be sold directly to consumers without a prescription.",
      "It's the manufacturer that decides whether it wants to seek FDA approval for a drug or if it wants to market a product as a dietary supplement \u2014 and that decision typically comes down to time and money. Pharmaceutical companies are less inclined to invest millions of dollars in clinical trials of unpatented treatments due to the lack of exclusive marketing rights (in other words, a time-limited monopoly), which can affect profitability.",
      "The FDA often goes after supplement brands that test this line when it sees companies marketing products with claims that amount to what should be regulated as a drug. This is why supplements often carry a\u00a0disclaimer that they aren't being sold to \"diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.\" Kennedy has\u00a0praised\u00a0the supplement industry for \"fighting back,\" following a court win over an anti-aging supplement that the FDA argued should be regulated as a drug.",
      "Finally, the FDA doesn't grant patents. That's the job of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.",
      "Q: Trump has said Kennedy will \"end the chronic health epidemic.\" What are some of the positive actions he could take if he becomes HHS secretary to reduce chronic disease in the U.S.?",
      "Kennedy has called for greater regulation of food additives and ultraprocessed foods. Ultraprocessed foods in American diets have led to an explosion in obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and other chronic disease.",
      "However, it's unclear which factions within Trump's orbit will prevail. Congress may have to give the FDA the authority to regulate more aggressively and the funding to enforce those regulations. Historically, the Republican Party has been opposed to regulation. Trump's chief of staff pick, Susie Wiles, is a longtime lobbyist who has worked on behalf of the food, insurance and tobacco industries.",
      "The Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 \u2014 which involved a number of former Trump advisers, but which Trump has tried to distance himself from \u2014 would roll back dietary guidelines, making it harder to fight ultraprocessed foods.",

    "story": [
      "We may receive an affiliate commission from anything you buy from this article.",
      "In the twenty-three years since he left the White House, former President Bill Clinton has worked to refashion a life of politics as a public servant and elected official, into that of a private citizen aiming to advance the promise of America, at a time when there was emerging, in his words, \"Two Americas \u2026 with very different stories.\"",
      "In his new book, \"Citizen: My Life After the White House\" (to be published Tuesday by Knopf), Clinton considers the post-presidencies of other chief executives, from John Quincy Adams to Jimmy Carter, and how he himself is determined to \"live in the present and for the future.\"",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Tracy Smith's interview with Bill Clinton on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" November 17!",
      "\"Citizen: My Life After the White House\" by Bill Clinton",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "On January 21, 2001, after twenty-five years in politics and elected office, eight as president, I was a private citizen again. I often joked that for a few weeks, I was lost whenever I walked into a room because no one played a song to mark my arrival. \"Hail to the Chief\" was now my successor's anthem. I had loved being president, but I supported the two-term limit and was determined not to spend a day wishing I still had the job. I wanted to live in the present and for the future. Except on rare occasions, I have kept that promise to myself, though it got a lot harder after the 2016 election, harder still after the coronavirus struck, George Floyd's killing, the January 6, 2021, attack on our Capitol, and the inventive efforts of the right-wing culture warriors to find new ways to stoke grievances without sensible plans to make things better for themselves and for all the rest of us.",
      "The years after the White House are different for every former president. In 2001, I was only fifty-four, with a lot of energy, useful experience, and contacts from my years in politics that could and should be used to serve the public as a private citizen.",
      "So how should a former president do that? Several of my predecessors had made a real difference in their time, disproving John Quincy Adams's famous maxim that \"there is nothing more pathetic in life than a former President.\" Adams himself served sixteen years in Congress, two of them with Abraham Lincoln, where he led the fight against slavery on the floor of the House. He also represented the captive African Mende people aboard the Amistad in the Supreme Court, winning their release before they could be sold into slavery. Theodore Roosevelt started a new party and ran for president, finishing second in 1912, the only third-party candidate to do so. William Howard Taft became chief justice of the Supreme Court. Herbert Hoover led an effort to modernize and reorganize the federal civil service under President Harry Truman. And Jimmy Carter built a remarkable record with his foundation, eliminating the scourge of guinea worm in Africa, overseeing elections in tough places, and becoming, along with Rosalynn, the face of Habitat for Humanity.",
      "Although Hillary was now serving in the Senate, I had always been impressed by the impact she had by working with nongovernmental organizations, beginning with the Children's Defense Fund. And I had learned a lot in our White House years watching her work with civil society groups in Africa, Northern Ireland, India, and elsewhere.",
      "So I decided to set up a foundation with a flexible but clear mission: to maximize the benefits and minimize the burdens of our new century in the United States and across the world. I was excited about the possibilities and hoped I could do it.",
      "Meanwhile, I had a more immediate agenda. I wanted to support Hillary, just starting her service as a senator from New York, and Chelsea, only a few months from graduating from Stanford, so they could stay in public life if they wanted to do so and be financially secure if I didn't live long, which, given my family history, seemed likely. To do that and pay my substantial legal bills run up during the Whitewater investigations and the impeachment process, I had to start making money, something that had never interested me before. As governor of Arkansas, I had made $35,000 until the voters raised it to $60,000 a couple of months before I left office. As president I made $200,000, and paid for most of our family's expenses out of it, in large part because the job provided excellent public housing!",
      "By the time I left office, I had given a lot of thought to how to increase the opportunities and decrease the problems of our interdependence. We had to create more fairly shared prosperity, shoulder more shared responsibilities, and build more communities in which our differences are respected, but our common humanity matters more.",
      "But the America that I found myself working in had changed in many ways since I had started in politics in the 1970s, and even in the short time since I'd left the White House. Two Americas were emerging with very different stories. One believes that our diversity makes us stronger, and better able to achieve shared prosperity through shared opportunities and responsibilities and equal treatment in our local, state, and national communities. The other believes they are in a battle for all that has been lost by our increasing diversity and economic stagnation, mostly in more rural areas. They feel they've lost control over our economy, our social order, and our culture. They're determined not to lose control over our politics, and to use politics to regain control over the other three.",
      "I still believe we all do better when we work together. In such a polarized environment, that means you have to be willing to work with people who don't think like you along with those who do. Almost always, cooperation beats conflict, and when you do have to stand your ground, it's wise to leave the door open for reconciliation. The ability to do that distinguishes great leaders. Think of Nelson Mandela putting the leaders of parties who had imprisoned him for twenty-seven years in his cabinet, or Yitzhak Rabin keeping the peace process alive while acts of terror claimed the lives of innocent citizens and eventually claimed his.",
      "Following this path is challenging even in less violent times. My family has had a lot of experience with highly personal attacks which were not just hurtful to us, but hurt the country by distracting attention from the real debate: how best to meet our common challenges. When the going got rough, I tried to imagine that I was one of those big inflatable toys of the cartoon figures Baby Huey or Casper the Friendly Ghost\u2014they were big favorites of kids when I was in elementary school. You could knock them down and they always bounced right back up. To survive in politics, that's what you have to do, over and over. Maybe we should start producing those bouncing figures again, as representative of happy warriors reaching across our great divide. People could keep them at home and at work, starting and finishing every workday by knocking them down and smiling when they bounce back. It might clear our heads and help us to get back in the building and cooperating business.",
      "A life in public service can be deeply rewarding if you accept that in the constant ebb and flow of history there are no permanent victories or defeats, and never forget that every life is a story that, regardless of time and circumstance, deserves to be seen and heard.",
      "As I entered this new chapter of my life, I knew that I'd keep score the way I always have: Are people better off when you quit than when you started? Do our children have a brighter future? Are we coming together instead of falling apart?",
      "This book is the story of my twenty-three-plus years since leaving the White House, told largely through the stories of other people who changed my life as I tried to help change theirs, of those who supported me, including those I loved and lost, and of the mistakes I made along the way.",
      "I'm very grateful that, with the help of my family, friends new and old, a great staff, and the endurance of my curiosity, energy, and ability to work, I have been able to have a life full of new experiences and new ways to help and empower people as a private citizen while finding real joy in our small but growing family. I've loved cheering Hillary on as a senator, secretary of state, presidential candidate both in 2008 and in 2016, and watching with wonder the life Chelsea has built with her work in the private sector, in academia, the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Health Access Initiative, with the books she's authored, and her family life with Marc, whom I love and admire. Chelsea says she and Marc are teaching their kids to \"be brave and be kind.\" It shows. I love being their grandfather, and am so glad Chelsea and Marc welcome Hillary and me to be involved in their lives.",
      "When this book comes out, I'll be seventy-eight\u2014the oldest person in my family since my maternal great-grandparents, straight out of American Gothic, made it into their late seventies. But I still think and dream about how people can live better lives together, and still want to help them do it. I can't sit still and can't go back. So, as many people do every day, I aim to get caught trying. It's the real American way.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 10:53:18 -0500",
    "summary": "Even with unified GOP control of government, Trump's agenda and some of his more controversial nominees may run into some opposition.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 When President-elect Donald Trump returns to office next year with Republican majorities in the House and Senate, he'll enjoy a unified government that's expected to ease the way for his agenda and his Cabinet and other nominees.",
      "But even with unified party control of government, approving a president's agenda is no easy feat \u2014 and opposition from members of a president's own party is expected, especially given the narrow majorities.",
      "Here's what to know about unified government under a second Trump term:",
      "A Republican-led House and Senate",
      "The GOP secured narrow majorities in both chambers in the 2024 elections, with at least 52 seats in the Senate and 218 in the House. But both margins are extremely narrow and may even shrink temporarily as Trump selects GOP members of Congress for top administration posts. Still, he and allies are bullish about the mandate Republicans have been given with their election victories, pledging to move swiftly on his agenda.",
      "\"The only way we're able to work quickly is because we have unified control of the Congress \u2014 both chambers now and the White House \u2014 beginning in January,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said Tuesday, celebrating Republicans' \"decisive win across the nation.\"",
      "Trump also came into office in his first term with majorities in the House and Senate, with a larger majority in the House eight years ago, becoming the second Republican president since President Dwight D. Eisenhower to enjoy a trifecta upon taking office. But Republicans acknowledge that they squandered opportunities in the beginning of his first term and have vowed to move more quickly this time.",
      "\"We all look back and recognize that the Republican Party was not fully prepared for that moment, and precious time was wasted in the beginning of that Congress,\" Johnson said. \"We are not going to make those mistakes again; we will be ready on Day One.\"",
      "In the upper chamber, Sen. John Thune, elected this week to serve as majority leader in the next Congress after 17 years with Sen. Mitch McConnell at the helm, celebrated the GOP victory.",
      "\"Now the real work begins \u2014 delivering on our agenda,\" Thune said.",
      "Implementing Trump's agenda",
      "At the top of the list of pledges Trump made during his campaign is border security. He pledged to shut down the border on Day One and conduct mass deportations.",
      "Johnson and Thune, too, say border security is a top priority. Earlier this year, a bipartisan group of senators negotiated the strictest immigration legislation in decades, but Senate Republicans ultimately blocked the package at Trump's urging.",
      "The Republican-led approach on border security next year, should it materialize, is expected to go further and is likely to face resistance from Democrats and even some within Trump's party.",
      "Republicans are also eager to enact new economic policies, including extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts that are set to expire in 2025, along with policies aimed at restoring U.S. energy dominance and cutting government spending waste.",
      "With narrow majorities in both chambers, Trump's key legislative priorities could still face obstacles. Sen. Todd Young of Indiana, who's among a handful of Senate Republicans who have reliably broken with Trump in the past, outlined to CBS News that with 60 votes needed to end debate on most legislation in the Senate, \"by definition, the Trump administration will need Democratic votes to do big things.\"",
      "\"In recent history I've been quite good at working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle,\" Young said, adding that he's hopeful he can \"help President Trump advance his agenda.\"",
      "For the Senate, the first task will be approving Trump's nominations.",
      "Confirming Trump's Cabinet nominees",
      "Some of Trump's Cabinet selections are making waves across the political sphere, prompting questions from some GOP senators about whether some controversial nominees will be able to make it through Senate confirmation.",
      "While some selections were expected, others have caught even Republicans by surprise. At the top of that category is Trump's selection for attorney general, former Rep. Matt Gaetz, a GOP firebrand who was under investigation by the House Ethics Committee for allegations of sexual misconduct and obstruction.",
      "Thune said the Senate's priority at the start of the year will be confirming Trump's nominees, pledging to oversee an aggressive schedule until the nominees are confirmed.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump has suggested he'd like to get his eventual nominees in place through recess appointments, effectively bypassing the Senate's confirmation process in a maneuver that hasn't been utilized in a decade. High-ranking Republican senators, including Thune, have said that they will work to process Trump's nominees at a rapid clip, while remaining open to recess nominations.",
      "Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican who lost a bid for leader to Thune, told reporters on Thursday that both the president's authority to make recess appointments and the Senate's advice and consent responsibilities are granted by the Constitution.",
      "\"The question is, how do you reconcile those two,\" Cornyn said.",
      "\"I think we all would like for the President to be successful and I agree he's had a mandate here,\" Cornyn also said. \"But we have a job to do, as well.\"",
      "The first 100 days",
      "The first 100 days of a president's term have historically been a yardstick to measure the new leader's governing ability. It's a practice that Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in Governance Studies at Brookings, characterizes as \"mythical.\"",
      "\"It's mythical because of Franklin Roosevelt,\" she said. \"And that's also why it's never happened again.\"",
      "Roosevelt, who quickly swore in his entire Cabinet and passed a slew of key legislation in the beginning of his term, had massive majorities in the House and Senate, paired with large Electoral College and popular vote victories. The unified control enabled Roosevelt to have \"a spectacular 100 days,\" Kamarck added.",
      "Since then, the first 100 days has been the first benchmark at which the effectiveness of a president is judged: is the Cabinet appointed and confirmed by the Senate? What signature legislation has been enacted? During Trump's first term, his first 100 days were marked by a pile of executive orders, a chaotic and lengthy effort to confirm his Cabinet and setbacks on his pledge to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and repeal the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The dynamics are different as Trump prepares for his second term, with the party more unified behind him, a stronger relationship with lawmakers and a better grasp of the workings of government than when he first took office in 2017.",
      "Speaking to the House Republican conference on Wednesday, Trump reveled in the shared GOP victory.",
      "\"Isn't it nice to win?\" Trump said. \"It's nice to win.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 23:14:51 -0500",
    "summary": "A recess appointment would allow Trump to install some officials and sidestep lengthy hearings and a floor vote.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump's selection of former Rep. Matt Gaetz to be attorney general is his most controversial Cabinet pick yet, and the Florida Republican is likely to face obstacles in the confirmation process.",
      "But Trump is seeking an important change to the Senate confirmation process that would allow him to install some officials and sidestep lengthy hearings and a floor vote, in which nominees need a majority vote to be confirmed.",
      "Before Senate Republicans elected their leaders for the upcoming 119th Congress, Trump demanded that the candidates agree to recess appointments, which would give him the option of bypassing the Senate's role of approving or rejecting the president's nominations. Trump argued that without the ability to temporarily install nominees he would not be able to fill the positions in a timely manner.",
      "The legal basis for recess appointments emanates from a constitutional clause that gives the president \"the power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate.\" A Supreme Court ruling in 2014 concluded that recess appointments could only be made when the Senate is not in session for 10 or more days, after President Barack Obama made controversial appointments when senators were on break.",
      "Senators often leave Washington for long stretches of time, but have utilized pro forma sessions to prevent presidents from installing nominees without their consent.",
      "\"In recent years, the Senate \u2014 regardless of which party controlled it \u2014 has used pro forma sessions to ensure that it is never in recess for more than three days,\" said Josh Chafetz, a law and politics professor at Georgetown University.",
      "For Trump to make recess appointments, the Senate would have to agree, through a simple majority vote, to go on recess for at least 10 days. The House must also agree to allow the Senate to adjourn, but Chavetz says if the House does not agree, or if it disagrees with the Senate on the length of adjournment, then the president has the constitutional power to adjourn both chambers for a timeframe of his choosing.",
      "\"That second route has never been used before in U.S. history, so no one is quite sure how it would work,\" Chafetz said.",
      "A recess appointment, however, does not have the same benefits as a nominee confirmed by the Senate. Without Senate approval, the appointee would not be paid. The appointee can serve in the role for up to two years, depending on when the appointment was made. After that, the individual could be installed again through a recess appointment or the regular confirmation process.",
      "Some senators, including Republicans who will be in the majority come January, showed little appetite for giving up their constitutional power, especially after Trump announced that he intended to nominate Gaetz to lead the Justice Department.",
      "\"I was shocked,\" Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said Wednesday. \"If the president proceeds with that nominee, I think it shows the importance of having the Senate advice and consent process.\"",
      "\"I have concerns that he can't get across the finish line, and we're going to spend a lot of political capital,\" Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota told reporters Thursday. \"I say we. A lot of people will spend a lot of political capital on something that, that even if they got done, you'd have to wonder if it was worth it.\"",
      "Cramer added that Gaetz has \"got a really steep hill to climb to get lots of votes, including mine.\"",
      "Gaetz resigned from Congress on Wednesday after Trump announced his selection. The timing came days before a House panel was set to vote on releasing a report on whether Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct. Gaetz was also the subject of a previous Justice Department investigation that sought to determine if he violated sex trafficking and obstruction of justice laws. No charges were filed, and Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "\"We have a process around here for considering presidential nominees,\" Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said Thursday when asked by reporters about Gaetz. \"That's a constitutional responsibility of the Senate, and I intend to play my part as a member of the Judiciary Committee in doing that vetting and advice and consent.\"",
      "\"I don't think we should be circumventing the Senate's responsibilities, but I think it's premature to be talking about recess appointments,\" Cornyn added.",
      "The Senate Judiciary Committee is responsible for conducting confirmation hearings for the attorney general nominee. Several other Judiciary Committee members also weighed in Thursday.",
      "\"The bottom line is our responsibility in the Senate is advice and consent,\" said Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the committee chairman.",
      "Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said recess appointments should be used \"judiciously,\" adding that he has concerns about \"blanket recess appointments.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said he could name between \"five to 10 Republicans who are seriously considering voting against\" Gaetz \"and insisting that there will be a vote.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri indicated he would not have an issue if Trump made recess appointments, saying the president \"has total authority to make recess appointments.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware urged his Republican colleagues to protect their role in confirmations and encourage Trump to pick confirmable candidates.",
      "Grace Kazarian and \n                                                  \n                      Laura Garrison\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Suicides among military service members rose in 2023 continuing a gradual rise in suicides among active-duty forces, persisting despite prevention efforts.",
      "The Defense Department's annual report on suicides in the military released Thursday said suicides among active-duty military rose from 331 in 2022 to 363 in 2023.",
      "\"Admittedly yes, that long-term trend is gradually increasing,\" Dr. Timothy Hoyt, Deputy Director of the Office of Force Resiliency at the Defense Department told reporters on a call.",
      "The suicide rate has grown from 17 per 100,000 active duty service members in 2011 to 26 in 2023, according to data released in the annual report for 2023, although the rate decreased for one year from 2020-2021.",
      "Active duty service members who died by suicide in 2023 were largely enlisted males under the age of 30, accounting for 61% of suicides. The most common method of suicide was firearms, at 65%, followed by hanging or asphyxiation, at 28%.",
      "Defense officials said the suicide rates were similar to rates across the U.S. population between 2011 and 2022.",
      "\"We are not immune to the factors that drive suicide throughout the U.S., and our service members face, in addition to those, a number of unique military challenges,\" Hoyt said.",
      "He added recommendations from the Suicide Prevention Response and Independent Review Committee have given a \"mechanism by which we can address as many of those potential risks as possible and make investments in those spaces.\"",
      "The Pentagon set up the review committee to provide recommendations to reduce suicide deaths\u00a0in the military. Last year the committee made a series of recommendations, including broadly improving the delivery of mental health care, addressing stigma and other barriers to care and revising suicide prevention training.",
      "Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin who established the review committee mandated by Congress in 2022 said in a statement that the annual report's findings \"urgently demonstrate the need for the Department to redouble its work in the complex fields of suicide prevention and postvention.\" Austin said the Defense Department completed 20 of the 83 committee's recommendations.",
      "The Pentagon expects to spend about $250 million on suicide prevention in fiscal year 2025, the largest amount of funds the Defense Department has ever invested, Hoyt told reporters.",
      "\"A lot of the time where we've done initiatives during the past two decades, there's been insufficient investment in making sure that those have staying power, that we've got a long-term implementation of those programs,\" Hoyt said.",
      "The total number of suicides across the force, including both active duty and reserve, was 523 in 2023 compared to 493 in 2022.",
      "Suicide is one of the leading causes of death for veterans\u00a0as well. According to the most recent report from the Department of Veterans Affairs, the suicide rate for 2021 was 33.9 per 100,000, up from 32.6 per 100,000 in 2020.",

      "\"I am thrilled to announce Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as The United States Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS),\" he said in a post on X. He said Americans have been \"crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation\" about public health, and Kennedy would \"Make America Great and Healthy Again!\"",
      "Kennedy has a long record of criticizing vaccines, including spreading misleading claims about their safety.",
      "He has vowed to combat an \"epidemic\" of chronic diseases and believes that large drug and food companies are to blame for a broad swath of ailments. Kennedy has claimed a number of health issues have worsened due to federal inaction, including autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, sleep disorders, infertility rates, diabetes and obesity. He has also urged removing fluoride from drinking water.",
      "Kennedy would need to be confirmed by the Senate. His odds of clearing a Senate led by Democrats would have been low, given his long record of what the party called\u00a0\"anti-science, fringe public health stances,\"\u00a0but with\u00a0Republicans in the majority\u00a0come January, Trump's nominees will have an easier path to confirmation.",
      "Despite the expected opposition to Kennedy's nomination \u2014 along with other controversial choices to lead national security agencies and former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz to lead the Justice Department \u2014 Trump has told associates in recent days he is standing by his pick for health chief.",
      "\"No one can talk him out of it,\" one of the sources familiar with the pick said Thursday.",
      "Trump promised during the campaign to let Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic and former environmental lawyer, \"go wild\" on issues relating to health, food and medicine.",
      "\"I'm going to let him go wild on health. I'm going to let him go wild on the food. I'm going to let him go wild on medicines,\" Trump said in the final days before the election. \"The only thing I don't think I'm going to let him even get near is the liquid gold that we have under our feet \u2026 sometimes referred to as oil and gas.\"",
      "The sprawling HHS Department encompasses a number of agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration. As HHS Secretary, Kennedy would also oversee the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is charged with caring for undocumented and unaccompanied children apprehended along the border.",
      "The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a watchdog group that often clashes with the FDA and in some ways is closely aligned with Kennedy's calls to get chemicals out of foods, put out a statement condemning his nomination.",
      "\"Nominating an anti-vaxxer like Kennedy to HHS is like putting a Flat Earther at the head of NASA,\" the group's president, Dr. Peter G. Lurie, said in a statement. \"CSPI opposes this nomination and any other nominees who are a direct threat to science and evidence-based solutions.\"",
      "But one prominent Democrat, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, said in a social media post that he was \"excited by the news\" of Kennedy's nomination. He praised Kennedy for helping to defeat vaccine mandates in Colorado in 2019 but said he hoped that Kennedy would embrace personal choice on vaccines, rather than banning them. He also said he was optimistic about Kennedy's vow to take on big pharma and high drug costs for Americans. Polis also backed Kennedy's criticism of \"entire departments, like the nutrition department at the FDA\" that \"are not doing their job, they're not protecting our kids,\" in particular from pesticides used in agriculture.",
      "Polis later clarified his praise, saying, \"Science must remain THE cornerstone of our nation's health policy and the science-backed decision to get vaccinated improves public health and safety.\"",

      "Kennedy said there were three issues that convinced him to endorse Trump: free speech, the war in Ukraine and what he called the \"war on our children.\" He said processed foods, chemicals and obesity were destroying the health of children in the U.S.",
      "At an August rally with Kennedy, Trump vowed to establish a panel to investigate chronic health problems and childhood diseases, as well as establish an independent presidential commission on assassination attempts that would be tasked with releasing all of the remaining documents related to President John F.

    "summary": "Among the 757 reports received, 4% had unusual descriptions, like \"green fireball\" or \"a jelly fish with [multicolored] flashing lights.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Pentagon office investigating reports of unidentified anomalous phenomena, the government's term for UFOs, received 21 reports last year that contain enough data for the intelligence community to continue actively investigating.",
      "The majority of the reports the office received described orbs, lights, cylinders, but about 4% fell into the category of \"other\" and included unique descriptions like \"green fireball,\" \"a jelly fish with [multicolored] flashing lights\" or a \"silver rocket approximately six feet long\" (these were not necessarily among the 21 that the intelligence community will continue to actively investigate).",
      "\"There are interesting cases that with my physics and engineering background and time in the [intelligence community], I do not understand, and I don't know anybody else understands them,\" Dr. Jon Kosloski, director, All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) told reporters during a briefing on the unclassified version of the annual report mandated by Congress.",
      "Kosloski said the office has found \"no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technologies,\" and he said none of the cases point to foreign adversaries or breakthrough technologies.",
      "In total, the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office received 757 reports of UAP between May 1, 2023 and June 1, 2024. Of the 757 received, 485 occurred during that time period, while 272 occurred outside of the reporting period but were not included in previous reports.",
      "The office resolved 49 of the cases by identifying the object as various types of balloons, birds or drones, and it expects to resolve 243 others by identifying them as one of those objects, as well.",
      "Another 444 didn't have enough data to keep investigating, so the office will go into the its active archive to see if other data can be found.",
      "Twenty-one merit further analysis, and these cases Kosloski found interesting because they correspond with the typical shapes the office receives reports on, like orbs, triangles, and cylinders, and at least \"one of those cases has been happening for an extended period of time.\"",
      "Kosloski acknowledged that even though investigators have not identified any of the cases as breakthrough technologies, the office can't rule it out.",
      "\"We're open to that as an explanation for it, but we're just not attributing breakthrough technology as the explanation to it,\" Kosloski said. \"An open mind works both ways. So if we don't understand what it is, we can't say that it is or it is not breakthrough technology.\"",
      "The AARO expects to soon release the second volume of the U.S. Government Involvement with Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena detailing the government's investigatory efforts from November 2023 to April 2024. The first volume released earlier this year looked at efforts from 1945 to 2023.",

      "The jail in Georgia's largest county, Fulton County, leaves its inmates vulnerable to \"substantial risk of serious harm from violence\" and violates their constitutional and statutory rights, according to a new Justice Department report released Thursday.",
      "After a more than year-long civil rights probe into the Fulton County Jail \u2013 which has long been plagued by overcrowding, understaffing and violence \u2014 federal investigators concluded detainees are subjected to \"dangerous and unsanitary\" conditions, like pest infestations and malnourishment. These conditions especially endanger those with mental health conditions, the report found.",
      "\"None of these problems are new,\" the report said. \"And despite widespread awareness of these issues, the unconstitutional and illegal conditions have persisted.\"",
      "The Justice Department launched its civil investigation into Fulton County's jail in July 2023, after at least four Black inmates died in the mental health unit in a matter of weeks, including two who were killed by their cellmates. \"Within weeks of opening our investigation, six more Black men had died in the Jail,\" the Justice Department revealed. The family of one inmate, Lashawn Johnson, said he died in in the jail in 2022, after he was \"eaten alive\" by insects and bedbugs. About 91% of the jail's total population is Black, according to the report, compared to 45% of the overall Fulton County population.",
      "Justice Department investigators conducted multiple site visits, expert consultations and interviews with inmates and staff.",
      "Crumbling infrastructure, failing security, abusive staff and insufficient medical and mental health treatment contributed to the overall unconstitutional conditions described in the report.",
      "According to the county sheriff, 62% of the jail's inmates suffer from mental health or substance use disorders and the staff failed to provide proper treatment or take steps to mitigate risks of suicide.",
      "\"We found that 75% of those who died in the Jail since January 2021 had a current mental health diagnosis or reported a history of mental illness,\" the report said.",
      "Justice Department investigators noted in their findings that Fulton County and the sheriff sought to remedy some of the issues, including by surging millions in emergency funding and sending some inmates to detention facilities in other districts.",
      "Still, the problems persisted. In 2024, three men in Fulton County's main jail have died, including one person who was stabbed 20 times in April. From 2022 to the present, according to the report, \"six incarcerated people have died in violent attacks.\" All six victims were Black men, the Justice Department said.",
      "Non-lethal violent assaults are also rampant inside the jail. In 2023, the Sheriff's Office said there were 1,054 assaults and more than 300 stabbings in the jail. The investigation also uncovered a pattern or practice of sexual abuse, according to the report.",
      "Announcing the report's findings, Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Department said officials in Fulton County have taken \"preliminary steps\" to address the issues outlined in the report, but such measures are \"not enough.\"",
      "The Justice Department's report outlines various remedial measures the jail must carry out to improve the conditions, like increased accountability measures for staff, overhauling how the jail secures its facilities from violence and contraband, and ensuring proper suicide prevention measures.",
      "\"At the end of the day, people do not abandon their civil and constitutional rights at the jailhouse door,\" Clarke said. \"We can fix these problems,\" she added later.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists say they have found the world's largest coral near the Pacific's Solomon Islands, announcing Thursday a major discovery \"pulsing with life and color.\" The coral is so immense that researchers sailing the crystal waters of the Solomon archipelago initially thought they'd stumbled across a hulking shipwreck.",
      "\"Just when we think there is nothing left to discover on planet Earth, we find a massive coral made of nearly one billion little polyps, pulsing with life and color,\" marine ecologist Enric Sala said.",
      "The standalone structure, formed from a \"complex network\" of tiny coral polyps, has likely been growing for 300 years or more, the researchers said.",
      "At about 111 feet wide and 104 feet long, the team said the \"mega coral\" was three times bigger than the previous record holder \u2014 a coral dubbed \"Big Momma\" in American Samoa. The massive coral is not a coral reef, structures that can be far larger but are comprised of many distinct coral colonies, they explained.",
      "\"While Big Momma looked like a huge scoop of ice cream plopped down on the reef, this newly discovered coral is as if the ice cream started to melt, spreading forever along the seafloor,\" said lead scientist Molly Timmers.",
      "It's longer than a blue whale and thought to be \"so colossal\" that it could be seen from space.",
      "The coral was discovered at the southeastern tip of the Solomon Islands, in an area known as the Three Sisters. It was spotted by a National Geographic team embarking on a scientific expedition in the region.",
      "Hotter and more acidic oceans have drained the life from corals in many of the region's tropical waters, a process called bleaching, including Australia's famed Great Barrier Reef. But this latest discovery offered a small glimmer of hope, the research team said.",
      "\"While the nearby shallow reefs were degraded due to warmer seas, witnessing this large healthy coral oasis in slightly deeper waters is a beacon of hope,\" said coral scientist Eric Brown.",
      "The lush rainforests and pristine waters of the Solomon Islands have long been celebrated for their ecological diversity. Wildlife observations made in the area in the 1920s helped prove a key part of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.",
      "\"There is so much to learn about the richness of marine life and the ocean ecosystem, but this finding opens doors of knowledge,\" said top Solomon Islands official Collin Beck. \"More scientific research is needed to better understand our rich biodiversity and our planet.\"",

    "summary": "Seal-shaped boards decked with bright horizontal lights were less likely to be attacked by great white sharks, researchers found.",
    "story": [
      "Covering your surfboard in bright lights sounds like an open invitation to great white sharks, but research released Tuesday by Australian scientists found it might actually stave off attacks.",
      "Biologist Laura Ryan said the predator often attacked its prey from underneath, occasionally mistaking a surfer's silhouette for the outline of a seal.",
      "Ryan and her fellow researchers showed that seal-shaped boards decked with bright horizontal lights were less likely to be attacked by great white sharks.",
      "This appeared to be because the lights distorted the silhouette on the ocean's surface, making it appear less appetizing.",
      "\"There is this longstanding fear of white sharks and part of that fear is that we don't understand them that well,\" said Ryan, from Australia's Macquarie University.",
      "The study, published in the journal Current Biology, was conducted in the waters of South Africa's Mossel Bay, a popular great white feeding ground.",
      "Seal-shaped decoys were strung with different configurations of LED lights and towed behind a boat to see which attracted the most attention.",
      "Brighter lights were better at deterring sharks, the research found, while vertical lights were less effective than horizontal.",

      "\"It's like an invisibility cloak but with the exception that we are splitting the object, the visual silhouette, into smaller bits,\" Hart said.",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 07:02:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Oil and natural gas companies will have to pay a federal fee if they emit methane above certain levels under a rule being finalized by the Biden administration that incoming Trump officials are likely to reverse.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Oil and natural gas companies for the first time will have to pay a federal fee if they emit dangerous methane above certain levels under a rule being made final by the Biden administration.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency rule follows through on a directive from Congress included in the 2022 climate law. The new fee is intended to encourage industry to adopt best practices that reduce emissions of methane - the primary component of natural gas - and thereby avoid paying.",
      "Methane is a climate \"super pollutant\" that is far more potent in the short term than carbon dioxide and is responsible for about one-third of greenhouse gas emissions. The oil and natural gas sector is the largest industrial source of methane emissions in the United States, and advocates say reduction of methane emissions is a crucial way to slow climate change.",
      "The rule, set to be announced Tuesday at an international climate conference in Azerbaijan, comes hours after President-elect Donald Trump named former New York congressman Lee Zeldin to head the agency in Trump's second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Zeldin is expected to move to reverse or loosen dozens of environmental regulations approved under President Biden as Trump seeks to establish U.S. \"energy dominance\u2033 worldwide.",
      "Trump is likely to target the methane fee amid a flurry of expected actions he has promised to deregulate the oil and gas industry.",
      "As outlined by the EPA, excess methane produced in 2024 could result in a fee of $900 per ton, with fees rising to $1,200 per ton in 2025 and $1,500 per ton by 2026. Industry groups are likely to challenge the rule, including any effort to impose a retroactive fee.",
      "The rule wouldn't become final until early next year, following publication in the Federal Register.",
      "EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement that the rule will work in tandem with a new EPA rule on methane emissions imposed this year. The rule targets the U.S. oil and natural gas industry for its role in global warming as Mr. Biden seeks to secure his legacy on fighting climate change.",
      "The fee, formally known as the Waste Emissions Charge, will encourage early deployment of available technologies to reduce methane emissions and other harmful air pollutants, Regan said. The fee \"is the latest in a series of actions under President Biden's methane strategy to improve efficiency in the oil and gas sector, support American jobs, protect clean air and reinforce U.S. leadership on the global stage,\" he said.",
      "Industry groups and Republican-led states have challenged the earlier methane rule in court, but lost a bid for the Supreme Court to block the rule while the case continues before lower-level judges.",
      "Opponents argue that the EPA overstepped its authority and set unattainable standards with the new regulations. The EPA, though, said the rules are squarely within its legal responsibilities and would protect the public.",
      "Many large oil and gas companies already meet or exceed methane-performance levels set by Congress under the climate law, meaning they are unlikely to be forced to pay the new fee, Regan and other officials said.",
      "Even so, the EPA estimates that the rule will result in cumulative emissions reductions of 1.2 million metric tons of methane (the equivalent of 34 million metric tons of carbon-dioxide) through 2035. That figure is similar to clean-air gains from taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year, the EPA said. Cumulative climate benefits could total as much $2 billion, the agency said.",
      "Like the earlier methane rule, the new fee faces a near-certain legal challenge from industry groups. The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's largest lobbying group, called a fee proposed earlier this year a \"punitive tax increase\" that \"undermines America's energy advantage.''",
      "The API said it looks forward to working with Congress to repeal the \"misguided new tax on American energy.\"",
      "Environmental groups, for their part, have hailed the impending methane fee, saying oil and gas companies should be held accountable for pollution that contributes to global warming. Oil and gas companies routinely calculate that it's cheaper to waste methane through flaring and other techniques than to make necessary upgrades to prevent leaks, they said.",
      "The EPA said it expects that over time, fewer oil and gas companies will be charged for excess methane as they reduce emissions in compliance with the rule.",

    "story": [
      "Beirut \u2014 Declassified 1970s-era U.S. spy satellite imagery has led a British-Iraqi archeological team to what they believe is the site of a seventh-century battle that became decisive in the spread of Islam throughout the region.",
      "The Battle of al-Qadisiyah was fought in Mesopotamia \u2014 in present-day Iraq \u2014 in the A.D. 630s between Arab Muslims and the army of the Sassanid Persian dynasty during a period of Muslim expansion. The Arab army prevailed and continued on its march into Persia, now Iran.",
      "A joint team of archeologists from the U.K.'s Durham University and the University of Al-Qadisiyah stumbled across the site while undertaking a remote sensing survey to map the Darb Zubaydah, a pilgrimage route from Iraq's Kufa to Mecca in Saudi Arabia built more than 1,000 years ago. The findings were published Tuesday in the journal Antiquity.",
      "While mapping the route, the team noticed that a site some 20 miles south of Kufa in Iraq's southern Najaf province \u2014 a desert area with scattered plots of agricultural land \u2014 had features that closely matched the description of the al-Qadisiyah battle site described in historic texts.",
      "William Deadman, a specialist in archaeological remote sensing at Durham University, said the Cold War era satellite images are commonly used tools by archeologists working in the Middle East because the older images often show features that have been destroyed or altered and wouldn't show up on present-day satellite images.",
      "\"The Middle East has developed so much in the last 50 years, both agricultural expansion and urban expansion,\" he said. Some of the distinguishing features at the al-Qadisiyah site, such as a distinctive trench, were \"much more pristine and clear\" in the 1970s images, he said.",
      "A survey on the ground confirmed the findings and convinced the team that they had correctly identified the site.",
      "The key features were a deep trench, two fortresses and an ancient river that was reportedly once forded by elephant-mounted Persian troops, said Jaafar Jotheri, a professor of archeology at the University of Al-Qadisiyah who's part of the team that made the discovery. The survey team also found pottery shards consistent with the time period when the battle took place.",
      "A revealing, well-known battle",
      "Jotheri said Iraqis of his generation, who grew up under the rule of Saddam Hussein, were all familiar with the battle in minute detail, down to the names of the generals on both sides.",
      "The battle at the time had political connotations \u2014 Iraq was engaged in a devastating war with Iran through much of the 1980s. Saddam pointed to the Battle of Qadisiyah as a harbinger of victory for Iraq.",
      "Like most children growing up in that era, Jotheri said he'd watched a popular movie about the battle multiple times as it was on regular rotation on television.",
      "In the post-Saddam era, al-Qadisiyah has become something of a political litmus test. Iraqis' views of the battle vary depending on their feelings toward Iran, which has expanded its influence in the country since the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq that toppled Saddam.",
      "\"There is some political and religious context in this battle because now, of course, we have religious differences, ethnic differences, political differences in Iraq and we read or we view everything based on our \u2026 differences,\" Jotheri said. But he added, \"We all agree that it is a very important battle, a decisive one, and we all know about it.\"",
      "Discovery was part of a regional trend",
      "The team plans to begin excavations at the site in the coming year, Jotheri said.",
      "The discovery comes as part of a broader project launched in 2015 to document endangered archaeological sites in the region.",
      "It also comes at the time of a resurgence of archeology in Iraq, a country often referred to as the \"cradle of civilization,\" but where archeological exploration has been stunted by decades of conflict that halted excavations and led to the looting of tens of thousands of artifacts.",

    "story": [
      "When astronomy fans look to the sky this week, they'll get to see November's Beaver full moon, the last of 2024's four consecutive supermoons.",
      "The 2024 series of supermoons started in August with a rare supermoon blue moon. After this month's Beaver Moon, there won't be another supermoon until late next year.",
      "Why is the November full moon called the Beaver Moon?",
      "November's full moon is called the Beaver Moon, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. The name was chosen because this is the time of year when beavers start sheltering in their lodges after having prepared food stores for the winter.",
      "This month's full moon also has several other names tied to winter and animals preparing for the cold weather. Other full names for the November full moon are the Frost Moon, the Freezing Moon, the Digging Moon, the Deer Rutting Moon and the Algonquin Whitefish Moon.",
      "When will the November supermoon be visible?",
      "The full moon is expected to reach its peak on Friday, Nov. 15, at 4:29 p.m. EST, NASA said. The Old Farmer's Almanac details specific moonrise times for different ZIP codes across the U.S.",
      "Around 96% of the moon's nearside will be illuminated by the sun on Thursday, according to NASA. By Friday, 100% of the moon's nearside will be illuminated. About 99% of it will be illuminated by the sun on Saturday and 96% of the moon will be illuminated on Sunday.",
      "You won't need binoculars or a telescope to enjoy the spectacular view.",
      "What makes supermoons special?",
      "A supermoon happens when the moon is simultaneously full and at the part of its orbit that's closest to Earth, according to NASA. The moon's distance from Earth varies between around 221,457 miles and 252,712 miles.",
      "During this month's supermoon, the moon will be about 224,385 miles from Earth.",
      "Supermoons appear larger than the average full moon. It's similar to the size difference between a quarter and a nickel, according to NASA. Supermoons are also about 16% brighter than an average moon.",
      "While all supermoons appear bigger and brighter than the average full moon, there is some variance. According to NASA, the November full moon will appear 6.2% bigger and 12.8% brighter than 2024's average full moon.",
      "When will the first supermoon of 2025 occur?",
      "Next year, expect three supermoons, starting in October, according to earthsky.org. There will be one on Oct. 7, 2025, followed by Nov. 5 and Dec. 4. Then the following new year will start with a supermoon on Jan. 3, 2026.",

      "It's not the first time Google's chatbots have been called out for giving potentially harmful responses to user queries.

      "Amazon Haul \u2014 whose name is a play on social media \"hauls,\" where people show off their purchases \u2014 focuses on selling items for $20 or less, or what Amazon calls \"crazy low prices.\" In a blog post, Amazon said the new service is available in its shopping app and mobile website.",
      "Temu and Shein have won over\u00a0many Gen Z shoppers and other bargain hunters by offering low-cost clothing, electronics and other items that typically ship directly from manufacturers in China. At the same time, U.S. consumers are still feeling the bite of inflation that hit a 40-year high in the pandemic, with many searching for deals as a result.",
      "\"Amazon Haul is a response to both the rise of low-price Chinese marketplaces and the fact that consumers are increasingly seeking value for money as they try to make their budgets stretch further,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of market research firm GlobalData.",
      "He added, \"The value retail segment has been a major growth area over the past few years, and while the regular Amazon site has a good value-for-money reputation, its wide offer means that it is not primarily seen as an everyday low-price destination.\"",
      "What is Amazon Haul?",
      "Amazon Haul is an online storefront within the Amazon app that sells low-cost items, aimed especially at consumers who shop at discount retailers such as Temu and Shein.",
      "To find Amazon Haul, go to the Amazon app and search \"Haul\" in the search bar, or go to www.amazon.com/haul\u00a0on your browser.",
      "How much do Amazon Haul items cost?",
      "Amazon said everything on Amazon Haul costs less than $20, but most products are priced at $10 and less.",
      "Items available on Amazon Haul on Wednesday included a three-pack of fuzzy socks for $4.99 and a quilted tote bag for $7.99. The merchandise ranged from clothing to household items such as silicone baking mats and throw pillows.",

      "What is the delivery time for Amazon Haul items?",
      "Longer than regular Amazon items, with the company noting that the goods are typically delivered within one to two weeks.",
      "What do the experts say?",
      "Amazon Haul could help the retailer appeal to younger shoppers, noted GlobalData's Saunders. But it also raises the risk that the low-cost shopping site could cannibalize sales from Amazon's main site, he added.",

      "In a post Friday, Pence criticized Kennedy's selection as teeing up \"the most pro-abortion Republican appointed secretary of HHS in modern history.\"",
      "\"On behalf of tens of millions of pro-life Americans, I respectfully urge Senate Republicans to reject this nomination and give the American people a leader who will respect the sanctity of life,\" Pence said in a statement published by the group Advancing American Freedom, calling the choice \"deeply concerning to millions of pro-life Americans.\"",

      "Trump expressed support for Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" platform during the campaign, and offered to let him \"go wild on health\" in the new administration.",
      "\"Do whatever you want. You just go ahead. Work on pesticides, work on making women's health. He's so into women's health, and you know he's really unbelievable. It's such a passion,\" Trump said of Kennedy on Nov. 4.",

      "Before dropping out, Kennedy posted in June that he backed \"the emerging consensus that abortion should be unrestricted up until a certain point,\" while also calling for policies that could \"reduce more abortions in America by choice than by force.\"",
      "There are ways that Kennedy could go further to cement his support among anti-abortion activists, Mize said.",
      "As one \"large signal to the movement,\" Mize suggested, Kennedy could support reinstating the FDA's restrictions requiring in-person prescribing of the medication abortion pill mifepristone.

      "Former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson is set to take on YouTube sensation and current professional boxer Jake Paul in a highly anticipated heavyweight fight Friday night at the AT&T Stadium in Dallas. It will mark the first time Tyson (50-6, 44 KOs) has entered the ring for a pro bout since retiring from the sport in 2005.",
      "Paul (10-1, 7 KOs) will be fighting for the third time in 2024 in what is easily his highest-profile bout to date. The match-up between the 58-year-old Tyson and 27-year-old Paul was initially scheduled for July 20 but was rescheduled to give Tyson time to recover from medical issues stemming from a stomach ulcer.",
      "Here's what you need to know about tonight's big fight, including when and how to watch.",
      "What time is the Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul fight tonight?",
      "The Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul televised fight card\u00a0began at 8 p.m. ET (5\u00a0p.m. PT) on Netflix. There will be three professional boxing fights before Tyson and Paul enter the ring. The main event will occur once those bouts have concluded with the exact timing dependent on the length of the preceding fights.",
      "How many rounds will the Tyson vs. Paul fight have?",
      "The Tyson-Paul fight is scheduled for eight, two-minute rounds. That's slightly shorter than the typical three-minute rounds most professional men's boxing fights are scheduled for. Both men will also wear heavier boxing gloves than heavyweights often do, sporting 14-ounce gloves versus the traditional 10-ounce versions.",
      "How to watch the Tyson vs. Paul fight",
      "The Tyson vs. Paul fight will be broadcast live on Netflix and will be free for subscribers.",
      "What is Mike Tyson's boxing background?",
      "Mike Tyson is one of the most famous \u2014 and infamous \u2014 boxers in sports history. A Hall of Fame inductee, Tyson burst onto the world stage in the 1980s when he became the youngest heavyweight champion in boxing history. Combining speed and power, Tyson possessed an uncanny ability to intimidate opponents before they even entered the ring. He won his first world title in 1986 and became the undisputed champion in the years that followed. He lost his belts to Buster Douglas in 1990 in one of the biggest upsets in sports history and was incarcerated on a rape conviction from 1992 to 1995.",
      "Tyson won the World Boxing Council (WBC) and World Boxing Association (WBA) titles upon his return to the ring in the mid-1990s but then lost to Evander Holyfield in a major upset in November 1996. A highly-anticipated rematch between the two in June 1997 led to Tyson getting disqualified after he bit off a chunk of Holyfield's ear.",
      "His subsequent performances in the ring after that were largely overshadowed by bizarre antics both during the fight and in between matches. He lost his final title fight against then-heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis in June 2002 and he retired following consecutive knockout losses to other opponents in 2004 and 2005. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. He last fought in an exhibition (non-professional) match against former champion Roy Jones Jr. in November 2020.",
      "What is Jake Paul's boxing background?",
      "Jake Paul was best known as a popular YouTuber and former Disney star before he decided to become a professional boxer in 2020. He fought his second professional fight on the undercard of Tyson's fight against Jones but has since promoted himself to main event status. Loquacious and promotable, Paul currently has 27 million followers on Instagram, 18.2 million followers on TikTok and 4.6 million on X.",
      "He's been able to morph that social media success into the boxing ring, entering tonight's fight with just a single loss against 10 wins, with seven of those victories via knockout. The lone loss came against undefeated Tommy Fury, the younger brother of former undisputed heavyweight champion Tyson Fury (who, ironically, was named after Paul's opponent tonight).",
      "Who do experts predict will win the Tyson vs. Paul fight?",
      "Expert predictions for tonight's match-up vary. Former opponents Lewis and Jones are both predicting a Tyson victory as is his namesake, Tyson Fury. Former boxing champion Oscar De La Hoya also likes Tyson but former heavyweight champ Anthony Joshua is going with Paul as is Paul's brother, Logan. Oddsmakers have had Paul as the slight favorite but the betting line has been moving more toward Tyson throughout fight week, according to ESPN.",

One operative working for Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps told federal investigators that he was tasked in September with \"surveilling, and, ultimately, assassinating\" Trump, according to court records unsealed last week.",
      "Prosecutors said Farhad Shakeri, who is believed to be residing in Iran, told investigators in a phone interview that unnamed IRGC officials pushed him to plan an attack against Trump to take place in October. If the plan could not come together in time, the Iranian officials directed Shakeri to delay the plot until after the election because the official \"assessed that [Trump] would lose the election,\" the charging documents said.",
      "In early August, a Pakistani national with alleged ties to Iran was arrested and charged with plotting a murder-for-hire scheme targeting U.S. government officials and politicians, according to charging documents unsealed Tuesday.",

He exited the international Iran nuclear agreement, which had lifted some sanctions in exchange for restrictions on Iran's nuclear program. He also directed the 2020 airstrike that killed top Iranian commander Gen. Qasem Soleimani. Since then, some Trump administration officials and military officials received threats from the regime, among them, Robert O'Brien, who was national security adviser during the strike. His predecessor in the job, John Bolton, who was part of the maximum pressure campaign that exerted sanctions pressure on Tehran, has also received threats.",
      "In 2022, the U.S. intelligence community assessed that Iran would threaten Americans \u2014 both directly and via proxy attacks \u2014 and was committed to developing networks inside the U.S. Two persistent threat assessments submitted to Congress by the State Department in January 2022 cited a \"serious and credible threat\" to the lives of former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former Trump administration Iran envoy Brian Hook. The non-public assessments showed that throughout 2021 and again in 2022, the State Department determined that round-the-clock, U.S.-taxpayer-funded diplomatic security details were needed to protect both men. That continues today.",
      "Multiple former officials have spoken to CBS about duty-to-warn notices that they have recently received from the FBI and other agencies regarding the ongoing threat from Iran and Iranian-hired actors, implying the U.S. is taking the threat seriously and not taking the Iranian regime's assurances at face value.",

    "summary": "Former Fox News host Pete Hegseth is President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be defense secretary.",
    "story": [
      "A man who in 2021 was a member of the same National Guard unit as Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be defense secretary, confirmed he sent a letter to his superiors warning that a tattoo Hegseth bears indicated that he was a potential \"insider threat\" ahead of President Biden's inauguration.",
      "The Associated Press reported that 12 U.S. National Guard members were removed from helping to secure Mr. Biden's 2021 inauguration after vetting by the U.S. military and FBI. They were found to have made extremist statements in posts or text messages or had ties with right-wing militia groups. In an interview with podcaster Shawn Ryan, Hegseth said he was one of the National Guard members removed from securing the inauguration.",
      "\"I was deemed an extremist because of a tattoo by my National Guard unit in Washington, D.C., and my orders were revoked to guard the Biden inauguration\u2026 a Jerusalem cross tattoo which is just a Christian symbol,\" he told Ryan.",
      "But that's not the tattoo that his fellow guardsman, DeRicko Gaither, pointed out to his superiors. He told CBS News, \"When I looked at the pictures \u2013 in one he had the tattoo of the Jerusalem Cross, which I didn't think was a problem.\"",
      "\"The next photo he had on his inner bicep he had a bicep that said 'Deux Vult,'\" Gaither said. \"I looked it up, and that tattoo had ties to extremist groups. So, I sent to my leadership. I included the photo attachment and the Army policy about tattoos. I said I just want you to know what's going on. I received a response saying Pete had been removed from the mission.\"",
      "He said in his letter, which CBS News obtained, \"White-Supremacist use of #Deus Vult and a return to medieval Catholicism, is to invoke the myth of a white Christian (i.e. Catholic) medieval past that wishes to ignore the actual demographics and theological state of Catholicism today.\"",
      "He added, \"Deus Vult has enjoyed popularity with members of the alt-right because of its perceived representation of the clash of civilizations between the Christian west and the Islamic world.\"",
      "Citing a military statute that bans extremist tattoos, Gaither said the Deus Vult tattoo \"falls along the line of Insider Threat.\" The Associated Press and Reuters first reported on Gaither's warning letter to the National Guard.",
      "\"Deus Vult\" is the Christian motto that refers to divine providence. It originated as the rallying cry of the Crusaders. But experts in domestic violent extremism say the latin phrase has also been co-opted by some members of the far right in recent years.",
      "For example, Mauricio Martinez Garcia, the gunman behind the 2023 mass shooting in Allen, Texas, had a \"Deus Vult\" tattoo, according to the Anti-Defamation League, in addition to neo-Nazi tattoos. The group also says the phrase is \"commonly used as an anti-Muslim symbol.\"",
      "The Trump transition team has not responded to a request for comment. Vice President-elect JD Vance said on X of the AP's story, \"They're attacking Pete Hegseth for having a Christian motto tattooed on his arm. This is disgusting anti-Christian bigotry.\" Hegseth reshared Vance's post and commented, \"They can target me \u2014 I don't give a damn \u2014 but this type of targeting of Christians, conservatives, patriots and everyday Americans will stop on DAY ONE at DJT's DoD.\"",
      "The National Guard declined to comment on whether Hegseth had been removed from the detail or why, and issued a statement that just said, \"Maj. Peter Hegseth joined the D.C. Army National Guard on June 6, 2019, and remained a member of the DCNG until March 31, 2021. He was in an M-Day, traditional drilling service member, status and available for duty if required during the presidential inauguration of 2021.\"",

    "story": [
      "A Venezuelan man \"went hunting for females on the University of Georgia's campus\" earlier this year and ended up killing nursing student Laken Riley after a struggle, a prosecutor said Friday. The man's lawyer, though, said the evidence is circumstantial and doesn't prove his client is guilty.",
      "Jose Ibarra, who entered the U.S. illegally, is charged with murder in the February killing, which helped fan the immigration debate during this year's presidential campaign. Ibarra waived his right to a jury trial, meaning his case is being heard and decided by Athens-Clarke County Superior Court Judge H. Patrick Haggard.",
      "Prosecutor Sheila Ross told the judge that Ibarra encountered Riley Feb. 22 while she was running on the University of Georgia campus in Athens. Riley, 22, was a student at Augusta University College of Nursing, which also has a campus in the city that is about 70 miles east of Atlanta.",
      "\"When Laken Riley refused to be his rape victim, he bashed her skull in with a rock repeatedly,\" Ross said, adding that the evidence would show that Riley \"fought for her life, for her dignity.\"",
      "As a result of that fight, Ibarra's DNA was left under her fingernails, Ross said. Riley called 911 and, in a struggle over her phone, Ibarra's thumbprint was left on the screen, she said.",
      "That forensic evidence is sufficient to prove Ibarra's guilt, but digital and video evidence also prove that Ibarra killed Riley, the prosecutor said.",
      "Defense attorney Dustin Kirby called the evidence in the case graphic and disturbing, but he said none of it proves that his client killed Riley.",
      "\"The evidence in this case is very good that Laken Riley was murdered,\" he said. \"The evidence that Jose Ibarra killed Laken Riley is circumstantial.\"",
      "The killing added fuel to the national debate over immigration when federal authorities said Ibarra illegally entered the U.S. in 2022 and was allowed to stay to pursue his immigration case.",
      "Republicans, including President-elect Donald Trump, blamed Democratic President Joe Biden's border policies\u00a0for her death. As he spoke about border security during his State of the Union address weeks after the killing, Biden mentioned Riley by name.",

      "During her opening statement, Ross laid out a timeline using doorbell and surveillance camera footage, as well as data from Riley's phone and watch, to piece together her final moments.",
      "Riley left home at 9:03 a.m. and headed for wooded trails where she often ran. Data from her watch shows that at 9:10 a.m., she was running at a fast pace when something happened that made her \"stop dead in her tracks.\" She called 911 at 9:11 a.m.",
      "A 911 dispatcher answered but no one responded when she repeatedly sought a response, and then the call was ended by the caller. The dispatcher immediately called back, but no one answered.",
      "\"Her encounter with him was long. Her fight with him was fierce,\" Ross said, noting that Riley's watch data showed her heart was still beating until 9:28 a.m.",
      "Ross also played security camera video that shows a man she said is Ibarra at 9:44 a.m. in a parking lot at his apartment complex. The man tossed something in a recycling bin and then appeared to throw something in nearby bushes. In the recycling bin, officers found a dark hooded jacket with blood that turned out to be Riley's on it and strands of long dark hair caught on a button. In the bushes, they found black disposable kitchen gloves, one of which had a hole in the tip of the thumb.",
      "Another video from about 35 minutes later shows what appeared to be the same man wearing different clothes and walking toward a trash bin with a bag and then walking back empty-handed. That bin was emptied before police were able to search it.",
      "One of Riley's three roommates testified that she became worried when Riley didn't return from a run. The four friends used a phone app to track each other's whereabouts, and Lilly Steiner testified that she became more worried when she saw that Riley's phone showed her in the same location for a long time.",
      "Riley often talked to her mother by phone when she ran, and her mother also became concerned that morning when her daughter didn't answer her calls.",
      "Steiner and another roommate, Sofia Magana, walked to the trail where the phone app indicated Riley was located. They found what they believed was one of Riley's earbuds on the trail and returned home to call police.",
      "One of the officers who responded found Riley's body partially covered by leaves, 64 feet off the trail. Although her shirt had been pulled up and her underwear was showing above the lowered waistband of her running tights, Ross said there was no evidence that Riley had been sexually assaulted.",
      "Police arrested Ibarra the day after the killing.",
      "Before Ross played video from the body camera of the officer who found Riley, she warned Riley's family that her dead body would be shown. Riley's mother left the courtroom, but other family members and friends remained, some of them crying or covering their faces during the video.",
      "Ibarra is charged with one count of malice murder, three counts of felony murder and one count each of kidnapping, aggravated assault, aggravated battery, hindering an emergency telephone call, tampering with evidence and being a peeping Tom.",

      "Further, the Zero Emission Transportation Association on Friday called on Trump to reconsider, saying the tax credit has bolstered employment in states that voted Republican, including Ohio, Kentucky, Michigan and Georgia.",
      "\"If the United States is going to continue to fight to bring those jobs here and actually compete to win against China, there needs to be a demand signal \u2014 like the New Clean Vehicle Tax Credit \u2014 aligned with that goal, otherwise we would be undercutting those investments and hurting American job growth,\" ZETA Executive Director Albert Gore stated on Friday.",
      "\"The potential elimination of the federal tax credit for electric vehicles by the Trump administration \u2014 without another form of incentive to replace it \u2014 could derail the trajectory of EV sales in the United States,\" offered Edmunds analysts.",
      "Trump repeatedly vowed to eliminate what he labeled President Joe Biden's \"EV mandate\" as he campaigned for the White House.",
      "While there is no such mandate in federal law, the Inflation Reduction Act passed during President Biden's term revived the credit for many EV purchases, while also granting low interest loans to manufacturers constructing EV and battery plants.",

      "The president-elect during his first term attempted to repeal the EV tax credit, which was expanded by President Biden in 2022.",
      "Analysts who track Tesla concurred with Musk's view that the credit's demise would only help his company.",
      "\"This is a clear negative for the EV industry at first look and would particularly hurt GM, Ford, Stellantis and Rivian,\" wrote Wedbush Securities tech analyst Daniel Ives.

Now, with production cuts shrinking supply and a fresh wave of demand from those seeking a deal while they still can, it can be all but assured that the price for that EV you've been eyeing is going up in the coming months,\" Drury stated.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 18:24:10 -0500",
    "summary": "The Social Security Fairness Act, which would increase benefits for 2.8 million retirees, has bipartisan support but time running out.",
    "story": [
      "Efforts to get the Senate to vote on a bill to expand Social Security benefits are intensifying, as the House-passed Social Security Fairness Act enjoys rare bipartisan support but has only a short window of time \u2014 six weeks \u2014 to be passed.",
      "\"We're guardedly optimistic,\" Shannon Benton executive director of The Senior Citizens League, or TSCL, an advocacy group devoted to protecting retirement benefits, said. \"There is so much momentum, if it doesn't get passed now, a lot of people will lose hope.\"",
      "Decades in the making, the legislation would eliminate a provision that reduces Social Security payments to some retirees who also collect a pension from jobs that aren't covered by the retirement program, such as state and federal workers including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. It would also end a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members.",
      "Various forms of the measure have been introduced over the years, but like many legislative proposals, they had failed to get enacted.",
      "\"I've been working at the league 25 years, and I don't remember ever not having a version,\" said Benton.",
      "Introduced by Reps. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., and Garret Graves, R-La., the bill was passed by the House in a 327-75 vote late Tuesday night, after a last-ditch effort to derail it by members of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus failed.",
      "The WEP impacts about\u00a02 million\u00a0Social Security beneficiaries and the GPO nearly\u00a0800,000\u00a0retirees.",
      "What happens next to the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "Despite having 62 cosponsors in the Senate, the bill still needs to be brought up for a vote by the chamber's leadership, and soon.",
      "The bill \"dies December 31, at the end of the second session of Congress,\" Benton said. \"Not only would this bill have to start from scratch, but a new person would have to introduce it.\"",
      "The Republican and Democratic lawmakers who introduced the measures in their respective bodies either did not run for reelection or lost their reelection bid, as was the case with Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, who introduced the bill in the Senate.",
      "If the Social Security Fairness Act comes up for a vote in the Senate, it's expected to pass, having already secured 62 co-sponsors \u2014 surpassing the majority needed to send it to President Joe Biden for his signature.",
      "If signed into law, the changes would be effective for benefits payable after December 2023.",
      "What does the Social Security Fairness Act do?",
      "The legislation would cut two provisions that curtail retirement payments for public workers and their surviving spouses and family members, the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO), which Spanberger and Graves argue are tantamount to theft of those workers' benefits.",
      "\"For more than 40 years, the Social Security trust funds have been artificially propped up by stolen benefits that millions of Americans paid for and that their families deserve,\" they said in a Nov. 13 statement.",
      "As things stand now, the WEP reduces the Social Security benefits of workers who also receive a public pension from a job not covered by Social Security. For instance, that would include teachers who don't earn Social Security through their public school positions but who work part-time or during the summer in jobs that are covered by Social Security, even though they pay into the system over enough quarters to qualify.",
      "The GPO impacts the spousal benefits of people who work for federal, state or local governments \u2014 including police officers, firefighters and teachers \u2014 if the job is not covered by Social Security. The GPO cuts by two-thirds the benefit received by surviving spouses who also collect a government pension, often offsetting benefits entirely.",
      "For instance, under the GPO, someone who receives a $900 spousal benefit from Social Security but who also has a $1,000 non-covered pension would see their Social Security benefit cut by $667. That would leave them with a $233 remaining spousal benefit from Social Security.",
      "Under the Social Security Fairness Act, the same person would receive the entire $900 spousal benefit.",
      "\"Workers should be able to count on the retirement benefits they've earned,\" said Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, an original cosponsor of the bill. \"It's time to pass the Social Security Fairness Act so government workers and their families and people with disabilities are not punished for earning multiple sources of retirement income.\"",
      "What is the chance of the Social Security Fairness Act passing?",
      "The biggest opposition to the bill is its cost. The Congressional Budget Office estimates it would cost upward of $190 billion over a decade.",
      "\"It would hasten the combined trust funds shortfall by six months to a year, when it's already in trouble,\" said Benton, who said TSCL supports reforming Social Security to resolve its projected insolvency in 2033 to 2034.",
      "\"The long-term solvency of Social Security is an issue that Congress must address \u2014 but an issue that is wholly separate from allowing Virginians, Louisianans, and Americans across our country who did their part and contributed their earnings to retire with dignity,\" Graves and Spanberger said in their joint statement.",

      "How much is Mike Tyson getting paid for the fight?",
      "Regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time, 58-year-old Mike Tyson has an estimated net worth of $10 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. That is a modest sum compared with the hundreds of millions of dollars \"Iron Mike,\" as he is known, accumulated in career earnings, including $400 million in fight purses, according\u00a0to\u00a0Forbes.

That bout lasted less than two minutes, with Tyson knocking out the previously undefeated Spinks in 91 seconds.",
      "In 1992, Tyson was sent to prison for six years after being convicted of raping a teenage beauty-pageant contestant.

Tyson was disqualified from the fight, had his boxing license revoked and fined $3 million, but was allowed to keep the purse.",
      "At a news conference on Wednesday, Paul wore a diamond-spiked ear cover, a pointed reference to the incident. But when it comes to making light of the ear biting, Tyson has beat Paul to the punch, having launched ear-shaped marijuana edibles\u00a0(with Holyfield's consent) through his company, Tyson 2.0, a premium cannabis brand he launched in 2021. The brand generated an estimated $150 million in revenue in 2023, according to Forbes Australia.",

      "Jake Paul, 27, is set to earn $40 million, according to an estimate from DraftKings Network and other sources \u2014 double what Tyson is expected to receive for the fight. A simple explanation for that may be that Paul, a top social influencer with 27 million followers on Instagram alone, is also co-founder of Most Valuable Promotions (MVP), the company promoting the extravaganza in partnership with Netflix. His net worth is estimated at $80 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.",
      "With a 10-1 fight record, mostly against\u00a0mixed martial artists and other pro-boxing newcomers under his belt, Paul, a former child star and YouTube prankster who began his boxing career in 2018, does not lack confidence \u2014 or showmanship. His cocky attitude earned him his latest nickname \"El Gallo de Dorado\" or the Golden Rooster, coined by fans in Puerto Rico. Before that, he was called \"The Problem Child,\" a fairly self-explanatory moniker based on the online persona he's crafted for himself over the years.",
      "Paul, who went full Gallo at an open training session this week with Tyson at the Toyota Music Factory in Irving, Texas, donning a rooster hat and red-feathered skirt over his boxing trunks, epitomizes social media's melding of Barnumesque entertainment and sports.",

If he doesn't, says Paul in the video, the aging boxer will have to get a tattoo that says \"I love Jake Paul.\"",

      "\"There has been a lot of anticipation for this fight, and we have been pleased with the betting volume,\" Johnny Avello, director of sports operations at DraftKings, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We expect more action to come in the hours leading up to the fight.\"",

      "\"While it won't match up to an event like the Super Bowl, it could certainly be our most bet boxing match of the year,\" he added.",
      "Not everyone will be able to place a bet the epic bout. Though the fight is sanctioned by Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, changes in the rules, including\u00a0shorter rounds and bigger gloves, disqualifies the fight from being bet on in at least seven U.S.\u00a0states.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump promised during his campaign he'd shut down the Department of Education, complaining that the agency's budget is too large and that its staff is filled with \"people that in many cases hate our children.\" In a September 2023 campaign video he accused schools of \"indoctrinating young people with inappropriate racial, sexual and political material.\"",
      "\"One thing I'll be doing very early in the administration is closing up the Department of Education in Washington, D.C., and sending all education and education work it needs back to the states,\" Trump said in the video.",
      "Dismantling the department has been an unfulfilled, decades-long goal for some Republicans, dating back to its founding in 1980. It's the first goal listed in the education section of Project 2025's \"mandate for leadership,\" a book that lays out a plan for Trump's new administration. Trump has publicly disavowed the project, but its goals \u2014 and the people behind it \u2014 remain influential in his orbit.",
      "The smallest of all Cabinet agencies, the Department of Education is responsible for distribution of federal financial aid for education, collecting and disseminating data and research related to schools, and prohibiting discrimination in schools. Its funds account for less than 10% of the nation's public school funding, which is primarily driven by state and local taxes.",
      "Shuttering the agency won't be easy, according to Michigan State University professor Joshua Cowen.",
      "\"This is a real thing. They really want to do this,\" said Cowen, a professor of education policy. \"It's more realistic than ever, but I don't want to overstate the possibility. It's going to be hard.\"",
      "Cowen said even though Republicans control both houses of Congress and the presidency, a wholesale closure of the Department of Education might not be palatable to some of the party's legislators.",
      "\"They realize some of the things that the education department oversees and funds are popular,\" said Cowen, adding that the Senate would need a 60-vote filibuster-proof majority to push through a bill to close the department.",
      "Instead, he said, Republicans are likely to focus on rolling back funding for programs geared toward \"equity, inclusion, or programs that could be particularly beneficial toward migrant communities\" \u2014 lightning rod issues for conservative politicians.",
      "Another target would likely be Title I funding, which provides school districts with funding geared toward low-income students, according to Columbia University professor Aaron Pallas.",
      "\"One thing that Project 2025 called for that is perhaps most doable and, and most threatening perhaps to local education agencies is a proposal to phase out federal funding for Title I, shifting that to be the responsibility of states and and local governments,\" Pallas said.",
      "Pallas said that plan also calls for many of the department's responsibilities to be shifted to other federal agencies.",
      "\"It's really just kind of rearranging in order to continue to provide congressionally mandated services to students. Even if the functions get moved to other agencies, there's going to have to be people available to administer them,\" Pallas said.",
      "Trump also promised in the campaign video to \"give all parents the right to choose another school for their children if they want.\" But part of the calculus GOP legislators might need to consider is that enthusiasm for dismantling the Education Department may not be as widespread as they think. On Nov. 5, three states \u2014 including two where Trump won handily \u2014 rejected ballot measures that would've shifted money away from public education.",
      "Voters rejected efforts in Kentucky, Colorado and Nebraska to strengthen school choice and voucher programs, in which state funds help foot the bill for parents who choose to forgo their local public schools.",
      "\"Rural Republicans have long resisted school choice schemes, especially vouchers, for the simple reason they just don't have very many private schools in their districts,\" said Cowen, whose book \"The Privateers\" examines the role of wealthy donors in politicians' push for school voucher programs.",
      "He said politicians who serve rural school districts might have one other big reason to avoid supporting legislation that strips away funding.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 14:46:30 -0500",
    "summary": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's pick\u200b to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, has raised controversy on topics ranging from vaccines to fluoride to food.",
    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, is coming into the nomination process in an unusual position: a long list of his own policy priorites\u00a0separate from the president-elect's, and a public promise by Trump to let him \"go wild\" on his ideas.",
      "CBS News medical contributor Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, the editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, answers questions below about the role Kennedy has been tapped to take on and some of the ideas in the sweeping \"Make America Healthy Again\" platform he may try to push through.",
      "Q: What is the role of the Department of Health and Human Services, and how much power does the HHS secretary have over its work?",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services comprises several agencies and offices including the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Office of the Surgeon General and much more.",
      "There is a big difference between political appointees and career civil servants. Political appointees set strategic priorities and align their department or agency's policies with the current administration's objectives. Civil servants have the institutional knowledge to know how to get things done and have specialized scientific or technical expertise. Scientific questions require specialized expertise. This is why there are career scientists who advise the HHS secretary, NIH director, CDC director and FDA commissioner.",
      "The HHS secretary has the authority to establish regulations that govern health, including food and drug safety, public health and health care quality. The HHS secretary can declare public health emergencies and coordinate federal responses to health crises, such as disease outbreaks or natural disasters. The secretary wields significant influence over the department's policies and its constituent agencies, which include the CDC, FDA, NIH and others.",
      "The HHS secretary is also in a position to shape public opinion if given a platform to do so by the media. Absent media attention, their influence on public opinion is more limited. We in the media have a responsibility to fact-check their statements and hold those in power accountable \u2014 regardless of who is in power.",
      "Q: One of Kennedy's most controversial stances is his criticism of vaccines, promoting the idea that they cause autism, among other conditions, and claiming \"there's no vaccine that is safe and effective.\" What is the reality?",
      "Extensive research has conclusively shown that vaccines do not cause autism. The \"research\" behind these claims was retracted due to ethical violations and sloppy work. The doctor who originally made those claims lost his medical license as a result of his professional misconduct.",
      "For parents whose kids have autism or people who have autism, this matters. For too long, claims about the safety of vaccines have not only put people at unnecessary risk of getting illnesses that vaccines can prevent, but have also been a red herring, distracting people from the real causes of autism and how to diagnose them and treat them. That distraction is unproductive and harmful.",
      "Secondly, nothing in this world is 100% safe and effective. It's all about weighing risks, the pros and cons. Is one choice more beneficial or more risky? Do the pros of wearing a seatbelt in the car outweigh the risks? Do the pros of exercising regularly outweigh the risks of not exercising? You could get injured while exercising. Do the pros of vaccinating instead of allowing infectious diseases to spread in the community outweigh the cons? Yes, yes and yes.",
      "Q: Kennedy has said he wants to leave it up to individuals to decide whether to vaccinate themselves or their children. What impact could that have?",
      "Increasingly, people are formulating opinions about vaccines based not on science, but on Google searches, social media, what family and friends think and personal observation. That is not research. Research is formulating a hypothesis and trying to disprove that hypothesis. It means you understand how to differentiate correlation from causation. And it means doing repeated experiments to show consistency, not just a chance or random result.",
      "This isn't a question of whether people are smart or not. But most people don't have the training, experience and context to objectively assess the pros and cons of vaccination. You wouldn't want me repairing your car's transmission or brake system. I'm not stupid, but I have no training or experience in this.",
      "The risk of leaving these decisions to untrained individuals is that these decisions won't be made on science. They will be made based on emotion and confirmation bias, which is to say, Google searches looking for opinions that line up with your preexisting beliefs or inclinations. This will put kids at risk, and because vaccines protect against transmissible infectious diseases this will put others in the community at risk, especially other kids and people who are immunocompromised.",
      "Q: Kennedy has also said chemicals in food are tied to autism as well as psychotic episodes and depression. What do we know about the connection between food and mental health?",
      "He's not wrong that there is a relationship between diet and autism as well as diet and mental health. These are areas of ongoing research. No diet has been proven to cure or universally improve autism or mental health symptoms, but certain dietary interventions improve symptoms in some people. These dietary changes may include elimination of ultra-processed foods, eliminating gluten and avoiding certain food additives or preservatives.",
      "Q: Kennedy has said one of the Trump administration's first acts will be to work to remove fluoride from drinking water, arguing it's connected to cancer, IQ loss, thyroid disease and other health problems. Why is fluoride in drinking water, and is it safe?",
      "Fluoride is put in the water to reduce the risk of cavities, especially in kids.",
      "As with many things, fluoride safety is all about dose. Drinking a few glasses of water a day is healthy. Drinking from a fire hydrant all day would land you in the hospital. The level of fluoride in U.S. water is safe and protects against tooth decay.",
      "When municipalities stopped putting fluoride in the water, cavity rates went up. This was observed, for example, in Calgary, Canada, and in Juneau, Alaska.",
      "There are parts of the world, including India, China and East Africa, where fluoride levels 30 to 40 times higher than levels in the U.S. have been found to be harmful. But we don't have anywhere near those levels of fluoride in our water.",
      "But Kennedy's statement demonstrates a common misunderstanding about public health authorities in the U.S. We are the United States of America \u2014 public health powers reside at the state level. The federal government has the authority to tax and spend and to regulate commerce across state lines, and federal government authorities derive from that.",
      "The CDC provides scientific guidance to help state and local authorities to make informed decisions. The CDC does not mandate fluoridation. The EPA sets the maximum allowable fluoride concentration in public water systems. But states have the authority to mandate fluoridation or can leave it up to local jurisdictions.",
      "Q: Kennedy has criticized multiple public health agencies he could now lead. He's said the FDA's \"war on public health is about to end,\" claiming the agency suppresses anything that \"advances human health and can't be patented\" by pharmaceutical companies. What do you make of these criticisms?",
      "This again demonstrates a misunderstanding of federal agency authority. Congress has passed laws that give the FDA specific authority to regulate drugs, supplements and food, and those laws grant the FDA different powers over drugs, supplements and food.",
      "If anything, given the Supreme Court's \"major questions doctrine,\" the courts can determine that agencies may not make regulations on issues of significant economic or political importance unless Congress has clearly authorized such actions. For example, in the case FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. (2000), the Supreme Court concluded that the FDA lacked the power to regulate tobacco. In 2009, Congress passed the\u00a0Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, granting the FDA the authority to regulate tobacco.",
      "Drugs require FDA approval before they can be marketed. Under the law, drugs are defined as substances used to diagnose, treat or prevent disease.",
      "Supplements don't need FDA approval before they are sold. The FDA monitors dietary supplements once they are on the market and can take action if they are unsafe or if they make claims about diagnosis, treatment or prevention of disease.",
      "Dietary supplement manufacturers often choose not to seek FDA approval to market their products as drugs because:",
      "There are less stringent requirements on dietary supplements than on drugs.The FDA approval process is expensive and lengthy. Clinical trials take years to conduct and cost millions of dollars. Manufacturers foot the bill for clinical trials.Dietary supplements can be sold directly to consumers without a prescription.",
      "There are less stringent requirements on dietary supplements than on drugs.",
      "The FDA approval process is expensive and lengthy. Clinical trials take years to conduct and cost millions of dollars. Manufacturers foot the bill for clinical trials.",
      "Dietary supplements can be sold directly to consumers without a prescription.",
      "It's the manufacturer that decides whether it wants to seek FDA approval for a drug or if it wants to market a product as a dietary supplement \u2014 and that decision typically comes down to time and money. Pharmaceutical companies are less inclined to invest millions of dollars in clinical trials of unpatented treatments due to the lack of exclusive marketing rights (in other words, a time-limited monopoly), which can affect profitability.",
      "The FDA often goes after supplement brands that test this line when it sees companies marketing products with claims that amount to what should be regulated as a drug. This is why supplements often carry a\u00a0disclaimer that they aren't being sold to \"diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.\" Kennedy has\u00a0praised\u00a0the supplement industry for \"fighting back,\" following a court win over an anti-aging supplement that the FDA argued should be regulated as a drug.",
      "Finally, the FDA doesn't grant patents. That's the job of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.",
      "Q: Trump has said Kennedy will \"end the chronic health epidemic.\" What are some of the positive actions he could take if he becomes HHS secretary to reduce chronic disease in the U.S.?",
      "Kennedy has called for greater regulation of food additives and ultraprocessed foods. Ultraprocessed foods in American diets have led to an explosion in obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and other chronic disease.",
      "However, it's unclear which factions within Trump's orbit will prevail. Congress may have to give the FDA the authority to regulate more aggressively and the funding to enforce those regulations. Historically, the Republican Party has been opposed to regulation. Trump's chief of staff pick, Susie Wiles, is a longtime lobbyist who has worked on behalf of the food, insurance and tobacco industries.",
      "The Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 \u2014 which involved a number of former Trump advisers, but which Trump has tried to distance himself from \u2014 would roll back dietary guidelines, making it harder to fight ultraprocessed foods.",

    "story": [
      "Two Missouri police officers were indicted separately this week and accused of similar crimes - pulling over women and searching their phones to find nude photos, federal prosecutors said.",
      "The indictments of former Missouri State Highway Patrol officer David McKnight on Tuesday and former Florissant, Missouri, officer\u00a0Julian Alcala\u00a0on Wednesday were unrelated but the indictments spelled out similar allegations. Both men face federal charges accusing them of depriving the rights of several women and destroying evidence.",
      "McKnight, 39, victimized nine women between September 2023 and Aug. 19, his indictment said. Typically, according to the indictment, he would pull over a woman for a traffic violation and tell her he needed to look at her phone to either verify her identity or confirm insurance coverage.",
      "McKnight searched the phones and used his own phone to photograph nude pictures he found, the indictment said.",
      "McKnight was arrested by patrol investigators on Aug. 21 and resigned five days later, patrol Capt. Scott White said in an email.",
      "White declined to discuss McKnight's case but said patrol employees \"are held to high standards and if it is determined that those standards were not met, they are held accountable.\"",
      "McKnight pleaded not guilty during a court appearance on Thursday. Messages were left Friday with his lawyer.",
      "\"These allegations are being taken very seriously, and we'd like to encourage anyone who believes they had a concerning interaction with McKnight to contact the FBI,\" U.S. Attorney Sayler A. Fleming said in a statement.",
      "Alcala, 29, was accused of crimes involving 20 women between Feb. 6 and May 18. Five of the alleged crimes happened on the same day.",
      "Alcala confiscated phones from women under the auspices of confirming insurance coverage and vehicle registration, the indictment said. Like McKnight, he was accused of searching the phones for nude photos and then using his own phone to take pictures.",
      "The indictment said Alcala also found a video on one victim's phone and texted the video to his own phone.",
      "Multiple victims of Alcala have\u00a0filed lawsuits, CBS affiliate KMOV reported.",

      "\"What you did to me and these other females, how you overused your power as a police officer to do these things to make these women feel this way, you should be disgusted in yourself,\" one victim told the station.",
      "Alcala doesn't yet have a listed attorney. No phone listing for him could be found. He also is named in four lawsuits filed against him and the city of Florissant, a St. Louis suburb.",
      "Alcala was with the Florissant department since January 2023. He resigned in June amid an FBI investigation.",
      "\"We are disgusted at this behavior, which is a complete betrayal of the values we uphold and in no way reflects the professionalism and integrity of our dedicated officers,\" Florissant police said in a statement. \"We recognize the gravity of this breach of trust and its impact on our community.\"",
      "Anyone with information is asked to contact the FBI by calling 1-800-CALL-FBI (800-225-5324) or via\u00a0tips.fbi.gov.",
      "\"If you feel uncomfortable about your encounter with law enforcement, please don't hesitate to go to that department after the fact to report what happened,\" Special Agent in Charge Ashley T. Johnson of the FBI St. Louis Division said in a statement. \"If you feel your civil rights have been violated, contact the FBI. Investigating criminal conduct by a law enforcement officer is among our top priorities.\"",

      "Johnson and Thune, too, say border security is a top priority. Earlier this year, a bipartisan group of senators negotiated the strictest immigration legislation in decades, but Senate Republicans ultimately blocked the package at Trump's urging.",
      "The Republican-led approach on border security next year, should it materialize, is expected to go further and is likely to face resistance from Democrats and even some within Trump's party.",
      "Republicans are also eager to enact new economic policies, including extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts that are set to expire in 2025, along with policies aimed at restoring U.S. energy dominance and cutting government spending waste.",
      "With narrow majorities in both chambers, Trump's key legislative priorities could still face obstacles. Sen. Todd Young of Indiana, who's among a handful of Senate Republicans who have reliably broken with Trump in the past, outlined to CBS News that with 60 votes needed to end debate on most legislation in the Senate, \"by definition, the Trump administration will need Democratic votes to do big things.\"",
      "\"In recent history I've been quite good at working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle,\" Young said, adding that he's hopeful he can \"help President Trump advance his agenda.\"",
      "For the Senate, the first task will be approving Trump's nominations.",
      "Confirming Trump's Cabinet nominees",
      "Some of Trump's Cabinet selections are making waves across the political sphere, prompting questions from some GOP senators about whether some controversial nominees will be able to make it through Senate confirmation.",
      "While some selections were expected, others have caught even Republicans by surprise. At the top of that category is Trump's selection for attorney general, former Rep. Matt Gaetz, a GOP firebrand who was under investigation by the House Ethics Committee for allegations of sexual misconduct and obstruction.",
      "Thune said the Senate's priority at the start of the year will be confirming Trump's nominees, pledging to oversee an aggressive schedule until the nominees are confirmed.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump has suggested he'd like to get his eventual nominees in place through recess appointments, effectively bypassing the Senate's confirmation process in a maneuver that hasn't been utilized in a decade. High-ranking Republican senators, including Thune, have said that they will work to process Trump's nominees at a rapid clip, while remaining open to recess nominations.",
      "Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican who lost a bid for leader to Thune, told reporters on Thursday that both the president's authority to make recess appointments and the Senate's advice and consent responsibilities are granted by the Constitution.",
      "\"The question is, how do you reconcile those two,\" Cornyn said.",
      "\"I think we all would like for the President to be successful and I agree he's had a mandate here,\" Cornyn also said. \"But we have a job to do, as well.\"",
      "The first 100 days",
      "The first 100 days of a president's term have historically been a yardstick to measure the new leader's governing ability. It's a practice that Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in Governance Studies at Brookings, characterizes as \"mythical.\"",
      "\"It's mythical because of Franklin Roosevelt,\" she said. \"And that's also why it's never happened again.\"",
      "Roosevelt, who quickly swore in his entire Cabinet and passed a slew of key legislation in the beginning of his term, had massive majorities in the House and Senate, paired with large Electoral College and popular vote victories. The unified control enabled Roosevelt to have \"a spectacular 100 days,\" Kamarck added.",
      "Since then, the first 100 days has been the first benchmark at which the effectiveness of a president is judged: is the Cabinet appointed and confirmed by the Senate? What signature legislation has been enacted? During Trump's first term, his first 100 days were marked by a pile of executive orders, a chaotic and lengthy effort to confirm his Cabinet and setbacks on his pledge to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and repeal the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The dynamics are different as Trump prepares for his second term, with the party more unified behind him, a stronger relationship with lawmakers and a better grasp of the workings of government than when he first took office in 2017.",
      "Speaking to the House Republican conference on Wednesday, Trump reveled in the shared GOP victory.",
      "\"Isn't it nice to win?\" Trump said. \"It's nice to win.\"",

      "Sara was forecast to drop 10 to 20 inches of rain, with up to 30 inches in isolated areas of northern Honduras. The heavy rain could lead to life-threatening flooding and landslides, according to the Miami-based National Hurricane Center.",
      "The weather system made landfall late Thursday about 105 miles west-northwest of Cabo Gracias a Dios, on the Honduras-Nicaragua border, the center reported. That is near Brus Laguna, a village of about 13,000 inhabitants. There are few other areas of population nearby.",
      "In its latest update Friday night, the hurricane center said the storm was \"producing torrential rainfall causing potentially catastrophic flooding and mudslides for portions of Central America.\" It was located about 35 miles southwest of Honduras' Guanaja Island and 155 miles southeast of Belize City, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph. Its movement had halted and it was considered stationary.",
      "Sara's center was expected to move near Honduras' northern coast through Saturday and then make landfall in Belize on Sunday, the hurricane center said.",
      "It was then expected to turn northwesterly towards Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, though forecasters said it probably won't reemerge into the Gulf after crossing the Yucatan.",
      "\"What remains of the system when it emerges into the Bay of Campeche in the Gulf of Mexico is not very favorable for redevelopment,\" the hurricane center said in an earlier advisory.",
      "Mexican authorities warned that it could cause \"intense rains\" over the resort-studded Yucatan Peninsula.",
      "Tropical storm warnings were in place for Honduras' northern coast and its Bay Islands, the Belize coast, the Caribbean Sea coast of Guatemala and the Mexican coast from Puerto Costa Maya southward to Chetumal.",
      "In November 2020, Eta and Iota passed through Honduras after initially making landfall in Nicaragua as powerful Category 4 hurricanes. Northern Honduras caught the worst of the storms with torrential rains that set off flooding that displaced hundreds of thousands. Eta alone was responsible for as much as 30 inches of rain along the northern coast.",
      "Sara, the 18th\u00a0named storm\u00a0of the 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season, is expected to linger in the Caribbean through the weekend and slowly move into the Gulf of Mexico early next week. After that, its path is less clear. CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan said a lot of the models are now trending towards it dissipating either after it enters the Gulf of Mexico or over Mexico, but several still have it aiming towards Florida.",
      "\"Florida residents should closely monitor the forecast updates as they come in,\" Nolan advised.",
      "The Atlantic Hurricane Season\u00a0officially runs from June 1 until Nov. 30, with activity typically peaking between mid-August and mid-October. An average season brings 14 named storms, seven hurricanes, and three major hurricanes, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which did predict the 2024 season would produce \"above average\" numbers.",

The U.S. government, along with international partners, has tried to broker a peace agreement, but there's been no progress. The Biden administration, meanwhile, has sanctioned individuals and companies affiliated with both sides in the war over alleged human rights abuses and war crimes.",
      "Journalists and aid officials have largely been blocked from traveling to the country to report on the conflict first-hand, but independent researchers say the number of deaths from the war has been vastly unreported. According to a study published this week by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, an estimated 61,000 people died in Khartoum State alone, home to the capital city of the same name, between April 2023 and June 2024.",

    "story": [
      "A German soccer club is leaving X because of the increase in hate speech and disinformation on the social media platform that it claims could undermine the snap elections in the country.",
      "FC St. Pauli announced the decision on Thursday, saying billionaire owner Elon Musk has turned the platform into a \"hate machine\" since he took over the company in 2022.",
      "\"Racism and conspiracy theories are allowed to spread unchecked and even curated,\" St. Pauli said in a statement. \"Insults and threats are seldom sanctioned and are sold as freedom of speech.\"",
      "The club said it had already limited posts on X and increased \"political statements in support of diversity and inclusion to make a stand against hate.\"",
      "Named after Hamburg's St. Pauli district, the club, which plays in the Bundesliga, is known among soccer fans for its left-leaning supporter base. Fan groups often chant anti-racist slogans and promote diversity within the club.",
      "St. Pauli also underlined Musk's role in last week's U.S. presidential election, and alleged his platform could affect the outcome of the snap elections in Germany, which are scheduled to take place next February, by \"manipulating the public discourse.\"",
      "\"Musk was a major backer of the Trump campaign and also used X for this purpose,\" the club said. \"It is to be assumed that X will also promote authoritarian, misanthropic and far-right content during the forthcoming German election campaign.\"",
      "St. Pauli said it would no longer share content on X but it will not deactivate the account. The club urged supporters to follow its updates on Bluesky, an alternative social media platform that has observed a surge of new members after President-elect Donald Trump's election victory last week.",
      "Musk was a key figure in Trump's third election campaign, donating millions of dollars and promoting content for his message on X. Trump announced this week that he will be part of the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency alongside fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur who sought the Republican Party's nomination.",

    "summary": "Tropical Storm Sara developed in the Caribbean on Thursday, threatening parts of Central America with life-threatening and potentially catastrophic rain.",
    "story": [
      "Tropical Storm Sara formed in the Caribbean on Thursday, becoming the 18th named storm of the 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season. The system, previously called Tropical Depression 19, developed in the western Caribbean earlier this week and intensified while traveling westward on a path toward Central America.",
      "Sara had sustained winds of 45 mph and was located around 105 miles north-northwest of the Nicaragua-Honduras border and 105 miles east-southeast of the Honduras island of Guanaja, moving west at 10 mph, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said\u00a0in a 10 p.m. ET update. A weather system is considered a tropical storm when its sustained wind speeds reach at least 39 mph.",
      "The storm is expected to linger in the Caribbean through the weekend and slowly move into the Gulf of Mexico early next week. After that, its path is less clear. CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan said a lot of the models are now trending towards it dissipating either after it enters the Gulf of Mexico or over Mexico, but several still have it aiming towards Florida.",
      "\"Florida residents should closely monitor the forecast updates as they come in,\" Nolan advised.",
      "The Atlantic Hurricane Season\u00a0officially runs from June 1 until Nov. 30, with activity typically peaking between mid-August and mid-October. An average season brings 14 named storms, seven hurricanes, and three major hurricanes, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which did predict the 2024 season would produce \"above average\" numbers.",
      "What is the projected path of Tropical Storm Sara?",
      "Sara was forecast to move closer to the northern coast of Honduras through early Saturday and then approach Belize on Sunday, the Hurricane Center said.",
      "Sara could potentially bring catastrophic rainfall to parts of Central America. Between 10 and 20 inches of heavy rainfall are possible in Honduras early next week, forecasters warned, with up to 30 inches accumulating in some places.",
      "Forecasters at the hurricane center said they expected \"life-threatening and potentially catastrophic\" flash floods to hit Honduras and persist through the weekend. The hurricane center also warned of potentially disastrous mudslides caused by the storm, especially in the mountainous area along and near Sierra La Esperanza on the country's northeastern coast. They estimated those conditions would persist through the weekend.",
      "The rest of Honduras, Belize, El Salvador, eastern Guatemala and western Nicaragua will likely receive between 5 and 10 inches of rainfall as the storm runs its course through that region, but up to 15 inches are possible.",
      "Governments across Central America have issued various watches and warnings as people brace for Sara's effects. Honduras' northern coast and its Bay Islands were under a tropical storm warning Thursday night.",
      "Will Tropical Storm Sara become a hurricane?",
      "It remains to be seen whether Sara will grow into a hurricane. A tropical storm becomes a hurricane when its sustained winds reach at least 74 mph, making it a Category 1 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.",
      "Forecasters also cautioned residents of Belize and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula to be ready for possible impacts of Sara early next week.",
      "Will Tropical Storm Sara hit Florida?",
      "After entering the Gulf of Mexico, some forecast models suggested the storm could make a right-hand turn and heading toward Florida by late next week, though Nolan noted that conditions can quickly change. Other models had the storm potentially heading into the central part of the Gulf and possibly dissipating.",
      "Air Force hurricane hunters that flew into the area to investigate the strength and structure of the developing weather system located Sara Thursday night along Hondruras' northeastern coast, the hurricane center said.",
      "Forecast models take in the current environmental factors along with historical data to compute \"spaghetti plots\" of where systems may track. Each model uses different computations, and the forecast track is an output of the consensus from those models.",
      "\"It is too soon to determine what impacts the system could bring to portions of the eastern Gulf of Mexico, including Florida, the Florida Keys, and Cuba during the middle portion of next week,\" the hurricane center said Thursday. \"Residents in these areas should regularly monitor updates to the forecast.\"",

      "Around 10 minutes after the game kicked off as scheduled at 8:45 p.m. local time, there was scuffle in the top section of the stand behind one of the goals, with some of those involved having Israeli flags draped over their backs. It was not clear what caused the altercation and security intervened after around one minute.",
      "The match finished in a 0-0 draw with no further incidents at Stade de France. However, Israel's national anthem was whistled by some fans when the players lined up and Israel players were jeered at times when they got the ball.",
      "Chants of \"Israel, Israel\" could he heard from visiting fans for several minutes before the final whistle.",
      "French police chief Laurent Nu\u00f1ez said 4,000 police officers and security staff were deployed in and around the stadium, with another 1,500 police on public transport.",

      "Security forces were on high alert in Paris ahead of the match. Israel's team bus arrived at the stadium shortly after 7 p.m. local time. Around one hour before kickoff, Nu\u00f1ez visited the stadium's video surveillance facilities along with French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau.",

      "The march was peaceful, but tension was running high on the heels of antisemitic violence last week on the streets of Amsterdam following a game between Israeli and Dutch teams.",
      "Among the Israeli fans who came to support Maccabi Tel Aviv in Amsterdam, there were some who marched through the streets before the game chanting \"death to Arabs\" and tore down a Palestinian flag. But after the match, mobs cornered Israeli fans and bystanders, beating and kicking them and throwing one into a canal.",
      "Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema condemned the violence, saying in its wake that \"Jewish Israeli supporters were hunted down and attacked via anti-Semitic calls on social media and on the streets.\"",
      "Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof described the violence as a \"terrible antisemitic attack\" and declared himself \"deeply ashamed\" for the country's capital city, while his Israeli and American counterparts, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Biden, also voiced disgust and horror at the attacks targeting Jews.",
      "Speaking Tuesday, Mayor Halsema said \"a more complete picture\" had emerged of the clashes that gripped Amsterdam last week, \"and all sorts of terrible things happened,\" but she stressed that it \"in no way negates\" that a call had been issued in her city for a \"hunt for Jews.\"",
      "Clashes have persisted since then, despite a temporary ban on demonstrations in Amsterdam, with police breaking up one protest that sought to defy the ban as recently as Wednesday evening. A train in Amsterdam was also attacked, with one man shouting, \"cancer Jew!\"",

      "New Delhi \u2014\u00a0India's Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that authorities demolishing illegally-constructed homes and other properties belonging to suspected criminals is unconstitutional and must cease. The practice is allegedly used widely by several state governments to punish suspects outside the court justice process, and is commonly known as \"bulldozer justice.\"",
      "\"The executive can't become a judge and decide that a person accused is guilty and, therefore, punish him by demolishing his properties. Such an act would be transgressing [the] executive's limits,\" the court said in a 95-page judgement.",
      "The court issued its ruling in response to several petitions over a spate of home demolitions targeting suspected criminals in states governed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in recent years. Critics have accused the BJP state administrations of using bulldozer justice primarily to\u00a0target Muslims \u2014 an accusation the party has repeatedly denied.",
      "BJP state officials have argued that due process of law has been followed in carrying out the demolitions, but the court said authorities had adopted a \"pick and choose\" attitude toward illegally constructed homes, singling out those belonging to Muslims suspected of other crimes while sparing similar, but non-Muslim-owned illegal dwellings in the same area.",
      "\"In such cases, where the authorities indulge in arbitrary pick and choose of structures and it is established that soon before the initiation of such an action an occupant of the structure was found to be involved in a criminal case, a presumption could be drawn that the real motive for such demolition proceedings was not the illegal structure, but an action of penalizing the accused without even trying him before the court of law,\" the court said.",
      "One of the petitions to the Supreme Court was filed over the April 2022 demolition of dozens of homes belonging largely to Muslims following sectarian clashes in Delhi's Jahangirpuri neighborhood, which drew allegations of religious discrimination and extrajudicial punishment.",
      "\"The chilling sight of a bulldozer demolishing a building\u2026 reminds one of a lawless state of affairs,\" Justices B.R. Gavai and K.V. Viswanathan said in the court's Wednesday judgment. \"Our constitutional ethos and values would not permit any such abuse of power and such misadventures cannot be tolerated by the court of law.\"",
      "The court warned state authorities it would take action against officials found guilty of \"such highhanded and arbitrary\" actions and issued detailed guidelines for the demolition of homes constructed without the required permits.",
      "The new guidelines make it mandatory for authorities to give at least 15 days' advance notice to an occupant before an illegal home is demolished and to explain the reason for the building being razed.",

      "That scandal involved a hard-up noblewoman named Jeanne de la Motte who pretended to be a confidante of the queen, and managed to acquire a lavish diamond-studded necklace in her name, against a promise of a later payment.",

    "summary": "Scientists say they've discovered a \"mega coral\" three times bigger than the previous record holder - so huge they initially thought it was a shipwreck.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists say they have found the world's largest coral near the Pacific's Solomon Islands, announcing Thursday a major discovery \"pulsing with life and color.\" The coral is so immense that researchers sailing the crystal waters of the Solomon archipelago initially thought they'd stumbled across a hulking shipwreck.",
      "\"Just when we think there is nothing left to discover on planet Earth, we find a massive coral made of nearly one billion little polyps, pulsing with life and color,\" marine ecologist Enric Sala said.",
      "The standalone structure, formed from a \"complex network\" of tiny coral polyps, has likely been growing for 300 years or more, the researchers said.",
      "At about 111 feet wide and 104 feet long, the team said the \"mega coral\" was three times bigger than the previous record holder \u2014 a coral dubbed \"Big Momma\" in American Samoa. The massive coral is not a coral reef, structures that can be far larger but are comprised of many distinct coral colonies, they explained.",
      "\"While Big Momma looked like a huge scoop of ice cream plopped down on the reef, this newly discovered coral is as if the ice cream started to melt, spreading forever along the seafloor,\" said lead scientist Molly Timmers.",
      "It's longer than a blue whale and thought to be \"so colossal\" that it could be seen from space.",
      "The coral was discovered at the southeastern tip of the Solomon Islands, in an area known as the Three Sisters. It was spotted by a National Geographic team embarking on a scientific expedition in the region.",
      "Hotter and more acidic oceans have drained the life from corals in many of the region's tropical waters, a process called bleaching, including Australia's famed Great Barrier Reef. But this latest discovery offered a small glimmer of hope, the research team said.",
      "\"While the nearby shallow reefs were degraded due to warmer seas, witnessing this large healthy coral oasis in slightly deeper waters is a beacon of hope,\" said coral scientist Eric Brown.",
      "The lush rainforests and pristine waters of the Solomon Islands have long been celebrated for their ecological diversity. Wildlife observations made in the area in the 1920s helped prove a key part of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.",
      "\"There is so much to learn about the richness of marine life and the ocean ecosystem, but this finding opens doors of knowledge,\" said top Solomon Islands official Collin Beck. \"More scientific research is needed to better understand our rich biodiversity and our planet.\"",
      "The discovery was announced as representatives from around the world meet in Baku, Azerbaijan for the COP29 United Nations summit on climate change.",
      "The Solomon Islands national climate minister, Trevor Manemahaga, told CBS News' partner network BBC News at the summit that his nation was proud to be the home of the massive, newly discovered coral.",
      "\"We want the world to know, that this is a special place, and it needs to be protected,\" he told the BBC. \"We rely mostly on marine resources for economic survival, so coral is very, very important.\"",

      "With the low pressure system in place in the western Caribbean, conditions were favorable for the formation of a tropical system. Forecast models take in the current environmental factors along with historical data to compute \"spaghetti plots\" of where systems may track. Each model uses different computations, which explains how the forecast track is an output of the consensus from those models.",
      "This system's strength is determined based on how much fuel it has \u2014 factors such as being in a favorable environment over warm waters, low wind shear, no intercepting fronts \u2014 and how long it remains in those favorable conditions. No matter its strength, the forecast models have it lingering in the western Caribbean through the weekend before turning to the north and into the Gulf of Mexico early next week.",

Intense fighting ensued and continued until the surrender of Bataan peninsula and Corregidor Island in spring 1942.",

Calvi's name, along with the names of other soldiers declared dead, was carved onto the Walls of the Missing at the cemetery.",

      "Anybody else from the House?\"I know he's already pulled a few really talented people out of the House. Hopefully, no more for a little while until special elections,\" said House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La.",
      "It\u2019s about the math.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump and the U.S. Capitol. (Getty Images)",
      "With Stefanik, Waltz and Gaetz on board, House Republicans likely score a majority of 221 seats to 214 for the Democrats. It\u2019s a margin of seven. But it means the GOP can only lose three votes on any given roll call and still pass the issue at hand without needing assistance from the other side.",
      "With Gaetz out and Stefanik and Waltz departing, that majority shrinks to 218-214. A margin of four votes. But Republicans can now only lose one vote. And there is almost never perfect attendance in the House. Absences are inevitable.",
      "But what if there are more departures?",
      "A senior House GOP source told Fox before the departure of Gaetz the Republican majority could lose no more than two House members to the Trump administration.",

Under other circumstances, Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., could be in play for an administration post or to even succeed Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., in the Senate if he\u2019s confirmed as secretary of state. But that scenario creates yet another House vacancy.",

      "According to French\u00a0cybersecurity company Sekoia, it all starts with an email containing a link to a Google Meet. The email can come from any address and may be socially engineered to look like it's related to your organization. It could link to a Google Meet invite for a meeting, webinar, online collaboration or something similar. When you click on the link, you\u2019ll be directed to a fake Google Meet page, which will soon display a warning claiming there\u2019s an issue with your PC. It might say your microphone or camera isn't working or there's a problem with your headset.",

    "story": [
      "Scammers often ask for answers to secret questions for crucial information needed to access accounts.",
      "Phishing emails are one of the most common tricks scammers use, but they\u2019re usually easy to catch if you pay attention. Awkward grammar, random details and, most importantly, an unofficial email address are dead giveaways. For example, you might get an email saying your Apple ID\u2019s been disabled, but the sender\u2019s email won\u2019t actually be from Apple. Now, though, scammers are finding ways to get around this.",
      "According to the FBI, there\u2019s been a recent rise in cybercriminal services using hacked police and government email accounts to send fake subpoenas and data requests to U.S.-based tech companies.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYSEnter by\u00a0signing up for my free newsletter!",
      "Illustration of a scammer at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "The\u00a0FBI has seen a spike in criminal forum posts about emergency data requests and stolen email credentials from police departments and government agencies. Cybercriminals are getting into compromised U.S. and foreign government email accounts and using them to send fake emergency data requests to U.S.-based companies, which exposes customer data for further misuse in other crimes.",
      "In August 2024, a popular cybercriminal on an online forum advertised \"high-quality .gov emails\" for sale, meant for espionage, social engineering, data extortion, emergency data requests and more. The listing even included U.S. credentials, and the seller claimed they could guide buyers on making emergency data requests and even sell real stolen subpoena documents to help them pose as law enforcement.",
      "Another cybercriminal boasted about owning government emails from over 25 countries. They claimed anyone can use these emails to send a subpoena to a tech company and get access to usernames, emails, phone numbers and other personal client info. Some con artists are even hosting a \"masterclass\" on how to create and submit their own emergency data requests to pull data on any social media account, charging $100 for the full rundown.",
      "Illustration of a scammer at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WINDOWS FLAW LETS HACKERS SNEAK INTO YOUR PC OVER WI-FI",
      "How this phishing scam works",
      "When law enforcement, whether federal, state or local, wants information about someone\u2019s account at a tech company, like their email address or other account details, they typically need a warrant, subpoena or court order. When a tech company receives one of these requests from an official email address, they\u2019re required to comply. So, if a scammer gets access to a government email, they can fake a subpoena and get information on just about anyone.",
      "To bypass verification, scammers often send emergency data requests, claiming that someone\u2019s life is at risk and that the data is needed urgently. Because companies don\u2019t want to delay in case of an actual emergency, they may hand over the information, even if the request turns out to be fake. By portraying it as a life-or-death situation, scammers make it harder for companies to take time to verify the request.",
      "For example, the FBI reported that earlier this year, a known cybercriminal posted pictures on an online forum of a fake emergency data request they\u2019d sent to PayPal. The scammer tried to make it look legitimate by using a fraudulent mutual legal assistance treaty, claiming it was part of a local investigation into child trafficking, complete with a case number and legal code for verification. However, PayPal recognized that it wasn\u2019t a real law enforcement request and denied it.",

      "CYBERSCAMMERS USE AI TO MANIPULATE GOOGLE SEARCH RESULTS",
      "What can companies do to avoid falling for these phishing scams?",
      "1) Verify all data requests: Before sharing sensitive information, companies should verify every data request, even those that look legitimate. Establish a protocol for confirming requests directly with the agency or organization that supposedly sent them.",
      "2) Strengthen email security:\u00a0Use email authentication protocols like DMARC, SPF and DKIM to block emails from unauthorized sources. Implement anti-phishing filters to detect suspicious content in messages.",
      "3) Train employees on phishing awareness: Regular training sessions on phishing scams can help employees recognize red flags, such as urgent language, unusual requests or emails from unknown addresses. Employees should be encouraged to report suspicious emails.",
      "4) Limit access to sensitive data: Restrict who can view or share sensitive customer data. Fewer people with access means fewer chances for accidental or intentional data leaks.",
      "5) Implement emergency verification procedures: Have a clear verification process in place for \"emergency\" data requests, including steps for double-checking with higher management or legal teams before responding to any urgent request for customer information.",
      "Illustration of a scammer at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Is there something you need to do?",
      "This particular phishing scam mostly targets big tech companies, so there\u2019s not much you can do directly. However, it\u2019s a reminder that you shouldn\u2019t automatically trust an email, even if it comes from a .gov address. Here are some steps you can take to stay safe.",
      "1) Double-check email addresses and links: Even if an email looks official, take a moment to check the sender\u2019s email address and hover over any links to see where they actually lead. Be cautious if anything looks off. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Use\u00a02FA for all sensitive accounts. This extra layer of security helps protect you even if your login credentials are compromised.",
      "3) Stay updated on phishing scams:\u00a0Keep an eye on the latest phishing tactics, so you know what to look out for. Regular updates help you spot new types of scams before they affect you.",
      "4) Verify suspicious requests:\u00a0If you get an unexpected email asking for sensitive info, contact the sender directly through an official channel to confirm the request.",

      "Scammers are taking phishing emails to a whole new level. I often recommend checking the email carefully when you receive anything suspicious to see if it\u2019s legit. But now, since scammers can even access government emails, you need to be extra cautious. This phishing scam seems to target mostly big tech companies, so it\u2019s on them to strengthen their security and verify every request thoroughly before sharing any user information. It's also up to governments worldwide to protect their digital assets from being compromised.",

      "While Siri's confusion can be frustrating, there are several ways to work around the issue. The most effective solution seems to be using Siri Shortcuts or Voice Control, as these methods create unique commands that are less likely to be misinterpreted across devices. It's worth noting that voice assistant technology is continually improving. In the future, we may see more sophisticated context recognition that can better distinguish between similar names on different devices. Until then, these workarounds should help Mike avoid any more awkward explanations to his colleague Terry!",

    "story": [
      "Chef Robert Irvine of the Robert Irvine Foundation speaks with Fox News Digital about the importance of supporting veterans and first responders this Veterans Day and some unique ways to do so.",
      "Cyberscammers are some of the most heartless people out there. They don\u2019t even spare our military heroes.",
      "Last year, these criminals stole $477 million from veterans, military personnel and their spouses, according to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). That\u2019s a $63 million jump from 2022, showing that the military community is a big target for scammers. The number of military members who lost money to these attacks went up by 7% to 30,948, per the FTC\u2019s latest data.",
      "These scammers use all kinds of tricks to get veterans to hand over personal info or hard-earned cash, including veterans' benefit scams and IRS scams. I break down five of the most common scams targeting our military heroes and how to stay safe from them.",

      "Image of military personnel (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Romance scams",
      "Romance scams have become an increasingly painful reality for veterans, as scammers target them through fake online relationships to exploit their emotions and financial stability. Often, these scammers pose as attractive, understanding individuals on dating apps, social media platforms or even support forums specifically tailored for veterans. They\u2019ll build a relationship over weeks or months, using flattery and fabricated stories to create a strong emotional connection with their target.",
      "Once the scammer believes they\u2019ve gained enough trust, they\u2019ll ask for money, typically by inventing a sudden, urgent situation. It might be a \"medical emergency,\" a supposed travel expense to come to visit or even a claim that they need help with a legal matter. The requests start small but can quickly escalate as the scammer continues to manipulate the victim's emotions.",
      "This continues to be the most common fraud targeting veterans, costing them and their families over $40 million in 2020, according to Aura. Among all romance scam victims, those ages 50-69 were hit the hardest, losing $179.65 million in just the first three quarters of 2022. That figure has almost certainly surged in 2024.",
      "Image of military personnel supporting one another (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "NEARLY 1 MILLION MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES FACE DATA BREACH",
      "Veterans benefit scams",
      "Some scammers pretend to offer help with veterans' benefits. They promise to help increase benefits or expedite claims, but they\u2019re really after personal information or a fee. A scammer might claim you\u2019re eligible for new or additional benefits, contacting you by phone, email or text. When dealing with unsolicited advice, remember that if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Phishing scams from fake government agencies",
      "Phishing scams are a social engineering trick where scammers send emails that look like they\u2019re from official places, like the government or your bank. These legit-looking emails act as bait, but the real goal is to grab your banking or credit card info.",
      "Sometimes, these scam emails will ask you to click a link or download an attachment, which can install malware on your device. Scammers are also known to send phishing links through LinkedIn, Facebook or other social media.",
      "One classic example is the IRS scam. Though it targets everyone, military members are prime targets. Scammers pretend to be IRS agents, threatening jail time, fines or other penalties if they don\u2019t get immediate payment. They even spoof IRS caller IDs to make their calls look real.",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Rental property scams",
      "Rental property scams are a common way scammers try to exploit people looking for a place to rent. In these scams, fraudsters often post fake listings for apartments or houses on popular rental websites or social media platforms. The listing might look too good to be true, like a beautiful place at an unbelievably low price.",
      "The scammer will usually claim to be out of town or unavailable to meet in person, asking potential renters to send a deposit or rent payment upfront to \"secure\" the property. In some cases, they may even send fake lease agreements or claim that the property is already rented, but they can still \"help\" find a similar place.",
      "BEWARE OF THIS SOCIAL SECURITY SCAM BY CROOKS TRYING TO TRICK YOU",
      "Car sales and financing scams",
      "Car sales and financing scams targeting veterans are unfortunately common. Scammers know that veterans may have limited experience with certain financial deals, so they exploit that by offering unrealistic car sales or financing options. These scams can take various forms, and the result is often financial loss and stress.",
      "Image of military personnel honoring our troops (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6 ways veterans can protect themselves from scams",
      "1) Be cautious with unsolicited offers: Whether it\u2019s a phone call, email or text, if someone claims to offer help with veterans' benefits or promises something too good to be true, don\u2019t take the bait. Verify the legitimacy of any offer directly through official channels like the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or trusted veteran organizations.",
      "2) Watch out for emotional manipulation in online relationships: Romance scammers often prey on veterans' emotions. Avoid sharing personal or financial details with people you meet online, especially if the relationship feels rushed or too perfect. If someone asks for money after just a few weeks or months, it\u2019s likely a scam.",
      "3) Verify government communications: Scammers often impersonate government agencies like the IRS or VA. If you get a message that threatens penalties or asks for personal information, don\u2019t respond. Instead, contact the agency directly using official contact details to confirm whether the message is legitimate.",
      "4) Be skeptical of rental or car sale deals that seem too good to be true: If a rental listing or car sale seems too cheap or perfect to be true, it probably is. Always visit the property or dealership in person, and never send money upfront without seeing the product or having a signed agreement.",
      "5) Protect your personal information: Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. Scammers use phishing emails and fake websites to steal personal and financial information. Ensure your devices have updated security software and be extra cautious when handling sensitive data online.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6)\u00a0Invest in data removal services: Consider using data removal services to protect your personal information from being harvested by scammers. These services can help remove your data from public databases and people-search websites, reducing the risk of identity theft and unwanted solicitations.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Scammers rely on misinformation to trick you. However, by staying informed and being extra careful when navigating the internet, you can stay safe. These bad actors are constantly finding new ways to target veterans, from romance scams to fake government offers. Being cautious, verifying offers and keeping your data secure are the best ways to avoid falling victim to these heartless fraudsters.",

      "A woman using a VPN on a tablet\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is a VPN?",
      "A VPN, or virtual private network, is a service that encrypts your internet connection, ensuring that your online activities remain private and secure. By routing your internet traffic through a secure server, VPNs mask your IP address, making it difficult for hackers and malicious entities to track your online behavior.",
      "A VPN being used on a laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "CAN YOU BYPASS VPN BLOCKS AND PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY?",
      "How VPNs work",
      "VPNs operate through two primary mechanisms \u2014 IP address masking and data encryption. When you connect to a VPN, it hides your real IP address by assigning you a new one from its server network, effectively preventing websites and cybercriminals from tracking your location or identifying you based on your IP address.",
      "Simultaneously, VPNs encrypt all data transmitted between your device and the internet, rendering it unreadable to anyone who might attempt to intercept it. This encryption process ensures that sensitive information, such as credit card details, remains confidential throughout your online activities. By combining these two powerful features, VPNs create a secure tunnel for your internet traffic, significantly enhancing your online privacy and security.",

So, how can a VPN prevent identity theft? By encrypting your internet connection, VPNs protect against data breaches and unauthorized access to personal information, especially on unsecured networks like public Wi-Fi.

A VPN can be used as a shield for financial data. VPNs ensure that all data exchanged during online transactions is encrypted, making it nearly impossible for hackers to access sensitive financial information. When using public Wi-Fi networks, which are often targeted by cybercriminals, a VPN provides an additional layer of security by encrypting all data transmissions.",

      "In an ominous warning on Wednesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that North Korea\u2019s military involvement in Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine poses a threat beyond the immediate conflict with Kyiv, and it could mean Moscow is aiding Pyongyang in its nuclear development.",
      "\"The fact is, the relationship between Russia and North Korea is a two-way street,\" Blinken said while speaking alongside Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha from NATO\u2019s headquarters in Brussels. \"North Korea is helping Russia and its aggression against Ukraine.",
      "\"At the same time, the support that Russia is providing to North Korea, potentially including support for its nuclear and missile programs, poses a threat to civility and security in the Korean peninsula as well,\" he added.",

      "Blinken\u2019s comments coincided with the Wednesday announcement from South Korean intelligence that North Korean troops had begun combat operations against Ukrainian forces in Kursk \u2013 just weeks after the U.S. warned that some 8,000 North Korean soldiers had been moved to the region where Ukraine opened offensive operations in August.",
      "Blinken called the development \"very significant and very negative\" as it \"increases the threat to security and stability in Europe, but also in the Asia Pacific region.\"",
      "The secretary argued North Korea\u2019s direct combat operations against Ukraine indicates that adversarial nations like Russia, North Korea and Iran are increasingly becoming jointly embroiled in malign activity across the globe.",
      "\"I think we see increasingly the indivisibility and security between the Euro-Atlantic Theater, the Indo-Pacific, Asia-Pacific theaters, even the Middle East, with the role that Iran plays,\" Blinken said, noting the U.S. and its NATO allies are \"very focused on this.\"",
      "Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister echoed Blinken\u2019s warnings and argued \"the future of Transatlantic and global security is being decided in Ukraine.\"",
      "Sybiha highlighted Russia\u2019s latest strike against Kyiv overnight on Tuesday, in which a combination of drones and missiles targeted the capital city for the first time since August. Though civilians were forced to seek shelter in the underground train stations, no causalities have been reported.",

      "\"Russia is using Iranian drones\u2026and North Korean troops to attack Ukraine. It provides assistance to those regions in return,\" Sybiha said. \"This is how this war undermines security in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. This is all linked together.",

      "Uncertainty has mounted over how President-elect Donald Trump will handle these complex security situations, in particular, whether Trump will continue military aid to Ukraine, and Blinken said the Biden administration will use its remaining time to bolster defensive aid to Kyiv.",

      "Sen.

      "As of yet, no official statement has come from Taiwanese President William Lai, but in 2019, when Lai was vice president to then-President Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan\u2019s\u00a0Ministry of Foreign Affairs offered its gratitude to Sen.

      "Rubio is blunt on China, writing on X, for example, \"Communist China is not, and will never be, a friend to democratic nations.\" In May 2022, Rubio introduced the \"Taiwan Peace Through Strength Act,\" a bill that would fast-track U.S.-Taiwan military coordination.\u00a0Rubio stated in connection to the bill that, \"Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is not the first time an authoritarian regime invaded its neighbor and, unfortunately, it won\u2019t be the last. An invasion of Taiwan could happen within this decade. Taiwan needs our support, and my bill will make Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party think twice before launching a foolish invasion. We must do all we can to deter an attack on Taiwan, or we risk losing the Indo-Pacific region to the Chinese Communist Party.\"",
      "Rubio as a potential secretary of state is a problem for China, as the Florida Republican is blacklisted, or in more diplomatic terms, \"sanctioned.\" Rubio was among the 11 U.S. senators China sanctioned in 2020 for their \"wrong U.S. behaviors \u2026 who have behaved egregiously on Hong Kong-related issues.\"",

      "After the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel and the subsequent wars against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, Iran-backed groups have not only levied increasing fire at Washington\u2019s top ally in the Middle East, but also its troops in Iraq and Syria as well as U.S. naval vessels targeted by Houthi terrorists in Yemen.",

Though the figure is still just half the number of attacks levied in January when some 34 strikes targeted U.S. personnel in Syria along with 19 in Iraq.",
      "Cicurel clarified for Fox News Digital that these strikes are by organizations like the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which is an \"umbrella mechanism for Iran\u2019s proxies\" and includes terrorist groups likes Kataib Hezbollah, Kataib Sayyid al-Shuhada, Asaib Ahl al-Haq, Ansar Allah al-Awfiya and Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba, to claim attacks against Israel and U.S. forces.\"",

      "But according to the JINSA report, prior to the October 2023 attacks by Hamas, Iran-sanctioned militant groups opted to target U.S. troops over Israeli positions because \"Iranian-linked groups determined that the U.S. responses would be less forceful than Israel\u2019s.\"",

      "Iran sent a written message via Swiss diplomats in mid-October saying that it would not seek to kill Donald Trump, according to a U.S. official.",
      "The message came after the Biden administration had sent a warning through Switzerland that it would view an assassination attempt against Trump as an act of war, the official said.",

      "Last week, the Justice Department charged an Iranian man with plotting to assassinate Trump as a part of a murder-for-hire scheme.",

      "The official told the man that if he didn't have a plot in place by then, the IRGC would \u201cpause its plan to kill [Trump] until after the U.S. presidential elections\u201d because they believed he would lose and it would then be easier to target him, the complaint alleges.",
      "The deadline appears to coincide with the timing of the message to Switzerland.",
      "The Justice Department said the plot was part of Iran\u2019s efforts to exact revenge for the death of Iranian top general Qasem Soleimani in 2020 during Trump\u2019s first term in office. Trump ordered a U.S. drone strike that killed Soleimani in Baghdad.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s announcement Thursday that he had chosen anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services was met with alarm from doctors and public health advocates.",
      "\u201cConcerned,\u201d said Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go backwards and see children or adults suffer or lose their lives to remind us that vaccines work.\u201d",
      "\u201cSpeechless,\u201d said Dr. Richard Besser, former acting director of the CDC, adding that Kennedy \u201cwould imperil the health of people across the country.\u201d",
      "\u201cShocked,\u201d said Dr. Paul Offit, professor of pediatrics at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and co-inventor of the rotavirus vaccine. \u201cIt\u2019s like Typhoid Mary being in charge of food safety.\u201d",
      "But another group was celebrating Trump\u2019s pick: the anti-vaccine movement Kennedy leads.",
      "On Friday, Mary Holland, CEO of the Kennedy-founded anti-vaccine nonprofit Children\u2019s Health Defense, shared her elation on the group\u2019s online TV morning show. She and Polly Tommey, director of CHD.TV and a longtime anti-vaccine activist, reflected on Kennedy\u2019s power within their campaign.",
      "\u201cBobby Kennedy was the first prominent citizen, the first prominent American, to really take up our banner and to join us,\u201d Holland said of Trump\u2019s pick.",
      "\u201cTo parents around the world with vaccine-injured children that either were killed or are very injured, I want to thank you for all your bravery. This day is for you. This news is for you,\u201d\u00a0 Tommey said.",
      "Kennedy did not return a request for comment.",
      "As a presidential candidate, Kennedy tried to distance himself from the anti-vaccine movement he helped build, while remaining a mainstay in the community, appearing on podcasts and at events supporting the cause. Now the movement\u2019s most vocal activists, many of whom worked for Kennedy\u2019s campaign and his nonprofit, are reveling in the legitimacy a Trump endorsement brings and hoping Kennedy has a chance at confirmation.",
      "Holland urged viewers to \u201ceducate\u201d the public and Congress that Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaccine claims were accurate, aiming to boost his support among senators who would vote on his confirmation. Republicans will control the Senate by a slim margin, and he has drawn a mixed reaction so far.",
      "Holland pleaded for those \u201cthat care about the truth that vaccines do cause autism, vaccines do cause chronic disease and harms, they do cause death, we need to align with Bobby Kennedy.\u201d She added, \u201cWe will have a big job as citizens, reaching out to our senators to really insist that this go through.\u201d",
      "Vaccines are safe and an essential piece of public health; repeated studies have disproved the claim that they cause autism or chronic disease.",
      "Holland finished the show with a comment on the symbiotic relationship between Kennedy and the anti-vaccine effort.",
      "\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be able to do this, but for the grassroots support that he\u2019s had from all of us for the last 20 years,\u201d Holland said. \u201cHe is really a reflection of us. He is aligned with us, and he has taken on our battle.\u201d",
      "Kennedy\u2019s activism started in the early aughts, when women began appearing at his environmental talks, ultimately convincing him of their cause: that their children were being harmed by vaccines. He quickly became the face of the movement, protesting, often controversially, against childhood vaccine mandates.",
      "Kennedy now has a chance to bring that advocacy into the top public health office in the country.",
      "\u201cWE DID IT!!!!\u201d posted Del Bigtree, leader of the country\u2019s second-best-funded anti-vaccine organization, Informed Consent Action Network. Bigtree, who served as the Kennedy campaign\u2019s communications director, now leads a super PAC (MAHA Alliance) and a nonprofit organization (MAHA Action), both named for Kennedy\u2019s Make America Healthy Again slogan.",
      "Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, a self-described \u201cdoctor who speaks out about vaccines,\u201d known for her false claims that Covid vaccines made people magnetic, also praised Trump. \u201cFinally, America\u2019s children are going to have a fighting chance to be healthy,\u201d she posted to X.",
      "\u201cTotally game-changing,\u201d said Steve Kirsch, a veteran Silicon Valley entrepreneur who during the pandemic became a major funder of anti-vaccine propaganda and events. On the podcast from his anti-vaccine organization, the Vaccine Safety Research Foundation, Kirsch called the possible HHS job \u201cbetter than if RFK had won for president,\u201d as it would allow Kennedy to focus only on health.",
      "\u201cThis is like a dream come true,\u201d he said.",
      "In numerous interviews, Kennedy has laid out what he would do as head of a department with a more than $1.5 trillion budget, a position former HHS Secretary Alex Azar once described as having \u201ca shocking amount of power by the stroke of a pen.\u201d",
      "Kennedy sees the role as an opportunity to disrupt a government conspiracy, one he believes without evidence has been engineered by officials, doctors, scientists, and drug and food companies to keep America sick.",
      "Kennedy has said he would overhaul agencies like the CDC, National Institutes of Health and Food and Drug Administration and replace \u201ccorrupt\u201d officials with \u201chonest public servants.\u201d He has said he would investigate and \u201cin a couple of months\u201d would find the cause of autism in children, which he has repeatedly and falsely linked to childhood vaccines.",
      "Kennedy has said he would gut some agencies and refocus others, including the NIH. \u201cWe\u2019re going to give infectious disease a break for about eight years,\u201d he said at an anti-vaccine conference last year.",
      "Those in the anti-vaccine movement weren\u2019t the only ones celebrating Trump\u2019s pick. Those on the far right who had taken up the anti-vaccine mantle during the pandemic seemed equally pleased.",
      "\u201cI actually just got dizzy, this is so good,\u201d conspiracy theorist host Alex Jones said on his show to political operative and Trump ally Roger Stone, reacting to the appointment. Stone replied, \u201cI am over the moon about the appointment.\u201d",
      "Others relished how Kennedy might bring a dreamed-about reckoning in public health agencies and retribution against former public health officials.",
      "\u201cCan I say now, Fauci, we put his head on a pike?\u201d Steve Bannon said on his show Thursday. \u201cNo, no, no, no,\u201d he continued, \u201cDr. Fauci, I didn\u2019t mean it. I know you\u2019re all worried about your security.\u201d",
      "During the pandemic, Kennedy was one of the loudest voices villainizing Dr. Anthony Fauci, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and he has said Fauci should be prosecuted if he committed crimes. Fauci, who has described being the target of death threats and harassment, has called Kennedy a \u201cvery disturbed individual.\u201d",
      "Author and conspiracy theorist Naomi Wolf, who joined Bannon\u2019s Thursday show, focused on the myriad crimes she imagined had been committed by Fauci and drug companies, offering to advise the future HHS secretary while acknowledging hurdles to Kennedy\u2019s appointment, including confirmation.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t celebrate till you\u2019re over the finish line,\u201d she said."

    "story": [
      "In the closing weeks of the presidential campaign, Sen. John Fetterman did something different than other Democrats.",
      "He went on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast, a show Democrats had been urging Vice President Kamala Harris to do \u2014 and the kind of appearance Democrats feel their candidates need to get more comfortable making in the current media environment.",
      "But Fetterman, who built a blunt, says-what-he-means brand, said Democratic setbacks in 2024 had more to do with unpopular positions progressives promoted than any lack of communication from the party\u2019s center-left establishment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not even what you might say as a candidate,\u201d Fetterman said in an interview, adding \u201call of the very hard-left, kind of \u2018woke\u2019 things\u201d Republicans used in advertising this year \u201care unloaded on the backs of all of us in purple states, and we\u2019re paying for all of the things that our colleagues might say in these hard blue kinds of districts.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s part of Fetterman\u2019s broader post-election message for his party. Moving forward, he says, Democrats can\u2019t get wrapped up in \u201cfreaking out\u201d over every controversial move Trump makes, adding that has proven to be a losing formula for the party and its brand. He was speaking after Trump selected former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., for attorney general and just before he tapped Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as his pick to run the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve said this before, it\u2019s like, clutch those pearls harder and scold louder \u2014 that\u2019s not going to win,\u201d Fetterman, D-Pa., said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s been demonstrated in this cycle.\u201d",
      "In the interview, Fetterman detailed his thoughts on this month\u2019s election, how he\u2019s readying for his party\u2019s life in the wilderness and whether he has interest in seeking the presidency in 2028.",
      "The following transcript has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "NBC NEWS: As you\u2019re looking in the rearview mirror a little bit at the 2024 election, do you think Democrats need to change how they talk to voters? Or was what happened last week really something that came down to policy choices or people being upset over inflation, immigration, you name it?",
      "FETTERMAN: When the election comes down to a handful of states \u2014 and I said this \u2014 it\u2019s never going to be about money, because we had much more money than they had. And it\u2019s not going to be about obscure white paper policies and about nuance.",
      "I pointed out there were two very incredibly unique situations, and one of them was the assassination [attempt]. Now think about when that\u2019s happened in American history, of course, Lincoln and Kennedy and Reagan. But this never happened when it\u2019s the year of an election and when the individual survived. And he responded in a very distinctive way of \u201cfight, fight, fight,\u201d and it created very powerful kind of imagery. And I felt, \u201cHey, that\u2019s definitely going to make things even more difficult.\u201d",
      "And then [Elon] Musk. Surrogates are common in our business, but someone like that is different, and I\u2019ve maintained that he can move the needle, and I do believe he did \u2026 that\u2019s why we\u2019ve lost two of our colleagues in the House, and we\u2019ve lost every row office statewide, as well. And now the race is so close for my colleague and friend Bob Casey, and now that\u2019s in the recount.",
      "I knew the border was going to be a real issue for our party \u2026 wanting a secure border and realizing that it was out of control, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a xenophobe or you\u2019re racist or anything. It\u2019s just, we need a secure border.",
      "NBC NEWS: Jumping off of that, was the result, whether you\u2019re thinking about in Pennsylvania or nationally, was this essentially inevitable or was there anything you think Democrats could have done differently and this could have gone the other way?",
      "FETTERMAN: I\u2019ve asked that question a lot. It\u2019s like, was it ever a winnable cycle? And I mean, who knows. But I\u2019ve always maintained, just like in the last three cycles, that it\u2019s going to be incredibly close, that\u2019s a fact. And it was a coin toss in 2016 and it was a coin toss of some sort in 2020 and if anything happened in our cycle here in '24, it felt more like a message that people had a choice, and it was very clear, and that gut check vote, and convincingly it put down on their side.",
      "\u2026",
      "If you look at the emoji for the slot machine, and you could see it \u2014 7-7-7, that means it\u2019s a jackpot. And they just got the 7-7-7. You got the House. Boom. They have the Senate. Boom. They\u2019ve got the presidency. And the real jackpot is they have the Supreme Court. And now here's where we are.",
      "If that\u2019s what you want, then you better buckle up, because here\u2019s where we are, and it\u2019s going to be a four-year ride, at least for two years, until there\u2019s an inevitable level of backlash and they lose the House.",
      "NBC NEWS: You got a lot of attention for going on Joe Rogan\u2019s show in the last week of the campaign. I feel like we\u2019ve gone through three presidential cycles in a row where the Democratic strategy, particularly as it relates to media, is, play it safe, don\u2019t make any mistakes, don\u2019t give your opponents any ammunition they could use against you. But in this modern media environment, do you think that Democrats going forward have to be willing to take more risks and really develop a media strategy that is more about going into places that might be less friendly?",
      "FETTERMAN: It\u2019s not even what you might say as a candidate. It might be other of our colleagues from your deep-blue districts will say those kinds of things, and then it\u2019s like they weaponize that, and they use that against you. For all of the very hard-left, kind of \u201cwoke\u201d things [Republicans] loaded up into the clips \u2026 are unloaded on the backs of all of us in purple states, and we\u2019re paying for all of the things that our colleagues might say in these hard blue kinds of districts.",
      "And that\u2019s the business that we\u2019re in. We can\u2019t forget that anything you say is immediately going to be nationalized, and that it\u2019s going to be weaponized in these kinds of states. So it\u2019s not so much what we say or our own views, it\u2019s what the most extreme in our party say and project that\u2019s going to get weaponized, and it\u2019s undeniable that\u2019s happened.",
      "NBC NEWS: Well, then do you feel as if some members of the Democratic Party, who might not agree with some of the more extreme things that get said, have been afraid to fully confront them, out of fear of offending some part of the electorate? And is that changing?",
      "FETTERMAN: I\u2019m not going to pander. I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s like, \u201cHey just remember, all of the safe positions in your district, or those things you say, those will be weaponized on the backs [of] the purple states and colleagues that have to defend that. It\u2019s like, they are running your record [in] some of these purple states, as well. And that\u2019s the concern. It\u2019s not a criticism so much as it\u2019s just, that\u2019s the reality.",
      "NBC NEWS: What is your biggest concern moving forward, and what\u2019s kind of the biggest thing that you think Democrats need to address?",
      "FETTERMAN: It\u2019s like he\u2019s the guy with the laser pointer, and we\u2019re going to be the cat chasing around here or there. \u201cHe did that. Can you believe [it]? I can\u2019t believe he appointed so and so.\u201d And like, I\u2019m not going to be that. I\u2019m not that guy. I\u2019m not that Democrat. Because we knew that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen.",
      "And, like, Gaetz was the ultimate troll. That\u2019s got to be candy for him to have and watch everybody get triggered. I\u2019ve said this before, it\u2019s like, clutch those pearls harder and scold louder, that\u2019s not going to win. And that\u2019s been demonstrated in this cycle.",
      "NBC NEWS: You brought up Gaetz and you said that there was kind of a \u201cGod-tier\u201d trolling element to this. Do you think among Democrats \u2014",
      "FETTERMAN: I mean, yes. 100%. It\u2019s like, I know he has no respect on the Republican side as well, too. So it was just like an opportunity \u2026 and that\u2019s the thing. If you\u2019re already exhausted, freaking out, and it\u2019s not even Thanksgiving, then you really ought to pace yourselves. Because he hasn\u2019t even been inaugurated yet. So you really have to chill out, and you\u2019re going to have to be more discerning or discriminate on what\u2019s going to freak you out or what\u2019s just trolling. Because it\u2019s not the weather, it\u2019s the climate now for the next four years.",
      "NBC NEWS: So to bounce off that, has there been a conversation among Democrats that\u2019s essentially what you\u2019re talking about?",
      "FETTERMAN: We just had one, literally. I emerged from a caucus lunch for that. They have \u2026 it\u2019s undeniable, the 7-7-7 that you America voted for is here. And if you think The Onion buying Infowars is, you know, like, OK. Would I rather have the control of the House, Senate and the presidency or, well, you know, the Onion bought Infowars. Well, sick burn. Sick burn.",
      "NBC NEWS: To put a finer point on this: Democrats now are viewing this as, look, we can\u2019t be freaking out about every individual thing that happens, like we\u2019ve got to be measured?",
      "FETTERMAN: That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. Unless you don\u2019t, you are going to be the cat, and he\u2019ll be the guy with the laser pointer, and you\u2019re going to be chasing it around the whole room. And again, I don\u2019t understand why people just, they think freaking out [matters]. And I don\u2019t understand. And if the sick burns really mattered, you know, here we wouldn\u2019t be.",
      "NBC NEWS: You mentioned Musk and his role in Pennsylvania. One of the biggest things Trump\u2019s announced so far is this advisory committee that Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are going to be running to look at making significant cuts to federal spending and to the federal bureaucracy. How do you think Democrats should handle this development? And what do you think that group is ultimately going to do?",
      "FETTERMAN: Here\u2019s the truth, the only governing force that can stop or temper that [is] going to be the bravest Republicans in the House or in the Senate. It\u2019s not going to us because we won\u2019t have the votes. We don\u2019t have the votes. We\u2019re in the minority. It\u2019s going to come down to how much craziness, how much absurdity will the Republicans in the House or the Senate want to jam up or not. And that\u2019s a fact because of what happened in 2024. We don\u2019t have the votes and they even have enough throwaway votes.",
      "NBC NEWS: Looking at your home county, Allegheny, one of the only urban areas in the country where Kamala Harris actually expanded on her share of the vote compared to Biden in 2020. This is completely against all the trends that have happened nationally. What is going on in the Pittsburgh area that caused the election results there to be different than in so many other places?",
      "FETTERMAN: We have a lot of pride in our history about labor and about what really works \u2026 and so I\u2019m not surprised to know that.",
      "\u2026",
      "I really want to talk about this, I called them out and I\u2019ll do this again, because now we know the margin. To every individual that chose to throw away their votes for the Greens \u2014 [65,000] people threw their vote away on the Greens. I assume that they thought that those people were going to project their values, because that is more than twice the size of the margin that might be what cost somebody like Bob Casey and that just installed Dave McCormick for the next six years. So I\u2019m here to call them out and it\u2019s like, congratulations, and you own that.",
      "(Editor\u2019s note: NBC News has not yet projected a winner in the Pennsylvania Senate race, which is in the middle of a recount at the moment.)",
      "NBC NEWS: Have you spoken with McCormick at all? Do you think he\u2019s someone you can work with?",
      "FETTERMAN: I have not. I don\u2019t have any personal animus. But I push back. Counting every vote, that\u2019s not controversial. And it\u2019s a recount. \u2026 that\u2019s the law. And then when the law gets triggered and that gets used, then, hey, we\u2019ve just got to wait and we know where we\u2019re at. But it\u2019s undeniable. It\u2019s 26,000 votes. And how many people threw away their votes for Greens? And imagine just like what they\u2019ve done for [Hillary] Clinton in \u201816, you\u2019ve turned around, you never learned your lesson. And look at what you possibly may have cost people that are most likely to have your kinds of values.",
      "NBC NEWS: Could Kamala Harris have done anything different that you think might have changed the results?",
      "FETTERMAN: I\u2019ll never be in that place. I mean, it\u2019s been a pleasure to campaign with her across my state. And I\u2019m not going to be part of like the piling on or the \u201cyou should\u2019ves.\u201d I\u2019m not going to shoot on anybody at this point.",
      "NBC NEWS: Obviously it\u2019s early, but when you think about 2028, would you have any interest in running for president?",
      "FETTERMAN: Nah. I would say this to anyone, never get high on your own supply. And I don\u2019t know who I\u2019m referencing. But, yeah."

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 23:06:45 GMT",
    "summary": "Democratic Sen.-elect Ruben Gallego says he won Arizona by appealing to Latinos, especially men, and taking seriously their economic concerns.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego is giving his party something to celebrate in an otherwise brutal 2024 election, winning an open Senate race in battleground Arizona, even as President-elect Donald Trump carried it handily.",
      "The senator-elect did it by outperforming Vice President Kamala Harris' margin by 8 points in the state. Latino voters overall were more than a quarter of Arizona\u2019s electorate \u2014 Gallego won them by 22 points while Harris carried them by 10 points. As for Latino men, Trump won them by 12 points nationally, marking a stunning 35-point swing from 2020\u00a0that powered\u00a0him to victory in key states,  according to NBC News' exit polls. But Gallego held his ground with Latino men, winning them by 30 points, exit polls showed.",
      "In an interview Friday, Gallego said he recognized early on that fellow Latinos were persuadable voters and not merely a base mobilization target. When asked why Democratic leaders misunderstood the electorate, Gallego said those who failed to empathize with the depth of pain felt by Latinos from the pandemic and inflation paid the price for it.",
      "\u201cI think we are missing the two things that were very compounded between 2020 and 2024. Men \u2014 Latino men \u2014 were feeling very insecure about their positions in the family because they wanted to make sure that they\u2019re providers and providing security and economic security. During Covid, we shut down businesses \u2014 and for good reason, we had to make sure that we were stopping the spread of Covid,\u201d Gallego told NBC News in the Capitol. \u201cBut people were kept out of work.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese men were working but weren\u2019t able to support their families as much as they wanted. They weren\u2019t able to buy homes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so it\u2019s the same commonality. If we don\u2019t answer the economic pressure, the bottom-line wallet pressure that these men have \u2014 and it\u2019s not just Latino men, I think men in general \u2014 we\u2019re going to continue having these problems.\u201d",
      "Gallego said he tailored his campaign and message to acknowledge their plight. He spoke of his humble beginnings, being raised by a single mom, empathized with the aspirations of working-class voters to succeed and persuaded them he would focus on fixing what's broken.",
      "\u201cAnd we just did that, over and over again,\u201d he said.",
      "It worked. He outperformed Harris among voters who cited the economy as their top concern, exit polls showed, and covered off the vulnerability that sank many Democrats, including Harris. While Trump won the state, Gallego defeated Republican Kari Lake, who modeled her campaign on the former president\u2019s MAGA model.",
      "On paper, some Democrats were initially skeptical that someone like Gallego, who as a congressman represented a deep-blue Phoenix area House district, had what it took to win statewide in Arizona. Gallego quietly left the Congressional Progressive Caucus during his Senate run and also broke with the Biden administration\u2019s unpopular record on immigration enforcement. Harris, as the vice president overseeing that record, struggled to do the same.",
      "\u201cWe took a very strong and direct approach at border security because we knew that the Latino community was actually also worried about border security,\u201d he said.",
      "When asked where he can find common ground with Trump next year, Gallego said, \u201cNumber one, border security.\u201d",
      "Trump and his allies poured millions into anti-transgender ads across the country, including in Arizona, to paint Democrats as focused on the wrong priorities. Gallego said he saw the ads but argued that they didn\u2019t work on him.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t see them resonating. Look, when I was out communicating, talking to people, having town halls in English and Spanish everywhere, I heard more about grocery store prices, about grocery store mergers,\u201d he said. \u201cActually, I don\u2019t remember ever having a conversation about trans and trans students. So it may have had an impact in other campaigns. I think because we were communicating who we were \u2014 people knew my background, knew I was working class, knew that I was fighting for them \u2014 I don\u2019t think it really had any impact.\u201d",
      "Gallego said Lake hasn\u2019t contacted him to concede the race, which NBC News projected for the Democrat late Monday night. He isn\u2019t holding his breath.",
      "\u201cNo tweets, no texts, no Snapchats,\u201d he laughed. \u201cBut it\u2019s OK. We\u2019re moving on. We\u2019re here to work for all Arizonans, including people like Kari Lake.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "During her murder trial this year, Ashley Benefield offered hours of emotional testimony about the abuse she said she suffered at the hands of her estranged husband \u2014 and about what happened in the terrifying moments before she fatally shot Doug Benefield in an act she described as self-defense.",
      "But not everyone was convinced by the former ballerina\u2019s apparent tears.",
      "The assistant state attorney for Florida\u2019s 12th Judicial District, Suzanne O\u2019Donnell, told \u201cDateline\u201d that, believing Ashley Benefield was performing \u2014 and not actually crying \u2014 she asked for the courtroom lights to be turned up. And she had Ashley step down from the witness stand to re-enact moment by moment her account of the fatal shooting of Doug, 58, at her home south of Tampa on Sept. 27, 2020, O\u2019Donnell said.",
      "What followed was one of the most wrenching exchanges of a six-day trial in which prosecutors accused Ashley of exaggerating and fabricating claims of abuse in an effort to win a protracted custody battle \u201cat all costs.\u201d",
      "\u201cOnce I realized she was not really crying, I knew she had to get down in front of that jury,\u201d O\u2019Donnell told \u201cDateline.\u201d \u201cWhen she steps down, she\u2019s literally within feet. And I wanted them to be able to see that.\u201d",
      "Ashley\u2019s lawyer, Neil Taylor, said it was \u201ccallous\u201d for prosecutors to make his client re-enact the shooting. She had consistent breakdowns throughout the proceedings, shedding authentic tears, Taylor said.",
      "\u201cWhether or not the jury believed them to be real tears, I can only tell you they acquitted her of murder,\u201d he told \u201cDateline.\u201d",
      "While the jury found Ashley not guilty of the most serious charge prosecutors had sought, it convicted her of manslaughter. She faces a maximum of 30 years in prison when she is sentenced on Dec. 3.",
      "After the verdict, Taylor requested a new trial alleging juror misconduct. The judge has not yet weighed in on the claim.",
      "A nasty custody battle",
      "At trial, prosecutors alleged that Ashley fatally shot Doug during a contentious custody battle that included some abuse allegations that O\u2019Donnell called \u201cfictitious.\u201d The prosecutor said physical evidence from the shooting didn\u2019t match Ashley\u2019s claim that she fired in self-defense.",
      "Taylor countered that his client did only what any law-abiding citizen can be expected to do with an abusive partner: She reported the alleged abuse in an effort to focus authorities\u2019 attention on his behavior.",
      "In testimony, Ashley said her estranged husband was controlling and volatile. While they were living in South Carolina, she said, he threw a loaded gun at her and, during an argument, fired it into the ceiling before he threatened to take his own life. Another time, she testified, he punched their dog so hard he knocked it unconscious.",
      "In South Carolina, where the Benefields had lived together, they obtained court orders in 2017 that barred them from contacting each other. After Ashley moved to Florida while she was pregnant with their daughter, she believed he violated the order, she testified.",
      "He appeared to be stalking her, she testified at trial, and sent a package that she believed contained poison. In 2018, she sought another court order that would have barred him from contacting her and given her custody of their daughter.",
      "During a hearing in those proceedings, Doug admitted hooting the ceiling \u2014 he called it a \u201chorrible decision\u201d \u2014 but denied that he threatened to die by suicide or threw a gun at her, a transcript of the hearing shows. He acknowledged hitting their dog but said he didn\u2019t strike it like \u201ca punching bag.\u201d",
      "Doug denied violating the restraining order or stalking her, according to the transcript, and the judge in the case said there was not a \u201cscintilla of credible evidence\u201d that Ashley had been poisoned.",
      "The judge accused Ashley of \u201cturning on\u201d tears when she felt it was appropriate and awarded Doug immediate access to their child, according to the transcript.",
      "Drama in the courtroom",
      "The moment when O\u2019Donnell asked for the lights to be turned up during Ashley\u2019s criminal trial came on the fourth day, near the end of her time on the witness stand.",
      "O\u2019Donnell had been questioning Ashley about her swift courtship with Doug \u2014 they married 13 days after they met, and she gave birth less than two years later \u2014 and her allegations of abuse.",
      "After roughly an hour, the prosecutor began walking Ashley through the day she fatally shot her estranged husband.",
      "At the time, Ashley testified, she was preparing to move with her mother to an inherited home in Maryland. Doug planned on moving there, too, and living separately in an effort to reconcile with his estranged wife, O\u2019Donnell said.",
      "Taylor said Ashley never planned on reconciling \u2014 \u201cDoug Benefield knew full well this relationship was over,\u201d he said in court \u2014 and he described the move as another unwanted pursuit of his client.",
      "On Sept. 27, 2020, Doug had gone to Ashley\u2019s home to help her pack. After an argument, Ashley testified, Doug struck her in the face and refused to leave when she asked him to.",
      "Ashley testified that she ran to her bedroom, grabbed a gun and closed the door. Doug slammed it open, she said, and \u2014 using an expletive \u2014 told her she was \u201cdone.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat made you fear for your life?\u201d O\u2019Donnell asked.",
      "\u201cYeah,\u201d Ashley testified, appearing to cry.",
      "O\u2019Donnell asked for the lights to be turned up. Moments later, she instructed Ashley to step down from the witness stand and re-enact the confrontation.",
      "Speaking from the well of the courtroom, Ashley testified that she raised her weapon and told Doug to stop. He got into a \u201cfighting pose,\u201d she said, then began inching toward her.",
      "O\u2019Donnell pressed her to show what he was doing with his hands as he advanced.",
      "After she struggled with the demonstration, Ashley said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not a fighter.\u201d",
      "When Doug lunged at her, Ashley testified, she pulled the trigger. He kept moving toward her, she said, and she kept shooting.",
      "O\u2019Donnell asked for more details. But after a roughly two-minute re-enactment, she told Ashley \u2014 who appeared to be sobbing \u2014 to have a seat.",
      "Moments later, the judge called a recess.",
      "To prosecutors, the exchange was a combination of theatrics and few details. To Rebecca Freel, another assistant district attorney prosecuting the case, Ashley\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t appear puffy and her face looked the same as before she left the stand.",
      "\u201cWe thought that was telling,\u201d Freel told \u201cDateline.\u201d",
      "But Barbara Russell, a psychologist and therapist who treated Ashley and spoke to NBC News with her permission, said emotional expression can vary widely from person to person, and she criticized prosecutors for portraying themselves as experts on the matter.",
      "Russell said she had never known Ashley to be deceptive, nor did she believe she would have shot her estranged husband unless her life was in imminent danger.",
      "\u201cThe fact that she doesn\u2019t cry enough tears to please the prosecutor changes none of that,\u201d Russell said. \u201cThey prosecuted a victim.\u201d"

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 19:25:58 GMT",
    "summary": "The Pentagon has released its annual report on UFO sightings, or what it officially calls unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) \u2014 and found 21 particularly curious incidents.",
    "story": [
      "The Pentagon has released its annual report on UFO sightings, or what it officially calls unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) \u2014 and found 21 particularly curious incidents.",
      "In total, 757 new reports of UAPs were received between May 2023 and June 2024 and investigated by the Defense Department's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), according to the report by the Defense Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.",
      "Of those, 485 UAP reports occurred within that reporting period, and another 272 occurred between 2021 and 2022 but hadn't been included in previous annual UAP reports. Overall, the AARO has received 1,652 UAP reports total as of Oct. 24, 2024.",
      "Forty-nine cases during the reporting period were resolved during the reporting period as objects such as balloons, birds and\u00a0unmanned aerial systems. Another 243 were recommended for closure as of June, also resolved to be prosaic objects. An additional 444 cases lacked sufficient data for analysis and were placed in the active archive, where they can be re-examined if additional data becomes available.",
      "However, there were 21 cases that the report said \u201cmerit further analysis\u201d due to \u201canomalous characteristics and/or behaviors.\u201d",
      "Still, the report said there's no evidence, so far, to substantiate life from another planet being involved in these sightings.",
      "\u201cIt is important to underscore that, to date, AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity or technology,\u201d the report said. Further, none of the resolved cases substantiated \u201cadvanced foreign adversarial capabilities or breakthrough aerospace technologies.\u201d",
      "Jon Kosloski, the director of the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, said in a media briefing Thursday: \u201cThere are interesting cases that I, with my physics and engineering background and time in the IC [intelligence community], I do not understand. And I don\u2019t know anybody else who understands them either.\u201d",
      "He said those curious cases were spread out over the last year and a half, and there is some video footage for a few of them, but not all.",
      "\u201cBut in each of the cases I\u2019m particularly interested in, there were multiple eyewitnesses. And there is additional data to go with them,\u201d Kosloski added. \u201cIt remains to be seen whether or not that additional data is going to be sufficient for us to either resolve the case, understand whether it\u2019s a UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle], bird or balloon, or say something substantive about the nature of the unknown phenomenon.\u201d",
      "The report was published a day after the second major hearing on UAPs was held in Congress, where leaders called for greater transparency from the Pentagon on UAP knowledge, as well as on whether tax dollars are being spent on UAP retrieval, research or other programs.",
      "Four witnesses testified at the House Oversight Committee joint subcommittee hearing titled, \u201cUnidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth.\u201d",
      "Luis Elizondo, a former Defense Department official and author, testified that the government has conducted secret UAP crash retrieval programs with the purpose of identifying and reverse engineering alien craft.",
      "\u201cLet me be clear, UAP are real. Advanced technologies not made by our government or any other government are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe,\u201d Elizondo said. \u201cFurthermore, the U.S. is in possession of UAP technologies, as are some of our adversaries. I believe we are in the midst of a multi-decade secretive arms race, one funded by misallocated taxpayer dollars and hidden from our elected representatives and oversight bodies.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlthough much of my government work on the UAP subject still remains classified, excessive secrecy has led to grave misdeeds against loyal civil servants, military personnel and the public, all to hide the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos,\u201d he added.",
      "Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., asked all four witnesses: \u201cDo you believe, just for the record, that the federal government, any part of the federal government, is knowingly concealing evidence about UAPs from the public?\u201d All four answered in the affirmative.",
      "When Garcia asked the witnesses what they believe UAPs could be, Tim Gallaudet,\u00a0a retired rear admiral of the U.S. Navy and chief executive officer of Ocean STL Consulting LLC, said: \u201cStrong evidence that they are nonhuman, higher intelligence.\u201d",
      "The report and the hearing add to what has been an influx of interest in attention on UAPs in recent years that has coincided with increased government transparency around the topic thanks in part to active-duty military members coming forward to discuss their experiences.",
      "That in turn has sparked government hearings in which various former officials have made a wide variety of allegations about the origin of UAPs and about a purported government effort to keep information about them from the public.",
      "Despite that testimony, no hard evidence has emerged concerning UAPs, extraterrestrials or a government cover-up.",
      "The Pentagon report noted a consistent pattern in reports describing the UAPs: unidentified lights and round/spherical/orb-shaped objects made up the bulk of cases in reports that had distinct visual characteristics.\u00a0Of the UAP reports, 81 originated from U.S. military operating areas. Three reports from U.S. military aircrews described \"pilots being trailed or shadowed by UAP.\"",
      "Of the new reports, 392 were from the Federal Aviation Administration and make up all of the FAA\u2019s UAP reports since 2021.",
      "The AARO noted that it was able to resolve one report made by a commercial pilot who reported seeing white flashing lights in the night sky that ended up being a Starlink satellite launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, that same night.",
      "If the AARO does find cases that indicate breakthrough foreign adversarial aerospace capability, it\u2019ll immediately report it to Congress.",
      "\u201cAARO is investigating if other unresolved cases may be attributed to the expansion of the Starlink and other mega-constellations in low earth orbit,\u201d the report said."

    "story": [
      "The Dallas-area influencer who had her spider monkey taken from her Saturday after a drunk driving crash is under investigation after the monkey was determined to be malnourished, officials said Friday.",
      "Brandi Botello's spider monkey, named Jorgie Boy, was taken from her following the crash in which Dallas police arrested the driver on a charge of driving while intoxicated.",
      "Irving, the Dallas suburb where Botello lives, prohibits ownership of wild animals so the monkey was transferred to its animal control department, authorities have said. It was eventually moved to an animal sanctuary.",
      "Irving police spokesperson Delaney Brey said the city's animal services department is leading the investigation into Botello.",
      "Brey said the department is investigating \"the care of the animal and the state that it was in when it was handed over.\" Police have said the monkey was diagnosed with rickets, described as \"a bone disease caused by inadequate nutrition.\"",
      "No charges related to the animal have been filed against Botello. Charges will not be determined until the investigation concludes \"because there is a difference between neglect and cruelty,\" Brey said.",
      "It's unclear how long the investigation will take, Brey said.",
      "According to Texas law, if someone is convicted of animal cruelty, they are not able to own any animals for five years, Brey said, but noted there are different levels of the charge from misdemeanor to felony.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it was illegal for her to have [the monkey] in Irving, period,\" Brey said. She said typically, in these cases, owners don't fight to get their animals back because it would require them to move to a different city.",
      "Botello did not respond Friday to multiple requests for comment. The Irving Animal Services Department also did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the investigation.",
      "Dallas police did not identify the driver in the single-vehicle crash, but Botello told NBC Dallas-Fort Worth she was the one who was arrested with a DWI. She said that a male acquaintance was the one driving, and that she only climbed into the driver's seat after the crash.",
      "She told the station she was drunk and asleep in the passenger seat while holding Jorgie Boy when the crash happened.",
      "Jorgie Boy legally at sanctuary",
      "Dwan Johns, the owner of Funky Monkey Ranch, a sanctuary near Fort Worth, confirmed to NBC News on Friday it now legally in possession of Jorgie Boy.",
      "\"I immediately added him to my USDA license here at our ranch. So he is legally here, where he will stay,\" Johns said.",
      "She added: \"Thankfully we were available to take him in.\"",
      "Johns said the monkey weighed 6 pounds, which is less than half of an average spider monkey's weight, and that he had a metabolic bone disease caused by poor nutrition as well as elevated liver and pancreatic levels.",
      "Botello, who has 43,000 Instagram followers, has launched something of a campaign to reunite with Jorgie Boy, reposting a number of Instagram stories from followers Thursday who posted with the hashtag \"#FreeJorgieBoy.\"",
      "Monkey could have been euthanized",
      "In a video shared to the Funky Monkey Ranch TikTok, Johns acknowledged the sympathy Botello has garnered and said she wanted to share the \"reality\" of the situation.",
      "She said she got a call from Irving Animal Control on Saturday saying they had confiscated a monkey but \"didn't know what to do with it.\"",
      "Because Irving has a zero-tolerance policy for wild animals within the city, Jorgie Boy was going to be euthanized if Funky Monkey Ranch or another sanctuary did not have room for him, Johns said.",
      "She said in the video that these cities are not trained in how to safely take care of wild animals like Jorgie Boy, and if, for example, the monkey had bitten someone, they would have had to test for rabies, which would have required Jorgie Boy to be euthanized.",
      "Johns said that \"within five seconds\" of seeing Jorgie Boy, she determined \"that animal has some severe special needs.\"",
      "She said his head and feet are not proportionate to his body and his growth has been stunted \"due to animal neglect.\" Jorgie Boy is the size of a 1-year-old monkey even though he will turn 3 in February. He also had tiny fractures in his bones, which were not from the car accident, Johns said.",
      "A primate vet checked Jorgie Boy out Monday, Johns said.",
      "\"Unfortunately, he was forced to live a lifestyle that was detrimental to his health,\" Johns said. \"He grew up spending his nights in night clubs, partying around drugs and alcohol, not eating a healthy diet that a spider monkey would eat, not being exposed to correct enrichment and playtime.\"",
      "Long road to recovery",
      "The sanctuary is doing sun therapy with Jorgie Boy twice a day for the next six weeks, at which point he will go back to the vet for more X-rays to see how his bones are healing. Johns said they hope to then start physical therapy.",
      "It might take over a year to get Jorgie Boy to a point where he is strong enough to play with other monkeys again, Johns said.",
      "Johns said she shared the story to let people know that when they were asked to take Jorgie Boy in, \"it wasn't to try to take someone else's monkey, it was to prevent a monkey from being euthanized.\"",
      "\"We are going to whatever it takes to save him and to get him healthy again and to let him live a happy life,\" Johns said.",
      "\"I just want to make it clear that if you're taking any kind of exotic animal into your care, it is your duty and your responsibility to do the proper research, to acquire the proper veterinarian that specializes in that exotic animal and to provide them with everything that they need,\" Johns said. \"And when you do not do those things, then you are the cause of the animal neglect and cruelty.\""

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 17:39:46 GMT",
    "summary": "The Texas Supreme Court has ruled against lawmakers who used their subpoena power to halt the execution of a death row inmate for his daughter\u2019s \u201cshaken baby\u201d death, paving the way for it to proceed.",
    "story": [
      "The Texas Supreme Court has ruled against lawmakers who used their subpoena power to halt the execution of a death row inmate for his daughter\u2019s \u201cshaken baby\u201d death, paving the way for it to proceed.",
      "Robert Roberson, 58, was set to be questioned by the House Criminal Jurisprudence Committee, which issued a legislative subpoena last month for him to testify about his case \u2014 setting off a flurry of litigation that temporarily stopped his Oct. 17 execution with only hours to spare.",
      "\"Categorically prioritizing a legislative subpoena over a scheduled execution, in other words, would become a potent legal tool that could be wielded not just to obtain necessary testimony but to forestall an execution,\" the Texas Supreme Court said in its ruling Friday.",
      "But the high court justices went on to say that the committee can still seek to interview Roberson \"so long as a subpoena issues in a way that does not inevitably block a scheduled execution,\" adding that \"nothing in our holding prevents the committee from pursuing judicial relief in the ordinary way to compel a witness testimony.\"",
      "The House committee's use of a subpoena to compel Roberson to testify in person was an unprecedented legal gambit. Some lawmakers noted it would help buy more time for Roberson, whose cause has bipartisan support.",
      "Committee Chairman Joe Moody, a Democrat, and committee member Jeff Leach, a Republican, responded that they did not expect their subpoena to necessarily stop Roberson's execution for good, but said the state Supreme Court's ruling does not prevent them from still attempting to gather his testimony.",
      "\"The Supreme Court strongly reinforced our belief that our Committee can indeed obtain Mr. Roberson's testimony and made clear that it expects the Executive Branch of government to accommodate us in doing so,\" Moody and Leach said in a statement.",
      "The lawmakers had issued their subpoena for Roberson to testify in his case as it relates to a 2013 \"junk science\" law that allows Texas inmates to potentially challenge convictions based on advances in forensic science.",
      "But the Office of the Attorney General quickly appealed the subpoena, which was supported by a district court judge's temporary injunction that halted Roberson's execution. After the state's highest criminal court agreed with the attorney general's office, allowing Roberson's execution to continue, lawmakers then petitioned their case to the Texas Supreme Court.",
      "The high court, which is currently made up of nine Republican elected justices, ultimately\u00a0agreed to a halting of the execution, although it did not specify for how long as a separation-of-powers issue continued to be litigated through the courts.",
      "The lawmakers and Attorney General Ken Paxton also sparred in public over the issue, with each accusing the other of \"misrepresenting\" Roberson's case and releasing their own reports and rebuttals of claims.",
      "Roberson, who is\u00a0set to become the\u00a0first person in the U.S. executed in a \"shaken baby\" case, has maintained his innocence in his 2-year-old daughter Nikki's 2002 death.",
      "At the time, doctors and law enforcement quickly concluded she was killed as a result of a violent shaking episode, leading to his conviction at trial, but Roberson's defense says new understanding of so-called\u00a0shaken baby syndrome\u00a0shows that other medical conditions can be factors in a child's death, as they believe it was in Nikki's.",
      "But the attorney general's office said last month that state lawmakers have \"attempted to mislead the public by falsely claiming that Roberson was unfairly convicted through 'junk science' concerning 'shaken baby syndrome.'\"",
      "Roberson's defense team initially sought to have him transported from his prison north of Houston to Texas' capital of Austin to be interviewed by the House committee, but lawmakers instead wanted to gather his testimony from where he is incarcerated.",
      "The attorney general's office did not immediately comment about the state Supreme Court's ruling, and it's unclear whether it will allow for Roberson to testify or when it may seek a new death warrant.",
      "Gretchen Sween, Roberson's lawyer, said she is hopeful the state will work with the lawmakers to still allow for Roberson to testify.",
      "\"The ancillary benefit to Mr. Roberson of staying his execution hopefully gives time for those with power to address a grave wrong to see what is apparent to anyone who gives the medical evidence fair consideration: his daughter Nikki's death was a tragedy not a crime; Robert is innocent,\" Sween said in a statement. \"Given the overwhelming new evidence of innocence, we ask the State of Texas to refrain from setting a new execution date.\""

    "summary": "Jordan Neeley\u2019s death was a direct result of the chokehold Daniel Penny held him in, a medical examiner testified Friday, rebutting assertions from the defense team that the former Marine did not apply enough pressure to kill the subway rider and that his death could have had some other cause.",
    "story": [
      "Jordan Neeley\u2019s death was a direct result of the chokehold Daniel Penny held him in, a medical examiner testified Friday, rebutting assertions from the defense team that the former Marine did not apply enough pressure to kill the subway rider and that his death could have had some other cause.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my medical opinion that there are no alternative reasonable explanations for Mr. Neely\u2019s death,\u201d the medical examiner, Dr. Cynthia Harris, told jurors.",
      "Harris classified Neely\u2019s manner of death as a chokehold days after his killing. More than a month later, a grand jury indicted Penny on a manslaughter charge. The medical examiner testified that Neely died of compression of the neck, or asphyxia.",
      "Attorneys for Penny, who is also charged with criminally negligent homicide, have refuted the medical examiner\u2019s findings. In his opening statement, one of the attorneys, Thomas Kenniff, said Penny had restrained Neely with a \u201cvariation of a nonlethal chokehold\u201d borrowed from martial arts training he had been taught in the Marine Corp.",
      "The trial is in its fourth week and is expected to last through Thanksgiving.",
      "Penny, 26, who was studying architecture before his arrest, had just left class and was on his way to the gym when he encountered Neely on an uptown F train on the afternoon of May 1, 2023, his attorneys have said.",
      "When Neely, who had a history of mental illness and homelessness, boarded the train, he shouted at passengers, threw his jacket to the ground, talked about being hungry and thirsty and made statements about hurting people and wanting to go back to jail for life, witnesses have testified. He had synthetic cannabinoids in his system when he died.",
      "Penny told two detectives in an interview at a precinct hours after Neely\u2019s killing that he had acted to protect other passengers, that he did not put pressure on Neely\u2019s neck and that he did not intend to kill him, according to a video of the interview that was shown in court Thursday. One of those detectives testified under cross examination that neither he nor the other detective had told Penny that Neely was dead when they interviewed him.",
      "Prosecutors have sought to convince jurors that while Penny\u2019s initial intent may have been \u201claudable,\u201d his actions became \u201cunnecessarily reckless\u201d when he refused to let go of Neely, even after he had gone limp, the train had arrived at the next station and passengers were able to exit the subway car.",
      "The prosecutors, the defense team and witnesses have said that some passengers feared Neely. But prosecutors have also said that no witnesses testified to seeing him display a weapon, threaten the use of a weapon or touch anyone before Penny wrapped his arms around him from behind and took him to the floor. A muffin was found in Neely\u2019s jacket after he was killed.",
      "The case has raised questions about\u00a0safety within the city\u2019s subway system, as well as about whether race played a role in Penny\u2019s actions\u00a0\u2014 Neely was Black and Penny is white.",
      "Neely made his last voluntary movement before Penny let go of his neck, Harris testified, citing a video recording of those moments played in court. She explained frame by frame the precise moment Neely stopped breathing and went limp.",
      "Harris directed jurors to moments in the video when she said Neely was struggling to breathe, making a hand gesture as a signal for help and when she observed his face had turned \u201cuniversally purple\u201d and he began twitching.",
      "\u201cI read that at this point, he has lost consciousness and that what we will see in the form of his twitching represents brain injury,\u201d she said.",
      "Assistant District Attorney Dafna Yoran questioned Harris about witnesses testifying that they did not hear Neely gag, gasp or say that he could not breathe. Harris said that did not surprise her.",
      "Harris said that it was also unsurprising that some witnesses, including responding officers, testified that Neely had a pulse minutes after Penny released him from the chokehold.",
      "\u201cThat makes perfect sense because this is an asphyxial death,\u201d she said. \u201cIn asphyxial deaths the brain dies first.\u201d",
      "A pulse can be maintained for up to 10 minutes in those cases, she said.",
      "\u201cIt indicates he had a normally functioning heart in a dying body,\u201d Harris testified.",
      "During his cross examination, defense attorney Steven Raiser sought to cast doubt on Harris\u2019 findings by suggesting that she had been influenced by the video of Penny choking Neely.",
      "\ufeffHe also questioned her about why she issued her ruling as to the cause of death before toxicology reports had been completed.",
      "\u201cNo toxicologic result imaginable was going to change my opinion,\u201d Harris said.",
      "Bystander video recorded by a freelance journalist that was widely shared online showed Penny holding Neely in a chokehold as he tried unsuccessfully to break free. Prosecutors have said Penny held Neely for almost six minutes. Two other men also helped to restrain Neely for some of that time. One of those men testified Tuesday that he had tried to convince Penny to loosen his grip on Neely.",
      "On Thursday, a former Marine who trained Penny in various types of holds when they served together said he may have applied a chokehold improperly. The trainer, Joseph Caballer, told jurors that video appeared to show Penny trying to use a blood choke, which, if deployed properly, could cut off oxygen to a person\u2019s brain in eight seconds.",
      "Caballer said that as Penny and Neely struggled on the floor of the subway car, it is possible the hold could have turned into an air choke, which takes longer to render a person unconscious. He said the air choke is not taught by the Marine Corps.",
      "\u201cOnce the individual is rendered unconscious, that\u2019s when you are supposed to let go,\u201d Caballer said.",
      "More than two dozen other witnesses have testified, including police officers, passengers and members of the transit authority.",
      "On Tuesday, Eric Gonzalez, a subway rider who helped Penny restrain Neely, testified that when he had came upon the two men, Penny had his legs around Penny\u2019s waist and his arm around his neck. He said he \u201cjumped in and tried to help\u201d without knowing why Penny was restraining Neely. Gonzalez said that after he held Neely\u2019s wrist, he told Penny: \u201cYou can let him go. I am holding on to him,\u201d but Penny continued to choke Neely while Gonzalez held on to his  arms and wrist. Gonzalez testified that he and Penny let go of Neely after he went limp."

    "title": "People's incomes are catching up with their debt",
    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 22:04:14 GMT",
    "summary": "Credit card debt levels keep smashing records, but average balances are lower relative to borrowers' earnings than pre-pandemic and delinquencies are slowing.",
    "story": [
      "Credit card balances are up, but so are many borrowers\u2019 paychecks.",
      "U.S. consumers collectively owe an eye-popping $1.17 trillion in credit card debt \u2014 a record \u2014 according to estimates the Federal Reserve Bank of New York released this week. But while there are still major financial risks for carrying hefty balances, the researchers said the data suggests that \u201crising debt burdens remain manageable\u201d for the typical consumer.",
      "It\u2019s a finding that might surprise voters fresh off an election in which a majority handed the federal government back to Republicans out of economic ire. But while major, chronic household costs continue to squeeze millions of families \u2014 especially those scraping by on lower incomes \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump is inheriting a robust overall economy fueled by consumers who keep on spending.",
      "Prices are still going up, but they\u2019re not going up as fast, and incomes are once again going up at a faster rate than expenses.",
      "Bankrate chief financial analyst Greg McBride",
      "What\u2019s more, many are doing so without much serious financial fallout. A separate report this week from the credit rating agency TransUnion found that the growth in credit card delinquencies is slowing down, falling from 2.43% in the third quarter of last year to 2.34% in the same period this year.",
      "A key reason for the improvements is pay.",
      "Earnings growth has averaged 6.2% per year since the pandemic began, compared to the cumulative debt balance rising 4% per year. As a result, the debt-to-income ratio among U.S. consumers has steadily declined during the post-Covid recovery \u2014\u00a0from 86% in 2019 to 82% today, the report said.",
      "That\u2019s despite credit card balances surging to nosebleed heights, rising by $24 billion just in the third quarter, 8.1% higher than a year ago.",
      "\u201cThe aggregate debt balance has continued to climb since the pandemic,\u201d the New York Fed researchers said in an analysis of their findings. \u201cHowever, during this same time, Americans\u2019 disposable personal income has grown as well.\u201d",
      "And disposing of it they are. Retail sales rose by 0.4% in October, the Commerce Department reported Friday. That\u2019s less than September\u2019s upwardly revised 0.8% jump but still makes for a solid stretch of spending heading into the busy holiday shopping season.",
      "Hourly earnings rose 0.4% last month, ahead of estimates, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the inflation rate has not exceeded the pace of wage growth since January 2023. That dynamic has left the median-income household financially better off than before the pandemic. The lowest average salary that Americans will accept from employers reached a new high of $81,822, the New York Fed reported this spring, keeping pressure on many employers to pony up even as the job market slows.",
      "\u201cWhen inflation was rising at a faster rate, and expenses were increasing more quickly than household incomes, oftentimes it was debt that bridged that gap,\u201d said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. \u201cNow that inflation pressures have moderated, prices are still going up, but they\u2019re not going up as fast, and incomes are once again going up at a faster rate than expenses.\u201d",
      "Even so, the New York Fed report highlights just how accustomed many Americans have become to living in the red. The data also raises questions about the effects of persistent debt on households of different means in an economy defined by vast wealth inequality, which still breaks heavily along demographic lines.",
      "\u201cThese aggregate measures don\u2019t necessarily represent what is happening at the household level in terms of borrower income, race, and age,\u201d the researchers noted, adding that delinquency rates remain elevated despite their slowdown, a fact that is still causing stress for many borrowers. \u201cDebts \u2014 and incomes \u2014 are not distributed evenly over the population,\u201d they said.",
      "For example, after the financial crises of recent decades, lenders increasingly tightened\u00a0standards for mortgages toward older, higher-income borrowers with better credit scores, the report noted. So some of the improvements in how well households are handling their debt loads also reflects who\u2019s getting access to credit in the first place.",
      "TransUnion flagged a similar trend in its own findings, saying credit card issuers \u201cin many cases have tightened underwriting standards which may have resulted in lending to borrowers less likely to grow balances quickly.\u201d",
      "\u201cLower-income borrowers bearing credit card and auto debt look very different than higher-income households with larger mortgages,\u201d the New York Fed researchers added.",
      "McBride said auto loans can be especially tricky to manage for consumers with tight budgets. Many borrowers are still financing larger-than-normal vehicle purchases due to post-pandemic sticker prices, he said, which could become unwieldy even with a decent car note.",
      "\u201cWhat that means is the balance declines more slowly,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially for higher-risk borrowers, credit card and auto loan delinquencies are the highest in a dozen years, and that\u2019s with unemployment at 4%. Those numbers would go up in a big way if the economy hits the skids.\u201d"

      "The man accused of killing Laken Riley earlier this year \"went out hunting for females\" on the day the nursing student in Georgia was slain, prosecutors told a judge Friday on the first day of Jose Antonio Ibarra's trial.",
      "\"When Laken Riley refused to be his rape victim, he bashed her skull in with a rock repeatedly,\" prosecutor Sheila Ross said in her opening statement.",
      "A medical examiner found that Riley died from blunt force trauma and asphyxiation and had a complex skull fracture and eight other lacerations on the left side of her head, she said.",
      "Riley\u2019s killing became a flashpoint in the immigration debate. Ibarra, 26, is a Venezuelan citizen who entered the United States illegally in 2022, officials have said. Republicans, including Donald Trump who met with Riley\u2019s parents before a campaign rally in March, have used the case to call for stricter border policies.",
      "Ross said the prosecution's forensic, digital and video evidence \u201cwill point to one person, Jose Ibarra, as the killer of Laken Riley.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe evidence will show that Laken fought \u2014 she fought for her life. She fought for her dignity and in that fight she caused this defendant to leave forensic evidence behind,\u201d Ross said.",
      "Ibarra is facing multiple charges, including three counts of felony murder and counts of malice murder, kidnapping with bodily injury, aggravated assault with intent to rape and \u201cpeeping Tom.\u201d He is accused of accosting Riley while she was out for a run on the morning of Feb. 22. She was found dead later that day in a forested area on the University of Georgia campus in Athens after her roommates called police when she did not return home. Riley's three roommates testified Friday.",
      "Ibarra has waived his right to a jury trial. Athens-Clarke County Superior Court Judge H. Patrick Haggard will consider the evidence and decide whether Ibarra is guilty.",
      "The prosecution is seeking life in prison without parole.",
      "Ross told the judge Friday that prosecutors would show that Ibarra's DNA was found underneath Riley's fingernails and that his thumbprint was found on her iPhone.",
      "She said that police also found a jacket in a dumpster near where Ibarra lived and it was determined that both Ibarra's and Riley\u2019s blood were on it. Riley\u2019s blood was also found on black gloves found discarded near Ibarra\u2019s home.",
      "Ibarra\u2019s defense attorneys called the evidence against him circumstantial.",
      "\u201cThe evidence that Jose Ibarra killed anyone is circumstantial,\u201d defense attorney Dustin Kirby said, adding the evidence \u201cthat links Mr. Ibarra to that event, is lacking\u201d upon closer inspection.",
      "Kirby said there is not enough evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Ibarra is guilty of the crimes he was charged with.",
      "The first witness called to testify Friday was Lilly Steiner, one of Riley\u2019s roommates at the time. She said she, Riley and their other two roommates were \u201clike a little family, and we called each other our family. We did everything together.\u201d",
      "\u201cLaken brought a sense of joy to all of our lives that has been missing ever since,\u201d she said.",
      "Steiner, 22, testified that the four roommates used an app on their phones to share their locations with one another and said that she became worried that morning when Riley\u2019s location had not moved from the same spot on the running trail she frequented.",
      "She said that after texting Riley and not getting a response, she wrote in a group message with another roommate that Riley has \u201cbeen in the woods a while.\u201d",
      "She testified that she and another roommate went to the running trail to try to find Riley, but only located one of her AirPods. The concerned roommates then returned home and called police, something they could not do from the trail because of an AT&T service outage that day.",
      "The officer who found Riley\u2019s body also testified on Friday.",
      "Sgt. Kenneth Maxwell said that Riley's shirt was pulled up in a way that \u201clooked more intentional, as if somebody had attempted to either remove her top or maybe had used it to drag her.\u201d",
      "The prosecution played video of Maxwell continually attempting to perform CPR on Riley after finding her body and calling in his discovery.",
      "Previously, police said there was no indication the suspect knew the victim and that Ibarra did not have an extensive criminal background."

      "Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson stunned a teenage girl on Thursday after she lobbed him an easy feel-good question \u2014 only\u00a0to get a shockingly bleak response about death and eternal nothingness.",
      "The jaw-dropping comments came as Tyson, 58, did a round of interviews ahead of his high-profile bout with YouTube personality Jake Paul, that\u2019ll be staged in Arlington, Texas on Friday and streamed on Netflix.",
      "When 14-year-old Jazlyn Guerra, the young journalist behind Jazzys World TV, asked what kind of \"legacy\" he hopes to leave behind, the unflinching Tyson explained how fleeting and seemingly meaningless strolling this planet could be.",
      "\"I don't believe in the word 'legacy.' I think that's another word for ego. Legacy doesn't mean nothing. That's just some word everybody grabbed on to. Someone said that word and everyone grabbed on to that word, now it's used every five seconds,\" Tyson said in an interview that posted on Thursday.",
      "\"It means absolutely nothing to me. I'm just passing through. I'm gonna die and it's gonna be over. Who cares about legacy after that?\"",
      "After a brief awkward pause, Iron Mike continued with his crushingly existential musings.",
      "\"So I'm gonna die. I want people to think that I'm this, I'm great?\" he continued. \"No, we're nothing. We're just dead. We're dust. We're  absolutely nothing. Our legacy is nothing.\"",
      "The teen interviewer appeared to be briefly surprised by Tyson's tough look at life. But she kept her composure, didn't break stride and thanked the champ for his wisdom.",
      "\"Well thank you so much for sharing that,\" she said. \"That is something that I have not heard before.\"",
      "Tyson wouldn't let up and kept hammering home that all of humanity is just running out the clock.",
      "\"Can you really imagine somebody saying, 'I want my legacy to be this way?' You're dead!\"  Tyson said. \"Who the f--- cares about me when I'm gone? My kids, maybe, or grand kids?\"",
      "Tyson was one of the most feared fighters in the 1980s and '90s. But he might be best known for serving three years in prison after being convicted of rape and biting off a chunk of Evander Holyfield's ear during a match in 1997.",
      "Paul, 27, is relatively new to boxing, after making his professional debut in the ring in 2020. He has more than 27 million Instagram followers and nearly 21 million YouTube subscribers."

      "Stargazers are in for quite the double feature this weekend: The Beaver moon, the last supermoon of the year, will share the celestial stage with the dazzling Leonid meteor shower.",
      "The beaver moon will reach the crest of its full phase at 4:29 p.m. ET Friday and appear full until a few hours before sunrise, according to NASA. This is the last of this year's four supermoons, when the moon appears bigger and brighter than normal, according to The Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac.",
      "As the beaver moon is rising, spectators might glimpse a \"moon illusion,\" a period of time where the supermoon could look even bigger than normal because of an optical illusion.",
      "Scientists are unsure why this happens, but believe our brains don\u2019t know that the moon\u2019s distance doesn\u2019t change that much no matter where it is in the sky on a given night, said NASA Public Engagement Specialist Preston Dyches.",
      "The beaver moon was named after the time of year when\u00a0beavers begin hibernation. During the fur trade in North America, this was also the season to trap beavers for their thick, winter-ready\u00a0pelts, according to The Old Farmer's Almanac.",
      "A supermoon occurs when a\u00a0full moon\u00a0coincides with the moon\u2019s closest approach to Earth in its elliptical orbit, a point known as\u00a0perigee. According to NASA, \"supermoon\" isn\u2019t an official astronomical term, but typically it\u2019s used to describe a full moon that comes within at least 90 percent of perigee.",
      "Those hoping to catch a glimpse might be in for a bonus scene in the sky as the Leonid meteor shower reaches its peak Saturday night into early Sunday, according to the\u00a0American Meteor Society. While the best viewing period will be over the weekend, the Leonids will be visible until the meteor shower ends Dec. 2.",
      "Upcoming celestial events include the last full moon of 2024 on Dec. 15; the Geminid meteor shower, which will peak\u00a0Dec. 12 to 13; and the Ursid meteor shower, which will peak Dec. 21 to 22."

      "Calling all \"Ice Age\" lovers: The frozen remains of a 35,000-year-old saber-toothed cat have been studied for the first time in history, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports.",
      "The animal's mummified remains, which include its head, arms and part of its chest, were found well-preserved in Yakutia, Russia, in 2020 and determined to belong to a cub around 3 weeks old, per the study.",
      "The young cub's most notable characteristics are its small ears, long neck and front arms, dark brown fur, and large mouth opening, the study authors wrote. When compared with the remains of a modern lion cub of a similar age, it was determined that the cat mummy shared characteristics with the subfamily Machairodontinae, specifically the Homotherium genus \u2014 cats with sharp, curved saber teeth that existed around 12 million to 10,000 years ago in North America and Europe.",
      "Compared with the modern lion cub's remains, the Homotherium cat's ears are up higher on the skull, and its mouth opening is about 11% to 19% larger, according to the study. Its neck is also \"longer and more than twice as thick\" as the modern cub's.",
      "For \"Ice Age\" movie franchise fans, the description of the saber-toothed cat might sound familiar. The character Diego, a saber-toothed tiger, has very similar traits to the 35,000-year-old cub.",
      "This marks the first time remains of this kind have been studied.",
      "\u201cFor the first time in the history of paleontology, the appearance of an extinct mammal that has no analogues in the modern fauna has been studied,\u201d the study authors wrote.",

    "story": [
      "Beneath the snowy slopes lay a prehistoric surprise: an ecosystem that predates the dinosaurs, revealed by melting snow before being stumbled upon by a hiker in the Italian Alps.",
      "The discovery, made public Wednesday, includes well-preserved footprints of reptiles and amphibians that scientists say date back 280 million years to a geologic period known as the Permian period.",
      "\u201cDinosaurs had not yet emerged at this time, but the animals responsible for the largest footprints here would still have been impressive, reaching up to 2-3 meters in length,\u201d said Cristiano Dal Sasso, a paleontologist at the Natural History Museum in Milan, where the finds are now on display.",
      "The fossils were discovered in the mountains of northern Italy's Lombardy region after the snow and ice that once covered them melted away, scientists say, as a result of the ongoing climate crisis.",
      "Claudia Steffensen was hiking along a trail in the Valtellina Orobie mountain range in the summer of 2023 when she stepped on a gray stone marked with unusual patterns.\u201cMy husband was in front of me, looking straight ahead, while I was looking toward my feet. I put my foot on a rock, which struck me as odd as it seemed more like a slab of cement. I then noticed these strange circular designs with wavy lines. I took a closer look and realized they were footprints,\u201d Steffensen told the Guardian newspaper.",
      "Intrigued, she snapped photos and shared them with her friend, Elio Della Ferrera, a nature photographer. Della Ferrera then contacted Dal Sasso, at the museum in Milan, to learn more about the discovery.",
      "Dal Sasso enlisted the expertise of two specialists: Ausonio Ronchi, a professor of stratigraphy at the University of Pavia in Northern Italy, and Lorenzo Marchetti, a fossil expert from the Natural History Museum in Berlin.",
      "Marchetti told NBC News on Friday that he was \u201camazed by the quality and quantity of the material,\u201d and said that while he had studied other Permian sites in the area, none seemed as \u201crich\u201d as this one.",
      "The Permian period immediately predated the dinosaurs.",
      "Ronchi said he was also \u201csurprised by the abundance and preservation\u201d of the fossils when he first saw the images.",
      "\u201cIt is the first time we have seen such an amazing variety of vertebrate footprints, invertebrate tracks, imprints of flora, and other fossils,\u201d he said in an email.",
      "\u201cThese footprints were imprinted when the sandstones and clays were still wet,\u201d Ronchi said. \u201cThe summer sun dried those surfaces so thoroughly that when water returned, the footprints weren\u2019t washed away; rather, they were covered by new layers of clay that formed a protective coating.\u201d",
      "Continental fossils have previously been found in the Permian sediments of the Southern Alps, but none of this quality.",
      "Starting in summer 2023, Della Ferrera and the research team conducted further inspections, photographing and mapping hundreds of fossilized traces across the mountain range, which rises to nearly 10,000 feet above sea level.The first fossils were airlifted out by helicopter last month.",
      "As the fossils lie in the upper part of a mountain valley, which is covered by snow for most of the year, the discoveries are closely linked to climate change.",
      "Ronchi explained that in recent years, rising temperatures have caused the ice to nearly disappear, leaving the debris where the fossils were found exposed.",
      "\u201cLast year\u2019s ice is almost gone due to the rising temperatures, which uncovers the debris area where we found the fossils,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cBlocks of rock fall down from the steep walls of the reliefs as a consequence of cracking and erosion, so we expect to find many more tracks and fossils in the coming years,\u201d Ronchi said.",
      "The research team said that the fossils uncover trends strikingly similar to those we are witnessing today: an intensifying greenhouse effect, melting polar ice and changing ecosystems.",
      "These environmental shifts contributed to the extinction of many species, which we may now encounter as fossils on a fortunate hike.",
      "\u201cThe past has much to teach us about what we risk doing to the world today,\u201d the researchers warned."

      "Warning: This story contains spoilers for \u201cThe Golden Bachelorette.\u201d",
      "It was a love story for the (golden) ages! In the emotional finale of \"The Golden Bachelorette,\" Joan Vassos chose her winner on the island of Bora Bora.",
      "Her decision came down to Chock Chapple, a 60-year-old insurance executive from Wichita, Kansas, and Guy Gansert, a 66-year-old ER doctor from Reno, Nevada. Ultimately, she chose Chock \u2014 the man who said, over and over, he was \"crazy about her.\"",
      "Joan, who lost her husband John to pancreatic cancer in 2021, was previously a contestant on \u201cThe Golden Bachelor.\u201d She departed the season voluntarily to care for her daughter, who had recently given birth.",
      "\"I feel happy about my future now that it looks a lot brighter. Chock is the reason for all of this,\" Joan said in a confessional interview.",
      "What happened in the 'Golden Bachelorette' finale?",
      "Chock emerged as a frontrunner early on, but his connection with Joan was cemented after meeting her adult children.",
      "The meeting was emotional \u2014 Joan's son Nick seemed to initially balk when Chock kissed Joan on the lips as a way of a greeting.",
      "But her kids came around. Chock promised that he was not here to \"replace\" their late father in any \"way shape or form.\"",
      "Joan and her kids also marked the difficulty of her moving on romantically. \u201cIf I loved Dad so much, would I be able to fall in love again?\u201d Joan questioned. Nick cheered her on, saying he and his sister were \"proud\" to see her \"take risks,\" and proud of the \"incredible strength\" she demonstrates.",
      "Chock, on his end, said he had a \"great time,\" calling her family \"good people.\"",
      "After the date, Chock declared his love for Joan. While Joan didn't respond, it was enough for her to decide that Chock would be her future husband. She realized was worthy of love \u2014 which came into question following her breakup with contestant Pascal Ibgui.",
      "The episode before the finale, Pascal, a salon owner from Chicago, broke up with Joan in an emotional boat cruise in Tahiti, telling her that he didn\u2019t feel a strong connection.",
      "\"It just makes me feel like I'm unlovable,\" Joan said at the time of the breakup. \"If he couldn't love me, how could anybody love me?\"",
      "And so, before Guy had the opportunity to meet Joan's family, Joan broke up with him. During the \"After the Final Rose\" special, she clarified that she was \"getting there\" with Guy, but they needed more time.",
      "\"It was really, really hard at the end to say goodbye to you because in any other situation, I would have been with you because we would have had more time,\" she said. \"It was absolutely nothing you did. I have missed you. It's been really hard to be away from you.\"",
      "Joan said she hopes she and Guy stay friends and can double date.",
      "Chock proposed on the beach",
      "Heading into the final scenes, Joan and Chock said they felt ready and excited to get engaged.",
      "Joan declared that she wants to \"spend the rest of her life\" with Chock. She had lost hope in her future \u2014 and he helped her bring it back. Chock, meanwhile, said he couldn't believe he found this \"incredible opportunity\" at this point in his life.",
      "In his proposal, Chock said he was \"so absolutely happy\" to be in her life, and have her in his. He acknowledged their late partners and said he would \"honor\" John by \"loving her every day.\"",
      "Joan, similarly, acknowledged the difficulty of having Chock step away from filming because his mother passed away. This, she said, was the moment she knew she couldn't complete the show's journey without him.",
      "\"We are living proof that no matter what life throws at you, there is still hope, even at our age,\" Joan said, proceeding to tell Chock she loved him for the first time.",
      "And with that, Chock got down on one knee and proposed with a Neil Lane ring (naturally). She gave him the final golden rose.",
      "After the proposal, the happy couple FaceTimed with Joan's mom from the beach, who expressed her shock and delight at meeting her daughter's new partner.",
      "\"I never in a million years thought I'd feel love like this again. Ever,\" Joan said.",
      "So, are Joan Vassos and Chock still together?",
      "Host Jesse Palmer revealed Joan and Chock as the franchise\u2019s \u201cnewest \u2018Golden Bachelorette\u2019 couple,\u201d indicating they are still together.",
      "The couple confirmed it in an interview.",
      "\"This feels so good. I'm looking at our family and friends who we've never gotten to be with together, so it's so nice to finally be able to share our love and our story and our future with them,\" Joan said to her loved ones, who were sitting in the audience.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier and I want the world to know it,\u201d Chock said. He then spoke up for his fianc\u00e9e for her behavior on the show. \u201cI want to tell the world, the fans, how classy Joan is and the respect she gave all the other guys,\u201d he added.",
      "Since the engagement, Joan and Chock were able to spend quality time together out of the public eye.",
      "\"We cooked, we played crosswords, I mean we did everything,\" Chock said.",
      "Jesse, in a surprise at the end of the finale, said the show was sending both of their families on a trip to Disney world, earning lots of claps from Joan's grandson."

      "Fans of the show know that Mr. Miyagi has become an almost omnipresent figure, guiding Daniel even in death as Daniel tries to take up the mantle of sensei for the next generation of Los Angeles karate prodigies. He names his dojo Miyago-Do and tries to pass on the teachings of his late mentor, often running up against rival Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka).",
      "But Season 6 complicates what Daniel knew about Mr. Miyagi's past. For a quick refresher, in the original \"Karate Kid\" film, Mr. Miyagi tells a young Daniel that he served in World War II and his wife died in childbirth at a U.S. internment camp. \"The Karate Kid Part II\" dove deeper into his past in Okinawa, revealing that Miyagi left Japan for Hawaii after a falling out with his best friend Sato, the uncle of Chozen (Yuji Okumoto).",
      "Flash forward to Season 6 of \"Cobra Kai.\" In Part 1 \u2014 which comprises the first five episodes of the season \u2014 Daniel unearths a box that belonged to Mr. Miyagi. Inside, he finds boxing gloves, a passport, a piece of fabric and a newspaper clipping with the headline \"Police search for assailant,\" dated to 1947. The passport features a photo of Mr. Miyagi next to the name \"Keisuke Miyagi,\" rather than Nariyoshi, the first name Daniel knew him to have. The clipping also reveals that Keisuke Miyagi was accused of violent robbery and assault.",
      "The boxing gloves and passport address lead Daniel to a gym. A man, purporting to be the grandson of the gym's original owner, says Mr. Miyagi was a silent partner in the gym. The man also reveals that Mr. Miyagi at one point fled the United States.",
      "In the last scene of Episode 5, Daniel realizes the significance of the headband. After Miyagi-Do qualifies for an international karate tournament in Barcelona, the Sekai Taikai, Daniel realizes the fabric matches the headbands awarded to team captains. The moment implies that Mr. Miyagi has a history at the Sekai Taikai, sending Daniel on a mission to learn more about his mentor's past \u2014\u00a0and all its dark twists and turns.",
      "Macchio describes the box and its revelations as something that \"unravels\" Daniel.",
      "\"He\u2019s kind of chasing the past instead of focusing on the present, let alone the future, for his students and everyone else,\" Macchio tells TODAY.com.",
      "Digging into Mr. Miyagi's past in Part 2, which consists of Episodes 6-10 and dropped on Netflix Nov. 15, will bring new obstacles. But his character can't help but investigate, Macchio says.",
      "\"When you have loss in your life, whether it\u2019s a parent or a mentor or a brother or sister, and you have something unknown, you grasp it, wanting to understand,\" Macchio says. \"It\u2019s important to go through that to get to the other side, to the resolve of what that is.",
      "\"In Part 2, it\u2019s the deepest and darkest dive for him that gets him a bit in trouble,\" Macchio adds.",
      "What is Mr. Miyagi's secret in 'Cobra Kai' Season 6?",
      "Once the Miyagi-Do crew arrives in Barcelona for the Sekai Taikai, Daniel starts asking organizers if they recognize Mr. Miyagi's headband. In Episode 6, a woman representing the company that makes the tournament's official apparel tells Daniel that Miyagi's headband was likely from the \"1950s era, maybe even 1940s,\" meaning Mr. Miyagi was likely involved in the Sekai Taikai after World War II.",
      "The headband is coated in dried blood, and one of the organizers reveals that the Sekai Taikai tournaments \"were even more brutal back then.\"",
      "Daniel's search for more info about Miyagi's background with the tournament hits a snag in Episode 7. After following a lead to speak with a Mr. Serrano, a former champion old enough to potentially have more information, Daniel falls into a trap and ends up caged. He eventually escapes and fights his way out in direct combat with a man with a snake \u2014 specifically the Cobra Kai symbol \u2014 tattooed on his arm.",
      "Shenanigans ensue, including the return of the No. 3 most villainest \"Karate Kid\" universe villain according to TODAY.com, Terry Silver (Thomas Ian Griffith), who was responsible for kidnapping Daniel. At the end of Episode 9, Silver, now associated with the defending champions, the Iron Dragons dojo, gives Daniel a manila envelope.",
      "\"A gift, from me to you,\" Silver says.",
      "Inside is a piece of paper, purportedly the Sekai Taikai record from the year Mr. Miyagi competed. The spreadsheet shows that Miyagi faced someone named Claramunt. In the final score column, it simply says, \"Death.\"",
      "\"He killed his opponent,\" Daniel says in shock.",
      "The Part 2 finale opens with Daniel dreaming. In the sequence, he faces a young Mr. Miyagi, as someone from the crowd shouts, \"Kill him, Miyagi-san.\"",
      "The fight starts, and the young Miyagi gets off the first and second points. \"If this is a lesson, I'm not getting it,\" Daniel says.",
      "\"Lesson?\" the dream Miyagi responds in Japanese.",
      "\"There's so much you never told me,\" Daniel says next. \"I just need to understand why.\"",
      "\"That was always your problem, Daniel-san. So eager to understand, but not willing to accept,\" Miyagi says.",
      "Daniel, now lying on his back, looks up at Miyagi before the final hit. He blinks, and a face resembling Morita's looks back at him and says, \"Miyagi never tell you everything, Daniel-san, because you were never strong enough to accept truth.\"",
      "After waking up, Daniel goes back to the tournament organizers, and they authenticate the sheet of paper with the record of Mr. Miyagi's fight.",
      "\"Sadly, the rare death did occur in that era,\" the organizer says. \"It was a different time.\"",
      "Johnny suggests it might have been a \"freak accident.\"",
      "The Part 2 finale ends before Daniel can uncover more details about Mr. Miyagi's past. By Episode 10, both Miyagi-Do and Cobra Kai are in the semifinals of the Sekai Taikai. Team captains from the remaining dojos \u2014\u00a0including Miyagi-Do's Robby (Tanner Buchanan) and Sam (Mary Mouser) and Cobra Kai's Tory (Peyton List) and Kwon (Brandon H. Lee) \u2014 have to fight in one-on-one matches to qualify for the championship.",
      "In the middle of Robby's match against one of the Iron Dragons, an eliminated team attacks an organizer, starting a brawl between all of the dojos. During the fight, Kreese tries to go after Silver with an eunjangdo, a small knife, before realizing he had dropped it on the mat.",
      "Kwon finds the knife and tries to use it while fighting with one of the Iron Dragons. Instead, after getting his leg swept in midair, he falls on his stomach, landing on the knife. Daniel rolls Kwon over, the blade sticking out of his chest.",
      "So death in the Sekai Taikai might not just be a thing of the past. Similarly, the death that resulted from Mr. Miyagi's fight in the Sekai Taikai might not be so straightforward.",
      "Macchio tells TODAY.com that a resolution to the Miyagi mystery will occur in \u201cthe full course of Season 6,\u201d which consists of 15 episodes in total. Part 3 of \u201cCobra Kai\u201d Season 6 is expected in 2025.",
      "Miyagi's backstory also \"opens up more into the Miyagi-verse,\" Macchio says, which is notably expanding in May 2025 with the film \"Karate Kid: Legends,\" starring Macchio and Jackie Chan.",
      "While it's unclear how everything will shake out, Macchio notes that Season 6 won't \"taint\" the Mr. Miyagi that fans know and love.",
      "\"We never want to taint who the essence of that character was,\" Macchio says. \"But we\u2019re all human, and everyone has flaws.\u201d",

      "Alex Cross, the literary world\u2019s well-known crime detective, is receiving a makeover in the latest television adaptation, \u201cCross,\u201d coming to Amazon Prime on Nov. 14. The titular star is played stoically by \u201cBlack Adam\u201d breakout Aldis Hodge.",
      "The role of Alex Cross is not new to on-screen adaptations. The first came in 1997\u2019s \u201cKiss the Girls,\u201d with Morgan Freeman playing the hardened Washington D.C. detective. The movie was a loose adaptation of the series\u2019 second book of the same name. A second installment also starring Freeman called \u201cAlong Came a Spider,\u201d released in 2001.",
      "The last major attempt to convert Alex Cross into an on-screen fixture came in 2012 with the aptly named film, \u201cAlex Cross\u201d starring Tyler Perry in the lead role.",
      "With multiple films and a longstanding book series in the rearview, Hodge had the difficult task of making the legendary character his own in an eight episode series. In an interview with TODAY.com, Hodge explained how he approached the task with showrunner Ben Watkins.",
      "\u201cThe perspective of how we shaped this character came in conversations with Ben Watkins where we didn\u2019t even talk about the character. We just talked about what was going on in our personal lives, our lives as men.\u201d",
      "For the 38-year-old actor, one of those \"personal\" life things included his newly appointed role as a father, which he says helped him curate his take on Alex Cross, a proud dad of two.",
      "\u201cI recently stepped into fatherhood,\u201d Hodge said. \u201cI was in a whirlwind of emotions because it\u2019s such a beautiful experience. And those kinds of things really shaped how they went back to write the character as we moved through so I was really stepping into something that was already familiar.\u201d",
      "Hodge is a first-time dad to his now three-year-old daughter. In an October profile of the star by Essence magazine, Hodge expanded on how his new parental role informs his life.",

      "Hodge says being a dad was one of the ways that helped him authentically portray his character on screen. The other? He says understanding what drove the detective\u2019s everyday life.",
      "\u201cI was stepping into honesty, and all I had to do was keep remembering what Alex Cross\u2019 \u2018why\u2019 was with whatever situation he stepped into,\u201d the actor tells TODAY.com.",
      "\"We didn't have to try for that. All we had to be aware of was making honest decisions and choices,\u201d he says.",
      "The Prime series also stars Isaiah Mustafa as John Sampson, a fellow detective and longtime friend of Alex Cross. The Sampson character has made several appearances in the James Patterson novels but has seldom been brought to the screen.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Mustafa opened up about bringing his character's close friendship with Cross to the screen.",
      "\u201cI looked at the relationship that Sampson had with Alex, and I let that inform me as to who Sampson was and how deep his character was, how much love he had for his partner,\u201d Mustafa says. \u201cSo to me, that was the through line. To show how much heart this character had and what he was willing to do to make sure his partner, his brother, lived up to his higher power.\u201d",
      "The backdrop of Washington D.C. also serves as an important component of this new retelling of the Alex Cross story. Hodge explains that in the show, \u201cD.C. stands as its own character.\u201d",
      "The star says that the show attempts to go beyond the political significance of nation\u2019s capital by tapping into the culture of the people that make up the city\u2019s heart.",
      "\u201cSomething that was really important to Ben was that we really bring out the flavor of D.C.\u2019s culture. You\u2019ve only really seen D.C. from the political side, the White House, the monuments,\u201d Hodge explains. \u201cWe owe it to the culture to highlight them in a celebratory way.\u2019"

      "The story of love and friendship between two legendary witches in \u201cWicked\u201d inspires real-life tears, both on and off the screen.",
      "The upcoming film, set to hit theaters Nov. 22, is the first of a two-part release and focuses on the relationship between Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) and Glinda (Ariana Grande) \u2014 sorry, Galinda \u2014 during their time at Shiz University.",
      "During one scene, \"there was not a dry eye\" in the audience, Hoda Kotb told Erivo and Grande in an interview that aired on TODAY Nov. 14.",
      "The party scene, set at the Ozdust Ballroom, marks a turning point for Erivo and Grande's characters' friendship, after Elphaba is the subject of ridicule. Filming the moment was just as emotional as watching it, Erivo said.",
      "\u201cIt was a really big day,\u201d Erivo said. \u201cSometimes painful. Sometimes joyous. It took a lot of heart because everything is out there for everyone to see. It\u2019s a very vulnerable space to walk into.\u201d",
      "Elphaba and Glinda perform an emotionally-charged dance sequence during the ballroom scene. Erivo told Hoda and Savannah Guthrie that the cast provided a \u201cwall of protection\u201d during that moment.",
      "\"I\u2019m so grateful to have been able to do that and walk through any of the little wounds that I have, and the little wounds that Elphaba has, and to sort of put everything on display,\u201d Erivo said.",
      "Grande explained that the scene in the movie lasts 10 minutes, and each time they filmed it, the scene was performed in full. During each take of that \"12-hour day,\" Grande said, \u201cyou could hear a pin drop.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery (supporting actor) in the room ... every dancer, everyone was holding it with us,\u201d Grande said. \u201cAnd I think all of our hearts are still in that room a little bit.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Dave Coulier announced exclusively on the TODAY show that he's been diagnosed with Stage 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of blood cancer that starts in the lymphatic system.",
      "The \"Fuller House\" star, who famously played Uncle Joey, noticed his first symptoms a little over a month ago, when he came down with a cold. In the past, he'd noticed the lymph nodes in his neck or armpits would swell when he was sick. This time, though, he felt surprised to discover a golf-ball sized lump in his groin within a week of falling ill.",
      "\u201cIt swelled up immediately,\" Coulier, 65, tells TODAY.com in a phone interview. \u201cI thought, \u2018Wow, I\u2019m either really sick, or my body\u2019s really reacting to something.\u2019\u201d",
      "Worried, he visited his doctors who ran a variety of tests, including bloodwork, EKG, and PET and CT scans. While everything appeared to be normal, the doctors biopsied the lymph node just to be safe. Coulier soon learned why his lymph node became so enlarged.",
      "\u201c(My doctors) said, \u2018Hey, we wish we had better news, but you have non-Hodgkin lymphoma, B-cell lymphoma,\u2019\u201d Coulier recalls. \u201cIt was a shock.\u201d",
      "Despite his cancer diagnosis, Coulier is still finding joy in life.",
      "\u201cMy joke is that in four short weeks I\u2019ve gone from a Virgo to a Cancer,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to retain a sense of reality but also a sense of humor about it.\u201d",
      "Dave Coulier diagnosed with Stage 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma",
      "When Coulier felt under the weather a little over a month ago and noticed a swollen lymph node in his groin, he felt puzzled.",
      "\"The onset of this growing lymphoma in my groin area was very quick. So I said, 'Something's not right,'\" he recalled to Hoda during his Nov. 13 appearance on TODAY.",
      "Coulier visited his doctor, who ordered a battery of tests.",
      "\u201cThey said, \u2018Yeah, we need to take a serious look at this.\u2019 And so, we did blood tests,\u201d he says. \u201cBlood tests came back great. My EKG, everything great. Heart, everything perfect.\u201d",
      "But his doctors felt worried by how quickly the lump grew and ordered more advanced imaging before eventually wanting a sample of it for testing.",
      "\u201c\u2018We\u2019d like to either remove this or biopsy it,\u2019\u201d Coulier recalls his doctors telling him. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, why don\u2019t we just remove it and biopsy it at the same time?\u2019\u201d",
      "Three days later, Coulier received the news from his doctor that he had B-cell lymphoma, a type of cancer that develops in B-lymphocytes, according to the American Cancer Society. B-cell lymphomas account for the vast majority of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Every year, more than 80,000 Americans are diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.",
      "\u201cThe first thing I said to them was, \u2018Wait a minute \u2014 cancer?\u2019\u201d he Coulier. \u201c(I was) feeling like I got punched in the stomach because it never happens to you. You always hear about it happening to someone else.\u201d",
      "Hearing the news was even harder because his wife, Melissa Coulier, wasn\u2019t at home.",
      "\u201cI was just contemplating, \u2018How do I tell her?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I told her, of course, she thought I was joking.\u201d",
      "After he reassured her that he was not joking, Melissa \u201corganized (his) entire life, from nutrition to the doctor\u2019s appointments to the pills.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s got stuff color-coded,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty great.\u201d",
      "To understand what stage of cancer he had, Coulier\u2019s doctors took a bone marrow sample.",
      "\u201cThey wanted to see if (the cancer had) moved on to any major organs or my blood or bones or anything,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was pins and needles for a few days because I didn\u2019t know what stage it was or if it had progressed.\u201d",
      "Yet at some point, Coulier started feeling a sort of acceptance.",
      "\u201cI told Melissa I don\u2019t know why, but I (am) OK with whatever the news (is) going to be no matter how devastating. \u2026 I can\u2019t explain where that came from,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve had an incredible life. I\u2019ve had the most amazing people in my life. This has been an extraordinary journey, and I\u2019m OK if this is the end of the journey.\u201d",
      "A few days later, he learned he had Stage 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma.",
      "Stage 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma survival rate",
      "Stage 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma means the cancer has not spread outside the lymphatic system, according to the American Cancer Society. The five-year survival rate for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has not spread widely is about 74%, per ACS.",
      "\u201c(Stage 3) doesn\u2019t sound great,\" Coulier says, but because it hasn't spread to his bone marrow, doctors told him his curability rate is upwards of 90%.",
      "\"It's very treatable,\" he said on TODAY.",
      "Starting chemotherapy",
      "Doctors wanted Coulier to start chemotherapy promptly, and he underwent another surgery to have his chemotherapy port, which delivers the medication, placed.",
      "Leading up to his first treatment, Coulier faced his fear of the unknowns of cancer.",
      "\u201cYou hear chemo, and it scares the daylights out of you,\u201d he says. \u201cThe first round was pretty intense because you don\u2019t know what to expect. You don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to feel. Is this going to hit me immediately? Is it going to be devastating? Am I going to walk out of here?\u201d",
      "As \u201ca preemptive strike,\u201d Coulier shaved his head, which he jokes makes him \u201clook like a baby bird.\u201d The last time he was bald was when he shaved his head during the \u201cFull House\u201d series wrap, getting rid of the mullet he sported for many years.",
      "Coulier felt better than expected after his first round of chemotherapy. In total, he\u2019ll have six rounds every 21 days and should be finished with treatment by February 2025. Following treatment, he expects a \u201ctotal remission.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a bit of a roller coaster. There (are) days where I feel unbelievable,\u201d he says. \u201cThen there\u2019s other days where \u2026 I\u2019m just going to lay down and let this be what it\u2019s going to be.\u201d",
      "Still he's been able to maintain a positive outlook as he navigates treatment.",
      "\u201cThis is a journey,\u201d Coulier told Hoda. \u201cThis is a bit of a battle and you\u2019re going to need to be on your game.\u201d",
      "When Coulier feels good, he takes advantage of it. He\u2019s been recording episodes of the podcast \u201cFull House Rewind\u201d with his new co-host Marla Sokoloff, who played Gia Mahan on \u201cFull House\u201d and \u201cFuller House.\u201d And he recently skated with the Detroit Red Wings alumni \u2014 though he can\u2019t play hockey as it could damage his chemotherapy port. At the end of this week, John Stamos will visit him following his second round of chemotherapy.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have so many laughs. We\u2019re going to have so much fun,\u201d Coulier says. \u201cI said, \u2018It could be \u2018Weekend at Bernie\u2019s\u2019 if I\u2019m just out of it.\u2019 And (Stamos) said, \u2018That\u2019s OK. I\u2019ll carry you around.\u2019\u201d",
      "Coulier feels grateful for his \u201cincredible wife\u201d and \u201cincredible friends\u201d supporting him through his cancer diagnosis and treatment.",
      "\u201cThey all rallied around this, and a couple of comments that I\u2019ve heard are, \u2018Dave, you\u2019re not letting us worry about this very much,\u2019\u201d Coulier says. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to. I want us to have happy times and we\u2019ll get through this.\u201d",
      "Since his diagnosis, Coulier has learned that \u201che\u2019s strong enough to know (his) weaknesses,\u201d and he understands when to ask for help.",
      "Raising awareness",
      "Sadly, Coulier has plenty of experience with cancer.",
      "\u201cI lost my sister Sharon at 36 years old, breast cancer. I lost my niece Shannon at 29 years old, breast cancer,\u201d he says. \u201cI lost my mom, and now my sister Karen has cancer. So, over the years I\u2019ve seen what the women in my family have gone through, and it\u2019s been not only an awakening but a learning process.\u201d",
      "While it\u2019s been tough watching cancer affect his family so dramatically, the actor has grown from it.",
      "\u201cWhen I was diagnosed, all of those memories came back of what they went through and so many hospital visits and sitting bedside and talking and having conversations and watching them leave the planet,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat they went through is 10 times harder than what I\u2019m going through. So, if I can be one-tenth as strong as they were, I\u2019m going to be fine.\u201d",
      "His family also taught him to embrace joy, and that has helped him maintain a positive outlook.",
      "\u201cMy mom, my sister and my niece were laughing until the day they died,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was a real inspiration for me to just remember that there\u2019s a lot of happiness.\u201d",
      "Coulier\u2019s looking forward to the future. His son, Luc, and his wife, Alex, are expecting a baby boy in March, and Coulier\u2019s excited to become a grandfather and anticipates lots of flights from Michigan to Los Angeles to spend time with his family.",
      "Coulier felt compelled to share his story to raise awareness of cancer and encourage others to undergo screening for it.",
      "\u201cThe one thing that just kept presenting itself to me was to tell other people about it. Talk to them about getting something as simple as pre-screening or a breast exam, mammogram, a colonoscopy or a prostate exam,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a really simple thing to do and it can add years to your life.\u201d"

      "One of several airstrikes on Friday morning, the attack struck near the Tayouneh junction in an area where the suburbs meet other parts of the city, a more central target than most that Israel has hit.

United Nations peacekeepers and Lebanese troops would be tasked with monitoring and enforcing the deal.",
      "The Israeli official said a key sticking point is the question of enforcement. Israel says it\u2019s looking for language in the deal that would allow it to resume attacking if Lebanese and U.N. authorities do not take action in the event Hezbollah violates the agreement.

    "story": [
      "Beneath the snowy slopes lay a prehistoric surprise: an ecosystem that predates the dinosaurs, revealed by melting snow before being stumbled upon by a hiker in the Italian Alps.",
      "The discovery, made public Wednesday, includes well-preserved footprints of reptiles and amphibians that scientists say date back 280 million years to a geologic period known as the Permian period.",
      "\u201cDinosaurs had not yet emerged at this time, but the animals responsible for the largest footprints here would still have been impressive, reaching up to 2-3 meters in length,\u201d said Cristiano Dal Sasso, a paleontologist at the Natural History Museum in Milan, where the finds are now on display.",
      "The fossils were discovered in the mountains of northern Italy's Lombardy region after the snow and ice that once covered them melted away, scientists say, as a result of the ongoing climate crisis.",
      "Claudia Steffensen was hiking along a trail in the Valtellina Orobie mountain range in the summer of 2023 when she stepped on a gray stone marked with unusual patterns.\u201cMy husband was in front of me, looking straight ahead, while I was looking toward my feet. I put my foot on a rock, which struck me as odd as it seemed more like a slab of cement. I then noticed these strange circular designs with wavy lines. I took a closer look and realized they were footprints,\u201d Steffensen told the Guardian newspaper.",
      "Intrigued, she snapped photos and shared them with her friend, Elio Della Ferrera, a nature photographer. Della Ferrera then contacted Dal Sasso, at the museum in Milan, to learn more about the discovery.",
      "Dal Sasso enlisted the expertise of two specialists: Ausonio Ronchi, a professor of stratigraphy at the University of Pavia in Northern Italy, and Lorenzo Marchetti, a fossil expert from the Natural History Museum in Berlin.",
      "Marchetti told NBC News on Friday that he was \u201camazed by the quality and quantity of the material,\u201d and said that while he had studied other Permian sites in the area, none seemed as \u201crich\u201d as this one.",
      "The Permian period immediately predated the dinosaurs.",
      "Ronchi said he was also \u201csurprised by the abundance and preservation\u201d of the fossils when he first saw the images.",
      "\u201cIt is the first time we have seen such an amazing variety of vertebrate footprints, invertebrate tracks, imprints of flora, and other fossils,\u201d he said in an email.",
      "\u201cThese footprints were imprinted when the sandstones and clays were still wet,\u201d Ronchi said. \u201cThe summer sun dried those surfaces so thoroughly that when water returned, the footprints weren\u2019t washed away; rather, they were covered by new layers of clay that formed a protective coating.\u201d",
      "Continental fossils have previously been found in the Permian sediments of the Southern Alps, but none of this quality.",
      "Starting in summer 2023, Della Ferrera and the research team conducted further inspections, photographing and mapping hundreds of fossilized traces across the mountain range, which rises to nearly 10,000 feet above sea level.The first fossils were airlifted out by helicopter last month.",
      "As the fossils lie in the upper part of a mountain valley, which is covered by snow for most of the year, the discoveries are closely linked to climate change.",
      "Ronchi explained that in recent years, rising temperatures have caused the ice to nearly disappear, leaving the debris where the fossils were found exposed.",
      "\u201cLast year\u2019s ice is almost gone due to the rising temperatures, which uncovers the debris area where we found the fossils,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cBlocks of rock fall down from the steep walls of the reliefs as a consequence of cracking and erosion, so we expect to find many more tracks and fossils in the coming years,\u201d Ronchi said.",
      "The research team said that the fossils uncover trends strikingly similar to those we are witnessing today: an intensifying greenhouse effect, melting polar ice and changing ecosystems.",
      "These environmental shifts contributed to the extinction of many species, which we may now encounter as fossils on a fortunate hike.",
      "\u201cThe past has much to teach us about what we risk doing to the world today,\u201d the researchers warned."

      "Israeli authorities have caused a forced displacement of Palestinian people in Gaza to an extent that constitutes war crimes and crimes against humanity, Human Rights Watch said in a report on Thursday.",
      "The report is the latest in a series from aid groups and international bodies warning about the dire humanitarian situation in the besieged enclave.",
      "\u201cHuman Rights Watch found that forced displacement has been widespread, and the evidence shows it has been systematic and part of a state policy. Such acts also constitute crimes against humanity,\u201d the report said.",
      "There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military or foreign ministry. Israeli authorities have previously rejected such accusations, and say their forces operate in compliance with international law.",
      "The law of armed conflict forbids the forcible displacement of civilian populations from occupied territory, unless necessary for the security of civilians or imperative military reasons.",
      "Israel invaded the Gaza Strip last year after Hamas-led gunmen attacked communities in southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities, and abducting more than 250 as hostages.",
      "Since then, the Israeli campaign has killed more than 43,500 people, according to Gaza health authorities, and destroyed much of the enclave\u2019s infrastructure, forcing most of the 2.3 million population to move several times.",
      "For the past month, Israeli troops have moved tens of thousands of people from areas in the north of the enclave as they have sought to destroy Hamas forces the military says have been reforming around the towns of Jabalia, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun.",
      "Human Rights Watch said the displacement of Palestinians \u201cis likely planned to be permanent in the buffer zones and security corridors,\u201d an action it said would amount to \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d",
      "The Israeli military has denied seeking to create permanent buffer zones and Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said on Monday that Palestinians displaced from their homes in northern Gaza would be allowed to return at the end of the war."

      "During his 2016 presidential run, Huckabee staked out an arch-conservative position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, rejecting the notion of an \"occupied\" West Bank. Instead, he referred to the area using the biblical term \u201cJudea and Samaria.\u201d",
      "At the time, received earned the Adelson Defender of Israel award at a Zionist Organization of America dinner in New York. Miriam Adelson, the widow of Sheldon Adelson, remains a top Trump donor, and she gave lavishly to his 2024 campaign.",

      "Government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said Scholz urged Putin in the hour-long call to withdraw his troops and end the full-scale invasion launched in February 2022.

      "NEW DELHI \u2014 India\u2019s government banned non-essential construction in New Delhi, the world\u2019s most polluted capital, and urged residents to avoid burning coal for heating, to combat worsening air quality that has disrupted flights and obscured the Taj Mahal.",
      "The new measures, which include sprinkling water with dust suppressants on roads, as well as mechanized sweeping that would help settle dust, came into effect on Friday morning.",
      "Delhi Chief Minister Atishi, who uses only one name, also directed all primary schools to shift to online classes.",
      "They measures also include a ban on non-essential construction and an appeal to citizens to use more public transport and avoid using coal and wood for heating, a government release said Thursday, without saying how long the measures would be in place.",
      "Air quality\u00a0in northern India has deteriorated over the past week, with toxic smog obscuring India\u2019s famed monument to love, the Taj Mahal, about 136 miles from New Delhi, as well as Sikhism\u2019s holiest shrine, the Golden Temple in Amritsar.",
      "New Delhi has a severe air quality level of 424, according to live rankings kept by Swiss group IQAir, the worst among global capitals.",
      "The city battles smog \u2014 a toxic mix of smoke and fog \u2014 every winter as cold air traps dust, emissions and smoke from illegal farm fires.",
      "Around 38% of the pollution in New Delhi this year has been caused by stubble burning \u2014 a practice where stubble left after harvesting rice is burned to clear fields \u2014 in the neighboring states of Punjab and Haryana.",
      "Delhi flights faced delays, with tracking website Flightradar24 showing 88% of departures and 54% of arrivals were delayed as of Thursday afternoon due to smog.",
      "Officials blamed high pollution, combined with humidity, becalmed winds and a drop in temperature for the smog, which cut visibility to 980 feet at the city\u2019s international airport, which\u00a0diverted\u00a0flights in zero visibility on Wednesday.",
      "More patients flocked to hospitals, particularly children.",
      "\u201cThere has been a sudden increase in children with allergies, cough and cold ... and a rise in acute asthma attacks,\u201d Sahab Ram, a pediatrician in Punjab\u2019s Fazilka region, told news agency ANI.",

      "Pollution in New Delhi was likely to stay in the \u201csevere\u201d category on Friday, the earth sciences ministry said, before improving to \u201cvery poor,\u201d or an index score of 300 to 400.",
      "The number of farm fires to clear fields in northern India has risen steadily this week to almost 2,300 on Wednesday from 1,200 on Monday, the ministry\u2019s website showed.",
      "Lahore, the capital of Pakistan\u2019s eastern province of Punjab, was rated the world\u2019s most polluted city on Friday, in IQAir\u2019s rankings. Authorities there have also\u00a0battled\u00a0hazardous air this month."

      "Thousands of people joined a march toward New Zealand\u2019s capital on Friday after a contentious bill that would reinterpret the country\u2019s 184-year-old founding document passed its first hurdle in Parliament.",
      "Several rallies against the\u00a0Treaty Principles Bill\u00a0are being staged in towns across the country as a nine-day march, or hikoi, moves to Wellington. It is expected to reach the national capital on Tuesday.",
      "An estimated 10,000 people marched through Rotorua, about 280 miles north of Wellington, New Zealand police said in a statement. Protesters, some wearing traditional clothing, were greeted by hundreds waving the Maori flag and chanting.",
      "On Thursday, Indigenous Maori leaders\u00a0staged a haka, a Maori dance that was traditionally a challenge to opponents, at the first parliamentary hearing of the bill that seeks to redefine the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi.",
      "Twenty-two-year-old lawmaker Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke ripped up a copy of the bill and led the haka in Parliament as other Maori members and some visitors in the public gallery joined her.",
      "First signed in 1840 between the British Crown and more than 500 Maori chiefs, the treaty lays down how the two parties agreed to govern. The interpretation of clauses in the document still guides legislation and policy today.",
      "The ACT New Zealand party, a junior partner in the governing center-right coalition government, last week unveiled the bill, which it had promised during last year\u2019s election.",
      "The party has criticized the sharing of some governance matters between the state and Maori, arguing that non-Indigenous citizens are losing out because of policies designed to uplift Maori.",
      "But Maori and their supporters say the bill undermines the rights of the country\u2019s Indigenous people, who make up about 20% of the population of 5.3 million.",
      "Coalition partners the National Party and New Zealand First are only supporting the legislation through the first of three readings. Both parties have said they will not support it to become legislation, meaning it will almost certainly fail.",
      "Prime Minister Christopher Luxon reaffirmed on Thursday that his National Party would not support the bill\u2019s progress beyond the first reading."

    "summary": "Chinese President Xi Jinping opened a $1.3 billion deep-water port in Peru that was funded by Beijing as it seeks greater trade and influence in South America.",
    "story": [
      "LIMA, Peru \u2014 Chinese President Xi Jinping launched a weeklong diplomatic blitz of South America on Thursday by inaugurating a massive deep-water port in Peru, a $1.3 billion investment by Beijing as it seeks to expand trade and influence on the continent.",
      "With China\u2019s demand for agricultural goods and metals from Latin America growing, Xi will participate in the\u00a0Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit\u00a0in\u00a0Lima\u00a0and then head to the Group of 20 summit in Rio de Janeiro next week, where he will also make a state visit to Brazil.",
      "Xi and Peruvian President Dina Boluarte participated on Thursday by video link in the opening of the Chancay port, about 48 miles north of Lima on the Pacific Ocean, and signed a deal to\u00a0widen an existing free trade agreement.",
      "Xi said that Chancay, a 15-berth, deep-water port, was the successful start of a \u201c21st-century maritime Silk Road\u201d and part of China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, its modern revival of the ancient Silk Road trading route.",
      "\u201cChina is willing to work with the Peruvian side to take the Chancay project as a starting point to forge a new maritime-land corridor between China and Latin America and connect the Great Inca Trail,\u201d Xi said, referring to a 15th-century mountain network that joined the Inca empire.",
      "In an opinion article in the state newspaper El Peruano, Xi said the Chancay project would generate $4.5 billion in annual revenue, create more than 8,000 direct jobs and reduce the logistics costs of the Peru-China route by 20%.",
      "The China-controlled megaport was built by Cosco Shipping Ports, and received $1.3 billion in Chinese investment for its first phase. China is expected to spend billions more as Beijing and Lima work to position it as a major shipping hub between Asia and South America.",
      "The first ship is due to set sail from Chancay next week, transporting Peruvian fruit to China, said Mario Ocharan, Peruvian director of the Chancay Chamber of Commerce.",
      "China\u2019s main motivation for developing the megaport, according to Ocharan, was access to neighboring Brazil, where a new railway line is planned to carry Brazilian exports such as soybeans and iron ore to the port.",
      "The rail project is estimated to cost $3.5 billion, according to Mario de las Casas, corporate affairs manager at Cosco Shipping Chancay Peru.",
      "Building that link is \u201ccrucial\u201d to improve transportation of soybeans, as Brazil is the top seller of the commodity to China, he said.",
      "The inauguration of the port comes as Beijing is looking to further tap into resource-rich Latin America, amid\u00a0trade tensions with Europe\u00a0and concerns about future U.S. tariffs on Chinese exports from the incoming\u00a0Trump administration.",
      "Hundreds of Chinese business executives have accompanied Xi on this trip, including heads of companies heavily invested in Peru such as Chinalco, which owns the Toromocho copper mine.",
      "Robert Evan Ellis, Latin America research professor at the U.S. Army War College, said that Chancay will make shipping between Latin America and China more efficient.",
      "Because the port can handle the biggest ships, it will reduce the need for shippers to consolidate cargo containers at intermediary points, reducing costs and handling times.",
      "\u201cChancay illustrates how China seeks secure access to resources and markets and its ever more successful fight to corner global value added,\u201d Ellis said.",
      "China\u2019s major investment in Chancay has raised alarm bells in Washington. Gen. Laura Richardson, former chief of the U.S. Southern Command, warned this month that Chancay could be used by the Chinese navy and for intelligence-gathering.",
      "U.S. anxieties about Chancay reflect a\u00a0broader, decades-long shift\u00a0in a region Washington long saw as its backyard. China has overtaken the United States to become the largest trading partner of countries such as Peru.",
      "China\u2019s state-backed Global Times newspaper wrote in an editorial on Monday that the port was \u201cby no means a tool for geopolitical competition,\u201d calling U.S. accusations of the port\u2019s potential military use \u201csmears.\u201d"

      "China is looking to \u201cplay a more proactive role internationally on climate change,\u201d said Joanna Lewis, an associate professor at Georgetown University and expert in international climate policy.",
      "But \u201cit would be a mistake for the United States to completely cede not just [its] leadership role on climate change. But the development of low-carbon technologies, that\u2019s really the area that has been particularly competitive between China and the United States,\u201d Lewis said.",

      "When Trump first pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement in 2017, there was an increase in subnational engagement at international climate negotiations, Lewis said. This included governors and senators taking action to demonstrate American initiative in climate policy and engage in diplomacy.",
      "\u201cIf Trump cedes leadership in the international realm, the states and other subnational actors will happily fill that void,\u201d Lewis said.",
