    "story": [
      "There were some heroic efforts overnight from Donald Trump and those around him to suggest the past seven days were something other than absolute chaos.",
      "By this reading, Trump's 4D game of chess has left China in check. Certainly the Chinese economy faces a massive hit from punitive tariffs in its biggest market. But even accounting for the President's roll back, the US has still erected a massive protectionist tariff wall, not seen since the 1930s.",
      "The world is left with a universal 10% tariff, irrespective of whether that country (for example the UK or Australia) actually sells less to the US than the US sells to it. There is now no difference between the EU, which clearly does have a massive trade deficit in goods and was preparing to retaliate, and the UK.",
      "There is also an anxious wait to find out what comes next. One of the questions is whether President Trump pushes ahead with tariffs on medicines, the UK's second biggest goods export.",
      "Plus there is potential logistical chaos on the cards from a little-noticed multi-million dollar port tax for every cargo vessel docking in the US that was \"made in China\". That is more than half of the global merchant fleet - and it is due next Friday.",
      "Even with Trump's stated 90 day pause on implementing higher tariffs, there remains too much uncertainty for companies to go through the rigmarole of rerouting global trade.",
      "The China fallout",
      "The central issue today, however, is that the world's two great economic superpowers are now facing off against each other like rutting stags.",
      "Tariffs at these sky-high rates are massively hitting business between two nations which together account for around 3% of the entire world's trade. The main motorway of the global economy is effectively shut.",
      "The visible tangible consequences of all this will become very real very quickly: Chinese factories will close, workers will stroll from plant to plant looking for work.",
      "Beijing will need to organise a stimulus package to account for the loss of whole percentage points of GDP, the kind of thing that happens when a natural disaster flattens a major city. Painful, but manageable at a cost, though not forever.",
      "Meanwhile the US will see consumer prices surge. President Trump might try to order these US companies not to raise prices, but the effect will come through soon enough.",
      "In theory this will be in sharp contrast to what is happening in other countries in the world. Across the border in Canada, or in Europe, not only will there not be such China-sourced price rises, there could be price cuts.",
      "From trade wars to currency wars",
      "Trade wars on this scale do not stay confined to the flow of goods. They tend to become currency wars.",
      "What we saw last night was the trade turmoil spread to credit markets, especially the US bond market, having already hit share prices.",
      "Indeed there was an invaluable reveal for the game theory of this conflict. The Trump administration revealed a key pressure point with its concern about the \"yippy\" - as Trump called it - bond market.",
      "As trading in US government debt continued overnight in Asia, the effective interest rate on these bonds rose to 5%.",
      "This sort of borrowing should not move in such an erratic fashion.",
      "The last time this happened was in the \"Dash for Cash\", the key moment of financial fragility at the very beginning of the pandemic. The world was focussed on life or death in March 2020, but this potential further crisis was alleviated only by emergency action.",
      "Effectively, the President's row back was a form of emergency policy change.",
      "Was the Chinese government behind this rash of US government bond sales in Asia? Probably not. However, what happened on Wednesday highlighted a vulnerability for Trump.",
      "China is the second biggest holder of US government debt in the world and if it chose to, dumping all that debt would be catastrophic for America. But doing so would be a form of mutually assured economic destruction - the losses for China would be huge.",
      "More importantly, what the bond markets were telling Trump is that they are deeply sceptical about his tariff policy.",
      "The US does have the Federal Reserve, which does have some power to tranquillise bond markets. But right now it does not look like its chairman Jerome Powell will ride to the rescue.",
      "The bond market scepticism echoes the sentiment of the ascendant Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. He is now pushing for Trump to reach trade deals with their allies because the US needs them to take on China.",
      "Given the US was previously calling these same close allies cheaters, looters and pillagers, there is no way this was the strategy all along.",
      "This does matter. The US needs the EU, UK, the rest of the G7 on side in terms of China. China probably needs those countries just to stay neutral, and carry on soaking up its exports.",
      "The rest of the world has seen Trump's team struggle to explain tariffing penguin islands or poor African economies and the President himself recirculating the suggestion he was crashing stock markets on purpose. And they've witnessed the fact that the tariff rates were changed after they came into effect and also the absurd nature of the equation used to calculate them.",
      "It's in this context that Trump's handling of the situation has handed leverage back to the rest of the world, because neither friend nor foe will know quite what they are negotiating  with this America.",
      "There is a calm, welcomed by all, but it could be rather brief.",
      "Trump has turned his back on the foundation of US economic might - the fallout will be messy",
      "War has changed Zelensky - but now is the time for him to transform again",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 23:07:36 GMT",
    "summary": "Cocoa prices are soaring so new chocolate firms are looking at an alternative ingredient.",
    "story": [
      "The first thing I notice is the lack of a strong aroma. There's no familiar, powerful waft of cocoa when opening this bag of sweets, the packet of biscuits, or the caramel-filled truffles.",
      "And as I taste each one as part of my solemn commitment to inform the public, I don't get quite the same burst of chocolate flavour that you might expect from treats with that familiar, waxy, light brown chocolate-like coating. The thing is, this isn't chocolate. It's made with sunflower seeds. Or fava (also called broad) beans.",
      "The selection before me is just a smattering of the non-cocoa containing alternatives to chocolate that are creeping into the European retail market right now. Their makers have spied an opportunity, partly because real chocolate prices are soaring.",
      "\"The average increase in price for chocolate was 9% over 2024,\" says Richard Caines, principal analyst in UK food and drink research at market research firm Mintel. \"In January just gone, it's shot up by 14%.\"",
      "That's the retail price of chocolate. The wholesale price of the key ingredient, cocoa \u2013 which is made from fermented, roasted and ground cacao beans \u2013 has increased by an astonishing 300% in 2024.",
      "\"I have been looking at this chocolate market for quite a few years now \u2013 I don't remember a big story like this on costs going up,\" adds Mr Caines.",
      "A key reason for this increase is climate change-related weather impacts on cacao farms, particularly in West Africa.",
      "Plus, some farmers in Ghana are turning away from cacao production in favour of illegal gold-mining, according to reports.",
      "It means that there was a deficit of roughly 500,000 tonnes of cocoa in the global market last year.",
      "Real chocolate could become a \"luxury\" item in the future says Massimo Sabatini, co-founder and chief executive of Italian firm Foreverland, which makes a cocoa powder alternative called Choruba.",
      "The company opened its production facility in March, where staff process not cacao beans but carob husks.",
      "Carob trees produce small, brown, banana-shaped pods containing seeds. It's possible to process the pods to create a cocoa-like powder. This chocolate alternative has a long history, however \u2013 and not a very happy one.",
      "A New Yorker article claims a generation was \"traumatized\" by carob-based confectionary during the 1970s. It didn't taste as good as real chocolate, and it didn't melt in your mouth in the same way, apparently.",
      "But Mr Sabatini insists that he and his colleagues have come up with a worthy product. He acknowledges that carob \"really doesn't taste like chocolate\" but adds that Foreverland's fermentation and roasting process removes some of the carob flavour to get it closer to cocoa.",
      "Their carob-based dark chocolate alternative is sweeter and more caramel-like than real dark chocolate, he explains.",
      "There could be health benefits to this. \"We can reduce drastically the sugar content,\" says Mr Sabatini. Carob is also higher in fibre and lower in fat than cocoa.",
      "German food manufacturer Planet A Foods has developed a different chocolate alternative. Sara Marquart, co-founder and chief technology officer, says her goal is not to replace chocolate but to help fill the gap in the market caused by volatility in cocoa availability and prices.",
      "Unlike Foreverland, Planet A Foods have chosen sunflower seeds as the key ingredient in their cocoa powder alternative, ChoViva.",
      "\"We process sunflower seeds like cocoa beans,\" explains Dr Marquart. \"It's a highly abundant ingredient, there's millions and millions of tonnes on the market.\"",
      "ChoViva is now present in roughly 35 different retail products, mostly on the market in Germany and France \u2013 though it also appears in mini egg-shaped sweets sold by Aldi in the UK. The sweets are made with peanuts and have a chocolate-like coating containing ChoViva.",
      "When I try them, the flavour is overwhelmingly dominated by the salty peanut at the egg's core. But the chocolatey texture of the coating is impressive. The same applies to ChoViva-covered biscuits made by the firm.",
      "I note that the chocolate-like coating is rather thin and not overly flavourful. But again, the texture is pretty much what you'd expect from real chocolate, though not quite as melty.",
      "The company's ChoViva-covered popcorn is probably the most chocolatey item I try \u2013 the popcorn doesn't usurp its coating.",
      "Overall, there's nothing here that would perturb a consumer. Especially one unaware that these products don't actually contain chocolate.",
      "A UK start-up also keen to compete in this space is Nukoko. Two of its founders previously ran a real chocolate business and teamed up with a food scientist to form their new venture.",
      "\"We saw first-hand the issues with the chocolate supply chain,\" says Ross Newton, co-founder. Like Foreverland and Planet A Foods, Nukoko has opted for a key ingredient that the firm can source and process locally \u2013 to reduce food miles and insulate against supply chain risks. But in Nukoko's case the raw material of choice is not carob or sunflower seeds but fava beans.",
      "\"There's around a million tonnes harvested in the UK every year,\" says Mr Newton.",
      "It's early days for the company but he adds that he hopes to begin selling their cocoa powder alternative to food firms later this year.",
      "Mr Newton says imitating the flavour of real chocolate is very hard but that, out of 25 crucial flavour compounds in real chocolate, his company's product manages to include 24 of them \u2013 though in some cases at slightly different concentrations.",
      "The company sends me four caramel-filled truffles to try. The caramel totally dominates and the truffles are very sweet. But the chocolate alternative is as smooth and glossy as you'd expect, and very satisfying to chew.",
      "\"Anything new that comes out has got to meet equal taste expectations,\" says Mr Caines, noting how discerning consumers are when it comes to their favourite chocolate-containing products. Getting them to embrace alternatives devoid of cocoa will be no mean feat.",
      "He adds that alternatives might fare best when used in bakery products \u2013 such as the chips in chocolate chip cookies: \"The chocolate is not so much the star of the show there so it might actually be more acceptable.\"",
      "Should chocolate alternatives meet with success, there is some risk that this could negatively impact cacao farmers, says Tonya Lander, a lecturer in biology at Oxford University.",
      "\"It's something that should be worked through with farmers or farmer collectives,\" she says. Cacao farmers are among the poorest agricultural workers in the world.",
      "Nukoko, Planet A Foods and Foreverland all say they don't aim to replace chocolate, rather, the goal is to fill the gap left by cocoa production shortfalls.",
      "Dr Lander and colleagues have studied environmental factors that influence yield from cacao trees.",
      "Poor pollination and high temperatures negatively affect how much cacao the trees produce, the researchers report in a study published in February.",
      "By shading cacao trees on plantations, for example, it might be possible to improve harvests and potentially reduce the volatility of cocoa supplies. Such interventions, besides switching to cocoa alternatives, could help satisfy confectionary-obsessed consumers in the coming years.",

    "summary": "Some analysts say that if costs incurred by tariffs pass to consumers, US iPhone prices could rise by hundreds of dollars.",
    "story": [
      "The world's most popular gadgets - phones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches - could be about to get a lot more expensive in the US.",
      "Many of them are made in China, which now faces a 145% tariff on its goods imported to the US, under President Donald Trump's controversial trade policy.",
      "The effect this may have on the iPhone and its maker Apple is under the spotlight - with some analysts saying if costs are passed onto consumers, iPhone prices in the US could rise by hundreds of dollars.",
      "And if the tariffs impact the value of the dollar, it could become more expensive to import iPhones and other devices around the world - potentially leading to higher prices in UK shops.",
      "Ben Wood of CCS Insight told the BBC that if tariffs remain in place, Apple may raise iPhone prices globally when the next iteration is launched.",
      "\"It is unlikely the company would want to have differentiated pricing globally,\" he said - as the tech giant would want to avoid people buying the device cheaply in the UK and selling it on for profit in the US.",
      "Though others say they believe it could result in cheaper prices if firms which normally send their goods to the US instead send them to countries which don't have such steep tariffs, like the UK.",
      "And there may be a significant change if the cost of tariffs is passed onto consumers globally - longer contracts to spread out the cost of the device.",
      "While a phone contract may typically last two years, Mr Wood said some firms already offer four year deals, and he believed \"we might see five-year contracts\" in 2025.",
      "\"One could argue it is almost like having a mortgage for your smartphone,\" he said.",
      "Where are iPhones made?",
      "The US is a major market for iPhones and Apple accounted for more than half of its smartphones sales last year, according to Counterpoint Research.",
      "It says as much as 80% of Apple's iPhones intended for US sale are made in China, with the remaining 20% made in India.",
      "Along with fellow smartphone giants such as Samsung, Apple has been trying to diversify its supply chains to avoid over-reliance on China in recent years.",
      "India and Vietnam emerged as frontrunners for additional manufacturing hubs.",
      "As tariffs took effect, Apple reportedly looked to speed up and increase its production of India-produced devices in recent days.",
      "Reuters reported on Thursday that Apple chartered cargo flights to ship more than 600 tons of iPhones from India to the US.",
      "Amid Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs, including those levied on India, the country may be set to benefit from an iPhone manufacturing boost.",
      "The BBC has approached Apple for comment on the impact of tariffs on their operations and prices, but has not had any response yet.",
      "How exposed is Apple to tariffs?",
      "Trump and his advisors have said the aim of its tariffs are to encourage more US manufacturing.",
      "However, the tech industry relies on a global network of suppliers for product components and assembly.",
      "This, and finding skilled workers to match the fast pace and low cost of production in Asia, means relocating supply chains is no simple feat.",
      "Apple committed a $500bn (\u00a3385bn) investment in the US in February - which the Trump administration believes will result in more homegrown manufacturing.",
      "But Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said shifting parts of its supply chain from cheaper manufacturing hubs in Asia to the US will take a lot of time, and money.",
      "\"The reality is it would take 3 years and $30 billion dollars in our estimation to move even 10% of its supply chain from Asia to the US with major disruption in the process,\" he wrote on X on 3 April.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Will iPhone prices go up?",
      "Apple have not revealed yet whether they plan to pass on the costs of the tariffs onto consumers in the US and increase prices.",
      "Some analysts believe Apple is in a more fortunate position than others, having reaped more money from its products than it has spent on making them.",
      "\"As a company with lucrative margins on its devices, Apple can absorb some of the tariff-induced cost increases without significant financial impact, at least in the short term,\" says Forrester principal analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee.",
      "But he notes the company's strong branding and popularity may allow it to pass some costs to consumers without too much backlash.",
      "\"The brand commands better loyalty than its competitors, and it is unlikely that a manageable price increase will send these customers fleeing into the arms of Android-based competitors.\"",
      "Some estimates suggest iPhone prices in the US could as much as triple if costs were passed to consumers.",
      "Following Trump's tariff increase on China to 125%, the cost for a China-made iPhone 16 Pro Max with 256GB storage would have surged from $1,199 to $1,999, according to estimates by investment banking firm UBS.",
      "They estimate a less significant increase on the iPhone 16 Pro 128GB storage - which is made in India - by five percent from $999 to $1046.",
      "While some analysts such as Dan Ives have suggested that the cost of a \"Made in USA\" iPhone could soar to as much as $3500.",
      "What can consumers do about it?",
      "There's still plenty of uncertainty about what happens next, and how companies like Apple will respond to tariffs remains to be seen.",
      "This hasn't stopped some US customers reportedly rushing to Apple stores to buy its smartphones.",
      "The BBC spoke to shoppers outside an Apple Store in New York who had bought products in fear of a potential price hike.",
      "Anthony Cacioppo, a 53-year-old DJ and security technician, purchased the new iPhone.",
      "\"I really didn't need a phone... but I'm not ready to pay double the price,\" he said.",
      "Bruce Conroy, a hair stylist, told the BBC that even if prices had risen considerably he \"would have stuck with Apple products\" - though potentially delayed his purchase of a new iPad.",
      "\"I bought it because the tariffs are coming, I want to buy before the prices go up and I expect they will,\" said Julia Baumann, a personal finance editor, of her new MacBook.",
      "We will likely have to wait until the autumn to see how much the next iPhone will cost.",
      "But if it looks like costs incurred by tariffs will result in higher price tags, some may look to rival handsets or second-hand devices.",
      "CCS Insight estimates that 5.5m second-hand smartphones will be sold in the UK in 2025, representing 29.7% of the total market.",
      "The iPhone remains one of the most expensive smartphones on the market - and brands such as Google and Samsung offer phones with similar features at a lower cost.",
      "The other option, and perhaps the most cost-effective, could be for people to skip upgrades to newer iPhone models and look to slightly older, cheaper versions.",
      "\"The path of least resistance would be to keep the smartphone they already have for longer,\" said Mr Wood.",

      "\"Rate cuts are on the cards, with the Bank of England expected to cut further in May, but mortgage rates may not fall quite as much as some are predicting.",
      "\"Trying to play the market in this environment is fraught with danger,\" he added.",
      "Hannah Bashford, mortgage and protection adviser at Model Financial Solutions, said that while Barclays' cuts were \"a very positive step\" for borrowers, the sub-4% rates it was offering were for purchases and not for people looking to re-mortgage.",
      "\"This is a signal that the lenders are still trying to keep the housing market alive but are keeping re-mortgage customers out in the cold,\" she said."

      "The duties, which the president had announced last week, were higher and more far-reaching than many on Wall Street had anticipated.",
      "In the aftermath of the announcement, the S&P plunged more than 10% and many analysts warned of the rising risk of economic recession in the US and globally.",
      "By Wednesday, the fears had hit the bond market, where investors started dumping US government debt.",
      "\"Although President Donald Trump was able to resist the stock market sell-off, once the bond market began to weaken too, it was only a matter of time before he folded,\" said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist for Capital Economics.",
      "He said he expected Trump to return to the plan for a 10% universal tariff that he called for in his presidential campaign last year, though warned that it would take time for for the US and China to work out a deal.",

      "The levies on goods from China, America's third largest supplier of imports, remain an economic challenge.",
      "The country sent more than $400bn in goods to the US last year and was the source of an estimated 60% of footwear imports and roughly 36% of clothing imports in January, according to the American Apparel and Footwear Association.",
      "Before Trump's announcement, the National Retail Federation had warned that shipments handled by US ports in May were likely to be 20% lower than a year earlier due to the tariffs.",
      "In appearances after his decision on Wednesday, Trump said that he hoped to strike a deal with China, and was also considering granting exemptions to tariffs for individual companies, a shift from earlier comments.",
      "\"I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy,\" he said, acknowledging the concerns, though he has signalled he remains committed to duties on key strategic sectors, such as cars, steel and aluminium, and is eyeing other industries such as pharmaceuticals and lumber.",

    "summary": "US exports have driven the economic success of countries like Vietnam and Cambodia.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs targeting most of the world are now in effect \u2013 and outside China, no other region has been hit as hard as South East Asia.",
      "Near the top of the list are Vietnam and Cambodia which have been hit by some of the highest tariffs: 46% and 49%.  Further down are Thailand (36%), Indonesia (32%) and Malaysia (24%). The Philippines gets a tariff of 17%, and Singapore of 10%.",
      "This is a huge blow for a region highly dependent on exports. Its widely admired economic development over the past three decades has largely been driven by its success in selling its products to the rest of the world, in particular to the US.",
      "Exports to the US contribute around 30% of Vietnam's GDP, and 25% of Cambodia's.",
      "That growth story is now imperilled by the punitive measures being imposed in Washington.",
      "The longer-term impact of these tariffs, assuming they stay in place, will vary, but will certainly pose big challenges to the governments of Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia in particular.",
      "As Trump hikes tariffs again, nervous businesses weigh what comes next",
      "China is not backing down from Trump's tariff war. What next?",
      "Vietnam's \"bamboo diplomacy\", where it attempts to be friends with everyone and balance ties with both China and the US, will now be tested.",
      "Under the leadership of the new Communist Party Secretary-General To Lam, Vietnam has embarked on an ambitious plan to build an upper-income, knowledge-and-tech-based economy by the year 2045. It has been aiming for annual growth rates in excess of 8%.",
      "Exporting more to the US, already its biggest market, was central to that plan.",
      "It was also the main reason why Vietnam agreed to elevate their relationship to that of a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2023.",
      "The Communist Party, which tolerates little dissent and has no formal political opposition, depends on its economic pledges for its legitimacy. Already viewed by many economists as too ambitious, these will now be even harder to meet.",
      "Thailand depends on US exports less than Vietnam \u2013 under 10% of GDP \u2013 but the Thai economy is in much worse shape, having underperformed for the past decade. The Thai government is trying to find ways to lift economic growth, most recently attempting but failing to legalise gambling, and these tariffs are another economic blow it cannot afford.",
      "For Cambodia, the tariffs pose perhaps the greatest political threat in the region.",
      "The government of Hun Manet has proved just as authoritarian as that of his father Hun Sen, whom he succeeded two years ago, but it is vulnerable.",
      "Keeping the Hun family's hold on power has required offering rival clans in Cambodia economic privileges like monopolies or land concessions, but this has helped create a glut of property developments, which are no longer selling, and a mass of grievances over land expropriations.",
      "The garment sector, which employs 750,000 people, has been a crucial social safety valve, giving steady incomes to Cambodia's poorest. Thousands of those jobs are now likely to be lost as a result of President Trump's tariffs.",
      "Unlike China, which has hit back with its own levies, the official message from governments in South East Asia is don't panic, don't retaliate, but negotiate.",
      "Vietnam has dispatched deputy prime minister Ho Duc Phoc to Washington to plead his country's case, and has offered to eliminate all tariffs on US imports. Thailand plans to send its finance minister to make a similar appeal, and has offered to reduce its tariffs and buy more American products, like food and aircraft.",
      "Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim is also heading to Washington, though with  exports to the US making up only 11% of Malaysia's total, his country is less affected than some of its neighbours.",
      "However, the Trump administration appears to be in no mood to compromise.",
      "Peter Navarro, President Trump's senior counsellor on trade and manufacturing and one of the main thinkers behind the new policy, said in interviews on Monday that Vietnam's offer of zero tariffs was meaningless, because it would not address the deficit in trade where Vietnam sells $15 worth of goods to the US for every $1 it buys.",
      "He accused Vietnam of keeping multiple non-tariff barriers to US imports, and said that one-third of all Vietnamese exports to the US were actually Chinese products, trans-shipped through Vietnam.",
      "The proportion of Vietnamese exports which are being made or trans-shipped there to avoid US tariffs on China is difficult to assess, but detailed trade studies put it at between 7% and 16%, not one-third.",
      "Like Vietnam, the government of Cambodia has appealed to the US to postpone the tariffs while it attempts to negotiate.",
      "The local American Chamber of Commerce has called for the 49% tariffs to be dropped, making the point that the Cambodian garment industry, the country's biggest employer, will be badly affected, but that no tariff level, however high, will see clothing and footwear manufacturing return to the US.",
      "Perhaps the most perverse tariff rate is the 44% applied to Myanmar, a country mired in a civil war, which has no capacity to buy more US goods.",
      "US exports make up only a small proportion of Myanmar's GDP, less than 1%.",
      "But as in Cambodia, that sector, mainly garments, is one of the few that provides a steady income to poor families in Myanmar's cities.",
      "In a supreme irony,  Trump has until now been a popular figure in this region.",
      "He has been widely admired in Vietnam for his tough, transactional approach to foreign policy, and Cambodia's former strongman Hun Sen, still the main power behind the scenes, has long sought a close personal relationship with the US president, proudly posting selfies with him at their first meeting in 2017.",
      "Only last month Cambodia was praising  Trump for shutting down the US media networks Voice of America and Radio Free Europe, which often carried the views of Cambodian dissidents.",

      "Musk - who is also a member of the Trump administration - said Navarro was \"dumber than a sack of bricks\" in posts on his social media platform X.",
      "It was in response to an interview Navarro gave in which he criticised Musk. \"[He's] not a car manufacturer. He's a car assembler, in many cases,\" Navarro said.",
      "Navarro was being interviewed about Trump's sweeping tariff policy and said he wanted to see parts made in the US in the future instead.",
      "Musk, who has hinted at his opposition to White House trade policy, said Navarro's claims about Tesla were \"demonstrably false\".",

      "Later on Tuesday, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt was asked about the row between Musk and Navarro. \"These are obviously two individuals who have very different views on trade and on tariffs,\" she told reporters.",
      "\"Boys will be boys, and we will let their public sparring continue,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Trump has in part justified his global wave of tariffs by saying he wants to revive manufacturing in the US. This is an argument Navarro made during an appearance on CNBC on Monday.",
      "\"If you look at our auto industry, right, we're an assembly line for German engines and transmissions right now,\" he said.",
      "\"We're going to get to a place where America makes stuff again, real wages are going to be up, profits are going to be up,\" Navarro added.",
      "Responding to the comments on Tuesday, Musk posted a link to a 2023 article by car valuation firm Kelley Blue Book, which cited Cars.com findings that Tesla vehicles had the most parts produced in the US.",
      "\"By any definition whatsoever, Tesla is the most vertically integrated auto manufacturer in America with the highest percentage of US content,\" Musk wrote in a follow-up post.",
      "Technology industry analyst Dan Ives said the company was less exposed to tariffs than other US car makers such as GM, Ford, and Stellantis.",
      "But he too claimed the company sourced the majority of its parts from outside the US, particularly China.",
      "\"The tariffs in their current form will disrupt Tesla, the overall supply chain, and its global footprint which has been a clear advantage over the years vs. rising competitors like BYD,\" he said.",

      "\"Seventy-nine percent of them said they're embarrassed in front of international partners, and 89 percent said this is needlessly taking us into a recession and a misguided economic policy,\" Mr Sonnenfeld told the BBC, referring to a survey taken at the event he hosted.",
      "Even before the row with Navarro, Musk had hinted at his dissatisfaction with the tariff policy.",
      "On Monday, he posted a video of the economist Milton Friedman, a noted opponent of tariffs, in which he extolls the values of the free market.",
      "Trump's tariffs have caused stock market falls around the world, as investors calculate it will result in firms making smaller profits.",

    "story": [
      "It sounds like something from a science fiction movie, but Stephen Eisele is confident that one day his company will open a data centre on the Moon.",
      "\"The way we see it is that by putting the data centre in space, you're really offering unparalleled security,\" says the president of Lonestar Data Holdings.",
      "Last month, the Florida-based firm claimed to have successfully tested a tiny data centre the size of a hardback book that hitched a ride to the Moon on the Athena Lunar Lander from US space exploration firm Intuitive Machines. This, in turn, had been launched by a rocket from Elon Musk's SpaceX.",
      "Data centres are the vast warehouses that house stacks of computers that store and process data used by websites, companies and governments.",
      "Lonestar says that putting them on the Moon will offer customers secure, reliable data processing, while taking advantage of unlimited solar energy to power them.",
      "The environmental campaigners fighting against data centres",
      "Data centre power use 'to surge six-fold in 10 years'",
      "Concern UK's AI ambitions could lead to water shortages",
      "And while space-based data centres may sound far-fetched, it's an idea that's really starting to take off.",
      "Part of the reason is rocketing demand and the difficulty of finding suitable sites on Earth.",
      "The ever-expanding use of artificial intelligence (AI) computing has seen a massive increase in the amount of data that needs to be stored and processed around the world.",
      "As a result, the need for data centres has shot up too, with annual demand set to rise between 19% and 22% by 2030, according to global management consultants McKinsey.",
      "New facilities are springing up all the time - but it's getting hard to find places to put them. Data centres are large and sprawling, and use enormous amounts of power and water for cooling.",
      "And increasingly local people don't want them built nearby.",
      "Putting data centres in space \u2013 either in orbit around Earth, or on the Moon - the theory goes, means they can't do quite so much harm. There's more-or-less unlimited energy available from the sun, for example, and no neighbours to complain about the environmental impacts.",
      "Not only that, space-based data centres could specialise in services for spacecraft and other space facilities, with space-to-space data transfers quicker than from the ground.",
      "Last summer, a European Commission-funded feasibility study into orbiting data centres published its results.",
      "The Ascend report by carried out by Thales Alenia Space - a joint venture between French and Italian aerospace groups Thales and Leonardo - published its results.",
      "It determined that deploying data centres in space \"could transform the European digital landscape\", and be \"more eco-friendly\".",
      "Thales Alenia Space envisages building a constellation of 13 satellites measuring  a combined 200m-by-80m, and with a total data processing power of around 10 megawatts (MW). That's equivalent to a current medium-sized, ground-based data centre, with some 5,000 servers.",
      "Based on technologies that already exist or are under development, the satellites would be assembled in orbit.",
      "Damien Dumestier, Ascend project architect at Thales Alenia Space, says that for space-based data centres to be more environmentally friendly than existing ground-based ones it will be necessary to make the rocket launchers 10 times less emissive over their lifecycles. He says this looks possible.",
      "\"But in order to cover the new technology's developments and the production capacity ramp-up to benefit from scale, we have to consider larger system capacity, around 200MW, meaning 200 of our envisaged large space infrastructures and 200 launches,\" he says.",
      "\"The main question is when an adapted launcher will be ready. Depending on the investment and decisions to be taken, this could be done for 2030 or 2035, meaning commercial viability before 2037.\"",
      "However, despite this optimism from firms aiming to develop the technology, Dr Domenico Vicinanza, associate professor of intelligent systems and data science at Anglia Ruskin University in the UK, says there are numerous big hurdles before space-based data centres can be a viable proposition.",
      "\"Even with the contribution and advancements of companies like SpaceX, launching hardware into orbit remains extremely expensive,\" he says. \"Each kilogram sent into space costs thousands of dollars.",
      "\"Space-based data centres would require not only the data equipment but also the infrastructure to protect, power, and cool them. All of which add up in weight and complexity.\"",
      "Cooling the equipment will be a particular problem,  because even though space is cold, conventional cooling systems don't work well without gravity.",
      "Meanwhile, space weather can damage electronics, while the ever-increasing quantity of space debris puts the physical hardware at risk.",
      "Dr Vicinanza adds: \"And fixing problems in orbit is far from straightforward. Even with robotics and automation, there are limits to what can be repaired remotely.",
      "\"A big hardware failure might necessitate a costly human mission, potentially making downtime stretch for weeks or months.\"",
      "Yet firms like Lonestar are supremely confident, and say that they are responding to demand. \"We wouldn't be doing this if the customers weren't asking us to,\" says Mr Scott.",
      "Its next target is to put a small data centre in orbit around the moon in 2027. Meanwhile, other companies are hoping to get there a bit faster, such as Washington state-based Starcloud, which is due to launch a satellite-based data centre next month, and start commercial operations in mid-2026.",
      "Lonestar's Mr Eidele says that space-based facilities offer more security for governments and businesses because their data does not need to be routed through terrestrial networks. Instead the information can be beamed directly from space to a dedicated ground station.",
      "\"It's like having the vaults at the back of the bank,\" he says. \"You don't have to open it every day, but it's there to provide an extra measure of security, and the distance from the Earth to the moon offers that - it's that much harder to hack, that much harder to access.\"",
      "The distance to the Moon means that data takes about a second and a half to reach the ground - this doesn't matter for some applications, like longer-term data storage and backups.",
      "And meanwhile, says Lonestar founder and chief executive Chris Stott, space-based data centres can help organisations meet regulations about data sovereignty - the need to hold peoples' data in the country of origin.",
      "\"Under space law, that box of electronics is literally under the law of the licensing or launching state - it is an actual embassy in space,\" he says.",

    "summary": "What impact will the introduction of hefty tariffs on countries in Asia have on Nike's iconic US trainer?",
    "story": [
      "The Nike Air Jordan 1 is, in some ways, the iconic US trainer. It's a popular line by a large American brand, created four decades ago for homegrown basketball legend Michael Jordan.",
      "But although Nike sells most of its products in the US, almost all of its trainers are made in Asia \u2013 a region targeted by President Donald Trump's tariffs salvo against foreign countries he accuses of \"ripping off\" Americans.",
      "Nike's shares fell 14% the day after the tariffs announcement, on fears over the impact they could have on the company's supply chain.",
      "Follow live updates",
      "So what will all this mean for the price of Nike's trainer?",
      "It depends on how much of the cost increase Nike decides to pass on to customers, if any, and how long they think the tariffs will actually be in place for.",
      "'Competitive industry'",
      "Goods from Vietnam, Indonesia and China face some of the heaviest US import taxes - between 32% to 54%.",
      "Hopes remain that Trump might be willing to negotiate those rates lower. On Friday, he said he had had a \"very productive\" call with the leader of Vietnam, helping Nike shares to recover some ground after their steep Thursday falls.",
      "But most analysts think the firm's prices will have to go up.",
      "Swiss bank UBS estimates that there will be a 10% to 12% increase in the prices of goods that come from Vietnam - where Nike produces half of its shoes.",
      "Meanwhile, Indonesia and China account for almost all of the balance of its trainer production.",
      "\"Our view is that, given how extensive the list of tariffs is, the industry will realise there are few ways to mitigate the impact in the medium term other than by raising prices,\" UBS analyst Jay Sole said in a note.",
      "David Swartz, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, agrees that price rises are likely but says any large price increase would reduce demand.",
      "\"This is a very competitive industry. My guess is that it would be difficult for Nike to raise prices by much more than 10-15%. I don't think it could offset most of the tariff,\" he says.",
      "Many other western brands such as H&M, Adidas, Gap and Lululemon will be facing the same predicament.",
      "Nike is already facing a tight bottom line.",
      "It had around $51bn (\u00a339.6bn) in sales in its most recent fiscal year. The cost of making products, including shipping, third-party profits and warehouse fees, consumed only about 55% of revenue, giving it a healthy gross profit margin of more than 40%.",
      "But that profit gets whittled away once you add in the cost of other business operations. A third of its revenue, for example, is consumed by selling and administrative expense.",
      "By the time you factor in interest and taxes, Nike's profit margin has shrunk to about 11%.",
      "That is across all its products, as they don't break down costs separately for its different items.",
      "Rahul Cee, who set up the trainer review website Sole Review, says there are other ways Nike could keep retail prices low.",
      "Mr Cee, who trained as a footwear designer and worked for Nike and Vans in India, says one way could be to downgrade the level of tech in the trainer.",
      "\"So instead of using high-performance midsole foams and construction, stick to injection moulded EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate),\" he says.",
      "Another option would be instead of bringing out a new design every one to two years, to refresh the design cycle every three to four years.",
      "Things could change fast",
      "Simeon Siegel, managing director at BMO Capital Markets, says most companies were looking at Wednesday's announcement as \"still far from the final conclusion\".",
      "\"I don't think that many people believe that those numbers are etched in stone just yet,\" he says.",
      "Theoretically, Nike is such a big brand that it should be able to put up prices without it hitting their sales, he says, but adds: \"Do they have it right now is the question and do they have it across their product offering is another?\"",
      "Even before the announcement, Nike was facing a slump in sales that had curbed its ability to command full price for its shoes.",
      "Finance chief Matthew Friend has also cited tariffs as an example of developments that were affecting consumer confidence.",
      "And Nike relies heavily on US sales, with the market contributing to roughly $21.5bn of its sales - almost everything it sells in its largest market of North America.",
      "Sentiment in the US is a \"significant concern\" for Nike as it directly affects demand for its footwear, says Sheng Lu, a professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware.",
      "China and US are at each other's throats on tariffs, and neither is backing down",
      "How does it affect me if share prices fall?",
      "Nintendo pulls Switch 2 pre-orders in US over Trump tariffs",
      "But ultimately he says firms may be forced to pass the cost of the levies on to consumers.",
      "\"Nike is very likely to raise prices if the tariff war persists. There is no way for brands to absorb a 30% to 50% increase in sourcing costs.\"",
      "He adds: \"How US trading partners react against the reciprocal tariff policy will also have a major impact.\"",
      "China has already hit back with a 34% tariff of its own.",
      "Part of the rationale behind Trump's tariff policy is because he wants more companies to manufacture their goods in the US.",
      "However, Prof Lu does not see Nike, or other companies, significantly reshaping its supply chain any time soon \"due to the complexity involved in footwear manufacturing\".",
      "That includes the time needed to \"consider a long list of factors when deciding where to source their products - quality, costs, speed to market and various social and environmental compliance risks\".",
      "Matt Powers from the Powers Advisory Group says the lack of American textile mills will make it \"difficult and expensive [for Nike] to pivot production back to the US\".",
      "Mr Powers added: \"This transition, if pursued, would take years and require significant investment.\"",
      "Nike did not respond to BBC requests for comment for this article.",

      "The economic uncertainty caused by US President Donald Trump's trade tariffs may mean UK interest rates fall further than expected.",

      "What are interest rates and why do they change?",
      "An interest rate tells you how much it costs to borrow money, or the reward for saving it.",
      "The Bank of England's base rate is what it charges other lenders to borrow money.",
      "This influences what lenders then charge their customers for loans such as mortgages, as well as the interest rate they pay on savings accounts.",

      "It has a target to keep inflation at 2%.",

      "The idea is to encourage people to spend less and reduce demand.",
      "Once inflation is at or near the target, the Bank may hold rates, or cut them.",
      "What has happened to UK interest rates and will they go down further?",
      "It is difficult to predict exactly what will happen to interest rates. The Bank has to consider whether inflation remains at or below its target, and how the UK economy is doing more generally.",
      "It also pays close attention to the performance of the global economy, which has been thrown into chaos by US tariffs.",
      "The main inflation measure, CPI, was 2.8% in the 12 months to February 2025, down slightly from the previous month.",
      "Although that is far below the peak of 11.1% reached in October 2022, it remains above the 2% target.",
      "After many months of keeping interest rates at a 16-year high of 5.25%, the Bank of England cut them to 5% in August 2024, and again to 4.75% in November. Rates fell again to 4.5% in February, where they stayed in March.",
      "When the Bank cut rates in February, it also cut its growth forecast for the UK economy in 2025.",
      "It said it expected the UK to only narrowly avoid falling into recession - where the economy shrinks for two three-month periods in a row - and predicted that inflation would rise towards 4% later in 2025.",
      "Announcing the decision to hold rates in March, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned about global economic uncertainty but said that he still believed interest rates were on a \"gradually declining path\".",
      "The Bank was concerned about the possible impacts of increases to the amount of National Insurance paid by employers and the minimum wage, both of which took effect at the start of April.",
      "There are growing fears that the US tariffs could spark a full-blown international trade war, push up prices and fuel inflation around the world - including in the UK.",
      "If that happens and the economy suffers, the Bank may may feel it has to cut rates further than it had planned to do at the start of the year.",
      "Most economists were already expecting a rate cut in May, and now many expect four this year, which would take rates down to 3.5% or below.",

      "The height of this wall needs to be put in historical context. It takes the US back a century in terms of protectionism. It catapults the US way above the G7 and G20 nations into levels of customs revenue, associated with Senegal, Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan.",
      "What occurred this week was not just the US starting a global trade war, or sparking a rout in stock markets. It was the world's hyper power firmly turning its back on the globalisation process it had championed, and from which it handsomely profited in recent decades.",
      "And in so doing, using the equation that underpinned his grand tariff reveal on the Rose Garden's lawns, the White House also turned its back on some fundamentals of both conventional economics and diplomacy.",
      "The great free trade debate",
      "Trump talked a lot about 1913 in his announcement. This was a turning point when the US both created federal income tax and significantly lowered its tariffs.",
      "Before this point, from its inception, the US government was funded mainly by tariffs, and was unapologetically protectionist, based on the strategy of its first Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton.",
      "The basic lesson the White House has taken from this is that high tariffs made America, made it \"great\" the first time, and also meant that there was no need for a federal income tax.",
      "On this side of the Atlantic, underpinning globalisation and free trade are the theories of 19th-Century British economist David Ricardo. In particular, the 1817 Theory of Comparative Advantage.",
      "There are equations, but the basics are pretty easy to understand: Individual countries are good at making different things, based on their own natural resources and the ingenuity of their populations.",
      "Broadly speaking, the whole world, and the countries within it, are better off, if everyone specialises in what they are best at, and then trades freely.",
      "Here in Britain this remains a cornerstone of the junction between politics and economics. Most of the world still believes in comparative advantage. It is the intellectual core of globalisation.",
      "But the US was never a full convert at the time. The underlying reluctance of the US never disappeared. And this week's manifestation of that was the imaginative equation created by the US Trade Representative to generate the numbers on Trump's big board.",
      "The rationale behind 'reciprocal' tariffs",
      "It is worth unpacking the rationale for these so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs. The numbers bear little resemblance to the published tariff rates in those countries.",
      "The White House said adjustments had been made to account for red tape and currency manipulation. A closer look at the, at-first, complicated looking equation revealed it was simply a measure of the size of that country's goods trade surplus with the US. They took the size of the trade deficit and divided it by the imports.",
      "In the hour before the press conference a senior White House official explained it quite openly. \"These tariffs are customised to each country, calculated by the Council of Economic Advisers\u2026 The model they use is based on the concept the trade deficit that we have is the sum of all the unfair trade practices, the sum of all cheating.\"",
      "This is really important. According to the White House, the act of selling more goods to the US than the US sells to you, is by definition \"cheating\" and is deserving of a tariff that is calculated to correct that imbalance.",
      "This is why the surreal stories about the US tariffing rarely visited islands only inhabited by penguins matter. It reveals the actual method.",
      "The long-term aim, and the target of the policy, is to get the US $1.2 trillion trade deficit and the largest country deficits within that down to zero. The equation was simplistically designed to target those countries with surpluses, not those with recognisable quantifiable trade barriers. It targeted poor countries, emerging economies and tiny irrelevant islets based on that data.",
      "While these two different factors overlap, they are not the same thing.",
      "There are many reasons why some countries have surpluses, and some have deficits. There is no inherent reason why these numbers should be zero. Different countries are better at making different products, and have different natural and human resources. This is the very basis of trade.",
      "The US appears no longer to believe in this. Indeed if the same argument was applied solely to trade in services, the US has a $280bn (\u00a3216bn) surplus in areas such as financial services and social media tech.",
      "Yet services trade was excluded from all the White House calculations.",
      "'China shock' and the ripple effect",
      "There is something bigger here. As the US Vice President JD Vance said in a speech last month, globalisation has failed in the eyes of this administration because the idea was that \"rich countries would move further up the value chain, while the poor countries made the simpler things\".",
      "That has not panned out, especially in the case of China, so the US is moving decisively away from this world.",
      "For the US, it is not David Ricardo who matters, it is David Autor, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economist and the coiner of the term \"China shock\".",
      "In 2001, as the world was distracted by the aftermath of 9/11, China joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO), having relatively free access to US markets, and so transforming the global economy.",
      "Living standards, growth, profits and stock markets boomed in the US as China's workforce migrated from the rural fields to the coastal factories to produce exports more cheaply for US consumers. It was a classic example of the functioning of \"comparative advantage\". China generated trillions of dollars, much of which was reinvested in the US, in the form of its government bonds, helping keep interest rates down.",
      "Everyone was a winner. Well, not quite. Essentially US consumers en masse got richer with cheaper goods, but the quid pro quo was a profound loss of manufacturing to East Asia.",
      "Autor's calculation was that by 2011, this \"China shock\" saw the loss of one million US manufacturing jobs, and 2.4 million jobs overall. These hits were geographically concentrated in the Rust Belt and the south.",
      "The trade shock impact on lost jobs and wages was remarkably persistent.",
      "Autor further updated his analysis last year and found that while the Trump administration's first term dabble with tariff protection had little net economic impact, it did loosen Democrat support in affected areas, and boosted support for Trump in the 2020 presidential election.",
      "Marine Le Pen's ban outraged France's far right - and they may well take revenge",
      "The influencers who want the world to have more babies - and say the White House is on their side",
      "Trump has blown up the world order - and left Europe's leaders scrabbling",
      "Fast forward to this week, and the array of union car workers and oil and gas workers celebrating the tariffs in the White House.",
      "So the promise is that these jobs will return, not just to the Rust Belt, but across the US. This is indeed likely to some degree. The president's clear message to foreign companies is to avoid the tariffs by moving your factories. The carrots offered by Biden followed by the stick from Trump could well lead to material progress on this.",
      "But the president's characterisation of the past half century of freer trade as having \"raped and pillaged\" the US obviously doesn't reflect the overall picture, even if it has not worked for specific regions, sectors or demographics.",
      "The US service sector thrived, dominating the world from Wall Street and Silicon Valley. US consumer brands used hyper-efficient supply chains stretching into China and East Asia to make incredible profits selling their aspirational American products everywhere.",
      "The US economy did very well indeed. The problem, simply, was that it was not evenly distributed among sectors. And what the US lacked was levels of redistribution and adaptation to spread that wealth across the country. This reflects America's political choices.",
      "The first social media trade war",
      "Now, as the US chooses to reshore its manufacturing with a sudden jolt of protectionism, other countries also have choices as to whether to support the flows of capital and trade that have made the US rich.",
      "The world's consumers have choices.",
      "It is little wonder major blue chip American companies, which have built cash machines on hyper-efficient East Asian supply chains producing cheaply and then selling to the whole world based on their attractive aspirational brands, have a big problem.",
      "Their share prices are particularly badly affected because the president has both decimated their supply chain strategies, and also risks greatly impairing their brand image amongst global consumers.",
      "Ultimately, this is the first social media trade war. The experience of Tesla's sale slump and Canada's backlash against US goods may prove contagious. That would be as powerful as any counter-tariff.",
      "These countries that bet on being the workshops for US consumers have choices over trade too. New alliances will form and intensify that seek to cut out an erratic US.",
      "The president's sensitivity to this was apparent when he threatened to increase tariffs if the EU and Canada joined forces over retaliation. This would be the nightmare scenario.",
      "In the game theory of trade wars, credibility does matter. The US has unrivalled military and technological might, which helps. But to transform the global trading system using an arbitrary formula, that throws up transparent absurdities, even without the penguins, is likely to encourage the other side to resist.",
      "This is especially the case when the rest of the world thinks that the loaded gun that the president is holding is being aimed at his own foot. The stock market fell most in the US. Inflation will go up most in the US. It is Wall Street now calculating a more-than-evens chance of a recession in the US.",
      "Perhaps there is some substance to the theory that the real objective here is to weaken the dollar and lower US borrowing costs.",
      "For now, the US is checking out of the global trade system it created. It can continue without it. But the transition is going to be very messy indeed.",

    "story": [
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer watched in his flat. Chancellor Rachel Reeves saw it in her study. The Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds, accompanied by staff and pizza, took in President Donald Trump's big tariffs reveal on Wednesday from his office in Old Admiralty Arch, from where the British Navy was directed to protect and control trade on the high seas in days gone by.",
      "Ministers can only dream of having that kind of power now, as the UK watches on in growing horror at the bust-up between the US and China.",
      "\"Sometimes people don't realise they are living through a moment of history,\" a cabinet minister notes, as Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping square up to each other, and stock markets plunge. Trump has slapped a 10% tariff on all nations \u2013 including the UK \u2013 for imports into the US, and much higher rates on some countries, including China, which has responded with fresh tariffs of its own.",
      "So what's happening in Whitehall right now to try to limit the harm to the UK, perhaps by making a deal with the US, and make the most of any opportunities?",
      "Tariffs have shaken the markets - how worried should we be?",
      "China and US are at each other's throats on tariffs, and neither is backing down",
      "The PM is spending another dramatic weekend working the phones from the peace of his country pad, Chequers. So far, the other calls that could really matter, from US negotiators, have not yet resumed.",
      "Trump dangled a possible trade deal that might exempt the UK from some of the costs from tariffs during the pair's chummy White House press conference in February. There have been significant negotiations since then by a team of around 20, led out of No 10 by Michael Ellam, the Treasury and banking veteran, and the PM's business adviser Varun Chandra alongside the business secretary.",
      "Those talks included ideas about the UK watering down rules on electric vehicles, possible changes to a tax on tech companies (\"space to talk about it\", one minister says) and changes to online safety rules (\"not happening\", says a government source).",
      "But as the US government prepared for its announcements on Wednesday, talks about a deal ground to a halt. Now, after the announcement, the \"ball is in their court\", said one government source involved, waiting to hear if, in the chaos of Trump's new tariff world, the White House can find time and energy to push a deal with the UK.",
      "\"We're expecting to hear from them any moment,\" one of those involved hopes. The risk, in the visible turmoil, is that any economic agreement could become a case of: don't call us, we'll call you. We'll be asking Darren Jones, the Treasury Minister, about it when he join us in the studio tomorrow.",
      "If a deal is done, however, do not expect an all-singing all-dancing arrangement. Instead, \"it would be a basic agreement on principles \u2013 rather than a super detailed trade agreement\", says a government source, contrasting these \"quick and dirty\" moves to long-running negotiations with India (\"we're on our 15th chapter with them!\").",
      "Uncertainty around the talks, and the limited nature of what a deal could achieve in any case, means No 10 is \"not sitting here waiting for it \u2013 it's not the basket where all our eggs are\".",
      "For weeks the government told us they were preparing for all kinds of scenarios. A secret cabinet committee was considering how the UK might react if Trump's tariffs materialised.",
      "But now they are here, the actual response is\u2026 not to respond, and to spend four weeks asking businesses if they would like the government to respond later on. That is not just Whitehall dither: at this stage, there seems to be almost zero appetite among ministers to join in with the rounds of tariffs between the US, China, and perhaps the EU in coming days.",
      "One Whitehall figure working with business says \"there has not been a single voice in business, big or small, saying this is the wrong strategy\".",
      "Ministers' approach to get businesses on board, like when Sir Keir invited dozens of big wigs to No 10 the morning after Trump's tariff announcement, is in part because of the anger when the government increased National Insurance contributions. \"The really calm reaction,\" one source says, \"is because we got people into the headspace where tariffs were going to happen \u2013 one of the businesses said they were being borderline stalked, we've been trying to persuade business to trust the process.\"",
      "The government is in no rush, and has no enthusiasm to introduce its own new tariffs, and for now at least, demands on them to do so are muted. According to a minister: \"Most people have considerable numbers of jobs in their constituencies on the line \u2013 even in cabinet there might have been some question marks but there weren't this week.\"",
      "And they joke that the Lib Dems, who are calling for tariffs in retaliation, \"keep demanding a trade war but I don't think they'll lead the nation\". Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who also does not want extra tariffs, will be on tomorrow's show too.",
      "But just as the government is going slow on hitting back, they are cracking heads to crack on with their existing plans faster.",
      "This isn't all about Trump. I understand the chancellor is looking at whether any of the money announced in the government's vital Spending Review can be brought forward from June. If government departments are able to finalise their deals, can that be sorted and made public as soon as possible?",
      "There are discussions too about whether it's possible to speed up the long waited-for Industrial Strategy \u2013 a plan to get investment into the UK pencilled in for June, but could it be brought forward? A decision hasn't been made but the prime minister is again, his team indicate, trying to use the jeopardy around the world as an impetus to push the government machine harder. \"We have to run quickly towards this,\" a government source says \u2013 and the chancellor is looking at it this weekend.",
      "Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.",
      "You might feel, haven't I heard this before? You'd be right. Since the start of the year, the prime minister and the chancellor have both repeatedly said the government has to go faster, work harder. So why after years in opposition weren't Starmer's team ready to go with all of these changes when they got into office? For a government that promised to be radical, its plans have not always been forthcoming.",
      "You may not fancy the kind of radicalism we're seeing out of the White House, but radical it certainly is. To compete, the UK may need to be that too.",
      "It is ludicrous to imagine the PM is \"very happy\" that the UK has been hit with tariffs as Trump suggested \u2013 \"artistic licence\", a government source remarked. No British action can completely insulate our economy from disruption abroad. But the government's own actions do matter, and this could be a defining moment.",
      "While there's been no lack of trying to soften the blows for the UK, the government's hopes have been dashed already. First, ministers believed the UK could escape tariffs, then they said they were prepared in case, then disappointed when they arrived.",

      "Two-year-old Henry is completely transfixed by the iPad in front of him. Every time a smiley face appears he taps the screen - and his tap transforms the face into a cartoon of a dancing animal.",
      "It looks like a simple, repetitive game, but is actually a test of a fundamental skill that is developing in the toddler's growing brain. Henry is wearing a sensor-laden cap with wires emerging from it that are attached to a large piece of analytical machinery. While Henry plays the game, the cap is scanning his brain activity and building up a picture of how well he can control his decision making.",
      "It is a test of inhibitory control, one of the skills scientists at the University of Bristol are measuring in babies and toddlers, as part of a mission to understand how and when very young children develop abilities that enable them to focus and learn.",
      "Scientists already know these skills are critical - but they don't yet know at what point they are established in an infant brain.",
      "The development of hundreds of children - from the age of six months to five years - is being tracked as they form the key skills that will shape their academic and social abilities.",
      "But what is really special about this pioneering project is that it is a human experiment within another decades-long human experiment. The mothers of 300 of the children being studied are themselves part of a project that has monitored their health since they too were babies, in the 1990s.",
      "A lifetime of data is being gathered that could reveal links between the brain development of the children being studied now and the health, experiences and genetics of their parents.",
      "For a study of child development, already having all this rich information about the parents is \"completely unique in the world\", lead researcher Dr Karla Holmboe says.",
      "\"We need to know when different skills develop and we need to understand how individual children develop over time.\"",
      "Children who are struggling when they start school tend to continue to struggle, Dr Holmboe explains.",
      "\"That can even continue into adulthood. So, there's this whole period of development that we need to understand so we can support children at a much younger age.\"",
      "During the study, young participants and their parents are invited to the university psychology lab to play scientific games and have their brain activity measured. Many have MRI scans at the ages of six months, three years and five years, generating a true picture of their young, developing brains.",
      "Key to the smiley face game Henry is playing is where that face appears on the iPad screen. Just as the toddler gets used to the face repeatedly popping up on the right side of his screen, it randomly starts appearing on the other side too.",
      "\"We're seeing if Henry can resist the urge to just keep tapping on the right,\" explains research assistant Carmel Brough, \"and instead look for where the smiley face is.\"",
      "This skill, explains Dr Holmboe, is critical when children start school.",
      "\"In a classroom, a child needs to be able to focus and not let their attention drift,\" she says. \"To learn new things, we need to be able to stop old habits.\"",
      "In another room, Jackson, who is also aged two, is playing a game designed to test his working memory.",
      "A research assistant encourages him to watch as she puts stickers in different pots. The toddler is then asked to recall which pots contain stickers, and which do not. The motivating factor? Jackson can keep all the stickers he finds.",
      "\"Working memory is when we need to keep a little bit of information in our head to solve a problem or do a task - like a puzzle, or even just remembering where we put something two minutes ago,\" explains Dr Holmboe. \"For children, you can imagine we need these skills when we learn maths or learn to read.",

      "The Children of the 90s project is now 35 years old. Focused primarily on health, by tracking 14,500 children born between 1991 and 1992, it has revealed insights into obesity, autism and, more recently, the effect of the pandemic on mental health.",
      "The project's data has been made available to scientists around the world and has been cited in thousands of scientific papers.",
      "One study of the diets of children of the 90s provided evidence that, while a child's fussy eating is often worrying, it is unlikely to have any lasting impact on their health and development.",
      "Thanks to repeated health-screenings that have been key to the project, it also revealed that one in five young people shows signs of fatty liver disease, and one in 40 young people may have liver scarring - caused largely by obesity and alcohol consumption. This has shown just how common the condition is and provided insights into ways it can be prevented through diet.",
      "And the scientific revelations keep on coming. Last month, the study revealed that children who lacked oily fish in their diets were less sociable and kind.",
      "In this latest study \u2013 of the children of the children of the 90s \u2013 scientists are looking specifically at formative abilities and brain development. They will follow each child until they start school.",

      "\"These children are not spending these hours on their phones while sat in school,\" Dame Rachel said in a new report.",
      "She said schools should educate young people about online risks - but parents and carers needed more help to manage their children's online habits and technology companies must \"take responsibility for making the online world safe\".",
      "She added that she would back any head teacher's decision to ban phones, but added: \"It should always be their choice, based on their knowledge of what's best for the children in their own classrooms, not a direction imposed nationally by the government.\"",
      "However, her report also recommended the government should \"conduct more research into the potential benefits of wider restrictions on children's use of phones, particularly social media\".",

      "The latest figures for serious incidents in the year 2023-24 are 40% higher than five years previously.",
      "Ofsted - which inspects England's education providers - says the rise may, in part, be due to its increased efforts to ensure nurseries report such events.",

      "\"I completely lost who I was, that night in hospital, holding her.\"",
      "Nurseries made more than 4,200 reports of serious childcare incidents in 2023-24, the BBC has found, compared with 3,021 in 2019-20 - according to Ofsted figures, obtained through a Freedom of Information request.",
      "Ofsted - which regulates more than 27,000 non-domestic childcare settings in England - says these were reports it had assessed as urgent.",
      "Incidents could range from injuries or illnesses, to serious accidents and deaths. They also include events affecting nursery premises, such as fires or floods.",

      "Until 2015, inspectors would arrive at nurseries unannounced - but only a third of inspections are now carried out this way. Most nurseries are informed the day before.",
      "The notice period is used by some nurseries to deliberately mislead inspectors, some nursery workers told us. Managers ask friends or family to attend, they say, to make a nursery appear fully staffed.",
      "One former worker said 15 babies had been left sleeping in a room with only a baby monitor and no staff members to look after them. But when Ofsted announced an inspection, managers called in staff from other locations.",

    "story": [
      "Indie icons Pulp have announced a new album, More, and shared their first single in almost 24 years, called Spike Island.",
      "Speaking on BBC 6 Music, frontman Jarvis Cocker said the band had been tempted back into the studio by the overwhelming response to their 2023 reunion tour.",
      "\"We did play one new song towards the end of the tour, and nobody threw things at us, or left to go to the bar,\" he said. \"So we just thought we'd carry on and see what we could conjure up.\"",
      "The Sheffield band were one of the biggest acts of the 1990s Britpop era - although their music never quite fit into the backward-looking musical revisionism of that movement - with songs like Babies, Disco 2000 and Common People.",
      "Formed in Sheffield in 1978, they sold more than 10 million records after taking a (very) long road to success.",
      "After 2001's We Love Life, the band went on a decade-long hiatus. They reformed in 2011 for a number of festival dates, including a surprise performance Glastonbury, and reunited again in 2023.",
      "The new single was inspired by the infamous Stone Roses concert at Spike Island, Widnes, in 1990 - a show that has been variously described as a milestone for British indie music, and a disappointing shambles with dodgy sound.",
      "Pulp guitarist Mark Webber told 6 Music's Lauren Laverne the show had been \"a slight anticlimax, to be honest\".",
      "\"I think everyone felt that way,\" he said. \"There was a lot of anticipation but it didn't sound very good, it was very windy and the vibe wasn't there.\"",
      "Cocker said he hadn't been at the show, but had written the lyrics after speaking to various attendees, including musician Jason Buckle, from the band All Seeing I, who co-wrote Pulp's single.",
      "\"All he could remember was a DJ who between every song said, 'Spike Island come alive, Spike Island come alive',\" he said.",
      "\"That phrase stuck with me. I've got a very short attention span I think.\"",
      "Cocker said the track was a sister song to 1995's Sorted for E's and Whizz, which was also based on a fan's experience of the Stone Roses' gig.",
      "The inspiration for that track was \"a girl that I was speaking to at The Leadmill in Sheffield one night,\" he recalled.",
      "\"She said all that she could remember were people going round saying, 'Is everyone sorted for E's and whizz?'. So that phrase stuck in my mind.\"",
      "More will be released on 6 June, and is dedicated to Pulp's former bassist Steve Mackey, who died in 2023, at the age of 56.",
      "Cocker said that recording without the musician was \"weird at first\" but that there were \"two songs on the record which date from when Steve was around\", which made him feel part of the project.",
      "\"It was not the nicest thing,\" the singer continued, \"but people who you're close to, you never forget them, and you can do things to remember them by\".",
      "The album was recorded over three weeks in 2024, and Cocker said there were \"no over-riding themes, except feelings, maybe, which sounds very wafty and not very precise\".",
      "He said the absence of an overarching idea had given the band a sense of freedom, compared to more conceptual Pulp albums such as This Is Hardcore.",
      "\"We [recorded] it quite quickly, and we were trying to not think about it too much, because that's what kind of made the last couple of Pulp albums a bit of a pain,\" he said.",
      "\"It was mainly my fault,\" he added, \"because I'd never got the lyrics together, so I was always changing them and messing around.",
      "\"This time, they were all written before we went into the studio, and I realised it was a lot less stressful.",
      "\"You know, I would always be a bit stressed in the studio, because I knew once the music was done, then I had to write the words. I don't know why I put myself through that,\" he said.",
      "Artificial intelligence video",
      "In a press release announcing the record, Cocker added: \"We hope you enjoy the music. It was written and performed by four human beings from the North of England, aided and abetted by five other human beings from various locations in the British Isles.",
      "\"No AI was involved during the process.\"",
      "However, he did employ artificial intelligence to create the video for Spike Island, which animates the infamous \"cardboard cut-out\" figures who appear on the cover of Pulp's biggest album, Different Class.",
      "\"All the moving images featured in the video are the result of me feeding in a still image and then typing in a 'prompt' such as: 'The black & white figure remains still whilst the bus in the background drives off', which led to [a] sequence where the coach weirdly slides towards the cut-out of me,\" said Cocker.",
      "\"The weekend I began work on the video was a strange time: I went out of the house and kept expecting weird transformations of the surrounding environment due to the images the computer had been generating.",
      "\"The experience had marked me. I don't know whether I've recovered yet.\"",
      "After completing the video, the musician said he'd landed firmly on the side of \"human intelligence\" over AI.",
      "The band will kick off a UK tour the day after the album is released in June but, in response to a 6 Music listener, said they had \"no plans\" to play Glastonbury.",
      "However, the band do have a gap in their diary for the weekend the festival takes place, before resuming their tour in Spain in July.",

    "story": [
      "A share of the revenue streaming services make from subscription fees should be paid into a fund to support British high-end TV production, an influential group of MPs has said.",
      "In a new report, the Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) committee urged the government to improve support measures for producers while safeguarding the creation of distinctly British content.",
      "It follows an inquiry into the UK TV and film industry which examined the effects of the rise of streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon and Apple TV.",
      "The report noted how \"vital\" dramas such as Adolescence are to the country's \"identity, national conversations and talent pipeline\", which they say is now \"under threat\".",
      "It is \"time for streamers to put their money where their mouth is\", the report read, suggesting that streaming companies should pay \"5% of their UK subscriber revenue into a cultural fund to help finance drama with a specific interest to British audiences\".",
      "Chair of the CMS committee, MP Dame Caroline Dinenage, noted how recent \"big box-office blockbusters made in Britain have showcased the UK's world-class film and high-end television industry like never before\".",
      "\"But the boom in inward investment of recent years now risks crowding out our many talented independent British producers,\" she said.",
      "She added: \"While streamers like Netflix and Amazon have proved a valuable addition for the industry and economy, unless the government urgently intervenes to rebalance the playing field, for every Adolescence adding to the national conversation, there will be countless distinctly British stories that never make it to our screens.\"",
      "Adolescence, created by Jack Thorne and Stephen Graham, tells the story of a 13-year-old boy who is charged with killing a female classmate.",
      "This week, it became fourth most popular English-language series in Netflix's history with 114 million views.",
      "A Netflix spokeswoman said: \"The UK is Netflix's biggest production hub outside of North America - and we want it to stay that way.",
      "\"But in an increasingly competitive global market, it's key to create a business environment that incentivises rather than penalises investment, risk taking and success. Levies diminish competitiveness and penalise audiences who ultimately bear the increased costs.\"",
      "The Association for Commercial Broadcasters and On-Demand Services (COBA) said a levy risks damaging streamers' investment in the UK.",
      "Coba executive director Adam Minns said: \"Especially in this economic climate, a levy risks impacting existing content budgets for UK shows, jobs, and growth, along with raising costs for businesses.",
      "\"Ironically, it could actually damage public service broadcaster dramas by reducing co-production budgets at streamers.\"",
      "He added pressure on domestic production stemmed from the real terms decline in the TV licence fee.",
      "A BBC spokesman said the corporation \"continues to invest\" in British content but faced \"significant financial challenges due to pressure on the licence fee and rising industry costs\".",
      "\"It is therefore integral that the BBC and the wider UK creative industries have the support in place to drive growth in the creative economy and support homegrown content and storytelling.\"",
      "The report released on Thursday noted how last year there was a 27% decrease in the number of domestic high-end TV productions made in the UK and a 25% fall in spend.",
      "The calls for greater help come after Wolf Hall director Peter Kosminsky told BBC News last month that the industry was in crisis, and that public service broadcasters including the BBC and ITV could no longer afford to make high-end British drama.",
      "Fair levy or unfair tariff?",
      "The arrival of the streamers into the UK market \"drove up the price of everything\", Kosminsky told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday, to the point where the public service broadcasters \"couldn't afford to make their programs anymore, so we need a new pot of money.\"",
      "He underlined how 17 other countries in Europe have imposed a similar levy \"so that public service broadcasters can stay in the game.\"",
      "Speaking on the same programme, former BBC One controller Peter Fincham replied saying he did not agree.",
      "\"I think this sounds to me a little bit like a tariff - to use a more fashionable word - and indeed a form of protectionism.\"",
      "A spokeswoman for the Department of Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) said: \"We acknowledge the challenges facing our brilliant film and TV industry and are working with it through our industrial strategy to consider what more needs to be done to unlock growth and develop the skills pipeline.",
      "\"We thank the committee for its report which we will respond to in due course.\"",
      "'Support freelancers'",
      "The report also noted while the introduction of tax breaks for independent British films, and for film and TV studios in England may have helped, it was not a \"silver bullet\" for solving many of the issues facing British producers.",
      "As well as providing greater support and resources for UK TV production workforces, it also suggested that lawmakers should consider cutting VAT on cinema tickets as well as doing more to meet the challenges posed by AI.",
      "Commenting on the report, Paul W Fleming, general secretary of Equity, which represents British performers, said the government should \"heed the call\" for the licensing of creative works in all cases where they are used to train artificial intelligence models.",
      "\"AI is being built illegally by stealing Equity members' life's works,\" he said.",
      "Big tech firms \"must be held to account\", he added, \"brought to the table and made to pay creators what they owe.\"",
      "The cross-party committee recommended the government and British Film Institute (BFI) should launch a national awareness campaign, highlighting the employment opportunities offered by film and high-end TV, and \"the range of skills the industry requires\".",
      "It stressed how the industry \"benefits hugely from the flexibility afforded by a predominantly freelance workforce\" and therefore more should be done to \"support freelancers when they are out of work\"; such as the introduction of a minimum hourly wage or guaranteed basic income.",
      "Head of industry union Bectu, Philippa Childs, said: \"We welcome this timely and incisive report from the committee which identifies many of the urgent challenges currently facing the industry and its workforce.\"",

      "For decades, Hockney has been among the world's greatest living artists, and he is now opening his biggest ever show.",
      "As we sit together in a vast gallery at the Louis Vuitton Foundation, a stunning museum designed in reflective glass on the edge of the Bois de Boulogne in Paris, I ask him what he thinks of the exhibition.",
      "He says it's his best ever, and bursts into laughter again.",
      "It's an expression of pure delight at the 11 rooms filled across four floors with his art - and at being alive to see it. \"I'm just laughing, I mean we made it!\"",
      "Two years ago, when they started planning the exhibition, \"I just thought I probably wouldn't be here\", he says. \"I'm still a smoker, a happy smoker fed up of bossy people telling you what to do... but I didn't know.\"",
      "Hockney is sporting a badge that says \"End Bossiness Soon\" in a gallery dedicated to his love of spring. During the pandemic in 2020, Hockney, who was living in Normandy, used his iPad to paint the trees and flowers blooming as spring arrived.",
      "Those 220 iPad works adorn this gallery, floor to ceiling, the walls bursting with blossom and pure joy, made at a time when the world wasn't feeling very hopeful.",
      "Visitors to the show are greeted at the entrance by Hockney's message from that time: \"Do remember they can't cancel the spring.\"",
      "Hockney has been in poor health. He now has two full-time carers, who have accompanied him to Paris from London, where he now lives. Portraits of both, sitting in their dark blue nurses' uniforms, are the most recent works in the exhibition, made earlier this year.",
      "A self-portrait of Hockney, painting and smoking a cigarette (his two great loves) is also very new.",
      "He still paints for four to six hours every day, he tells me.",
      "He believes you can't judge a painter until their last work is done - but looking at his own work gathered together in Paris, \"I can see what I was always trying to do, really\".",
      "And he promises that \"anybody who has just a little visual sensibility will really enjoy this show\".",
      "His great-nephew Richard Hockney, who has regularly sat for him for 28 years, since he was four years old, including for this exhibition, tells me everyone was determined the artist would make it to Paris.",
      "The night before, Hockney got into a car with his dachshund Tess to be driven across the Channel. And on the morning before they left, they were playing him variations of the jazz classic April in Paris.",
      "Having arrived, \"he is glowing\", Richard says. \"I think this will keep him going for a long, long time, to be honest.\"",
      "And with spring unfolding in the French capital, it's entirely appropriate that the artist known for chronicling spring would open his exhibition, David Hockney 25, now.",
      "This is a man who would fly back from his home in Los Angeles when he heard the hawthorn had begun to blossom in his native Yorkshire, just so he could paint the dazzling spectacle.",
      "Some of his earliest works, including probably his most famous, A Bigger Splash, are also on show in Paris.",
      "That painting, capturing the moment of a swimmer diving into a Santa Monica pool, is on the wall next to Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures), the south of France pool painting that broke records when it sold at auction in 2018 for \u00a370m.",
      "Next to those are Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy, another of Hockney's most recognisable works, which depicts his good friend Celia Birtwell and her husband Ossie Clark, with their white cat on his knee.  Seeing them brought together in one room is spectacular.",
      "But the show's main focus is the last 25 years because \"it's 2025\", he says. \"People think it's miserable, but in 1925 they'd had the First World War.\"",
      "It's a visual feast, full of the bright colours and optimism for which Hockney has become known.",
      "\"I've always had it. I've always thought it was an absurd world.\"",
      "A world to laugh at, to look at closely, as Hockney does, and to paint vibrantly.",
      "Some of the iPad paintings are huge. He's \"amazed they could be blown up so big\" when they were created on something so small.",
      "One room is almost pitch dark to show off paintings he did of the Moon, made possible by advances in iPad technology.",
      "There's also a floor devoted to his portraits (about 60), including a 2022 painting of singer Harry Styles in a striped cardigan with a set of pearls around his neck.",
      "But the rest are the friends and family Hockney knows well - Birtwell, her children and grandchildren, the show's curator Sir Norman Rosenthal wearing full regalia, Hockney's partner JP, sometimes with Tess the dog - and two of Richard.",
      "Even though they're related, when he's having a portrait done \"it's very surreal looking at him and then realising you're being painted by David Hockney\", he tells me. \"You know he's always going to create a masterpiece.\"",
      "His great uncle chooses to paint people he loves because \"he sees the truer representation of yourself than you do\". In one of the portraits, Richard is grinning, in a green and white striped T-shirt.",
      "Because Hockney likes Richard's cheeky grin, \"he will sit there and grin at me because he knows it's going to make me grin... after six hours, it aches a bit\".",
      "King Charles went to visit Hockney at home in London before he travelled. \"He's a very nice man, thoughtful, I thought,\" the artist says. \"He does watercolours himself.\"",
      "But he doesn't fancy painting the King. \"The problem there is the majesty, isn't it really? I would find that a bit difficult, I think.\"",
      "He does, though, have a work on the go, a new painting of his great-nephew.",
      "Richard tells me Hockney \"says he's still got a lot of work to do, which is good\", adding: \"As long as that's in his head, then he'll keep going.\"",
      "The artist says he'll finish his painting of his great nephew and then \"I will paint somebody else. And I just carry on.\"",

    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump says he will soon announce \"major\" tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals, a move that could end decades of low-cost global trade in medicines.",
      "For years, most countries, including the US, have imposed few or no tariffs on finished drugs, thanks in part to a 1995 World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreement aimed at keeping medicines affordable.",
      "This shift comes after Trump introduced a blanket 10% tariff on other imports last week, as part of a broader effort to bring manufacturing back to the US.",
      "His new \"reciprocal\" tariffs - including a duty of 104% on goods arriving from China - came into force on Wednesday, intensifying a global trade war and further shaking markets.",
      "Pharmaceutical buyers, so far spared from such measures, are now preparing for what may come next.",
      "The US has typically imported vast quantities of finished medicines from India, Europe and China without buyers paying tariffs - although active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), used to make drugs, do face some duties.",
      "Speaking at a fundraiser dinner for his Republican Party on Tuesday, Trump said: \"We're going to be announcing very shortly a major tariff on pharmaceuticals. And when they hear that, they will leave China.\"",
      "He also told reporters on board his Air Force One plane last week that \"pharma\" tariffs would arrive \"at a level that you haven't really seen before\", saying these would be announced \"in the near future\".",
      "In 2024, the US imported $213bn (\u00a3168bn) worth of medicines - more than two and a half times the total a decade earlier.",

      "Indian drugmakers warn that tariffs would force them to raise prices, which could ultimately drive up US medical bills. While firms like Cipla and Dr Reddy's have US plants, most say moving production is not viable for low-margin generic drugs.",
      "European drugmakers are also on alert. After a high-level meeting between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and top pharma firms on Tuesday, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) warned that tariffs could shift production away from Europe, and to the US.",
      "The EFPIA, whose members include major pharmaceutical companies such as Bayer, Novartis, and Novo Nordisk - the maker of the star diabetes type 2 drug Ozempic - expressed concerns that rising tariffs could disrupt Europe's role as a key player in global pharmaceutical production.",
      "In 2024, pharmaceuticals were the EU's largest export to the US, worth a reported $127bn (\u00a3100bn).",
      "Major companies have urged the EU to act swiftly, seeking policy changes to enhance Europe's competitiveness and prevent a \"mass exodus\" to the US. They have also expressed concerns about potential EU retaliatory tariffs, which could disrupt supply chains and affect patients on both sides of the Atlantic.",

      "A \"miracle\" baby girl has become the first child in the UK to be born to a mother using a donated womb.",
      "The baby's mum, Grace Davidson, 36, was born without a functioning uterus, and received her sister's womb in 2023 \u2013 in what was then the UK's only successful womb transplant.",
      "Two years after that pioneering operation, Grace gave birth to her first child in February. She and her husband, Angus, 37, have named their daughter Amy after Grace's sister, who donated her womb.",
      "Holding baby Amy - who weighed just over two kilos (four and a half pounds) - for the first time was \"incredible\" and \"surreal\", new mum Grace says.",
      "\"It was quite overwhelming because we'd never really let ourselves imagine what it would be like for her to be here,\" she says. \"It was really wonderful.\"",
      "Grace and Angus, who live in north London but are originally from Scotland, hope to have a second child using the transplanted womb.",
      "The couple initially wished to remain anonymous, but following the safe arrival of baby Amy are now speaking to the BBC about their \"little miracle\".",
      "The surgical team told the BBC they have carried out three further womb transplants using deceased donors since Grace's transplant. They aim to carry out a total of 15 as part of a clinical trial.",
      "Grace was born with a rare condition, Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, where the womb is missing or underdeveloped, but with functioning ovaries. When the BBC first spoke to her in 2018, she was hoping her mother could donate her uterus to allow her to have children - but it proved to be unsuitable.",
      "The BBC met Grace and husband Angus again in 2019 when one of Grace's two sisters, Amy Purdie, was being assessed to find out if she could donate her womb to Grace. Amy and her husband already had two children and did not want any more.",
      "Prior to surgery both sisters had counselling. Grace and Angus also had fertility treatment and still have several embryos in storage. Grace says she was given the option of surrogacy or adoption, but carrying her own baby felt \"really important\".",
      "\"I have always had a mothering instinct,\" she says, \"but for years I had been suppressing it because it was too painful to go there.\"",
      "Womb transplants: how do they work?",
      "The first baby born as a result of a womb transplant was in Sweden in 2014. Since then around 135 such transplants have been carried out in more than a dozen countries, including the US, China, France, Germany, India and Turkey. Around 65 babies have been born.",
      "Originally scheduled to take place in late 2019, the sisters' transplant operation fell through and then looked in doubt for several years during the Covid pandemic.",
      "When it eventually took place, in February 2023, it took a team of more than 30 medics around 17 hours to remove Amy's womb and transplant it to Grace.",
      "Isabel Quiroga, the surgeon who led the transplant team at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford, says although the procedure carried risks for both sisters, it was \"life-enhancing and life-creating - and you can't have better than that.\"",
      "Amy says she did not feel the sense of loss some women experience after a hysterectomy, because of the \"dramatic\" and immediate benefits to her sister. Grace had her first ever period within two weeks of the transplant and became pregnant on the first attempt at IVF.",
      "It was \"incredible\" to feel her baby's first kick, she says, adding the entire pregnancy had been \"really special\".",
      "Baby Amy was born by Caesarean section at Queen Charlotte's hospital in west London on 27 February.",
      "\"It was an incredible moment, full of joy,\" says surgeon Isabel Quiroga.",
      "Grace and Angus say they hope to have a second child - as soon as the medical team say the time is right.",
      "The donated womb will be removed after the birth of a second child. This will allow Grace to stop taking the daily immunosuppressants she is currently on to ensure her body does not reject her sister's womb. Taking these drugs can increase the risks of developing some cancers, especially if taken over many years - but surgeon Isabel Quiroga says these risks should return to baseline once the womb is removed.",
      "Prof Richard Smith, a gynaecological surgeon at Imperial College Healthcare, who led the organ retrieval team, has been researching womb transplantation for more than two decades.",
      "He says his team is thrilled about the birth of baby Amy.",
      "\"I'm not often short of words but when the baby came out I was speechless - there were a lot of tears in the theatre that day.",
      "\"The whole thing is astonishing and incredibly moving,\" Prof Smith adds.",
      "He says Amy's birth will give hope to many of the 15,000 women in the UK of childbearing age who do not have a functioning uterus, of whom around 5,000 were born without a womb.",
      "Mr Smith heads a charity called Womb Transplant UK, which paid the NHS costs for Grace's transplant operation. All the medical staff gave their time for free.",
      "He told the BBC around 10 women have embryos in storage or are undergoing fertility treatment, a requirement for being considered for womb transplantation. Each transplant costs around \u00a330,000, he says, and the charity has sufficient funds to do two more.",
      "The surgical team has permission to perform 15 womb transplants as part of a clinical trial, five with living and 10 with deceased donors. No details have been made public about the three women who have so far received wombs from deceased donor organs. NHS Blood and Transplant told the BBC extra consent is sought from families for such rare donations.",
      "Baby Amy's father, Angus, says he and Grace will never be able to thank his wife's sister enough for enabling them to become parents. It was an \"absolute no brainer\" that they would name Amy after her aunt, Angus says.",
      "The baby's middle name is Isabel, after the surgeon who led the womb transplantation team.",
      "For Grace, having baby Amy has brought her even closer to her sister.",

    "story": [
      "Listen to this article on BBC Sounds",
      "Ministers, health staff and the public gathered in London last week for a summit to discuss the 10-year NHS plan in England. It was the final roadshow in a nationwide tour to help set out the strategy the government says will rescue the \"broken\" NHS, which has a waiting list of nearly 7.5 million patients and public satisfaction of just 21% - a record low.",
      "Not for the first time, moving healthcare away from hospitals and into the community is being touted as a way of treating people better and for less. Research suggests that every \u00a3100 spent on community care would otherwise cost \u00a3131 for hospital care.",
      "This helps explain why Health Secretary Wes Streeting has promised to turn the NHS into a neighbourhood health service.",
      "Washwood Heath, a community health clinic that was set up in a deprived part of east Birmingham two years ago when the Conservative government was in power, is a living, working example of what this could look like. Here, hospital doctors, GPs, nurses, occupational therapists, council social care teams, mental health professionals and charity staff work under one roof.",
      "The three-storey building combines an urgent treatment centre offering some of the services usually provided by hospitals, as well as a diagnostic service (for MRI scans, X rays and ultrasounds), alongside mental health care and wider social support.",
      "In practice, this allows for addressing social problems such as housing issues, alongside treating physical health conditions, plus arranging support for daily tasks such as washing and dressing.",
      "The target is the most frequent users of health services - and the aim is to keep them well and out of hospital.",
      "\"We want to work with the 10% of the population that is responsible for 70 to 80% of its use,\" explains Richard Kirby, head of Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust, one of the key partners at Washwood Heath. \"The NHS cannot meet their needs on its own \u2013 it requires partnership working.\"",
      "Streeting himself is on board. Speaking to the BBC this week, he said that Washwood was a \"pioneering service\" and he is firm that the model could \"be the future of the NHS\".",
      "However not everyone is convinced. And while few argue against the principle of more care within the community, there are wider questions around just how feasible it is on a bigger scale.",
      "A model system to unblock beds?",
      "In the middle of the clinic, staff gather around five touchscreens, each containing up-to-date information about patients from east Birmingham who are in hospital or making calls to the ambulance service. Their goal is to get these patients discharged from hospital as swiftly as they can - and keep them out.",
      "One way of doing this is by arranging remote monitoring from the 'virtual wards team' (which allows doctors to keep an eye on patients who would otherwise have to stay on the wards), as well as ordering equipment such as mobility aids and medicine dispensers to be delivered to their homes.",
      "The team is also automatically alerted if a patient registered at the clinic calls for an ambulance or is admitted to hospital. There is a live link to the local Heartlands Hospital, where the clinic's own team of therapists and paramedics see patients face-to-face on the wards and liaise with hospital staff to try to get them home.",
      "\"Our job is to identify which patients will benefit from our help,\" says nurse Dani Fullerton. \"It's so different from anything I have done before.\"",
      "Tackling loneliness to save money",
      "One issue the neighbourhood teams are homing in on is loneliness - they have identified this as a way to keep down hospital numbers.",
      "Government commissioned research published in 2020 suggests the cost of severe loneliness to be more than \u00a39,500 for each person in that category, due to the combined impact on wellbeing, health, and work productivity.",
      "So, at the centre, local neighbourhood teams plan intense support for the most vulnerable residents, knitting together not just what the NHS and council provide, but what charities can offer too.",
      "\"We have patients going to GPs and A&E basically because they are lonely,\" says Christine Francis, who is employed as a 'social prescriber'. Her job is to help find new activities and groups for the lonely and then accompany them until they are settled.",
      "\"The NHS cannot solve [loneliness]. But I can link patients in with befriending services or, if they can get out and about, local groups such as knitting groups or organised walks.\"",
      "Ms Francis also works with groups who can help with house cleaning and tackle other issues associated with poor mental health, such as hoarding.",
      "At present some doubt there is enough robust evidence from the research to show the effectiveness of social prescribing. The neighbourhood team is adamant their approach is making a difference, however, based on what they've seen first-hand.",
      "Hamzisah Aslam, an occupational therapist at Birmingham Council, recalls visiting one patient with health and alcohol problems, whose home was littered with cardboard boxes and rubbish. The visit, also attended by a GP, mental health professional and social prescriber, lasted more than an hour.",
      "\"Afterwards, we had a five-minute debrief and drew up a plan and it was actioned the next day - you would never be able to do that if we were all working individually.\"",
      "Some GPs I spoke to have also observed a positive impact. Dr Subeena Suleman says the neighbourhood team worked with two patients from her practice who were frequent visitors because of their range of health and social issues. An estimated 100 appointments at the GP surgery were freed up over six months.",
      "\"It meant we had more time for other patients,\" says Dr Suleman. \"We even started offering longer appointments of up to 30 minutes for those that need it.\"",
      "In the first 12 months since Washwood Heath began operating, GP visits among the local population supported by the centre fell by 31%, A&E attendances by 20% and admissions to hospital by 21%.",
      "However, there is not yet robust evidence to quantify how much more efficient the new model would be if expanded across the city.",
      "The knock-on effect for hospitals",
      "The most recent addition to the centre is an emergency service for patients with respiratory illness that opened in December to address the fact that around 40% of admissions to the nearby Heartlands Hospital related to lung and breathing conditions.",
      "So far the service, which is staffed by UHB respiratory specialist nurses and doctors, has taken in 670 patients. Christopher Thomas is one of them. He used to be a builder and worked with asbestos. Now 77, he has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which he believes has links to his job.",
      "Recently, he went to hospital after coughing up blood, and was told he had pneumonia - but rather than being kept in hospital, he was discharged into the care of Washwood clinic's respiratory service.",
      "This, he says, worked far better for him. \"I was able to stay at home to rest and take my medications and I can just ring the team at Washwood if I have any concerns.\"",
      "Respiratory medicine consultant Dr Rifat Rashid is also positive. \"Here we can see and test patients quickly \u2013 there are not the delays we have in hospital waiting for results.\"",
      "But there are broader benefits for the hospital too in her view - she says GPs are starting to refer their patients directly to Washwood Heath and ambulances are also now bringing patients to the centre rather than the hospital.",
      "Despite the benefits of fewer admissions, ultimately hospitals are no less full - while fewer people in the Washwood area are being admitted, patients from elsewhere have filled the beds.",
      "The model is being expanded across the city - the aim is to have a network of six community hubs and 25 to 30 integrated neighbourhood teams, covering Birmingham's population of 1.4 million people.",
      "Not every centre will be identical. For example, in the north of the city, there might be a focus on helping with frailty to support the older, more affluent population demographic.",
      "There are of course costs - these are estimated at less than \u00a3100,000 as the six hubs as the centres will use existing buildings and redeployed staff.",
      "Richard Kirby thinks the model could easily be replicated nationwide. \"We believe this is the right model,\" he insists.",
      "But there is a catch. As he puts it, \"It only works when the whole system buys into it.\"",
      "Tight budgets and a 'cynical' sector",
      "Part of the problem with making the whole system buy into it is money. Ruth Rankine, an NHS Confederation primary care director, believes that during times, such as now, when money is tight, collaboration generally becomes harder.",
      "\"People are too focused on their budgets and making sure it goes on where they immediately need it,\" she says.",
      "But clinics like Washwood Heath require collaboration and pooling resources.",
      "The other issue, she argues, is that the hospital sector has, in places, \"been a bit cynical\". \"The problem is that it takes time to get results \u2013 you need to invest in front and then it can be years before it has an impact.\"",
      "The NHS is spending a fortune giving people a death they don't want",
      "Labour's plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma",
      "'It's unforgivable': The problem at the heart of the NHS's maternity care failures",
      "Another concern is around finding suitable premises. In Birmingham, officials I spoke to acknowledged they were lucky to have a network of large health centres (as they were beneficiaries of a short-lived finance programme launched in the 2000s to improve community NHS buildings) but many other places around the country do not.",
      "This is a concern for Dr Richard Vautrey, a GP from Leeds who has been involved in national NHS politics since the early 2000s in his role as a British Medical Association negotiator and, more recently, as president of the Royal College of GPs.",
      "\"There just isn't enough of the right premises,\" he argues. \"In many places, GPs and community colleagues cannot work side-by-side because the buildings are too outdated and cramped.",
      "\"We've had all the talk over 40 new hospitals, but where are the 1,000 new neighbourhood clinics?\"",
      "Political pressure and short-term thinking",
      "There are deeper rooted political pressures too that make a nationwide rollout of centres like those in Birmingham a challenge.",
      "Even though the work in east Birmingham ticks a lot of the boxes set out by independent peer and NHS surgeon Lord Darzi in his report for the government last autumn, after being commissioned by Wes Streeting, this is not the first time such calls have been made. Lord Darzi himself set out similar goals in a report for the Blair government in 2007.",
      "Ms Rankine has had a front-row view of this. She worked for the Department of Health and NHS executive for more than a decade from the mid-1990s. \"We've been talking about this for 20, 30 years, but failed to achieve it on any sort of scale.\"",
      "And today, there are a series of contradictory priorities facing the NHS. Often it is those considered the most pressing that are addressed first.",
      "Hugh Alderwick, Director of Policy at the Health Foundation think-tank, who advised Labour in opposition, points out that the big focus is on hitting the 18-week hospital waiting time targets.",
      "\"It's pulling in the opposite direction of this ambition to move care out into the community,\" he observes.",
      "So can the government really reshape the NHS into a neighbourhood health service? Dr Vautrey, for one is optimistic.",
      "\"It can,\" he says. \"But it will take determination, effort \u2013 and money.\"",

    "summary": "Men are more likely to die prematurely than women - and worse at seeking care when they need it.",
    "story": [
      "This month the government in England will launch a consultation for its men's health strategy. The move is long overdue, experts say, with men much more likely to die prematurely than women. But why are they in such poor health \u2013 and what can be done about it?",
      "Andrew Harrison was running a men's health clinic from a youth centre in Bradford when he heard a knock. He turned to the door, but no-one was there. Then he heard his name being called. He looked around to see a young man at the window asking for condoms.",
      "\"I was on the first floor,\" he says, recounting the story from a few years ago. \"The lad had shimmied up a drainpipe on the outside of the building because he didn't want to go through the reception and ask.\"",
      "The anecdote, in many ways, encapsulates the challenges over men's health \u2013 a combination of risk-taking behaviour and a lack of confidence and skills to engage with health services.",
      "Early deaths",
      "In the UK men are more likely to smoke, drink alcohol, use drugs and have high cholesterol and blood pressure.",
      "These are major contributors to the fact men have a lower life expectancy than women - by four years - and are nearly 60% more likely to die prematurely before the age of 75 with heart disease, lung cancer, liver disease and in accidents.",
      "Prof Alan White, who co-founded the Men's Health Forum charity and set up a dedicated men's health centre at Leeds Beckett University, says the issue needs to be taken more seriously.",
      "He cites the pandemic as an example, pointing out that 19,000 more men than women died from Covid. \"Where was the outrage? Where was the attention?\"",
      "He says it is too easy to blame men's poor health on their lifestyles, arguing \"it's much more complex than that.\"",
      "He says there are biological reasons \u2013 the male immune system is less able to fight off infection. But, as the story of the young man seeking condoms above demonstrates, they can also lack the skills to access health services.",
      "Prof White says: \"Men are less health-literate, that is to say they don't develop the skills to talk about their health and recognise and act on the signs. Men's health is very static from their teenage years right through into their 40s generally \u2013 many go years without seeing a health professional.",
      "\"It is different for women. Getting contraception, having cervical screening and then childbirth means many women have regular contact with health services in a way men do not.\"",
      "Stark differences",
      "Machismo is also a factor, says Mark Brooks, the policy adviser for the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Men's and Boy's Issues, which has played a key role in influencing the government to draw up a men's health strategy.",
      "\"In society we have different expectations in regards to men. They are expected to man up and get on with things, to be strong and resilient.\"",
      "But he says when it comes to men's health it is important to pay particular attention to the impact of deprivation. Life expectancy in the poorest 10% of areas is 10 years less than in the wealthiest \u2013 a larger gap than is seen for women \u2013 and in the most deprived areas a man is 3.5 times more likely to die before the age of 75.",
      "\"You cannot ignore the stark differences when it comes to left-behind communities and those working in blue-collar jobs like construction and manufacturing,\" he says. \"The way health services are designed isn't working for men.\"",
      "NHS health checks, which are offered every five years to those aged 40 to 74, are considered a crucial intervention when it comes to many of the diseases which are claiming the lives of men early. But fewer than four in 10 men take up the offer.",
      "\"Someone working in construction or on an industrial estate will find it very difficult to take time off whether that's for a health check or to go and see their GP.\"",
      "Mr Brooks says he would like to see employees given a right to two hours' paid time off to go for health checks as well as seeing them delivered in places where blue-collar workers are employed, such as industrial estates.",
      "But he says this is also an issue about employment - with some men in these roles scared to face up to health problems that develop in their 40s and 50s - ignoring early warning signs or hiding illnesses from bosses altogether because of what it may mean for their work.",
      "He adds that job worries and financial concerns, along with relationship problems,  are a big driver in the high suicide rates seen among men. Three-quarters of people who take their own lives are men.",
      "Despite this, just a third of people sent for talking therapies are men, which may suggest that services are not doing enough to consider men's needs.",
      "\"How services are set up to recognise signs of depression and anxiety is not how men express them \u2013 they are more likely to display signs of anger, abuse alcohol or become withdrawn and push people away,\" says Prof White.",
      "Ethnic differences are also important to recognise, he says. For example, black men in England are twice as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer, while men from Indian or Bangladeshi backgrounds are at particularly high risk of diabetes.",
      "Wake-up call",
      "But none of this means men are not interested in their own health, says Prof Paul Galdas, a men's health expert at York University. \"Men will open up and want to be engaged, but to do that you have to base it around actions and activities.\"",
      "He has helped develop a six-week mental fitness programme in partnership with the Movember men's health movement that has been trialled on NHS front-line workers following Covid. Now it is being used by Leeds United football club for its youth players.",
      "Men are provided with support to understand how behaviour affects moods, they are encouraged to track their habits and set goals for healthy activities.",
      "\"It can be about going for a walk, seeing friends, playing golf and developing problem-solving skills to protect mental health. Good mental health leads to good physical health.\"",
      "Similar activity-based initiatives can be found in a number of local areas where charities, councils and local men's groups have worked together to set up schemes.",
      "The Men's Sheds movement is perhaps the most well-known where men are encouraged to come together and bond and support each other while doing practical projects.",
      "Prof White says now is the time to build on these foundations \u2013 something a national men's health strategy is vital for. He says it will help \"shine a spotlight\" on the issue in a similar way to the women's health strategy did back in 2022 \u2013 that led to the creation of a network of women's health hubs and women's health champions at the heart of government.",
      "But he also wants it to act as a \"wake-up call\" for men themselves. He says there are some simple steps every man should consider.",
      "\"Look at your waist size \u2013 if you are carrying weight, if your tummy is too big try to do something. Get moving, get out and about and talk to people.",
      "\"Take every opportunity to get a health check or screened. And, if you notice changes to body or the way you are managing problems, seek help.\"",

      "She said after a series of relapses and months of treatment over the course of last year, she had received a stem cell transplant in December and had been declared cancer-free.",
      "However, just a week later, in early March this year, Ms Knowles was given the \"bitter\" news the leukaemia had returned.",
      "The hair salon owner, whose \"typical weekend\" before her diagnosis involved 100-mile bike rides and 15-mile runs, walked 20 miles around Fairhaven Lake on 16 March to raise funds for clinical research at King's College Hospital.",
      "She said she hoped any donations would improve research on AML, a particularly aggressive cancer which, she said, had not seen any \"solid advancements\" in treatment for 50 years.",

      "\"Over three months since the Government announced these local inquiries, Tom Crowther KC, a barrister invited by the Home Office to help establish them, knows almost nothing about their progress, and neither do we,\" she told the Commons.",

      "\"Following feedback from local authorities, the fund will adopt a flexible approach to support both full independent local inquiries and more bespoke work, including local victims' panels or locally-led audits into the handling of historic cases,\" she said.",
      "Phillips also announced a child protection authority will be created to address another of the central recommendations of IICSA, as well as doubling funding for national services which support adult survivors of child sexual abuse.",

      "\"We will pursue justice for victims without fear or favour, and claims we would not do so to avoid offending any group are false.",

      "\"But in an increasingly competitive global market, it's key to create a business environment that incentivises rather than penalises investment, risk taking and success. Levies diminish competitiveness and penalise audiences who ultimately bear the increased costs.\"",

      "Fair levy or unfair tariff?",
      "The arrival of the streamers into the UK market \"drove up the price of everything\", Kosminsky told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday, to the point where the public service broadcasters \"couldn't afford to make their programs anymore, so we need a new pot of money.\"",
      "He underlined how 17 other countries in Europe have imposed a similar levy \"so that public service broadcasters can stay in the game.\"",

    "summary": "The move could see some taxpayer-funded organisations not directly controlled by ministers scrapped.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of public bodies are to be reviewed in a bid to cut spending and give ministers more decision-making powers.",
      "Cabinet Office Minister Pat McFadden has written to government departments asking them to justify the existence of every taxpayer-funded organisation not directly controlled by ministers.",
      "Some of these organisations, known as quangos, could be closed, merged, or have their responsibilities handed over to departments.",
      "The BBC has been told ministers are considering passing a new law that would make it easier to scrap multiple quangos at once.",
      "A government source said the review had no completion date, and ministers had not set a target for how many quangos, or quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations, they wanted to abolish.",
      "The source said the review be particularly focused on quangos dealing with policy issues of national importance.",
      "The review comes after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced plans to abolish NHS England, which Labour has described as the world's biggest quango.",
      "The organisation will be brought into the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), in a radical overhaul of the management structure of the NHS.",
      "The move is part of the government's drive to slim down the Civil Service, with a view to saving money and restructuring how the state works.",
      "Last month, Sir Keir told his ministers they should take more responsibility for decisions rather than \"outsourcing\" them to regulators.",
      "Could Starmer's regulation shake-up mean a 'bonfire of the quangos'?",
      "Abolishing NHS England is radical - why do it?",
      "Quangos are organisations such as regulators, cultural institutions and advisory bodies, which are funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled from Whitehall.",
      "They range from huge organisations like NHS England, to smaller ones like the Gambling Commission and the British Film Institute.",
      "Some - such as the Environment Agency, or the broadcasting regulator Ofcom - have powers to make decisions without ministerial input.",
      "The Cabinet Office's review will consider four key principles, including the importance of ministerial oversight of key policy areas and government efficiency.",
      "There will be a presumption that all quangos could be scrapped unless there is a compelling reason to keep them, the Cabinet Office said.",
      "But some quangos that scrutinise the government or protect the rule of law will remain unaffected.",
      "McFadden said the government wants to \"ensure decisions of national importance that affect everyone in this country are made by those who have been elected to do so\".",
      "He added: \"The review will aim to drive out waste and inefficiency across Whitehall, reducing duplication and bureaucracy - saving the taxpayer money and cutting the cost of 'doing government'.\"",
      "'Handle it properly'",
      "Since Labour won the general election last year, government has set up a number of new quangos, including Great British Energy, which invests in clean power sources.",
      "Previous governments have taken an axe to these organisations, with the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition getting rid of hundreds in a so-called bonfire of quangos from 2010.",
      "But trade unions are wary of further cuts, and fear they could mean jobs losses in the Civil Service.",
      "\"If they target up to 50% job cuts - as they are pursuing with the NHS England and DHSC merger \u2013 the government seriously risks undermining their own agenda,\" said Lucille Thirlby, assistant general secretary of the FDA, a union representing senior civil servants.",

      "A number of Deaf and Disabled People's Organisations have told the BBC they are considering stepping back from working with the government over proposed benefit cuts.",
      "The organisations, known as DDPO's which are run for and by disabled people, say there has been a lack of genuine engagement from the Labour government.",
      "It comes as it launches accessible formats of the consultation on the cuts, triggering a 12-week period for people to give their views.",
      "Sir Stephen Timms, Minister for Social Security and Disability, said the government needs the opinions of disabled people to move forward.",
      "Appearing on the BBC's disability and mental health podcast, Access All, Sir Stephen said: \"I very much hope that they will carry on talking to me because I need to know what they think about these proposals.",
      "\"I want to make sure that the views and voices of disabled people are at the heart of what we do in this area, [as well] as elsewhere across the government.\"",
      "The Spring Statement, announced in March, outlined that a benefit shake-up to make savings of \u00a35bn would include tightening eligibility for Personal Independence Payment, a non-means tested benefit to support people with everyday tasks. It also outlined that people under the age of 22 could be prevented from claiming universal credit top-up payments for health conditions.",
      "Fazilet Hadi, head of policy at Disability Rights UK, a DDPO, said there was an \"anger and sense of betrayal\" felt by millions of disabled people over the cuts which she described as \"the Government's massive attack on the incomes of disabled people\".",
      "Ms Hadi said: \"Currently, Disability Rights UK, continues to have dialogue with ministers, as we believe it is important to express the depth of opposition to government plans.",
      "\"Having said this, we will reconsider our position, should the wider disabled people's movement decide to take a different stance.\"",
      "Svetlana Kotova, director of campaigns and justice at Inclusion London, another DDPO, said it was also \"considering its position on engagement\".",
      "She said: \"Massive cuts to financial support will push disabled people, including children, into poverty, the government is not even consulting on the most significant cuts\"",
      "Suspended Labour MP, John McDonnell, who represents Hayes and Harlington in Parliament and previously held the position of shadow chancellor, also told Access All of his \"shock and anger\" at the plans, and said he was \"praying\" for a government U-turn.",
      "Initially, the government's reforms to benefits were intended to make savings of \u00a35bn a year by 2030, but the Office for Budget Responsibility has revised government figures, projecting a lower net saving of \u00a33.4bn.",
      "The government says that without radical reforms to the benefit system it could cost the tax payer as much as \u00a370bn annually by the end of the decade.",
      "To make savings, other planned changes include freezing extra payments for existing claimants of Universal Credit and almost halving them for new applicants.",
      "The government says some of the money saved will be reinvested into work programmes targeting youth unemployment.",
      "Alongside the 12-week consultation, which ends on 30 June, the government has announced the formation of \"collaboration committees\" which will involve civil servants working with disability experts and those with lived experience to  \"provide discussion, challenge, and recommendations\" to inform government proposals.",

      "Business",
      "Those most directly exposed in the UK to this trade war are British businesses - from carmakers to food producers - selling goods into the US.",

      "They already risk a dent to their sales from tariffs, threatening jobs and investment plans. Other companies too could be squeezed by more competition, if cheap imports from other nations are diverted to the UK - China makes a third of global goods.",

      "Growth",
      "The blow to growth via trade will likely be less marked in the UK than elsewhere, in part because of what Britain sells to America.",
      "Two-thirds of British exports to the US are services - the likes of banking, insurance  and advertising - which aren't subject to tariffs. The UK's success in this area makes it a particular area of strength in its trade portfolio.",
      "But that strength can also be a weakness.",
      "Some services exports are linked to goods; think after-sales services or marketing. The demand for those could be affected by tariffs in the US.",
      "Sales of services exports could more broadly be impacted elsewhere if demand from other countries suffers.",
      "Some in the advertising industry are already fretting because spending on their services are often the first to suffer when there are budget cutbacks.",
      "And that trade success could be a vulnerability.",
      "The Bank of England notes that the size of the UK's export sector compared to the economy, and its financial sector, means it may be susceptible to risks to financial stability from weaker global growth.",
      "It's for all these reasons that Chancellor Rachel Reeves is warning that growth in the UK will be hit, even if we're now on a level playing field with other countries in terms of the 10% tariff.",
      "That's worrying, not just for households and businesses, but for the chancellor's own sums - weaker growth puts more of a strain on the public finances.",
      "That's why there's been speculation that we may see more tax rises come the Autumn Budget, if she's to stick to her fiscal rules.",
      "ISAs and pensions",
      "Compounding that dilemma, potentially, are movements in the bond markets.",
      "Those are usually seen as safe investments in times of strife but there have been signs of heavy selling, which could lead to higher borrowing costs for governments.",
      "And the wild swings in stock markets around the world, egged on by the heightened risk of global recession, have not been good news for investors in the UK.",
      "When share prices drop, they reduce the value of products such as ISAs and pension funds.",
      "But as seasoned analysts caution, those sorts of funds are long-term ones. Swings in the value of investments tend to get smoothed out over time - and most people aren't drawing from such funds day-to-day. On the whole, households here are less exposed to the stock market directly than those in America are.",
      "Interest rates",
      "There may be a silver lining to the market volatility.",
      "Prices of oil and commodities such as copper and sugar have been falling.",
      "That may bode well for lower inflation, as might the diversion of cheap goods from countries struggling to sell in the US.",
      "Against a backdrop of weaker growth, investors are speculating that the Bank of England may cut interest rates four more times this year, touting potential relief for millions of households.",
      "The Bank of England itself has noted that, in any case, British households are well placed to weather the storm - our debt relative to our incomes is at its lowest level since 2001.",
      "Moreover, the banking system, the Bank judges, is well placed to absorb shocks. Lessons from the 2008 financial crisis have been learnt.",

    "story": [
      "It sounds like something from a science fiction movie, but Stephen Eisele is confident that one day his company will open a data centre on the Moon.",
      "\"The way we see it is that by putting the data centre in space, you're really offering unparalleled security,\" says the president of Lonestar Data Holdings.",
      "Last month, the Florida-based firm claimed to have successfully tested a tiny data centre the size of a hardback book that hitched a ride to the Moon on the Athena Lunar Lander from US space exploration firm Intuitive Machines. This, in turn, had been launched by a rocket from Elon Musk's SpaceX.",
      "Data centres are the vast warehouses that house stacks of computers that store and process data used by websites, companies and governments.",
      "Lonestar says that putting them on the Moon will offer customers secure, reliable data processing, while taking advantage of unlimited solar energy to power them.",
      "The environmental campaigners fighting against data centres",
      "Data centre power use 'to surge six-fold in 10 years'",
      "Concern UK's AI ambitions could lead to water shortages",
      "And while space-based data centres may sound far-fetched, it's an idea that's really starting to take off.",
      "Part of the reason is rocketing demand and the difficulty of finding suitable sites on Earth.",
      "The ever-expanding use of artificial intelligence (AI) computing has seen a massive increase in the amount of data that needs to be stored and processed around the world.",
      "As a result, the need for data centres has shot up too, with annual demand set to rise between 19% and 22% by 2030, according to global management consultants McKinsey.",
      "New facilities are springing up all the time - but it's getting hard to find places to put them. Data centres are large and sprawling, and use enormous amounts of power and water for cooling.",
      "And increasingly local people don't want them built nearby.",
      "Putting data centres in space \u2013 either in orbit around Earth, or on the Moon - the theory goes, means they can't do quite so much harm. There's more-or-less unlimited energy available from the sun, for example, and no neighbours to complain about the environmental impacts.",
      "Not only that, space-based data centres could specialise in services for spacecraft and other space facilities, with space-to-space data transfers quicker than from the ground.",
      "Last summer, a European Commission-funded feasibility study into orbiting data centres published its results.",
      "The Ascend report by carried out by Thales Alenia Space - a joint venture between French and Italian aerospace groups Thales and Leonardo - published its results.",
      "It determined that deploying data centres in space \"could transform the European digital landscape\", and be \"more eco-friendly\".",
      "Thales Alenia Space envisages building a constellation of 13 satellites measuring  a combined 200m-by-80m, and with a total data processing power of around 10 megawatts (MW). That's equivalent to a current medium-sized, ground-based data centre, with some 5,000 servers.",
      "Based on technologies that already exist or are under development, the satellites would be assembled in orbit.",
      "Damien Dumestier, Ascend project architect at Thales Alenia Space, says that for space-based data centres to be more environmentally friendly than existing ground-based ones it will be necessary to make the rocket launchers 10 times less emissive over their lifecycles. He says this looks possible.",
      "\"But in order to cover the new technology's developments and the production capacity ramp-up to benefit from scale, we have to consider larger system capacity, around 200MW, meaning 200 of our envisaged large space infrastructures and 200 launches,\" he says.",
      "\"The main question is when an adapted launcher will be ready. Depending on the investment and decisions to be taken, this could be done for 2030 or 2035, meaning commercial viability before 2037.\"",
      "However, despite this optimism from firms aiming to develop the technology, Dr Domenico Vicinanza, associate professor of intelligent systems and data science at Anglia Ruskin University in the UK, says there are numerous big hurdles before space-based data centres can be a viable proposition.",
      "\"Even with the contribution and advancements of companies like SpaceX, launching hardware into orbit remains extremely expensive,\" he says. \"Each kilogram sent into space costs thousands of dollars.",
      "\"Space-based data centres would require not only the data equipment but also the infrastructure to protect, power, and cool them. All of which add up in weight and complexity.\"",
      "Cooling the equipment will be a particular problem,  because even though space is cold, conventional cooling systems don't work well without gravity.",
      "Meanwhile, space weather can damage electronics, while the ever-increasing quantity of space debris puts the physical hardware at risk.",
      "Dr Vicinanza adds: \"And fixing problems in orbit is far from straightforward. Even with robotics and automation, there are limits to what can be repaired remotely.",
      "\"A big hardware failure might necessitate a costly human mission, potentially making downtime stretch for weeks or months.\"",
      "Yet firms like Lonestar are supremely confident, and say that they are responding to demand. \"We wouldn't be doing this if the customers weren't asking us to,\" says Mr Scott.",
      "Its next target is to put a small data centre in orbit around the moon in 2027. Meanwhile, other companies are hoping to get there a bit faster, such as Washington state-based Starcloud, which is due to launch a satellite-based data centre next month, and start commercial operations in mid-2026.",
      "Lonestar's Mr Eidele says that space-based facilities offer more security for governments and businesses because their data does not need to be routed through terrestrial networks. Instead the information can be beamed directly from space to a dedicated ground station.",
      "\"It's like having the vaults at the back of the bank,\" he says. \"You don't have to open it every day, but it's there to provide an extra measure of security, and the distance from the Earth to the moon offers that - it's that much harder to hack, that much harder to access.\"",
      "The distance to the Moon means that data takes about a second and a half to reach the ground - this doesn't matter for some applications, like longer-term data storage and backups.",
      "And meanwhile, says Lonestar founder and chief executive Chris Stott, space-based data centres can help organisations meet regulations about data sovereignty - the need to hold peoples' data in the country of origin.",
      "\"Under space law, that box of electronics is literally under the law of the licensing or launching state - it is an actual embassy in space,\" he says.",

    "summary": "The BBC finds evidence of fraud in the production of a \"green\" diesel meant to cut emissions.",
    "story": [
      "The UK government is investigating a fast-growing \"green fuel\" called HVO diesel amid claims of significant fraud, the BBC has learned.",
      "HVO is increasingly popular as a transport fuel and for powering music festivals and its backers say it can curb carbon emissions by up to 90% as it can be made from waste materials like used cooking oil.",
      "But industry whistleblowers told the BBC they believe large amounts of these materials are not waste but instead are virgin palm oil, which is being fraudulently relabelled.",
      "And data analysed by the BBC and shared with the UK's Department for Transport casts further doubt on one of the key ingredients in HVO, a material called palm sludge waste.",
      "Europe used more of this waste in HVO and other biofuels in 2023 than it is thought possible for the world to produce.",
      "In response to the BBC's findings, the Department for Transport said they \"take the concerns raised seriously and are working with stakeholders and international partners to gather further information\".",
      "HVO, or hydrotreated vegetable oil, has been called something of a wonder-fuel in recent years as it can be used as 100% substitute for diesel reducing planet warming emissions.",
      "UK consumption rocketed from 8 million litres in 2019 to about 699 million litres in 2024, according to provisional government figures.",
      "Its green credentials rely heavily on the assumption that it is made from waste sources, particularly used cooking oil or the waste sludge from palm oil production.",
      "But industry whistle-blowers have told the BBC that they believe virgin palm oil and other non-waste materials are often being used instead.",
      "That would be bad news for the planet, as virgin palm oil is linked to increased tropical deforestation, which adds to climate change and threatening endangered species like orang-utans.",
      "This palm oil \"floods the market like cancer,\" one large European biofuel manufacturer told the BBC.",
      "They said that to stay in business they have to go along with the pretence that they are using waste materials.",
      "Another whistle-blower, a former trader of these biofuels, also speaking anonymously, gave the BBC his account of one recent case dealing with supposedly waste products.",
      "\"I believe that what I bought was multiple cargos of virgin palm oil that has been wrongly classified as palm oil sludge,\" they said.",
      "\"I called one of the board members and told them about the situation, and then I was told that they didn't want to do anything about it, because the evidence would be burned.\"",
      "As well as this testimony, data compiled by campaign group Transport & Environment and analysed by the BBC suggests that more palm sludge waste is being used for transport biofuels than the world is probably able to produce.",
      "The figures show that the UK and EU used about two million tonnes of palm sludge waste for HVO and other biofuels in 2023, based on Eurostat and UK Department for Transport figures.",
      "EU imports of this sludge appear to have risen further in 2024, according to preliminary UN trade data, although the UK appears to have bucked this trend.",
      "But the data analysed by the BBC, which is based on well-established UN and industry statistics, suggests the world can only produce just over one million tonnes of palm sludge waste a year.",
      "This mismatch further suggests non-waste fuels such as  virgin palm oil are being used to meet Europe's rapid growth in biofuels, according to researchers and industry figures.",
      "\"It's a very easy game,\" said Dr Christian Bickert, a German farmer and editor with experience in biofuels, who believes that much of the HVO made with these waste products is \"fake\".",
      "\"Chemically, the sludge and the pure palm oil are absolutely the same because they come from the same plant, and also from the same production facilities in Indonesia,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"There's no paper which proves [the fraud], no paper at all, but the figures tell a clear story.\"",
      "Underpinning the sustainability claims of biofuels is an independent system of certification where producers have to show exactly where they get their raw materials from.",
      "It is mainly administered by a company called ISCC, and in Europe it has a long-standing reputation for ensuring that waste materials turned into fuel really do come from waste, by working with national authorities.",
      "But in Indonesia, Malaysia and China, three of the main sources of the raw ingredients claimed to be waste for HVO, supervision is much more difficult.",
      "\"ISCC is simply not allowed to send anybody to China,\" said Dr Christian Bickert.",
      "\"They have to rely on certification companies in China to check that everything is OK, but China doesn't allow any inspectors in from outside.\"",
      "This concern is echoed by several other groups contacted by the BBC.",
      "Construction giant Balfour Beatty, for example, has a policy of not using the fuel, citing sustainability concerns.",
      "\"We just are not able to get any level of visibility over the supply chain of HVO that would give us that level of assurance that this is truly a sustainable product,\" Balfour Beatty's Jo Gilroy told BBC News.",
      "The European Waste-based and Advanced Biofuels Association represents the major biofuel manufacturers in the EU and UK.",
      "In a statement they said \"there is a major certification verification issue that needs to be addressed as a matter of priority\", adding that the \"ISCC should do much more to ensure that non-EU Biodiesel is really what it claims to be\".",
      "In the light of growing fraud allegations, the Irish authorities have recently restricted incentives for fuels made from palm waste.",
      "The BBC also understands that the EU is about to propose a ban on ISCC certification of waste biofuels for two-and-a-half years, although it is expected to say it is not aware of direct breaches of renewable goals.",
      "It would then be up to individual member countries to decide whether to accept certifications.",
      "In response, the ISCC said it was \"more than surprised\" by the EU's move, adding that it had been \"a frontrunner in implementing the most strict and effective measures to ensure integrity and fraud prevention in the market for years\".",
      "\"The measure would be a severe blow to the entire market for waste-based biofuels,\" it said.",

    "summary": "A toxic algae bloom in southern California has sickened dozens of animals, causing them to have seizures and act erratically.",
    "story": [
      "For 20 years, Rj LaMendola found peace while paddling in the water on his surfboard.",
      "But last month off the coast of Southern California, the ocean turned hostile after a sea lion lunged at him, bit him and dragged him off his board.",
      "\"It looked possessed,\" Mr LaMendola wrote in a Facebook post, saying the animal involved in the encounter just north of Los Angeles was \"feral, almost demonic\".",
      "The surfer later learned the animal was suffering from domoic acid toxicosis- a neurological condition caused by a harmful algal bloom. It's one of dozens of sickened animals that have been spotted across California beaches recently - many suffering from symptoms like seizures or intense lethargy. The toxin often leads to death.",
      "This particular algae bloom has appeared four years in a row across California, raising concerns it might be turning into an annual event. The bloom of algae started earlier than normal this year and has spread roughly 370 miles of the iconic Southern California coastline.",
      "When Mr LaMenolda made it to shore, his wetsuit ripped open, he was bleeding and went to the hospital. \"It felt like I was being hunted,\" he said.",
      "South of where he was attacked, 15-year-old Phoebe Beltran was doing a swim test in Long Beach to become a lifeguard when a sea lion repeatedly bit her.",
      "\"I was just so scared, so shocked, but I still felt the immense pain on my arms, like, over and over again,\" the teen told local US media.",
      "The two back-to-back attacks have garnered global headlines and caused some anxiety among those who call California and its iconic beaches home. While attacks are rare, experts say the number of animals sickened by the toxic algae bloom appears to be increasing.",
      "John Warner, CEO of the Marine Mammal Care Center in Los Angeles - which is treating sea life sickened by the bloom - told the BBC these animals aren't \"naturally aggressive or actually attack people\" but the toxins impact their behaviour.",
      "\"These animals are reacting to the fact that they are sick,\" he explained. \"They're disoriented, and most likely, most of them are having seizures, and so their senses are not all fully functional as they normally would and they're acting out of fear.\"",
      "Domoic acid builds up in smaller fish like sardines and anchovies, which are eaten by marine predators such as dolphins, seals and sea lions in large quantities, causing them to get sick.",
      "Exposure to the acid causes serious neurological issues in sea lions, including seizures, disorientation and a telltale head-tilting behaviour known as \"stargazing.\"",
      "Some animals fall into a lethargic and comatose state, while others can turn aggressive.",
      "\"Their behaviour changes from what we're used to, to something more unpredictable,\" Mr Warner said. \"But in this particular bloom, we're seeing them really comatose and rather taken out by this toxin.\"",
      "The Marine Mammal Care Center is currently overwhelmed with the influx and severity of sick animals.",
      "According to Mr Warner, the nonprofit has admitted at least 195 sea lions from Feb 20 to the end of March. During the same time frame last year, the centre saw only 50 of the animals.",
      "If treated promptly, sea lions have a 50% to 65% chance of recovery, but Mr Warner says the centre is running out of space and money to treat the animals. Treatment includes anti-seizure medication and sedation, followed by twice-daily tube feeding and hydration.",
      "On top of that, the recovery pace this year has been slower, he said.",
      "While sick sea lions in 2023 typically began eating within a week, many this year are still lethargic five weeks into care.",
      "Recovery comes in stages: from a comatose state to disorientation, then aggressive reawakening\u2014when the animals are most dangerous due to lingering neurological effects.",
      "Adult sea lions can weigh hundreds of pounds, and aggressive behaviors make housing them complicated. If their behaviour doesn't normalize, it could signal permanent brain damage, and humane euthanasia becomes necessary.",
      "\"If they're still aggressive or not foraging properly, it tells us their brains aren't functioning the way they should,\" Mr Warner said.",
      "For now, beachgoers are urged to stay well away from stranded animals - at least 50 feet - and resist the temptation to intervene.",
      "\"These are still the same charismatic, really fun-to-watch expert cuddle puddlers that we see along the coast all the time,\" Mr Warner said. \"We need to remember they are wild animals. They can be unpredictable even in normal circumstances.\""

      "A detailed analysis of a full-sized digital scan of the Titanic has revealed new insight into the doomed liner's final hours.",
      "The exact 3D replica shows the violence of how the ship ripped in two as it sank after hitting an iceberg in 1912 - 1,500 people lost their lives in the disaster.",
      "The scan provides a new view of a boiler room, confirming eye-witness accounts that engineers worked right to the end to keep the ship's lights on.",
      "And a computer simulation also suggests that punctures in the hull the size of A4 pieces of paper led to the ship's demise.",
      "\"Titanic is the last surviving eyewitness to the disaster, and she still has stories to tell,\" said Parks Stephenson, a Titanic analyst.",
      "The scan has been studied for a new documentary by National Geographic and Atlantic Productions called Titanic: The Digital Resurrection.",
      "Rarely seen Titanic artefacts kept in secret warehouse",
      "Scans of Titanic reveal wreck as never seen before",
      "The wreck, which lies 3,800m down in the icy waters of the Atlantic, was mapped using underwater robots.",
      "More than 700,000 images, taken from every angle, were used to create the \"digital twin\", which was revealed exclusively to the world by BBC News in 2023.",
      "Because the wreck is so large and lies in the gloom of the deep, exploring it with submersibles only shows tantalising snapshots. The scan, however, provides the first full view of the Titanic.",
      "The immense bow lies upright on the seafloor, almost as if the ship were continuing its voyage.",
      "But sitting 600m away, the stern is a heap of mangled metal. The damage was caused as it slammed into the sea floor after the ship broke in half.",
      "The new mapping technology is providing a different way to study the ship.",
      "\"It's like a crime scene: you need to see what the evidence is, in the context of where it is,\" said Parks Stephenson.",
      "\"And having a comprehensive view of the entirety of the wreck site is key to understanding what happened here.\"",
      "The scan shows new close-up details, including a porthole that was most likely smashed by the iceberg. It tallies with the eye-witness reports of survivors that ice came into some people's cabins during the collision.",
      "Experts have been studying one of the Titanic's huge boiler rooms - it's easy to see on the scan because it sits at the rear of the bow section at the point where the ship broke in two.",
      "Passengers said that the lights were still on as the ship plunged beneath the waves.",
      "The digital replica shows that some of the boilers are concave, which suggests they were still operating as they were plunged into the water.",
      "Lying on the deck of the stern, a valve has also been discovered in an open position, indicating that steam was still flowing into the electricity generating system.",
      "This would have been thanks to a team of engineers led by Joseph Bell who stayed behind to shovel coal into the furnaces to keep the lights on.",
      "All died in the disaster but their heroic actions saved many lives, said Parks Stephenson.",
      "\"They kept the lights and the power working to the end, to give the crew time to launch the lifeboats safely with some light instead of in absolute darkness,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"They held the chaos at bay as long as possible, and all of that was kind of symbolised by this open steam valve just sitting there on the stern.\"",
      "A new simulation has also provided further insights into the sinking.",
      "It takes a detailed structural model of the ship, created from Titanic's blueprints, and also information about its speed, direction and position, to predict the damage that was caused as it hit the iceberg.",
      "\"We used advanced numerical algorithms, computational modelling and supercomputing capabilities to reconstruct the Titanic sinking,\" said Prof Jeom-Kee Paik, from University College London, who led the research.",
      "The simulation shows that as the ship made only a glancing blow against the iceberg it was left with a series of punctures running in a line along a narrow section of the hull.",
      "Titanic was supposed to be unsinkable, designed to stay afloat even if four of its watertight compartments flooded.",
      "But the simulation calculates the iceberg's damage was spread across six compartments.",
      "\"The difference between Titanic sinking and not sinking are down to the fine margins of holes about the size of a piece of paper,\" said Simon Benson, an associate lecturer in naval architecture at the University of Newcastle.",
      "\"But the problem is that those small holes are across a long length of the ship, so the flood water comes in slowly but surely into all of those holes, and then eventually the compartments are flooded over the top and the Titanic sinks.\"",
      "Unfortunately the damage cannot be seen on the scan as the lower section of the bow is hidden beneath the sediment.",
      "The human tragedy of the Titanic is still very much visible.",
      "Personal possessions from the ship's passengers are scattered across the sea floor.",
      "The scan is providing new clues about that cold night in 1912, but it will take experts years to fully scrutinise every detail of the 3D replica.",

      "Dr Beth Shapiro, a biologist from Colossal Biosciences, said that this feat does represent de-extinction, which she described as recreating animals with the same characteristics.",
      "\"A grey wolf is the closest living relative of a dire wolf - they're genetically really similar - so we targeted DNA sequences that lead to dire wolf traits and then edited grey wolf cells... then we cloned those cells and created our dire wolves.\"",
      "According to Dr Rawlence though, dire wolves diverged from grey wolves anywhere between 2.5 to six million years ago.",
      "\"It's in a completely different genus to grey wolves,\" he said. \"Colossal compared the genomes of the dire wolf and the grey wolf, and from about 19,000 genes, they determined that 20 changes in 14 genes gave them a dire wolf.\"",
      "The edited embryos were implanted in surrogate domestic dog mothers. According to the article in Time, all three wolves were born by planned caesarean section to minimise the risk of complications.",
      "Colossal, which was valued at $10bn (\u00a37.8bn) in January, is keeping the wolves on a private 2,000-acre facility at an undisclosed location in the northern US.",
      "The pups certainly look like many people's vision of a dire wolf and the story has gathered global attention. So why is this scientific distinction important?",
      "\"Because extinction is still forever,\" Dr Rawlence told BBC News. \"If we don't have extinction, how are we going to learn from our mistakes?",
      "\"Is the message now that we can go and destroy the environment and that animals can go extinct, but we can bring them back?\""

    "summary": "The BBC finds evidence of fraud in the production of a \"green\" diesel meant to cut emissions.",
    "story": [
      "The UK government is investigating a fast-growing \"green fuel\" called HVO diesel amid claims of significant fraud, the BBC has learned.",
      "HVO is increasingly popular as a transport fuel and for powering music festivals and its backers say it can curb carbon emissions by up to 90% as it can be made from waste materials like used cooking oil.",
      "But industry whistleblowers told the BBC they believe large amounts of these materials are not waste but instead are virgin palm oil, which is being fraudulently relabelled.",
      "And data analysed by the BBC and shared with the UK's Department for Transport casts further doubt on one of the key ingredients in HVO, a material called palm sludge waste.",
      "Europe used more of this waste in HVO and other biofuels in 2023 than it is thought possible for the world to produce.",
      "In response to the BBC's findings, the Department for Transport said they \"take the concerns raised seriously and are working with stakeholders and international partners to gather further information\".",
      "HVO, or hydrotreated vegetable oil, has been called something of a wonder-fuel in recent years as it can be used as 100% substitute for diesel reducing planet warming emissions.",
      "UK consumption rocketed from 8 million litres in 2019 to about 699 million litres in 2024, according to provisional government figures.",
      "Its green credentials rely heavily on the assumption that it is made from waste sources, particularly used cooking oil or the waste sludge from palm oil production.",
      "But industry whistle-blowers have told the BBC that they believe virgin palm oil and other non-waste materials are often being used instead.",
      "That would be bad news for the planet, as virgin palm oil is linked to increased tropical deforestation, which adds to climate change and threatening endangered species like orang-utans.",
      "This palm oil \"floods the market like cancer,\" one large European biofuel manufacturer told the BBC.",
      "They said that to stay in business they have to go along with the pretence that they are using waste materials.",
      "Another whistle-blower, a former trader of these biofuels, also speaking anonymously, gave the BBC his account of one recent case dealing with supposedly waste products.",
      "\"I believe that what I bought was multiple cargos of virgin palm oil that has been wrongly classified as palm oil sludge,\" they said.",
      "\"I called one of the board members and told them about the situation, and then I was told that they didn't want to do anything about it, because the evidence would be burned.\"",
      "As well as this testimony, data compiled by campaign group Transport & Environment and analysed by the BBC suggests that more palm sludge waste is being used for transport biofuels than the world is probably able to produce.",
      "The figures show that the UK and EU used about two million tonnes of palm sludge waste for HVO and other biofuels in 2023, based on Eurostat and UK Department for Transport figures.",
      "EU imports of this sludge appear to have risen further in 2024, according to preliminary UN trade data, although the UK appears to have bucked this trend.",
      "But the data analysed by the BBC, which is based on well-established UN and industry statistics, suggests the world can only produce just over one million tonnes of palm sludge waste a year.",
      "This mismatch further suggests non-waste fuels such as  virgin palm oil are being used to meet Europe's rapid growth in biofuels, according to researchers and industry figures.",
      "\"It's a very easy game,\" said Dr Christian Bickert, a German farmer and editor with experience in biofuels, who believes that much of the HVO made with these waste products is \"fake\".",
      "\"Chemically, the sludge and the pure palm oil are absolutely the same because they come from the same plant, and also from the same production facilities in Indonesia,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"There's no paper which proves [the fraud], no paper at all, but the figures tell a clear story.\"",
      "Underpinning the sustainability claims of biofuels is an independent system of certification where producers have to show exactly where they get their raw materials from.",
      "It is mainly administered by a company called ISCC, and in Europe it has a long-standing reputation for ensuring that waste materials turned into fuel really do come from waste, by working with national authorities.",
      "But in Indonesia, Malaysia and China, three of the main sources of the raw ingredients claimed to be waste for HVO, supervision is much more difficult.",
      "\"ISCC is simply not allowed to send anybody to China,\" said Dr Christian Bickert.",
      "\"They have to rely on certification companies in China to check that everything is OK, but China doesn't allow any inspectors in from outside.\"",
      "This concern is echoed by several other groups contacted by the BBC.",
      "Construction giant Balfour Beatty, for example, has a policy of not using the fuel, citing sustainability concerns.",
      "\"We just are not able to get any level of visibility over the supply chain of HVO that would give us that level of assurance that this is truly a sustainable product,\" Balfour Beatty's Jo Gilroy told BBC News.",
      "The European Waste-based and Advanced Biofuels Association represents the major biofuel manufacturers in the EU and UK.",
      "In a statement they said \"there is a major certification verification issue that needs to be addressed as a matter of priority\", adding that the \"ISCC should do much more to ensure that non-EU Biodiesel is really what it claims to be\".",
      "In the light of growing fraud allegations, the Irish authorities have recently restricted incentives for fuels made from palm waste.",
      "The BBC also understands that the EU is about to propose a ban on ISCC certification of waste biofuels for two-and-a-half years, although it is expected to say it is not aware of direct breaches of renewable goals.",
      "It would then be up to individual member countries to decide whether to accept certifications.",
      "In response, the ISCC said it was \"more than surprised\" by the EU's move, adding that it had been \"a frontrunner in implementing the most strict and effective measures to ensure integrity and fraud prevention in the market for years\".",

    "story": [
      "More than 40 percent of the world's electricity was generated without burning fossil fuels in 2024, according to a new report from think-tank Ember.",
      "But carbon dioxide emissions, which warm the planet, have risen to an all time high, the report says, with hot weather pushing up the overall demand for power.",
      "That meant an increase in the use of fossil fuel burning power stations.",
      "Solar power continues to be the fastest-growing energy source, with the amount of electricity it generates doubling in the last three years.",
      "\"Solar power has become the engine of the global energy transition,\" said Phil Macdonald, the managing director of Ember.",
      "\"Amid the noise, it's essential to focus on the real signal. Hotter weather drove the fossil generation increase in 2024, but we're very unlikely to see a similar jump in 2025.\"",
      "In a separate report, the European Copernicus climate service said March 2025 was the second hottest on record, extending a spell of record or near record breaking temperatures.",
      "Ember is a global energy think tank which has been predicting for several years that emissions of the climate warming gas carbon dioxide were about to start falling.",
      "But this hasn't happened yet due to increasing global demand for electricity.",

      "Four ways climate change worsens extreme weather",
      "Solar revolution",
      "Cheap and relatively easy to install, for the twentieth year in a row solar is the fastest growing electricity source. According to Ember, the amount generated by solar panels has doubled every three years since 2012.",
      "China continues to dominate the growth of solar with more than half of the increase taking place there. India's solar capacity doubled between 2023 and 2024.",
      "Though it is growing fast, solar remains a relatively small part of the global energy mix contributing just under 7% of global supply \u2013 that's the same as powering the entire country of India.",
      "Wind contributes just over 8%, with hydropower contributing 14% making it the largest source of clean energy. Both hydro-electric and nuclear power (9%) are growing much more slowly than wind and solar.",
      "Back to the 1940s",
      "The report says that clean energy sources contributed more than 40% of global electricity generation for the first time since the 1940s. Back then demand was much lower, and hydroelectric power stations contributed a significant share.",
      "The big picture is that the rise in the global demand for electricity continues to outpace the growth in renewable energy.",
      "That means that though the percentage generated by clean power has risen to 40.9% the amount of greenhouse gases being emitted has yet to start falling.",
      "According to the Ember report global demand for electricity rose by 4% in 2024.",
      "This was partly due to an increased use of air conditioning in what was a particularly hot year. That meant that fossil fuel generation, mostly coal (34%) and gas (22%), increased by 1.4% and global emissions of the climate warming gas CO2 rose to an all time high of 14.6bn tonnes.",

      "The exact 3D replica shows the violence of how the ship ripped in two as it sank after hitting an iceberg in 1912 - 1,500 people lost their lives in the disaster.",
      "The scan provides a new view of a boiler room, confirming eye-witness accounts that engineers worked right to the end to keep the ship's lights on.",
      "And a computer simulation also suggests that punctures in the hull the size of A4 pieces of paper led to the ship's demise.",
      "\"Titanic is the last surviving eyewitness to the disaster, and she still has stories to tell,\" said Parks Stephenson, a Titanic analyst.",
      "The scan has been studied for a new documentary by National Geographic and Atlantic Productions called Titanic: The Digital Resurrection.",

      "Scans of Titanic reveal wreck as never seen before",
      "The wreck, which lies 3,800m down in the icy waters of the Atlantic, was mapped using underwater robots.",
      "More than 700,000 images, taken from every angle, were used to create the \"digital twin\", which was revealed exclusively to the world by BBC News in 2023.",
      "Because the wreck is so large and lies in the gloom of the deep, exploring it with submersibles only shows tantalising snapshots. The scan, however, provides the first full view of the Titanic.",
      "The immense bow lies upright on the seafloor, almost as if the ship were continuing its voyage.",
      "But sitting 600m away, the stern is a heap of mangled metal. The damage was caused as it slammed into the sea floor after the ship broke in half.",
      "The new mapping technology is providing a different way to study the ship.",
      "\"It's like a crime scene: you need to see what the evidence is, in the context of where it is,\" said Parks Stephenson.",
      "\"And having a comprehensive view of the entirety of the wreck site is key to understanding what happened here.\"",
      "The scan shows new close-up details, including a porthole that was most likely smashed by the iceberg. It tallies with the eye-witness reports of survivors that ice came into some people's cabins during the collision.",
      "Experts have been studying one of the Titanic's huge boiler rooms - it's easy to see on the scan because it sits at the rear of the bow section at the point where the ship broke in two.",
      "Passengers said that the lights were still on as the ship plunged beneath the waves.",
      "The digital replica shows that some of the boilers are concave, which suggests they were still operating as they were plunged into the water.",

      "A new simulation has also provided further insights into the sinking.",
      "It takes a detailed structural model of the ship, created from Titanic's blueprints, and also information about its speed, direction and position, to predict the damage that was caused as it hit the iceberg.",
      "\"We used advanced numerical algorithms, computational modelling and supercomputing capabilities to reconstruct the Titanic sinking,\" said Prof Jeom-Kee Paik, from University College London, who led the research.",
      "The simulation shows that as the ship made only a glancing blow against the iceberg it was left with a series of punctures running in a line along a narrow section of the hull.",
      "Titanic was supposed to be unsinkable, designed to stay afloat even if four of its watertight compartments flooded.",
      "But the simulation calculates the iceberg's damage was spread across six compartments.",
      "\"The difference between Titanic sinking and not sinking are down to the fine margins of holes about the size of a piece of paper,\" said Simon Benson, an associate lecturer in naval architecture at the University of Newcastle.",
      "\"But the problem is that those small holes are across a long length of the ship, so the flood water comes in slowly but surely into all of those holes, and then eventually the compartments are flooded over the top and the Titanic sinks.\"",
      "Unfortunately the damage cannot be seen on the scan as the lower section of the bow is hidden beneath the sediment.",
      "The human tragedy of the Titanic is still very much visible.",
      "Personal possessions from the ship's passengers are scattered across the sea floor.",
      "The scan is providing new clues about that cold night in 1912, but it will take experts years to fully scrutinise every detail of the 3D replica.",

      "The world's most popular gadgets - phones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches - could be about to get a lot more expensive in the US.",
      "Many of them are made in China, which now faces a 145% tariff on its goods imported to the US, under President Donald Trump's controversial trade policy.",
      "The effect this may have on the iPhone and its maker Apple is under the spotlight - with some analysts saying if costs are passed onto consumers, iPhone prices in the US could rise by hundreds of dollars.",
      "And if the tariffs impact the value of the dollar, it could become more expensive to import iPhones and other devices around the world - potentially leading to higher prices in UK shops.",
      "Ben Wood of CCS Insight told the BBC that if tariffs remain in place, Apple may raise iPhone prices globally when the next iteration is launched.",
      "\"It is unlikely the company would want to have differentiated pricing globally,\" he said - as the tech giant would want to avoid people buying the device cheaply in the UK and selling it on for profit in the US.",
      "Though others say they believe it could result in cheaper prices if firms which normally send their goods to the US instead send them to countries which don't have such steep tariffs, like the UK.",
      "And there may be a significant change if the cost of tariffs is passed onto consumers globally - longer contracts to spread out the cost of the device.",

      "The BBC has approached Apple for comment on the impact of tariffs on their operations and prices, but has not had any response yet.",
      "How exposed is Apple to tariffs?",
      "Trump and his advisors have said the aim of its tariffs are to encourage more US manufacturing.",

      "But he notes the company's strong branding and popularity may allow it to pass some costs to consumers without too much backlash.",
      "\"The brand commands better loyalty than its competitors, and it is unlikely that a manageable price increase will send these customers fleeing into the arms of Android-based competitors.\"",
      "Some estimates suggest iPhone prices in the US could as much as triple if costs were passed to consumers.",
      "Following Trump's tariff increase on China to 125%, the cost for a China-made iPhone 16 Pro Max with 256GB storage would have surged from $1,199 to $1,999, according to estimates by investment banking firm UBS.",

      "Nine in ten secondary schools restrict the use of smartphones, according to a survey of 19,000 schools and colleges commissioned by Dame Rachel de Souza.",
      "Dame Rachel said children were racking up hours of screen time at home instead, and that \"the people with the real power here are the parents\".",
      "Her comments come as the general secretary of the UK's largest teaching union said a government ban on phones would \"take the pressure off schools\".",
      "Dame Rachel told BBC Radio 5Live that the vast majority schools were already restricting and banning phones, adding: \"Blanket ban if you want, but they're doing it.\"",
      "The former head teacher cast doubt on how effective a ban would be on those schools without strict policies, noting that the government can impose rules but \"unless a headteacher really believes it, they won't do it properly\".",
      "A minority of schools want a ban because they are \"worried about parents\" not supporting the decision, she said.",
      "\"That's why I'm saying parents, 'get behind your school'.\"",
      "Dame Rachel told BBC Breakfast that \"parents have to remember they are not the friends of their children\" but are \"there to protect their children [and] put the boundaries around them.\"",
      "A third of teachers reported misogyny among pupils last week, survey suggests",
      "How can you keep your child safe online?",
      "Her survey suggests 99.8% of primary and 90% of secondary schools limit pupils' use of phones during the school day.",
      "Most primary schools (76%) require pupils to hand in their phones or leave them in a secure place during the day, whereas most secondary schools (79%) say phones must be kept out of sight and not used.",
      "The survey did not cover how thoroughly these policies are implemented, or their success rate.",
      "A separate survey of 502 eight to 15-year-olds, also commissioned by Dame Rachel, suggests:",
      "69% of children spend more than two hours a day on a device23% of children spend more than four hours a day",
      "69% of children spend more than two hours a day on a device",
      "23% of children spend more than four hours a day",
      "\"These children are not spending these hours on their phones while sat in school,\" Dame Rachel said in a new report.",
      "She said schools should educate young people about online risks - but parents and carers needed more help to manage their children's online habits and technology companies must \"take responsibility for making the online world safe\".",
      "She added that she would back any head teacher's decision to ban phones, but added: \"It should always be their choice, based on their knowledge of what's best for the children in their own classrooms, not a direction imposed nationally by the government.\"",
      "However, her report also recommended the government should \"conduct more research into the potential benefits of wider restrictions on children's use of phones, particularly social media\".",
      "The Netflix drama Adolescence has raised awareness of the type of content children can be exposed to online, such as misogyny and violence, and the risks involved.",
      "A survey commissioned by BBC News found that more than a third of secondary teachers have reported misogynistic behaviour from pupils at their school in the last week.",
      "A government spokesperson said social media platforms already have to take down illegal material under the Online Safety Act, and the same law would soon protect children from other harmful online content.",
      "And the government has said there is already guidance on how schools can restrict the use of phones, which head teachers can decide how to put into practice.",
      "But Daniel Kebede, the general secretary of the National Education Union, said he believed a government ban on smartphones in schools would \"assist parents, but also take the pressure off schools\".",
      "\"Most schools do have rules in place, but [a ban] would create a uniformity across the school system, which would be very important and ensure that a new culture was developed in which smartphones were not in possession during school time,\" he said.",
      "He said the UK should consider following in Australia's steps with a social media ban for under-16s, adding: \"We have to view the online world, social media and mobile phones in the same prism as we view the tobacco companies. These are harmful to our young people and they need regulating.\"",

      "So when it made a big investment in India's market, the footwear industry took note.",
      "Hong Fu is currently building a giant plant in Panapakkam, in the state of Tamil Nadu in south eastern India. When fully operational, some time in the next three to five years, it will make 25 million pairs of shoes a year, employing as many as 25,000 workers.",
      "The project has Indian partners, including Aqeel Panaruna, the chairman of Florence Shoe Company: \"The international market is saturated and they [Hong Fu] were looking for a new market,\" he explains.",
      "\"There is a drastic increase in non-leather footwear in India. It has huge potential,\" Mr Panaruna added.",
      "The Indian government is keen to attract such investment, hoping it will raise standards in the footwear industry and boost exports.",
      "To spur the industry, last August the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) introduced new quality rules for all shoes sold in India.",
      "Under those standards, for example, materials will have to pass tests of strength and flexibility.",
      "\"These BIS standards are really about cleaning up the market. We've had too many low-quality products flooding in, and consumers deserve better,\" says Sandeep Sharma a journalist and footwear industry expert.",

      "\"I think the government is trying to walk a tightrope here. They can't just shut down thousands of small businesses that employ millions of people - that would be economic suicide.",
      "\"What I'm seeing is more of a carrot-and-stick approach. They're pushing for standards, but also rolling out programs to help small manufacturers upgrade their processes. It's not about wiping out the unorganised sector but gradually bringing them into the fold.\"",

      "\"Most homegrown brands rely on off-the-shelf soles from the market, but when we started Comet, we realized that these were lacking in quality, durability, and grip,\" he says.",
      "Change is coming to the footwear sector he says. \"The shift to high value is now happening.\"",
      "\"Many high value brands need to move their manufacturing to India. In 3-5 years, we should have a robust ecosystem to compete in the international sneaker market,\" he adds.",
      "Back in Agra, Ashok hopes that the unorganised sector is not neglected amid the growth of India's footwear industry.",
      "\"The government should give us accreditation and certificates so our factories don't close down. Once we too are included in the organised sector no one can beat India in the shoe manufacturing industry.\"",

      "The Rafah area was reported to be almost completely empty when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced three days later that troops were \"seizing the Morag Corridor\" - a reference to a former Jewish settlement located between Rafah and Khan Younis.",
      "He said it would be \"the second Philadelphi\" and would increase pressure on Hamas to hand over the remaining 59 hostages, 24 of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "On Wednesday, Defence Minister Israel Katz visited troops deployed in the new corridor with senior Israeli commanders and journalists.",
      "\"The IDF is eliminating terrorists, locating and thwarting terrorist infrastructure, and dismembering the Gaza Strip, even in places like the Morag corridor, where we have not operated to date,\" he said in a video later released by his office.",
      "\"The population of Gaza is being evacuated from the fighting zones, and many areas are being seized and added to the security zones of the State of Israel, leaving Gaza smaller and isolated.\"",
      "Katz also warned that \"if Hamas continues to refuse and does not release the hostages soon, the IDF will carry out intense military operations across all of Gaza\".",
      "An Israeli journalist for the Ynet news website who accompanied the minister separately quoted him as saying: \"All of Rafah will be evacuated and turned into a security area. This is what we are doing now.\"",
      "The BBC has asked the IDF for comment.",
      "On Thursday morning, it said troops were continuing to operate \"in the area of Rafah and along the Morag corridor\", and that they had \"eliminated several terrorists, located and dismantled terrorist infrastructure sites\" while working to \"establish operational control\".",
      "Israeli military analysts suggest there is a plan to push Palestinian civilians towards the coast so that Israeli forces can focus on eliminating Hamas in urban areas.",
      "According to local media, this strategy would also allow the IDF to take control of the delivery of aid to the coast - bypassing both Hamas and international aid agencies.",
      "On Tuesday, the UN said the IDF had issued 15 evacuation orders over the past three weeks, covering almost 131 sq km (51 sq miles), or 36% of Gaza.",
      "Another 30% of the territory was covered by the Israeli-designated \"no-go\" zone along Gaza's borders, and along the Wadi Gaza river valley that separates the north and south of the territory, it added.",
      "The UN human rights office warned last month that the evacuation orders failed to comply with the requirements of international law, accusing Israel of not taking any measures to provide accommodation for those affected or ensuring satisfactory hygiene, health, safety and nutrition conditions.",
      "Israel's government said it was evacuating civilians to protect them from harm and from being used by Hamas as \"human shields\" in violation of international law.",
      "The UN has also said that Israel's five-week blockade of Gaza violates international law, which requires it to ensure the basic needs of the civilian population under its control are met and allow the rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian assistance.",
      "In a separate development on Thursday, the IDF announced that an strike in eastern Gaza City on Wednesday had killed the commander of Hamas's Shejaiya battalion, whom it identified as Haitham Sheikh Khalil and said had been planning attacks from the area.",
      "A local hospital said the attack, which destroyed a four-storey building, killed at least 29 people, including children.",
      "The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",
      "More than 50,880 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."

      "A controversial bill seeking to reinterpret New Zealand's founding document, which established the rights of both M\u0101ori and non-M\u0101ori in the country, has been defeated at its second reading.",
      "The Treaty Principles Bill was voted down 112 votes to 11, days after a government committee recommended that it should not proceed.",
      "The proposed legislation sought to legally define the principles of the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi - causing widespread outrage that saw more than 40,000 people taking part in a protest outside parliament last year.",
      "The bill had already been widely expected to fail, with most major political parties committed to voting it down.",
      "Members of the right-wing Act Party, which tabled it, were the only MPs to vote for it at the second reading on Thursday. Act's leader David Seymour has promised to continue campaigning on the issue.",
      "\"I believe this Bill or something like it will pass one day because there are not good arguments against its contents,\" he wrote on social media.",
      "Tensions were high during a parliamentary debate on the bill in November. Labour MP Willie Jackson was told to leave after refusing to withdraw a comment he made calling Seymour a \"liar\".",
      "Labour leader Chris Hipkins said the proposed legislation would forever \"be a stain on our country\", while Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori (The M\u0101ori Party) MP Hana R\u0101whiti Maipi-Clarke - who gained international attention for starting a haka in parliament at the bill's first reading - said it had been \"annihilated\".",
      "\"Instead of dividing and conquering, this bill has backfired and united communities across the motu [country] in solidarity for our founding agreement and what it represents,\" Green Party co-leader Marama Davidson later said in a statement.",
      "The second reading came after a select committee, which had been looking into the proposed legislation released its final report - revealing that more than 300,000 submissions had been made on it, the vast majority of which were opposed.",
      "It is the largest response to proposed legislation that the New Zealand parliament has ever received.",
      "While the principles of the Treaty have never been defined in law, its core values have, over time, been woven into different pieces of legislation in an effort to offer redress to M\u0101ori for the wrong done to them during colonisation.",
      "Act's proposed legislation had three main principles: that the New Zealand government has the power to govern, and parliament to make laws; that the Crown would respect the rights of M\u0101ori at the time the Treaty was signed; and that everyone is equal before the law and entitled to equal protection.",
      "The party said the bill would not alter the Treaty itself but would \"continue the process of defining the Treaty principles\". This, they believe, would help to create equality for all New Zealanders and improve social cohesion.",
      "Among those backing it was Ruth Richardson, a former finance minister for the centre-right National Party, who told the select committee that the proposed legislation was \"a bill of consequence whose time has come\".",
      "She argued that while the Treaty itself could not be disputed, the idea of its principles was a \"relatively modern matter\", and that these principles had so far been largely defined by the courts, rather than parliament.",
      "\"There is a new imperative in New Zealand on the cultural front, the necessity to address and correct Treaty overreach that has increasingly and evidently become wayward and wrong,\" she said.",
      "Opponents of the bill, meanwhile, believe it would be detrimental to M\u0101ori and create greater social divides.",
      "Sharon Hawke, the daughter of the late M\u0101ori activist and MP Joe Hawke, spoke to the select committee on behalf of the Ng\u0101ti Wh\u0101tua \u014cr\u0101kei hap\u016b [sub-tribe] - telling it that the legislation \"strips the fabric of where we've been heading for in the last three decades at improving our people's [M\u0101ori's] ability to gain education, gain warm housing, gain good health\".",
      "She added that the bill \"polluted\" the idea of all New Zealanders having a future together.",
      "\"We will continue to show our opposition to this,\" she said.",
      "Key issues identified by members of the public who made submissions to the select committee included that it was inconsistent with the values of the Treaty, and that it had promoted equality with equity - not taking into account social disparities, such as those created by the legacy of colonisation.",
      "There were also concerns about the extent to which the bill complied with international law, and whether it would negatively impact New Zealand's reputation internationally.",
      "Submitters who supported the bill, meanwhile, referred to a current lack of clarity and certainty about the principles of the Treaty, and of the importance of equality for all.",
      "They also said that it was important to hold a referendum to facilitate a national conversation around the Treaty - something David Seymour believes is still needed.",
      "The Treaty Principles Bill passed its first reading in November, with support from National - the dominant party in New Zealand's ruling coalition - who had promised to back it as part of a coalition agreement with Act, but not any further.",
      "Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, who is also leader of the National Party, previously said there was nothing in the bill that he liked. He was not in parliament for its second reading, but remarked earlier in the day that it was time to move on from it.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has announced a 90-day pause for countries hit by higher US tariffs but a trade war with China has escalated.",
      "In a dramatic change of policy, just hours after levies against roughly 60 of America's trading partners kicked in, Trump said he was authorising a universal \"lowered reciprocal tariff of 10%\" as negotiations continued.",
      "At the same time he increased tariffs on goods from China to 125%, accusing Beijing of a \"lack of respect\" after it retaliated by saying it would impose tariffs of 84% on US imports.",
      "This comes a week after Trump announced import taxes on all goods entering the US, in the biggest upheaval of international trade in decades.",
      "His plan set a baseline tariff of 10% on all imports - which remains in place - but also higher rates on partners the White House described as the \"worst offenders\" for what the president considers to be unfair trade practices.",
      "This included the 27-member European Union, Vietnam, South Africa and many more - all of which were due to be on the receiving end of US tariffs ranging from 11% to more than 100%.",
      "Major market turmoil followed Trump's announcement last week, with sell-offs sparking trillions in losses across the world, many Americans fearing price rises and some analysts predicting increased odds of recession.",
      "On Wednesday, before Trump said he would suspend the higher tariffs on goods from countries other than China, the US government saw interest rates on its debt spike to 4.5% - the highest level since February.",

      "Hours later, when the change was announced, US shares rocketed with the S&P 500 soaring 7% in afternoon trading. It later closed the day's trading up 9.5%, while the Dow Jones surged by 7.8%.",
      "Announcing the latest iteration of his plan on Truth Social, Trump said he was authorising a 90-day pause on tariffs for the countries that had not retaliated against his levies.",
      "The additional tariff on Beijing, he said, would be effective immediately. \"At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realise that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable,\" he wrote.",
      "US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent insisted the change of policy had not been influenced by the global falls, but senior Democrat Chuck Schumer said the decision showed Trump was \"reeling and retreating\".",
      "Speaking outside the White House, Trump later said the amendments to his tariffs policy had \"had to be done\" because people were \"getting yippy\".",
      "\"I did a 90-day pause for the people that didn't retaliate because I told them 'if you retaliate, we're going to double it' - and that's what I did with China,\" he said, adding that he thought, \"It's all going to work out amazing.\"",
      "He also said he thought Chinese President Xi Jinping was \"going to want to get to a deal\".",

      "The ongoing stand-off between China and the US - the world's two biggest economies - began when Trump announced new tariffs last week.",
      "China was hit with an additional 34% tariff, on top of a 20% levy the president had put in place earlier this year. However, Beijing was quick to retaliate with a 34% tariff on US imports to China.",
      "In response, Trump threatened an additional 50%, bringing the total to 104% on Tuesday, if Beijing did not back down. China did not change course and said it would \"fight to the end\" if the US \"insists on provoking a tariff war or trade war\".",
      "Just hours after the 104% tariffs from the US kicked in earlier, Beijing announced it would raise its own tariffs on American goods from 34% to 84% from Thursday.",
      "China's foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said on Wednesday the US \"continues to impose tariffs on China in an abusive manner\".",
      "He said China opposes such \"bullying practices\" and the US must show \"an attitude of equality, mutual respect, and reciprocity\" if it hopes to resolve issues through negotiation.",

      "Earlier on Wednesday, the European Union approved a first set of retaliatory tariffs against the US, due to take effect on 15 April. The bloc, on Trump's \"worst offender\" trading partner list, had been due to receive customised tariffs of 20%.",
      "But because the EU's retaliatory tariffs had not yet gone into effect, the White House included it on the list of countries to be capped at 10%.",
      "Meanwhile, the so-called baseline rate never applied to Canada and Mexico - key trading partners of the US - and a White House official has said neither is in line to receive the 10% baseline tariff now."

      "There was also an exchange of private gifts between Pope Francis and the royal visitors.",

      "\"We are both European countries,\" he said, standing in front of the Italian and European Union flags.",
      "He welcomed that the UK and Italy \"stood by Ukraine in her hour of need\", but warned that images of wars were now reverberating across the continent.",
      "\"Our younger generations can see in the news every day on their smartphones and tablets that peace is never to be taken for granted,\" said the King.",
      "Such threats meant it was important that \"Britain and Italy stand today united in defence of the democratic values we share\", he told Parliament.",
      "Delivering some of the speech in Italian, he spoke of the long history between the UK and Italy, going back to the ancient Romans arriving on Britain's \"windswept shores\".",
      "As head of the Commonwealth, he also spoke of the role of Canadian troops in helping to liberate Italy in the Second World War.",

      "According to the popular real-time flight-tracking website Flightradar24, the helicopter was in the air for about 15 minutes.",
      "It started its route heading towards the Statue of Liberty and pivoted north towards the George Washington Bridge.",
      "Then, the helicopter circled back down the Hudson along the New Jersey side and plunged into the River Hudson near a pier in Hoboken, New Jersey, at 15:15 local time (20:15 BST).",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 16:37:19 GMT",
    "summary": "Some analysts say that if costs incurred by tariffs pass to consumers, US iPhone prices could rise by hundreds of dollars.",
    "story": [
      "The world's most popular gadgets - phones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches - could be about to get a lot more expensive in the US.",
      "Many of them are made in China, which now faces a 145% tariff on its goods imported to the US, under President Donald Trump's controversial trade policy.",
      "The effect this may have on the iPhone and its maker Apple is under the spotlight - with some analysts saying if costs are passed onto consumers, iPhone prices in the US could rise by hundreds of dollars.",
      "And if the tariffs impact the value of the dollar, it could become more expensive to import iPhones and other devices around the world - potentially leading to higher prices in UK shops.",
      "Ben Wood of CCS Insight told the BBC that if tariffs remain in place, Apple may raise iPhone prices globally when the next iteration is launched.",
      "\"It is unlikely the company would want to have differentiated pricing globally,\" he said - as the tech giant would want to avoid people buying the device cheaply in the UK and selling it on for profit in the US.",
      "Though others say they believe it could result in cheaper prices if firms which normally send their goods to the US instead send them to countries which don't have such steep tariffs, like the UK.",
      "And there may be a significant change if the cost of tariffs is passed onto consumers globally - longer contracts to spread out the cost of the device.",
      "While a phone contract may typically last two years, Mr Wood said some firms already offer four year deals, and he believed \"we might see five-year contracts\" in 2025.",
      "\"One could argue it is almost like having a mortgage for your smartphone,\" he said.",
      "Where are iPhones made?",
      "The US is a major market for iPhones and Apple accounted for more than half of its smartphones sales last year, according to Counterpoint Research.",
      "It says as much as 80% of Apple's iPhones intended for US sale are made in China, with the remaining 20% made in India.",
      "Along with fellow smartphone giants such as Samsung, Apple has been trying to diversify its supply chains to avoid over-reliance on China in recent years.",
      "India and Vietnam emerged as frontrunners for additional manufacturing hubs.",
      "As tariffs took effect, Apple reportedly looked to speed up and increase its production of India-produced devices in recent days.",
      "Reuters reported on Thursday that Apple chartered cargo flights to ship more than 600 tons of iPhones from India to the US.",
      "Amid Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs, including those levied on India, the country may be set to benefit from an iPhone manufacturing boost.",
      "The BBC has approached Apple for comment on the impact of tariffs on their operations and prices, but has not had any response yet.",
      "How exposed is Apple to tariffs?",
      "Trump and his advisors have said the aim of its tariffs are to encourage more US manufacturing.",
      "However, the tech industry relies on a global network of suppliers for product components and assembly.",
      "This, and finding skilled workers to match the fast pace and low cost of production in Asia, means relocating supply chains is no simple feat.",
      "Apple committed a $500bn (\u00a3385bn) investment in the US in February - which the Trump administration believes will result in more homegrown manufacturing.",
      "But Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said shifting parts of its supply chain from cheaper manufacturing hubs in Asia to the US will take a lot of time, and money.",
      "\"The reality is it would take 3 years and $30 billion dollars in our estimation to move even 10% of its supply chain from Asia to the US with major disruption in the process,\" he wrote on X on 3 April.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Will iPhone prices go up?",
      "Apple have not revealed yet whether they plan to pass on the costs of the tariffs onto consumers in the US and increase prices.",
      "Some analysts believe Apple is in a more fortunate position than others, having reaped more money from its products than it has spent on making them.",
      "\"As a company with lucrative margins on its devices, Apple can absorb some of the tariff-induced cost increases without significant financial impact, at least in the short term,\" says Forrester principal analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee.",
      "But he notes the company's strong branding and popularity may allow it to pass some costs to consumers without too much backlash.",
      "\"The brand commands better loyalty than its competitors, and it is unlikely that a manageable price increase will send these customers fleeing into the arms of Android-based competitors.\"",
      "Some estimates suggest iPhone prices in the US could as much as triple if costs were passed to consumers.",
      "Following Trump's tariff increase on China to 125%, the cost for a China-made iPhone 16 Pro Max with 256GB storage would have surged from $1,199 to $1,999, according to estimates by investment banking firm UBS.",
      "They estimate a less significant increase on the iPhone 16 Pro 128GB storage - which is made in India - by five percent from $999 to $1046.",
      "While some analysts such as Dan Ives have suggested that the cost of a \"Made in USA\" iPhone could soar to as much as $3500.",
      "What can consumers do about it?",
      "There's still plenty of uncertainty about what happens next, and how companies like Apple will respond to tariffs remains to be seen.",
      "This hasn't stopped some US customers reportedly rushing to Apple stores to buy its smartphones.",
      "The BBC spoke to shoppers outside an Apple Store in New York who had bought products in fear of a potential price hike.",
      "Anthony Cacioppo, a 53-year-old DJ and security technician, purchased the new iPhone.",
      "\"I really didn't need a phone... but I'm not ready to pay double the price,\" he said.",
      "Bruce Conroy, a hair stylist, told the BBC that even if prices had risen considerably he \"would have stuck with Apple products\" - though potentially delayed his purchase of a new iPad.",
      "\"I bought it because the tariffs are coming, I want to buy before the prices go up and I expect they will,\" said Julia Baumann, a personal finance editor, of her new MacBook.",
      "We will likely have to wait until the autumn to see how much the next iPhone will cost.",
      "But if it looks like costs incurred by tariffs will result in higher price tags, some may look to rival handsets or second-hand devices.",
      "CCS Insight estimates that 5.5m second-hand smartphones will be sold in the UK in 2025, representing 29.7% of the total market.",
      "The iPhone remains one of the most expensive smartphones on the market - and brands such as Google and Samsung offer phones with similar features at a lower cost.",
      "The other option, and perhaps the most cost-effective, could be for people to skip upgrades to newer iPhone models and look to slightly older, cheaper versions.",
      "\"The path of least resistance would be to keep the smartphone they already have for longer,\" said Mr Wood.",

    "story": [
      "Little more than 19 months after the bloodless coup that brought an end to more than five decades of rule by the Bongo family, the people of Gabon are about to head to the polls to choose a new head of state - bucking a trend that has seen military leaders elsewhere in Africa cling on to power.",
      "The overwhelming favourite in the race on Saturday is the man who led that peaceful putsch and has dominated the political scene ever since, Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema.",
      "Having abandoned his soldier's fatigues and military status in favour of a politician's suit, this highly articulate former commander of the elite Republican Guard faces seven other candidates.",
      "Basking in popularity among a population relieved to be rid of dynastic rule - and assisted by electoral regulations that disqualified some key challengers - the 50-year-old appears almost certain to secure an outright majority in the first ballot.",
      "His campaign slogan - using his initials \"C'BON\" - is a play on the French words \"c'est bon\", meaning \"it's good\".",
      "His chances of avoiding a second round run-off are bolstered by the fact that his main challenger - one of the rare senior political or civil society figures not to have rallied to his cause - is the old regime's last prime minister, Alain-Claude Bilie-By-Nze, known by his initials ACBBN.",
      "Victory will bring a seven-year mandate and the resources to implement development and modernising reform at a pace that the rulers of crisis-beset African countries could not even dream of.",
      "With only 2.5 million people, Gabon is an established oil producer and the world's second-largest exporter of manganese.",
      "Its territory, which sits astride the equator, encompasses some of the most biodiverse tracts of the Congo Basin rainforest.",
      "And other than a harsh post-election crackdown in the capital, Libreville, in 2016, the country has enjoyed a mostly calm recent history that contrasts with the conflicts and instability that have afflicted many regional neighbours.",
      "Oligui Nguema and his Republican Guards met no resistance when they seized power on 30 August 2023, just hours after the electoral authorities had taken to the airwaves in the middle of the night to proclaim that the incumbent President, Ali Bongo Ondimba, had secured a third seven-year term with a crushing 64% of the vote.",
      "It was hard to see this official result as credible. Ali Bongo, who succeeded his father Omar in 2009, had only squeaked a narrow and much disputed victory in the previous poll, in 2016.",
      "When he suffered a stroke while visiting Saudi Arabia two years later and embarked on a painstaking gradual recovery there had been widespread popular sympathy.",
      "But the mood shifted after he decided to stand for a third term, despite his visibly frail state of health - this fuelled widespread resentment at the supposed behind-the-throne influence and ambitions of his French-born wife Sylvia and his son Nourredin Bongo Valentin.",
      "The military's peaceful intervention to forestall a continuation of the regime, arresting Sylvia and Nourredin and confining Ali in enforced retirement in his private villa, triggered spontaneous celebrations among the many Gabonese who had grown weary of this apparently immovable dynasty.",
      "And the coup was greeted with relief even by most of the administrative, political and civil society elite.",
      "Oligui Nguema took shrewd advantage, reaching out to build a broad base of support for his transitional regime. He brought former government figures, opponents and prominent hitherto critical civil society voices into the power structure or institutions such as the appointed senate.",
      "Political detainees were freed, though Ali Bongo's wife and son remain in detention awaiting trial on corruption charges.",
      "He did not resort to the sort of crackdowns on dissent or media freedom that have become a routine tool of Francophone Africa's other military leaders, in Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso and Niger.",
      "On the diplomatic front, in marked contrast to the assertively anti-Western posture adopted by the regimes in West Africa, Oligui Nguema despatched senior figures to cultivate international goodwill and reassure Gabon's traditional partners of his determination to restore civilian constitutional government within a tightly limited timeframe.",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 01:00:03 GMT",
    "summary": "There is much more to this than straightforward retaliation, writes John Sudworth, and it traces back to his first term.",
    "story": [
      "Suddenly, Donald Trump's trade war is in much sharper focus.",
      "Rather than a fight on all fronts against the world, this now looks far more like a fight on familiar Trumpian territory: America v China.",
      "The 90-day pause on the higher \"retaliatory\" tariffs levied on dozens of countries still leaves a universal across-the-board tariff of 10% in place.",
      "But China \u2013 which ships everything from iPhones to children's toys and accounts for around 14% of all US imports \u2013 has been singled out for much harsher treatment with an eye-watering rate of 125%.",
      "Trump said the increase was due to Beijing's readiness to retaliate with its own 84% levy on US goods, a move the president described as showing a \"lack of respect\".",
      "But for a politician who first fought his way to the White House on the back of an anti-China message, there is much more to this than simple retaliation.",
      "For Trump, this is about the unfinished business of that first term in office.",
      "\"We didn't have the time to do the right thing, which we're doing now,\" he told reporters.",
      "The aim is nothing less than the upending of an established system of global trade centred on China as the factory of the world, as well as the once widely held view that underpinned it \u2013 the idea that more of this trade was, in and of itself, a good thing.",
      "To understand just how central this is to the US president's thinking, you need to go back to the time before anyone ever thought of him as a possible candidate for office, let alone a likely winner.",
      "In 2012, when I first reported from Shanghai - China's business capital - increased trade with the country was seen by almost everyone \u2013 global business leaders, Chinese officials, visiting foreign governments and trade delegations, foreign correspondents and learned economists \u2013 as a no brainer.",
      "It was boosting global growth, providing an endless supply of cheap goods, enriching China's army of new factory workers increasingly embedded in global supply chains, and providing lucrative opportunities to multinational corporations selling their wares to its newly minted middle classes.",
      "Within a few of years of my arrival, China had surpassed the US to become the world's biggest market for Rolls Royce, General Motors and Volkswagen.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?US pauses higher tariffs for most countries but hits China harderTrump steps back from cliff edge of all-out global trade war",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "US pauses higher tariffs for most countries but hits China harder",
      "Trump steps back from cliff edge of all-out global trade war",
      "There was a deeper justification, too.",
      "As China got richer, so the theory went, Chinese people would begin to demand political reform.",
      "Their spending habits would also help China transition to a consumer society.",
      "But the first of those aspirations never happened, with China's ruling Communist Party only tightening its grip on power.",
      "And the second one didn't happen fast enough, with China not only still dependent on exports, but openly planning to become ever more dominant.",
      "Its infamous policy blueprint - published in 2015 and entitled Made in China 2025 - set out a huge state-backed vision of becoming a global leader in a number of key manufacturing sectors, from aerospace to ship building to electric vehicles.",
      "And so it was that same year, a political outsider launched his run for US president, making the case repeatedly on the campaign trail that China's rise had hollowed out the American economy, driven Rust Belt decline and cost blue-collar workers their livelihoods and dignity.",
      "Trump's first-term trade war broke the mould and shattered the consensus. His successor, President Joe Biden, kept much of his tariffs on China in place.",
      "And yet, even though they have undoubtedly caused China some pain, they have not done much to change the economic model.",
      "China now produces 60% of the world's electric cars \u2013 a large proportion of them made by its own homegrown brands - and 80% of the batteries that power them.",
      "So, now Trump is back, with this tit-for-tat escalation on levies.",
      "It would, arguably, be the biggest shock ever delivered to the established global trading system, were it not for all the other on-again off-again tariff measures the US president has rolled out in recent days.",
      "What happens next depends on two key questions.",
      "Firstly, whether China takes up that offer to negotiate.",
      "And secondly, assuming it eventually does, whether China is willing to make the kind of major concessions that America is looking for, including a complete overhaul of its export driven economic model.",
      "In answering them, the first thing to say is that we are in completely uncharted territory, so we should be wary of anyone who says they know how Beijing is likely to react.",
      "But there are certainly reasons to be cautious.",
      "China's vision of its economic strength - one based on strong exports and a tightly protected domestic market - is now closely bound up with its idea of national rejuvenation and the supremacy of its one-party system.",
      "Its tight control over the information sphere means it will be unlikely to drop its barriers to American technology companies, for example.",
      "But there is a third question, and it is one for America to answer.",
      "Does the US still believe in free trade? Donald Trump often suggests that tariffs are a good thing, not merely as a means to an end, but as an end in themselves.",
      "He talks about the benefit of a protectionist barrier for America, in order to stimulate domestic investment, encourage American companies to bring those foreign supply chains back home, and raise tax revenues.",
      "And if Beijing believes that is indeed the primary purpose of the tariffs, it may decide there is nothing to negotiate anyway.",
      "Rather than championing the idea of economic co-operation, the world's two biggest superpowers may find themselves locked in a fight for winner-takes-all economic supremacy.",
      "If so, that really would mark a shattering of the old consensus, and a very different, possibly very dangerous, future."

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkgm7rk3rmo",
    "published": "Wed, 09 Apr 2025 21:28:26 GMT",
    "summary": "Online apps are posing a threat to physical stores, but their presence so far is limited to big cities.",
    "story": [
      "The corner shop Ramji Dharod has manned for over six decades is now on the brink of closure.",
      "The store sits in a bylane in the central Indian city of Mumbai's busy shopping precinct, and has served the community for 75 years.",
      "Dharod began coming to the shop with his father when he was just 10. These days, he mostly sits idle, waiting for an occasional customer to walk in.",
      "Behind him, cardboard boxes of unsold biscuit packets and snacks show a \"stock clearance sale\" sign posted on them.",
      "\"I wouldn't get a minute to breathe a few years ago, but now I rarely get anyone coming,\" says the septuagenarian wryly. \"They are all shopping online. I've decided to retire and down the shutters.\"",
      "As 10-minute online deliveries by \"quick commerce\" apps like Zomato, BlinkIt and Zepto pervade urban India, hundreds of thousands of neighbourhood stores across cities have closed down.",
      "A lobby group of consumer product distributors estimated that number to be 200,000 last October, while the municipal body of the southern city of Chennai estimated 20% of small grocers and 30% of larger departmental stores had shut down in the city in the past 5 years.",
      "Sunil Kenia who runs a provision store right beside Dharod's shop says he's still in business only because his family owns the shop. Those on rent are no longer able to stay afloat, he says.",
      "\"It started going downhill after the Covid lockdowns. Business is at 50% of what we did before the pandemic,\" Kenia told the BBC.",
      "Most of his revenue now comes from wholesale customers \u2013 hawkers or those selling street-side snacks. The retail customer has all but \"vanished\", he says, because of the convenience of mobile deliveries.",
      "Mumbai-based graphic designer Monisha Sathe is among the millions of urban Indians who've stopped their weekly run to the market because of the ease of quick commerce.",
      "\"Lugging groceries back home was a big pain,\" says Sathe. And occasionally, when she took out her car, navigating narrow market lanes and finding a parking slot would be a challenge.",
      "Sathe says she misses the human interaction she had with the grocers and vegetable vendors and even the variety of fresh produce on sale \u2013 but for her, the balance still tilts in favour of online deliveries because of how much easier it has made her life.",
      "A recent survey by consultancy PwC shows some 42% of urban consumers in India's big cities think like Sathe, especially preferring quick delivery for their urgent needs. And these shifts in buying behaviour have led to three out of 10 retailers reporting a negative impact on their business, with a 52% drop in essential goods sales.",
      "But to what extent is quick commerce really hollowing out the Indian high street?",
      "There's no doubt general trade \u2013 which includes grocery stores, corner shops and even big retail outlets \u2013 has come under threat, says Ankur Bisen, a partner at Technopak retail advisory. But at least for now \"quick commerce is still a three-four city story\", he says. Nearly all of their sales come from these cities.",
      "Lightning fast deliveries bucked the global trend and became successful in India largely due to a large concentration of people staying in urban clusters.",
      "They are serviced through low-rent \"dark stores\" - or small shops dedicated to delivery and not open to the public - in densely populated areas, enabling economies of scale.",
      "But the precarious nature of demand and fragmented demographics of smaller towns could make it expensive for quick commerce players to expand and make money beyond the metros, says Mr Bisen.",
      "There's little doubt though that these online deliveries will disrupt trade in the longer run.",
      "Bain and Company expects quick commerce to grow at over 40% annually through to 2030, driven by expansion across \"geographies\".",
      "And this has made traditional retail nervous.",
      "Trade organisations - like the Confederation of All India Traders, or the All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation which calls itself the voice of India's 13m retailers - have made urgent and repeated pleas to the government against this breakneck expansion.",
      "They allege that these companies are using billions of dollars in venture capital funds to engage in anti-competitive practices like \"predatory pricing\" or \"deep discounting\" which has further distorted the playing field for mom-and-pop shops.",
      "The BBC spoke to several small retailers who shared these concerns. Mr Bisen too agreed there's evidence of such practices in the clusters that quick commerce companies operate.",
      "Swiggy, Zepto and Blinkit, who primarily control this market, did not agree to comment on the BBC's queries on these allegations.",
      "But a source within one of the quick commerce companies told the BBC the discounting was done by traders on the platform and not by them.",
      "The source also said that contrary to the binary narrative of the \"big guy versus small guy\", online deliveries were solving real-world challenges for people for whom going to the market was a \"traumatic\" experience.",
      "\"Think of women or senior citizens - they don't want to be harassed or navigate potholes and traffic,\" the source said. \"Also consider the small brands that sell on our platform - they never get shelf space in physical shops where only the big names are displayed. We've democratised the market.\"",
      "Analysts say, the sheer diversity of India in terms of its stages of development, levels of income and infrastructure will mean that in the end all retail models - small corner shops, organised big retailers and quick commerce platforms - will cohabit in the country.",
      "This is not a \"winner takes all market\", says Mr Bisen, giving the example of e-commerce which came into India in 2010 and was meant to sound the death knell of local retailers.",
      "Even after all these years, only 4% of all shopping is done online in India.",
      "But the ripples caused by quick commerce should be a warning for physical retailers, say analysts, to improve their marketing and integrate technology to use both online and offline channels to give their consumers a better shopping experience.",
      "Competing with click-of-a-button delivery means it can no longer be business as usual for the millions of corner shops who've existed for decades, with little or no innovation.",

      "When F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote \"The Great Gatsby\" at the height of the roaring '20s, he couldn't possibly realize that the book would emerge as one of the very top contenders for \"the great American novel.\"",
      "In fact, when Fitzgerald \u2013 a St. Paul, Minnesota native whose debut novel \"This Side of Paradise\" launched him into national prominence at the age of 24 \u2013 died in 1940 at the early age of 44, the book was already in danger of falling into obscurity.",
      "Now, 100 years after the book's first publication on April 10, 1925, it endures as one of the country's foremost tales of American hubris, modern yearning and class consciousness. And its clear-eyed assessment of the attainability of the American dream remains incisive with each passing decade.",
      "Fitzgerald's book, long a staple in high school literature classes, tells the story of Nick Carraway, a Midwesterner (and veiled Fitzgerald stand-in) who becomes enamored with the bon vivant, Jazz Age lifestyle on Long Island, specifically the effects of mutli-millioniare Jay Gatsby.",
      "Like Carraway, Gatsby is a Midwesterner who has trekked to the East Coast to make a name for himself. It's Carraway's cousin Daisy Buchanan who serves as the catalyst for Gatsby's downfall, and ultimately Carraway's own disillusionment. All the while, a symbolic green light beckons from the distance.",
      "When the book was first published, reviews were largely positive, though not unanimous. Fitzgerald, who originally wanted to title the book \"Trimalchio in West Egg\" before being persuaded to go with a title he thought far more generic, watched as the book languished on the vine commercially, selling fewer than 25,000 copies in the initial push.",
      "He would only complete one further novel in his lifetime: 1934's \"Tender is the Night,\" a thinly-veiled roman \u00e0 clef of Fitzgerald's own marriage to socialite Zelda Sayre, detailing their mutual descent into alcoholism and mental illness. Fitzgerald's early death from a heart attack was likely fuelled by years and years of alcohol abuse. Ironically, he'd gone sober just ahead of the cardiac event.",
      "If \"The Great Gatsby\" never achieved the level of esteem it now enjoys during the author's own life, it wasn't long after his death that Fitgerald's literary reputation took off.",
      "When the Modern Library asked authors, historians, critics and publishers on the eve of Y2K to rank their picks for the world's best novels of the 20th century, it was \"The Great Gatsby\" that\u00a0stood above all other U.S. contenders near the top of the poll. (The novel landed in second place, bookended by Irish author James Joyce's \"Ulysses\" and \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" in the top three.)",
      "The novel has since launched multiple film adaptations, has been transposed to the stage, and since going into the public domain in 2021, has been the subject of an endless array of reimaginings, remixes and mashups. It's even cleared space around itself as a modern-day meme, in the form of an animated .GIF depicting Leonardo Dicaprio (playing Gatsby in Baz Luhrmann's 2013 film adaptation) smirking as he offers a champagne toast flanked by ostentatious fireworks.",
      "Host of \"Gatsby\" centennial events planned in New York, Minnesota",
      "A host of \"Gatsby\"-themed events are planned to mark the novel's centennial anniversary. In New York, the Empire State Building announced plans to light up in green Thursday, in a nod to the novel's symbolic green light at the end of Tom and Daisy's dock.",
      "There is also a rowdy \"Roaring Twenties\" party scheduled at the Empire Steak House in New York, which was an opulent opera house in Fitzgerald's era. Billed as the \"nation's most extravagant celebration,\" the event will feature live jazz, period dancing, and speeches from officials with the New York Public Library.",
      "In Fitzgerald's hometown of St. Paul, the events include a new exhibit of the author's life and times at the Minnesota History Center, as well as various, less-than-sober events leaning into the novel's party-friendly Prohibition-era setting.",

      "The author described her mother's \"fluid\" relationship with reality, saying in the book that \"mom's relationship with reality was fluid. Truth was fed through the meat grinder of mental illness.\"",
      "She detailed both emotional and physical abuse in her childhood home. Hanks explained that in California during the late 1980s, family law typically required evidence of physical abuse before a child could be removed from a situation.",
      "\"Family law in California in the late '80s wasn't enough room for it. At that time, you kind of had to have the receipts of physical abuse to get pulled out of a situation. And once we crossed that rubicon is when I moved to Los Angeles,\" she said.",
      "What Hanks learned about her mother",
      "Despite the difficult relationship, Hanks said she remained protective of her mother. In writing the memoir, she incorporated her mother's poetry as a way to reconnect with her.",
      "\"At the time, my mom kind of had this stance like a thoroughbred who had been put out to pasture too soon, and she didn't get her chance as an artist because of my dad's, as I describe it, catastrophic fame,\" Hanks said. \"I think including her poetry in the book is a way of treating her seriously as an artist and getting back into conversation with her. And anybody who's buried a parent knows that a two-way conversation suddenly becomes a one-way conversation.\"",
      "When asked about the truth she now understands, Hanks reflected, \"The truth is, my mother had good days and bad days. And I was lucky to experience the good days, and I was shaped by the bad days. All of the care and protection I had for the child that I was doesn't diminish what happened between us. But it means that as I get older, there's more wiggle room and acceptance for her flaws and mine.\"",
      "The memoir also explores themes of place and identity. As a journalist accustomed to interviewing others, Hanks discovered, \"When you're talking to stone-cold strangers, you can't start with, 'Tell me about your mom,' but you can start with, 'Tell me where you're from.' If someone wants to talk about their hometown, it's an elevator to their deepest self.\"",
      "She added, \"Identity and where you're from, that's the whole story. I learned that I'm the product of where I'm from.\"",

      "\"Hey, Mr. Wilson!\"\u00a0\u00a0Jay North (Aug. 3, 1951-April 6, 2025), who began appearing on kids' TV shows when he was 5, had already played small roles on \"77 Sunset Strip\" and \"Wanted: Dead or Alive\" when he was cast, at age 6, as the bright-eyed troublemaker in the TV adaptation of Hank Ketcham's comic strip \"Dennis the Menace.\" The series ran on CBS for four years beginning in 1959, but Dennis continued to strike terror in the heart of his elderly neighbor, George Wilson, for years after in syndication.",
      "The stardom came at a cost to the child. He told the Los Angeles Daily News in 1993 that he had been abused by his aunt and uncle, who would be with him on set while North's single mom was at work. \"If it took me more than one or two takes, I would be threatened and then whacked,\" North said.",
      "His other TV and film credits in the 1960s and early '70s included \"Wagon Train,\" \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,\" \"Maya,\" and voice work for \"The Banana Splits Adventure Hour\" and \"The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show.\"",
      "After appearing on stage in \"Butterflies Are Free,\" North had a brief stint in the Navy in the 1970s, and tried to return to show business with more mature, darker roles. Aside from a 1985 Yugoslavian World War II film, \"Wild Wind,\" North's appearances were mostly playing off his child actor past. He satirized his Dennis the Menace role on HBO's \"Not Necessarily the News,\" and played himself in a 1999 episode of \"The Simpsons\" and the David Spade comedy \"Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star.\"",
      "He also helped counsel other child and former child actors through the nonprofit organization A Minor Consideration."

      "Commit to What Matters",
      "I had come from a world of higher-end restaurants, of finesse and creativity. So a tapas restaurant was not exactly what I was looking for. But my new partners in Washington, DC, had a clear idea: they wanted to open a Spanish restaurant that was fun. They called it Jaleo, which means \"merrymaking, a joyful celebration,\" inspired by the John Singer Sargent painting of a Spanish woman dancing to guitars. It lives in Boston, but it had traveled on loan to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, and they had seen it there. They even painted a reproduction of it on a wall of the new restaurant.",
      "I understood that sense of joy. I'm the kind of guy who doesn't like tables. I prefer standing up at bars. If I can, I like to hop around to five different bars and eat good food at each one. Jaleo was a chance to show how I like to enjoy life. These little plates of tapas were also a chance to give people more access to different bites of Spanish food, different tastes of the various regions of Spain. Maybe people didn't know what they wanted to eat, and the small plates would be a way to move a little bit further out of their comfort zones. Of course, it was an opportunity to make a mark for myself. And I could do that while being a kind of ambassador for my country, in the capital of the United States, not too far from the White House and the US Capitol. It felt like an extension of my military service, going from port to port on a historic tall-mast ship, showing the best of Spain to the world.",
      "I knew there were immigrants before me who had brought Spanish food to every corner of America. They opened restaurants, maybe some of them played guitar or danced flamenco. They were mythical places. Tio Pepe in Baltimore. Caf\u00e9 San Martin in New York. Montse Guill\u00e9n's El Internacional in Tribeca, which was short-lived but put Spanish food and drink on the map. There was already a high-end Spanish restaurant in Washington called Taberna del Alabardero, and the more informal Churreria Madrid in Adams Morgan.",
      "Washington at that time was not seen as a culinary mecca, even by the people of DC, and Jaleo opened in a downtown neighborhood, known as Penn Quarter, that was empty at night. But it would not stay that way. It would become a very important part of the city, not too far away from where all the big decisions were made that affected the country and the world. It was a part of the city where senators, congressmen, lobbyists, and business executives would gather. It was the home of new businesses like America Online, and so many other amazing new companies. Slowly but surely, Jaleo became a huge success.",
      "That's not to say it was easy. I was young, just twenty-three years old, and I was still learning how to run a kitchen. The movie in my head cast me as the creative guy, but now I needed to learn how to run the place. Fortunately, I had a wonderful, patient teacher: Ann Cashion, who was the first executive chef of Jaleo, showed me how to do the job properly, even though I preferred the creative side of things.",
      "We didn't really know whether American diners would accept these little plates, or the idea of sharing plates at all. What happened if people didn't want to share? Our waiters were concerned and would often tell me how some people said they weren't comfortable with sharing. I had a simple answer. If they didn't want to share, they could move the plate ten inches closer to them and use their knife and fork to protect the dish for themselves. I wasn't going to Americanize tapas for them. It's what we did in the south of Spain and in Catalonia. They would adapt because it was a fun way to be with friends. Who doesn't want to dig a fork into the plate of the person across the table?",
      "My heart was full of the joy that comes from introducing Spanish food to new people. That joy translated into happy guests eating the dishes I knew. Jaleo was a place where I could share what I knew about Spanish food: croquetas, gazpacho, gambas al ajillo, sangria. But it was also a way to learn more about what I didn't know about Spanish food. I had not traveled all across Spain at the age of twenty-three, nor did I know about all of Spanish gastronomy. Far from it. The reality is that you need to keep learning in any line of work. People say I'm one of the biggest experts in Spanish cooking, but I still feel clueless sometimes. Every time I go back to Spain and discover a new ingredient or a new dish, it feels to me the same as looking at the stars. You can see a few, but how many more are out there that you cannot see? You can read books, and you can travel, but learning is a lifetime of curiosity and discovery.",
      "Sometimes that work can feel less joyful and more of struggle. In particular, in those early days, it was a struggle to buy the right ingredients. Believe it or not, I'm a pragmatic guy. You can support the local economy, buying local fruit and vegetables for instance. But there are some ingredients that cannot be replaced. I observed the success of Italy, where they have been amazingly successful in supporting the small towns where their unique food products are made. I believed we could do the same for the small towns and food producers of Spain. Manchego cheese is like no other. Sweet roasted piquillo peppers are unique. Our olive oil is the envy of Europe, and even gets repackaged under Italian names. Our sherry vinegar is unmatched. And nothing compares to our pure-bred Ib\u00e9rico ham, the very best ham in the world. You can't have Spanish cooking without some of the staples. It was a symbiotic relationship.",
      "Still, importing food is not always easy. There are regulations and policies, rules to protect consumers and businesses. The US Department of Agriculture insists that slaughterhouses operate according to American standards, not European ones, if they want to sell their meat in the United States. They need to be inspected, even though Europeans have been eating these foods for centuries without any problems. It was crazy but also fascinating. Of course, it wasn't just a question of safety; there were concerns that ham from Spain would hurt ham in America. So one day I met a bearded man visiting Washington, and he happened to be a great Ib\u00e9rico ham producer who was investing to comply with US regulations at his slaughterhouse: Santiago Mart\u00edn, the owner of Embutidos Ferm\u00edn. I helped producers like Santiago navigate these challenges with Congress and the administration, finding a lawyer who assisted the Italians in bringing Parma ham to America. Because in reality these European hams were much more expensive than the American hams, and they helped elevate the perception of all pork products in America. It was a win-win for America and Spain.",
      "That's the world of work. Your commitment to your values, to what's important, can turn a seemingly small decision\u2014like buying a type of roasted pepper or a slice of ham\u2014into something as big as international relations.",
      "Your sense of responsibility is what matters. How was I going to be a Spanish chef without all these ingredients? I had to do the work, just like other chefs and importers who made Spanish food available in the United States. People like Tim Harris, who created the incredible Spanish food store La Tienda, and Juana Gimeno Faraone, who started La Espa\u00f1ola Meats. Or Almudena de Llaguno and Steve Metzler bringing Spanish wines to America; and Jorge Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, who would walk the streets of Manhattan with a big bag filled with wine bottles, trying to get his wines into a few restaurants. The whole ecosystem of Spanish food people kept me going, and I needed to play my part, too.",
      "So Jaleo became much more than a restaurant; it was a way to build bridges between these two countries, to inspire American chefs to buy and cook with Spanish ingredients, to spread the culture that made me who I am. Something like 80 percent of all restaurants close before they reach their five-year anniversary. Jaleo has now been open for thirty years, and we have new Jaleos in Orlando, Las Vegas, and even Dubai. Because we committed from the first year to what we value\u2014to what matters\u2014even when we didn't yet have all the expertise to make it happen.",
      "I feel a sense of joy when I see Ib\u00e9rico ham, or Spanish anchovies, or wines from the Bierzo region in restaurants and shops. I know that nothing would have happened without the persistence and vision of so many people who may now be forgotten. They built the bridges that will last forever\u2014because they cared so deeply.",
      "Follow what you feel is your purpose\u2014not what others tell you to do. Otherwise you lose your soul and become a commodity. Don't be a commodity. Be true to yourself.",

      "The nation's 988 hotline works like 911, bringing critical access to care for those battling mental health emergencies. Counselor Alejandra takes calls at the nation's largest suicide prevention center \u2014 Los Angeles' Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services. That one center receives 20,000 calls and texts a month.",
      "Alejandra said they became a counselor because they have \"personal experience with suicidal thoughts.\"",

      "\"I know what it's like to go through this, or not feel comfortable reaching out,\" Alejandra told CBS News.",
      "\"When someone calls prevention, they're already breaking through a lot of barriers and a lot of stigma,\" Alejandra said. \"So there is vulnerability and courage in those first few of moments. I breathe deeply because those are the moments where you show someone, 'I'm glad you called.'\"",

      "\"Since 2022, 12 million people have contacted 988 for help. So what that tells us is that people want the help,\" said Didi Hirsch CEO Lyn Morris, noting that these calls are oftentimes literal life or death situations.",
      "\"We have dealt with people calling our line who have either taken measures to end their life or are sitting at home with a gun in their lap,\" she said.",
      "A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association outlines that, while calls have gone up, access to care after those initial calls has not increased. The study's authors are pushing for more awareness and funding to make 988 more effective for those in need.",

      "More than 10% of the staff working for the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA, which oversees the 988 hotline, were fired last month amid cuts by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. One SAMHSA employee said about a quarter of the agency's communication team, who work to raise awareness about the hotline, were let go.",
      "\"The ultimate goal is for all Americans to have access to crisis care for mental health and substance use issues, in the way that 911 provides rapid response for physical health emergencies,\" SAMHSA told CBS News in a statement. \"The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration is working diligently to support the development and sustainability of local treatment and support connected to 988, including the expansion of mobile crisis services and 24/7 walk-in crisis care clinics across the country. Transformation of this scale and building a cohesive crisis care system takes time, and there is more work needed to be able to deliver these critical services to the American public.\"",
      "Morris said additional cuts could lead to \"a very dire situation.\"",
      "\"If there was any funding cut to 988 or other mental health services, there would be more hospitalizations, more death, and more mental health issues,\" she said.",

There have been cases in at least 21 states, including Texas, California, Florida, Georgia, New Mexico and New York. The CBS News data team is tracking confirmed measles cases nationwide as state health departments and the CDC continue to release data. This map is updated with new data from the CDC on Fridays.",

    "summary": "Consumers fraudulently enrolled in Affordable Care Act coverage could receive unexpected tax bills \u2014 possibly their only clue they've been victimized.",
    "story": [
      "Because of past fraud by rogue brokers, some Affordable Care Act policyholders may get an unexpected tax bill this season.",
      "But that isn't the only potential shock. Other changes coming soon - stemming from proposals by the administration of President Donald Trump - could affect their coverage and its cost. And sorting out related problems and challenges may take longer as federal workers are laid off and funding for assistance programs is cut.",
      "First up: taxes",
      "Tax season is when some consumers learn they were fraudulently enrolled in an ACA plan or switched to a different one without their knowledge.",
      "Those unauthorized enrollments or changes took off in late 2023 and continued through last year, drawing more than 274,000 complaints in the first eight months of 2024 to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, mostly about rogue agents or call centers.",
      "Tax problems can arise if those enrollments resulted in premium tax credits exceeding the amount the consumer should have received. In those cases, consumers may have to pay all or part of those credits back. The amount owed could range from a few hundred dollars to thousands, with some caps based on income.",
      "The first clue some people have is when they get a 1095-A form in the mail.",
      "Those documents are sent out by the state and federal marketplaces to the IRS and ACA enrollees, showing any tax credit payments made to health insurers on a taxpayer's behalf. Taxpayers use the premium tax credit information from the 1095-A when completing their return.",
      "Returns can be held up if the IRS has information indicating the taxpayer has ACA coverage that they failed to report on their return, or if there are other discrepancies.",
      "The Biden administration last year took steps to slow the fraudulent switching, including requiring a three-way call between the broker, client, and marketplace for some enrollment issues.",
      "\"While we may be seeing less [fraud], we're still dealing with 2024 taxes,\" said Erin Kinard, director of systems and intake for the Health and Economic Opportunity Program at Pisgah Legal Services, a nonprofit serving western North Carolina that offers both legal help and assistance with ACA problems.",
      "Consumers who suspect they were fraudulently enrolled should immediately call their federal or state ACA marketplace, experts say. Some consumers will be referred to special federal caseworkers throught he marketplaces. But some of those caseworkers are now part of the broad reduction in force by theTrump administration.",
      "In recent days, \"they laid off two divisions on the Affordable Care Act side,\" said Jeffrey Grant, who oversaw ACA issues as CMS' deputy director for operations in the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight before leaving in February.",
      "With fewer caseworkers, \"it will take longer to get problems taken care of,\" said Grant, who is now president of Schedule F Healthcare Strategies, a consulting group that aims to help laid-off federal workers find new jobs. \"The marketplace is twice as big as it was the last time the Trump administration was here, and now they are cutting caseworkers to less than were around then.\"",

      "And these cases are difficult because the rogue brokers who enrolled consumers sometimes misstated their income so they would qualify for the largest tax credits possible. Other consumers have found they were enrolled even though they had affordable employer coverage, making them ineligible for ACA subsidies.",
      "That's what happened to Anthony Akra and his wife, Ashley Zukoski, in Charlotte, North Carolina. They were enrolled in a plan without their knowledge in 2023, by a broker in Florida with whom they had never spoken. The couple had health insurance through Zukoski's employer. The broker listed an income that qualified the household for a large subsidy that fully offset the monthly premium cost, so the couple never received a bill. One day, a 1095-A form showed up in their mailbox.",
      "\"I didn't know what the hell it was,\" said Akra, who said the form showed that he had been receiving hundreds of dollars a month in premium tax credits.",
      "He would owe a big chunk of that back unless he could get the plan retroactively canceled. Because their pharmacy, part of a national chain, had switched them to the new plan, also without telling them, they had used the new coverage every time they filled a prescription. That inadvertent use of the policy complicated their efforts to get the fraudulent coverage revoked.",
      "Meanwhile, the IRS withheld more than $4,000 from their tax refund based on the information sent through that 1095-A form.\u00a0 Months passed, but with assistance from a \"navigator\" program \u2014 a government-fundednonprofit that helps people deal with insurance problems \u2014 they were able to get the incorrectinsurance canceled and a refund at the end of October.",
      "It is not unusual for people to spend weeks or even months trying to sort out the mess, said Kinard, whose organization is similar to the one that helped Akra.",
      "While navigator programs nationwide are still operating to help people sign up for health coverage or address issues, the Trump administration has targeted their funding for a 90% cut. Meanwhile, ACA enrollees may face a range of other surprises due to policy and budget steps proposed by the Trump administration.",
      "More Potential Changes",
      "Congress must decide whether to extend premium tax credits that were enhanced during the covid pandemic, which expanded eligibility for the credits and made them larger for many enrollees. Keeping them in place would be expensive, with the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation estimating it would add $335 billion to the deficit through 2034.",
      "That debate will come amid another deficit-affecting decision: whether to extend tax cuts enacted during the first Trump administration, which would add trillions to the budget deficit through 2034.",
      "If the enhanced subsidies are not renewed, monthly premium costs would rise by an average of over 75%, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. Premiums could more than double in some states, including many GOP-led ones, such as Texas, Mississippi, Utah, Wyoming, and West Virginia.",
      "That could spark a political backlash. Additionally, the enhanced subsidies are seen as a main reason for strong enrollment growth, leading to more than 24 million people signing up for ACA plans for this year.",
      "A recent KFF study found the 15 states with the most enrollment growth since 2020 were all won by Trump in 2024.",
      "A proposed rule released last month by the Trump administration includes provisions to shorten the annual enrollment period, get rid of a special open enrollment period that allows low-income people to sign up year-round, and require stricter verification of income and other information when people apply for coverage. The administration says most of these steps are needed to reduce fraud in the system.",
      "The administration estimates that 750,000 to 2 million fewer people would enroll in coverage as a result of the changes.",
      "The new rule, if finalized, will make it harder for people to enroll, said Xonjenese Jacobs, director of Florida Covering Kids & Families at the University of South Florida College of Public Health. Losing the year-round enrollment for very low-income people, for example, would affect people short on cash who move often to stay with relatives or friends, and those who have unsteady employment, making it hard to know when or where to enroll and what their income might be in the coming year.",
      "\"They don't have the same ability to plan,\" Jacobs said. \"It's definitely going to make a difference for a lot of the individuals that we service.\""

      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. first said Sunday that the CDC would be redeploying to Texas at its governor's request, after another unvaccinated child died in the measles outbreak. An 8-year-old girl was the second fatality there this year.",
      "\"Once the assessment is complete, more CDC staff will be sent to Texas per Sec. Kennedy's order and the governor's request. The first teams deployed to Texas arrived on March and returned to CDC on April 1,\" McDonald said.",
      "Multiple agency staff working on the CDC's measles response were among the thousands cut from the agency last week, officials have told CBS News.",
      "A handful of employees at agencies within the department have been brought back to work so far, multiple officials said, at least through the end of the 60 day period before their layoff notices formally take effect.",
      "McDonald did not comment on whether laid-off staff who had been working on the agency's measles response would be among those Kennedy might reinstate.",
      "The ongoing outbreak in Texas and neighboring states has driven this year's tally of U.S. measles cases to the highest levels seen since a large wave of cases in 2019, which was the worst in the U.S. in decades.",
      "While dozens of measles cases are reported every year, usually linked to undervaccinated travelers returning from trips outside the country, health authorities have warned that ongoing community spread of the virus this year is now threatening America's status of having eliminated endemic spread of the virus.",
      "There have been six measles outbreaks so far this year, a CDC spokesperson told CBS News on Friday. The outbreak in Texas and neighboring states makes up the majority of cases. Smaller outbreaks are also ongoing in New Jersey, Georgia, Ohio and Kansas.",

      "Kennedy calls vaccine \"most effective way\" to stop measles spread",
      "While in Texas, Kennedy also posted on X that the \"most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.\" The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella, and is normally given in two doses in early childhood.",
      "Kennedy's range of statements about the measles vaccine in recent weeks have drawn scrutiny from health experts, including after a Fox News interview in which he falsely inflated the shot's risks.",
      "In a later post, Kennedy also said he had met with \"two extraordinary healers\" who he said have \"healed some 300 measles-stricken Mennonite children using aerosolized budesonide and clarithromycin.\"",
      "Budesonide can sometimes help to treat respiratory illnesses, reducing inflammation in the lungs, said pediatrics professor Dr. James Campbell of the University of Maryland in an email in March. CBS News reached out to Campbell after Kennedy previously hailed \"miraculous and instantaneous recovery\" from use of these treatments.",
      "\"In 2025, we should not have to treat measles in the US because it is completely preventable, but of course, like all preventable diseases, we do,\" said Campbell.",
      "Campbell is vice chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee that develops recommendations for treating measles and other infectious diseases.",
      "Clarithromycin, an antibacterial drug, has no effect on viruses like measles but can be used by doctors to treat coinfections from some bacterial pneumonias that sometimes develop in infected children, Campbell said. However, it does not work for all bacteria.",
      "\"These choices should be made on an individual basis by the doctors, not as sweeping recommendations for all children with measles,\" said Campbell. He said that the drugs don't have evidence proving they should be used as routine treatments for measles and cautioned against \"sweeping statements about how those singular choices related to treatment of measles in general.\"",
      "\"Vaccination will prevent measles, but for those who do get measles, rigorous studies, and not anecdotal reports, will help us to better treat them,\" said Campbell.",
      "Kennedy's embrace of alternative therapies has been contradicted by other health experts, including former Trump administration officials.",

    "summary": "Inflation cooled in March, but economists expect prices to reaccelerate as some of President Trump's tariffs kick in.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index in March rose 2.4% on an annual basis, showing progress in the Federal Reserve's battle to bring down inflation to a 2% rate.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was forecast to rise 2.6% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in those prices over time.",
      "March's report comes after\u00a0inflation rose 2.8% on an annual basis in February.",
      "On a monthly basis, prices actually fell 0.1% in March, the first monthly drop in nearly five years.",
      "Inflation eased last month due partly to lower fuel prices, with gasoline tumbling 9.8% on an annual basis, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said.",
      "Another reason prices fell was sharp drops in travel-related costs, including airfares, which decreased 5.3% just from February to March. Hotel room prices dropped 3.5%.",
      "Economists said those declines in part reflected much slower international demand as the number of tourists visiting the United States has fallen sharply amid Trump's aggressive trade policy.",
      "Visits to the United States from overseas fell nearly 12% last month, according to government data.",
      "What experts say",
      "Easing inflation combined with President Trump's announcement yesterday of a 90-day pause in his reciprocal tariffs should help alleviate some concerns for the Federal Reserve when it meets on May 7 to make its next interest rate decision, said Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank.",
      "But because other tariffs orchestrated by Mr. Trump have recently gone into effect \u2014 such as auto tariffs \u2013 inflation nevertheless could pick up later this year, experts say.",
      "Yet March's data is \"backward looking\" and doesn't reflect the trade policy changes orchestrated by the Trump administration, noted Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs are still expected to lift inflation later in the year as the impact of the import duties trickle through the economy. Because tariffs are paid by U.S. importers like Walmart when they accept shipments of foreign goods, they typically pass off all or some of the tariff cost onto consumers through higher prices.",
      "The president's 90-day pause excludes China, a major exporter to the U.S., which will continue to face tariffs of 125% on its goods. And Mr. Trump's 10% universal duty will also likely to push up prices in the coming months, economists say. The higher import taxes will likely weigh on the economy's growth as well.",
      "What the CPI shows about egg prices",
      "Although consumer prices cooled in March, the CPI data showed egg prices continued to inch higher last month. According to the CPI figures, egg prices increased in March to reach a new record-high of $6.23 despite a drop in wholesale prices and no egg farms having bird flu outbreaks.",
      "More recently, grocers have told CBS News that egg prices are\u00a0showing signs of easing.",
      "Bird flu outbreaks were cited as the major cause of price spikes in January and February after more than 30 million egg-laying chickens were killed to prevent the spread of the disease.",
      "Since the current bird flu outbreak began, more than 168 million birds have been slaughtered, most of them egg-laying chickens. Any time a bird gets sick, the entire flock is killed to help keep bird flu from spreading. That can have an effect on the egg supply because massive egg farms may have millions of birds.",
      "What the CPI means for your money",
      "Despite today's cooler-than-expected CPI numbers, inflationary risks are still a threat to the U.S. economy, especially as some of Mr. Trump's tariffs are still in place while others are merely delayed, experts say.",
      "\"Going forward, the Fed is likely to face a difficult trade-off as tariff-driven price increases start to feed through to the inflation data and activity remains soft,\" Haigh said. \"We expect the Fed's initial reaction to be cautious, but the risks remain that a sharper than expected slowdown in the economy could result in a resumption of the Fed's easing cycle.\"",
      "Three of four economists polled by FactSet expect the Fed will hold rates steady at its next meeting on May 7. The current federal funds \u2014 the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 now stands in a range 4.5% to 4.75%.",
      "That means consumers and businesses are unlikely to see any relief on loan rates in the near term, although economists are penciling in cuts later in the year, with the majority forecasting a reduction at the Fed's June 18 meeting.",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 18:45:25 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump had brushed off the stock market's plunge, but turmoil in the bond market got his administration's attention.",
    "story": [
      "Even as stocks plunged in reaction to his administration's sweeping tariffs, President Trump expressed\u00a0confidence in his trade policies, saying last week that \"markets are going to boom.\" But by Wednesday, a collective thumb's down to the tariffs by bond investors had given Mr. Trump pause.",
      "With U.S. and global financial market tumbling, he abruptly suspended his administration's \"reciprocal tariffs\" on dozens of other countries for 90 days, acknowledging that the bond market was \"getting a little queasy.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's about-face was by no means the first time a sitting American president had blinked in the face of bond investors expressing alarm over U.S. policies they viewed as fiscally reckless and harmful to their portfolios. In their first terms, both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama also found themselves knocked back when the bond market rebelled at the cost of some of their strategic priorities.",
      "The \"bond vigilantes\" ride again",
      "Americans might think of bonds as a less risky asset class they turn to in their 401(k)s to offset more volatile investments, such as stock. But the $2.8 trillion Treasury market is also a bedrock of the U.S. government. The federal government finances the country's debt by selling Treasury bills to investors, who prize the asset because of the country's sterling credit rating and its guarantee of making good on interest payments.",
      "As the Trump administration's reciprocal tariffs went into effect on Wednesday, the bond prices slid and the yield on 2-year Treasury notes rose by as much as 0.3 percentage points, marking the biggest intraday move since 2009, according to financial data firm FactSet. (Bond prices move in inverse relation to their interest rates, or yields.)",
      "Such sudden moves can signal that investors are dumping their bonds. That pushes bond prices lower but boosts yields, which are the returns that bond holders pay to investors.",
      "\"Why is this happening? Fixed-income investors may be starting to worry that the Chinese and other foreigners might start selling their U.S. Treasuries,\" economist Ed Yardeni said in an April 8 research note.",
      "Yardeni, who coined the term \"bond vigilantes\" in the 1980s to describe fixed-income investors who express their disapproval of government policies by dumping Treasuries, added that the bond market was cautioning that \"the Trump administration may be playing with liquid nitro.\"",
      "In another report after Mr. Trump announced the tariff pause, Yardeni noted, \"The Bond Vigilantes have struck again. As far as we can tell, at least with respect to U.S. financial markets, they are the only 1.000 hitters in history.\"",
      "Some Trump administration officials acknowledged that the bond market's hostile reaction to the tariffs influenced the decision to pause the tariffs.",
      "\"[The] bond market was telling us, 'Hey, it is probably time to move,'\" White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett\u00a0said\u00a0on CNBC on Thursday.",
      "Soon after Mr. Trump announced his April 2 tariffs, economists raised concerns\u00a0about the potential impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "The president claimed the tariffs, which he called \"reciprocal\" because they were aimed at equalizing the trade barriers between the U.S. and its trading partners, would help revive manufacturing to the U.S. and raise revenue for the federal government.",
      "But experts warned that the tariffs, which ranged from a baseline 10% for most nations up to more than 100% for Chinese imports, raised the risks of a recession and would likely reignite inflation. Investors dumped stocks and bonds as they digested the economic risks of Mr. Trump's tariff barrage.",
      "While the stock market plunge hurt millions of Americans' retirement savings, the turmoil in the bond market creates very real pressures on the nation's finances. Because the Treasury Department pays interest to debt holders, any increase in yields puts more financial strain on the nation's coffers.",
      "\"Developments in the last 24 hours suggest we may be headed for serious financial crisis wholly induced by U.S. government tariff policy,\" Harvard University economist and former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers\u00a0said\u00a0in an April 9 thread on social media.",
      "He added, \"Long-term interest rates are gapping up, even as the stock market moves sharply downwards. This highly unusual pattern suggests a generalized aversion to U.S. assets in global financial markets.  We are being treated by global financial markets like a problematic emerging market.\"",
      "An expensive problem",
      "Given the size of the Treasury market, the surging bond yields and broader market turmoil could create an expensive problem for the federal government. For Mr. Trump, the timing was especially poor as he pushes Congress to pass an extension of his 2017 tax cuts, which are forecast to cost trillions over the next decade.",
      "In 2024, the U.S. spent more than $1 trillion to service its debt, more than double its roughly $500 billion in 2020, according to Treasury data. That's largely due to higher interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve to battle the post-pandemic surge in inflation.",
      "An increase in bond yields could add to that expense, putting even more pressure on the federal budget.",
      "\"Although President Donald Trump was able to resist the stock market selloff, once the bond market began to weaken, too, it was only a matter of time before he folded on his eye-wateringly high tariffs,\" noted economist Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics in an April 9 research note.",

      "The Trump administration confirmed Thursday that some Chinese goods will be subject to so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" reaching as high as 145%, while imports from Vietnam and India face tariffs of 46% and 27%, respectively. Mr. Trump suspended the tariffs on most countries for 90 days to allow more time for trade talks, but the levies on China remain in place.",

      "China this week announced more countermeasures against the U.S., and market losses accelerated after the White House clarified that it will tax Chinese imports at 145%, not 125% as initially announced by Mr. Trump on social media. The swings also hit the bond market despite a better-than-expected report on inflation. U.S. crude oil prices fell more than 3%.",
      "It's been a wild couple of weeks on Wall Street with Mr. Trump's tariff announcements,\u00a0reversals and retaliation from U.S. trading partners. That volatility seems unlikely to change in the coming weeks with the U.S. and China still locked in a tit-for-tat tariff battle and earnings season kicking off on Friday with the latest results from some of the nation's biggest banks.",
      "\"Despite Wednesday's announcements to lower the reciprocal tariff rate for most countries to 10%, the escalation between the U.S. and China could dramatically impact trade between the world's two largest economies,\" said Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer for wealth management at UBS, in a research note.",
      "Taking into account Mr. Trump's 145% levy on Chinese imports, UBS currently estimates the overall U.S.\u00a0effective tariff rate at 27%, versus 9% prior to April 2. \"Excluding trade with China, the effective tariff rate is 11%,\" Haefele added.",
      "\"Everything is still very volatile, because with Donald Trump, you don't know what to expect,\" said Francis Lun, chief executive of Geo Securities. \"This is really big uncertainty in the market. The threat of recession has not faded.\"",
      "Markets had been sinking earlier Wednesday on worries that Mr. Trump's trade war could drag the global economy into a recession. But then came the posting on social media that investors worldwide had been waiting and wishing for.",
      "\"I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE,\" Mr. Trump said, saying more than 75 countries are negotiating on trade and not retaliating against his latest increases in tariffs. China was a huge exception, with the president raising tariffs\u00a0 on its products to 145%.",
      "Investors went \"from fear to euphoria,\" Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, said in a commentary. On Wednesday, following Mr. Trump's tariff-pause announcement, the S&P 500 surged 9.5%, its third-best day since 1940. The index is still below where it was when Trump announced his sweeping set of tariffs last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shot to a gain of nearly 3,000 points, or 7.9%. The Nasdaq composite leaped 12.2%.",
      "\"It's now a manageable risk, especially as global recession tail bets get unwound, and most of Asia's exporters breathe a massive sigh of relief,\" Innes said. Analysts had expected the global comeback given that U.S. stocks had one of their best days in history on Wednesday as investors registered their relief over Trump's decision.",
      "The trade war isn't over, and an escalating battle between the world's two largest economies can create plenty of damage. U.S. stocks are also still below where they were just a week ago.

      "\"This month's inflation report showed that CPI dropped across the board in March, which is welcome news for the Federal Reserve, which would like to cut rates if significant damage is done to the economy through increased tariffs, but otherwise would be reluctant to cut rates in the face of an inflation threat,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management.",
      "March \"saw a fairly big cooling in inflation (both headline and core) and this, coupled w/the healthy job adds from last week, point to robust underlying economic fundamentals. The downtick in inflation gives breathing room for the Fed to be more forceful in responding to market turmoil,\" said equity analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, in a report.",
      "From bear investors' perspective, however, \"inflation is still running above the Fed's target and regardless, Mar and Q1 numbers are irrelevant given how much the world has changed. Trump's tariffs are only hitting the economy now, and it will take months before they fully show up in the data,\" Crisafulli added.",
      "In other words, according to most analysts, the situation is still too uncertain to call.",

      "\"Inflation still remains a concern because the full impact of tariffs is yet to be felt, however, at least the underlying trends (e.g. non-tariff related inflation) seems benign at this time. We will be keeping a close eye on PPI tomorrow in order to determine whether or not future inflation is already in the pipeline,\" he added.",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 11:27:46 -0400",
    "summary": "A new breed of veterinary clinic is changing how pets \u2014 and their owners \u2014 are treated. \"I'd rather see four pets a day,\" one vet said.",
    "story": [
      "When Kathleen Whitman's daughter's Bernadoodle, Cody, swallowed a Kong toy, the family faced a veterinary emergency requiring immediate surgery.",
      "X-rays at their local suburban clinic suggested what looked like a hair tie tangled in Cody's intestines. When referred to a corporate emergency hospital, the family was quoted $10,000 for the procedure.",
      "\"They literally told me in the waiting room with a clipboard, thinking I was just coming in and we were doing $10,000,\" Whitman said. \"I said, 'No, I'm just coming in to hear the price.\"",
      "Desperate for an alternative, Whitman reached out to Vetique, a boutique veterinary clinic in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood. There, Dr. Jessica Trice and Dr. Jennifer Remnes performed the surgery for what Whitman called \"an appropriate fee\" that was significantly less than $10,000.",
      "During the surgery, she and her daughter waited in the clinic's lobby with glasses of Prosecco while receiving regular updates.",
      "\"The humans were taken care of just as much as the puppy in distress was,\" Whitman said.",
      "This experience mirrors what many pet owners report when comparing corporate-owned emergency animal hospitals to independent practices. Kara Adams, whose 16-year-old rescue dog Shadow needed emergency eye surgery, also chose Vetique over corporate alternatives.",
      "When Adams called Vetique explaining she had only $1,000 available, staff accommodated her financial constraints.",
      "\"The planning manager came out with a payment plan for me,\" Adams said. \"I was crying because otherwise, what would I do? I didn't have any other options.\"",
      "\"You literally burn people out\"",
      "Drs. Trice and Remnes founded Vetique after witnessing firsthand how corporate consolidation was transforming veterinary medicine \u2014 often for the worse.",
      "\"Just coming from a corporation for many years, the whole thing is about quantity, getting all those pets,\" Trice explained after spending 10 years at Banfield Pet Hospital, followed by five years as a medical director at VCA Animal Hospitals. \"We feel the best way is not pushing about the number of quantity, because it gets very sloppy and you lose that interaction and relationship with the clients.\"",
      "Remnes' experience echoed her partner's concerns. At Banfield as a new graduate, she found herself overwhelmed by volume demands.",
      "\"As a new grad, you're still learning and trying to break into this brand-new world. I was seeing like 30 pets a day,\" Remnes said.",
      "She later moved to VCA before its Mars acquisition, initially enjoying the autonomy because \"each hospital was able to operate as they liked to.\" After the corporate takeover, however, the pressure intensified.",
      "\"It was like, 'Oh, you need to see this number of pets, or we're decreasing your salary.' That's what's burning out the industry,\" Remnes said. \"You literally burn people out doing that. You can't possibly offer your best when you're crammed with all of these patients.\"",
      "These pressures contribute to a profession in crisis. A 2024 study in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association found that U.S. veterinarians are more likely to experience serious mental health struggles than most people.",
      "\"We have forums on Facebook where our industry has one of the highest suicide rates,\" Remnes noted. \"It's because of things like this, when you're given spreadsheets and quotas rather than focusing on patient care.\"",
      "Their solution was to create a different business model. Instead of maximizing patient volume, Vetique prioritizes extended appointment times and a calming environment with luxury touches like sparkling epoxy floors, examination tables with faux fur coverings and exam rooms named after the founders' pets.",
      "\"I'd rather see four pets a day. That meant that family was getting my full attention, that pet was getting everything that I do,\" Remnes explained.",
      "Alongside traditional veterinary medicine, Trice offers acupuncture, herbal remedies and chiropractic treatments \u2014 holistic approaches she had wanted to pursue at corporate practices but was discouraged from using.",
      "Surging pet care prices",
      "Setting prices at Vetique involves balancing fair market rates with the clinic's added value. What Remnes found surprising was how significantly corporate prices have increased in recent years. \"Prices are so drastically different from when I was at VCA seven years ago. They're charging actually close to what we're charging as a general practice for an exam,\" she noted.",
      "This observation led her to reconsider Vetique's own pricing strategy.",
      "\"It's like, 'Well, we can actually probably charge more, because we offer all these experiences along with it.' It's trying to find a happy medium, trying to be fair, but also knowing our value.\"",
      "Despite the appeal of the boutique model, both Remnes and Trice acknowledge significant business challenges. The clinic is in its third year of operation, still within the typical three-to-five-year window before seeing substantial returns. Unlike corporate-backed veterinary chains, Vetique is entirely funded through a bank loan.",
      "Vetique's founders see their clinic not as a competitor to corporate chains but as an alternative model for the industry. \"We're not competing,\" Trice said. \"We're creating a new veterinary culture.\"",
      "Corporate giants reshape vet landscape",
      "John Volk, senior consultant with Brakke Consulting, said veterinary practices historically grow 4-5% annually and carry minimal accounts receivable, making them attractive to investors.",
      "\"Pet care in general is very attractive to the financial community,\" Volk said. \"It's a very steady growth industry, and it's a cash business, so they carry very little accounts receivable because pet owners pay for their services at time of service.\"",
      "Mars Inc., best known for candy brands like M&M's and Snickers, has quietly become the largest owner of veterinary hospitals in the U.S. through a series of major acquisitions.",
      "The privately held company owns three of the nation's largest veterinary chains: Banfield Pet Hospital, VCA Animal Hospitals, and BluePearl Specialty and Emergency Pet Hospital \u2014 giving it control of more than 2,000 clinics across North America.",
      "Mars entered the pet care industry in 2007 by acquiring Banfield, which primarily operates inside PetSmart locations. In 2017, it significantly expanded its footprint by purchasing VCA for $9.1 billion \u2014 one of the largest acquisitions in veterinary history,\u00a0according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.",
      "VCA operates more than 900 hospitals in the U.S. and Canada, while Banfield has over 1,000 clinics nationwide. Unlike VCA, which grew by acquiring independent practices, Banfield has mostly launched new locations within retail stores.",
      "Mars's scale allows for standardized protocols, shared technology platforms and subscription-based wellness plans across its network. According to the company website, Mars Veterinary Health serves more than 25 million pets annually.",
      "While private equity firms have been acquiring veterinary practices since the late 1980s, the trend has accelerated significantly over the past 15 years. Volk estimates approximately 30% of veterinary practices are now corporate-owned.",
      "Despite the growth in corporate ownership, Volk sees no evidence that care quality differs significantly between corporate and independent practices.",
      "\"I've not seen any data to suggest that the services provided by corporately owned practices are materially different than services provided by independently owned practices,\" he said.",
      "However, some policymakers have raised concerns about the impact of consolidation on pricing. In January 2023, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, specifically called out Mars Veterinary Health and other large veterinary corporations in a letter to the Federal Trade Commission. Warren cited \"troubling reports of anti-competitive consolidation\" and suggested these corporate entities were using market power to \"raise prices for consumers and lower wages for veterinarians.\"",
      "Even as consolidation continues, Volk finds that independent practices remain viable. \"If you have a DVM degree and don't have a bad personal history, you can get money to buy or start a practice,\" he said. \"Veterinarians are one of the lowest-risk borrowers of any category.\"",
      "For new veterinarians, the industry offers growing opportunities. The American Veterinary Medical Association reports the average starting salary in companion animal medicine reached approximately $137,000 in 2024.",
      "Design, investment, and a human touch",
      "When clients walk into a Bond Vet clinic, they won't find the sterile environment or cluttered waiting rooms traditionally associated with veterinary offices. Instead, they'll encounter soft pastel colors, comfortable seating and an atmosphere deliberately designed to feel more like a high-end hospitality experience than a medical facility.",
      "\"The industry has two categories of clinics historically \u2014 many designed very clinical, cold and sterile, and then others called mom and pop, which could be cluttered or dirty,\" said Garrett Lewis, CEO of Bond Vet. \"The question is how to solve both problems.\"",
      "That solution \u2013 creating premium veterinary experiences with transparent pricing and greater accessibility \u2013 has attracted significant private equity investment.",
      "While these premium services might suggest significantly higher costs, Lewis emphasizes transparency in Bond Vet's pricing model. \"When someone comes in, you can look at the laptop and see exactly what the pricing is,\" he said. \"Our prices are just a little bit above average, but the experience is what differentiates us.\"",
      "This transparency extends to digital platforms, where clients can check prices online or via text before visiting. During appointments, veterinarians show pricing information directly to clients on laptops, allowing for discussion about options.",
      "Bond Vet, backed by a $170 million investment from Warburg Pincus, has expanded to 57 locations across the Northeast and Midwest since its founding in 2019. The company was inspired by human-focused healthcare models like One Medical, focusing on convenience, design, and a better experience for both pets and owners.",
      "\"They saw the same issue, which was that the industry wasn't serving clients and pets at a much higher level,\" Lewis said of Bond Vet's founders, who included a veterinarian and her husband. \"They quickly found it was very different to change culture and design in existing practices, so they rebooted from the ground up.\"",
      "Bond Vet's approach represents a broader trend in veterinary medicine, where traditional practices are being reinvented with a focus on client experience alongside medical care.",
      "Bond Vet's model bridges the gap between traditional veterinary practices and emergency hospitals, offering urgent care alongside preventative services \u2013 all with a hospitality-focused approach.",
      "\"In the 90s, if you needed sick care, your veterinarian would say, 'Come on in.' If you needed preventive care, they'd say, 'Come on in,'\" Lewis explained. \"What happened in the 2000s is a lot of specialization occurred where practices became just preventative and started referring out anything that looked urgent or sick.\"",
      "Bond Vet handles non-emergency urgent cases that might otherwise end up in expensive emergency rooms. \"ER practices see about 40% of their volume as urgent rather than emergent cases. Clients go to ER and spend twice as much, often having to wait longer,\" Lewis noted.",
      "These clinics feature design elements specifically created to reduce stress for pets \u2014 an approach that appears to be working. \"I always see dogs dragging their owners into the clinic, which is not a common thing,\" Lewis said.",
      "The \"no walls\" philosophy breaking ground",
      "Imagine walking into a veterinary emergency room and instead of being separated from your pet during a crisis, you're welcomed directly onto the treatment floor. At  VEG ER for Pets, this isn't just possible \u2014 it's mandatory.",
      "\"We built an entire business around it,\" said Dr. David Bessler, founder and CEO of VEG ER for Pets. \"It's much easier doing something 100% of the time than trying to do it 90% of the time.\"",
      "With 102 locations across 28 states, VEG ER for Pets represents an approach to emergency veterinary medicine that stands apart from both traditional practices and newer primary care models.",
      "Unlike other veterinary innovators that blend primary and urgent care, VEG ER for Pets focuses exclusively on emergency medicine \u2013 a deliberate strategy that Bessler calls \"a bit of a crazy bet.\"",
      "\"We took the hardest part of an industry, emergency, and created an entire business around that,\" said David Gladstein, co-founder and president of VEG ER for Pets. \"It's hard to make money, it's hard to get the team, it's hard to recruit, it's hard to train.\"",
      "VEG ER for Pets' most distinctive feature is its commitment to keeping pets with their owners throughout the entire treatment process, even during emergencies \u2014 an approach not found in traditional emergency hospitals, where pets are typically treated in back rooms away from owners.",
      "This transparency extends to the physical design of newer hospitals, which have eliminated traditional waiting rooms entirely. \"Our newer hospitals don't even have a lobby,\" Gladstein explained. \"You literally walk in and you're in the middle of the treatment floor.\"",
      "In a notable departure from many veterinary innovators, VEG ER for Pets has achieved financial independence from its initial investors and now funds its expansion through its own operations.",
      "\"VEG ER for Pets is now independently able to do that,\" Gladstein stated. \"We don't need anyone else to advocate for us or to pay for us. We're not beholden to anybody. We're beholden to our customers, and we're beholden to our veggies.\"",
      "This independence allows the company to maintain its distinctive approach while continuing to open 25-30 new locations annually.",
      "The company's exclusive focus on emergency care, while limiting in some ways, has allowed it to \"crack the code\" on veterinary emergencies according to Gladstein. \"We've kind of cracked the code on one way of doing things in emergency that results in a better experience for all of the souls that are there experiencing that at the same time.\"",

      "U.S. stocks soar in relief rally",
      "On Wall Street, the S&P 500 surged 9.5%, an amount that would count as a good year for the market. It had been sinking earlier in the day on worries that Mr. Trump's trade war could drag the global economy into a recession. But then came the posting on social media that investors worldwide had been waiting and wishing for.",
      "\"I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE,\" the president said, after recognizing the more than 75 countries that he said have been negotiating on trade and hadn't retaliated against his latest increases in tariffs.",

      "China was a huge exception, though, with Mr. Trump saying tariffs are going up to 125% against its products. That raises the possibility of more swings ahead that could stun financial markets. The trade war isn't over, and an escalating battle between the world's two largest economies can create plenty of damage. U.S. stocks are also still below where they were just a week ago, when Trump announced worldwide tariffs on what he called \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "But on Wednesday, at least, the focus on Wall Street was on the positive. The Dow shot to a gain of 2,962 points, or 7.9%. The Nasdaq composite leaped 12.2%. And the S&P 500 had its third-best day since 1940.",
      "The relief came after doubts had crept in about whether Mr. Trump cared about the financial pain the U.S. stock market was taking because of his tariffs. The S&P 500, the index that sits at the center of many 401(k) accounts, came into the day nearly 19% below the record its set less than two months ago.",
      "That surprised many professional investors who'd long thought a president who used to crow about records for the Dow under his watch would pull back on policies if they sent markets reeling.",
      "Wednesday's rally pulled the S&P 500 index away from the edge of what's called a \"bear market.\" That's what professionals call it when a run-of-the-mill drop of 10% for U.S. stocks, which happens every year or so, graduates into a more vicious fall of 20%. The index is now down 11.2% from its record.",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 08:42:32 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump's aggressive use of tariffs has fueled concerns about the economy and roiled the stock market.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's barrage of \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on countries around the world this year has rattled consumers, businesses and investors. Although President Trump on Wednesday announced a 90-day pause on most of his new tariffs, he upped import duties on Chinese goods to 125% \u2014 escalating a conflict between the world's two largest economies.",
      "We asked you what questions you had about tariffs and answered some of those in a CBS News 24/7 special. Read on for some answers to your questions below.",
      "Are global tariffs legal, and have U.S. levies on other countries risen or fallen over the years?",
      "CBS MoneyWatch: Tariffs are legal under World Trade Organization rules, although participating countries must comply with certain restrictions and levies are generally capped.",
      "As a result, nations have long had the right to impose multilateral tariffs, although those costs vary widely based on trade agreements, product type and many other factors.",
      "In the 19th century, average U.S. tariff rates on trading partners routinely exceeded 30%. The government sharply reduced those levies after the Great Depression, cutting them to single digits. After resuming power in 2025, President Trump raised the effective U.S. tariff to 22% \u2014 the highest since 1909.",
      "For the Trump administration, are these massive tariffs intended to pressure other nations into more favorable trade deals, or is the goal to push American businesses to invest more in domestic manufacturing? Or both?",
      "Both, correct. These historically large tariffs have several main objectives. In the short term, the tariffs are intended to pressure countries to come to the table to negotiate what Mr. Trump sees as more favorable trade deals.",
      "Over the long term, Trump administration officials say that sharply raising U.S. tariffs will spur both domestic and foreign companies eager to avoid the added costs to expand here at home, creating jobs, reinvigorating manufacturers and boosting economic growth.",
      "President Trump has also long argued that global trade rules, enshrined in entities like the World Trade Organization, disdvantage the U.S. by, for example, permitting countries like China, Germany and Japan to subsidize key industries. He blames those rules for fueling large global trade imbalances that have saddled the U.S. with a large, and growing, trade deficit.",
      "Another goal of tariffs is to generate federal revenue \u2014 funds that Mr. Trump will likely need to offset additional tax cuts he has promised to Americans and to corporations.",
      "Why do some people oppose deploying tariffs against countries that impose tariffs on the U.S.?",
      "Most mainstream economists think the kind of sweeping tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump on nearly all U.S. imports act as a tax on businesses and consumers. Such levies raise the cost of many essential items, leading to higher prices for American households; depress economic growth; and could even trigger a recession.",
      "Under this view, a trade war in which countries jack up tariffs on their economic partners effectively makes them all poorer.",
      "By contrast, trade experts also say that targeted tariffs \u2014 implemented as but one element in a larger industrial strategy \u2014 can help protect critical U.S. industries and workers from unfair foreign competition.",
      "How do these tariffs impact consumers, especially when it comes to prices on everyday items like groceries or housewares?",
      "Tariffs are taxes paid by importers such as Walmart, which must pay the fees to the U.S.\u00a0 Customs and Border Protection when it accepts shipments at American ports. As a result, U.S. businesses typically pass on most or all of that cost to consumers through higher prices.",
      "For instance, after Mr. Trump added tariffs to imported washing machines during his first term, the median price of those appliances jumped more than 11%, tacking on about $86 to the cost of a new unit, according to University of Chicago researchers.",
      "While consumers can opt for U.S.-made merchandise, domestic manufacturers also may raise their prices due to tariffs. Sometimes that's due to an increase in the cost of imported goods they need to manufacture their products. But some companies also take the opportunity to hike prices because the newly expensive foreign-made products provide them with more pricing flexibility.",
      "Without Mr. Trump's pause, imported vegetables, fruit and nuts were set to rise by 19% due to the tariffs, according to a recent analysis from the Yale Budget Lab, a public policy think tank. That would have boosted prices for those foods by more than 6%, after adjusting for an expected 0.6% increase in the cost of the same items grown in the U.S.",
      "What's the long-term outlook \u2014 are these tariffs likely to strengthen the U.S. economy or just cause temporary disruption?",
      "Economists say Mr. Trump's tariffs have increased the risk that the U.S. and other nations could tumble into a recession in the next year. Because tariffs raise prices, Americans are expected to cut back on spending \u2014 a potentially major problem given that 70 cents of every $1 in the nation's gross domestic product is based on consumer spending.",
      "For instance, the tariffs could slow GDP growth to 1.4% in 2025, while core inflation could rise to 3.9% this year, according to an April 2 forecast from Oxford Economics. That would represent a significant slowdown from the economy's 2.8% growth rate in 2024.",
      "Other experts say leaving sharply higher U.S. tariffs in place could leave much deeper scars. GDP growth could fall by 0.6 percentage points over the next decade, the Yale Budget Lab estimated.",
      "What is the end goal for the Trump administration's tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump has said he believes tariffs will bring back manufacturing jobs. By making it more expensive to sell foreign-made goods in the U.S., the president wants to convince American and foreign companies to build factories here.",
      "But he's also highlighted other goals for his tariff barrage, such as convincing other nations to give more favorable trading terms to the U.S.",
      "Lastly, Mr. Trump has pointed to tariffs as a way to raise billions in revenue for the U.S. government, even though economists point out that tariffs are essentially a sales tax which are paid by American consumers.",
      "Does Mr. Trump really think he's going to be able to rebuild manufacturing in America again?",
      "Mr. Trump is adamant that tariffs can revive manufacturing in the U.S., which has been on the decline for at least half a century. Yet economists and other experts aren't so sure.",
      "There are several reasons for their skepticism. For one, building the types of factories and infrastructure to support the manufacturing that is now handled by other nations, such as China and Vietnam, would require years and billions in investment.",
      "The U.S. manufacturing sector has been shrinking for decades, so companies repatriating factories from abroad would struggle to find enough skilled workers, especially in technology and other areas higher up the industrial value chain",
      "And because of the uncertainty caused by Mr. Trump's tariffs, some businesses might not want to commit to such an investment given that the import duties might disappear or be sharply lowered \u2014 as they were today.",
      "What could happen to block the U.S. tariff increases?",
      "Several factors could halt the tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump, according to experts.",
      "First, Congress could introduce a resolution to terminate the emergency declaration used by Mr. Trump to issue the tariffs. Since both the Senate and House are controlled by Republicans, that would require several members of the GOP to join Democrats in voting against Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "But Mr. Trump would likely veto any such measure that reached his desk, which means that two-thirds of both chambers would need to vote in favor of the measure in order to make it veto-proof.",
      "Second, the courts could intervene and rule that Mr. Trump has exceeded his authority. Already, there has been a lawsuit filed by a small business in Florida that argues that Mr. Trump has overstepped by issuing the April 2 tariffs, and that the power should belong to Congress alone.",
      "Third, the violent reaction in financial markets that followed Mr. Trump's latest tariff salvo could persuade him to change course. His move on Wednesday to pause many of the tariffs followed a five-day plunge in stocks that put the S&P 500 on the verge of entering a bear market \u2014 when equities fall at least 20% from their most recent high.",
      "That steep decline in stock prices hurts tens of millions of Americans saving for retirement and could lead them to cut their spending, a big drag on economic growth.",

      "Even with today's gain, the S&P 500 remains 11% below its February 19 peak of 6,147.",
      "Investors have been spooked by Mr. Trump's escalating trade war, which Wall Street economists warn could raise the risk of a recession and hurt U.S. corporations and consumers by hiking prices on products from almost every nation.",
      "Even before Mr. Trump's announcement, some on Wall Street had expressed optimism that the White House could back down from the latest tariffs, which slapped rates of between 10% to 84% on U.S. trade partners.",
      "Despite the pause, experts noted that uncertainty remains an issue for U.S. businesses, given that the tariffs could restart in 90 days and that the penalties on China \u2014 a major trading partner \u2014 are likely to dampen economic growth.",
      "\"Businesses will be relieved that the destination for trade policy looks like it could be less disruptive than seemed possible yesterday,\" said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank. \"Even so, the huge overhang of policy uncertainty will weigh on investment and weak decisions in the next few months.\"",
      "He noted, \"Also, 125% tariffs on Chinese imports will be a huge problem for many businesses if they stay in place.\"",
      "Best stock performers today",
      "The gains were widespread across the U.S. stock market, and 98% of the stocks in the S&P 500 index rallied.",

      "Also leading the way were airlines and other stocks that depend on customers feeling confident enough to travel for work or for vacation. Delta Air Lines soared 23.4%, while American Airlines gained 22.6%.",
      "China trade war intensifies",
      "Still, the trade war continues between the U.S. and China continues to rage.

The retaliation signals Beijing isn't backing down from Mr. Trump's global trade war.",
      "Mr. Trump's broad-based \"reciprocal tariffs,\" which apply to imports of almost every nation, had kicked in after midnight Eastern time in the U.S.",
      "Already, there are signs that some corporations are feeling the impact of Mr. Trump's tariff policies, with Delta on Wednesday pulling its guidance for 2025 as the trade war depresses bookings across the travel sector.",

      "But on Wednesday, the president said he'd been mulling a pause \"over the last few days.\" The president said he decided to forward with the pause early Wednesday morning. He and his top advisers wrote the statement without lawyers present, he said, and came \"from the heart.\"",
      "The so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs above the baseline 10% worldwide rate went into effect Wednesday.",
      "\"It's unfolded exactly the way it should. It's a beautiful thing,\" said top White House adviser Peter Navarro on Fox Business Channel.",

The Trump administration's imposition and walkback of tariffs has led to stock volatility and sparked worries of a global trade war and recession.",
      "In the United States, many are concerned about levies driving up the price of everyday goods, and Goldman Sachs economists on Monday cited them in a report\u00a0raising the odds of a recession to 45%. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned the tariffs could slow the economy and\u00a0\"will likely increase inflation.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's April 2 announcement set out a baseline 10% tax on all U.S. imports, plus additional \"reciprocal\" tariffs on imports from 90 countries. He pitched the tariffs as a strategy to reduce the trade deficit between the U.S. and other global powers, including China and the European Union.",
      "Exactly a week later, the president paused many of the newly announced reciprocal duties, with the exception of those placed on China.",
      "The reversal came a little over a month after Mr. Trump imposed 25% tariffs\u00a0on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, and\u00a0then announced a pause just two days later.",

      "As markets fluctuate, and with many of his most recent\u00a0reciprocal import duties\u00a0paused, here's what Mr. Trump has said about the tariffs.",
      "Trump reverses course, pauses tariffs",
      "Two days after Mr. Trump said during a\u00a0meeting with Israeli Prime Minister\u00a0Benjamin Netanyahu that he's not looking at any pauses in tariffs, he announced a 90-day pause on most of his planned tariffs and a lowering of the \"reciprocal tariff\" rate to 10% \u2014 with the exception of China.",
      "The U.S.\u00a0stock market surged\u00a0immediately after the president's announcement.",
      "When reporters asked about mixed messages from his administration on whether the tariffs are permanent or open to negotiation, the president said on April 7, \"they both can be true.\"",
      "\"We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and they're going to be fair deals,\" Mr. Trump said. \"No other president's going to do this, what I'm doing.\"",
      "On April 9, citing China's unwillingness to negotiate, Mr. Trump announced on Truth Social that he's raising taxes on China to 125%. China announced earlier in the day that it would\u00a0raise its tariffs on U.S. products to 84%.",
      "The president previously said there are \"other things besides tariffs\" that could be open to negotiation, like other countries' \"standards and tests\" that Mr. Trump said make trading more difficult, but he didn't provide further details.",
      "\"Hang tough\"",
      "In a Truth Social post on April 5 as his 10% universal tariffs took effect, Mr. Trump urged Americans to \"hang tough\" and acknowledged things \"won't be easy.\"",
      "\"China has been hit much harder than the USA, not even close. They, and many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly,\" he wrote.",
      "\"We have been the dumb and helpless 'whipping post,' but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before. Already, more than FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT, and rising fast! THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"",
      "\"Sometimes you have to take medicine\"",
      "Mr. Trump doubled down on his trade position while speaking to reporters on April 6 on Air Force One, making clear he did not intend to budge on the reciprocal tariffs set to take effect later this week, nor the universal levies already implemented.",
      "Addressing the U.S. market plunge\u00a0that followed his April 2 announcement \u2014 Wall Street's worst in five years \u2014 and seemingly preparing Americans for more potential market pain to come, the president said, \"I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\"",
      "\"What's going to happen with the market I can't tell you, but I can tell you our country has gotten a lot stronger,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "He also said various world leaders had expressed interest in negotiating to roll back tariffs as global markets, reacting to the levies, began to nosedive, too.",
      "\"I spoke to a lot of leaders, European, Asian, from all over the world,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They're dying to make a deal. And I said, we're not going to have deficits with your country. We're not going to do that, because to me a deficit is a loss. We're going to have surpluses or at worst, going to be breaking even.\"",
      "Echoing Mr. Trump's sentiment, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick suggested the administration would not waver on the new round of tariffs, in an interview on\u00a0\"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"\u00a0Arguing the policies will help protect U.S. factories and \"reset the power of the United States of America,\" Lutnick acknowledged that \"it is going to be a big change.\"",
      "\"This is the moment that the United States of America takes hold of itself, and Donald Trump has been talking about this his whole life,\" Lutnick said. \"This is Donald Trump's agenda, and we're all here to help him execute.\"",
      "\"Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!)\"",
      "In the hour before trading opened on Wall Street on Monday, April 7, the president took to Truth Social to support his flurry of tariffs and appeared to coin a new Trump-ism referencing panic.",
      "\"The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,\" Mr. Trump said in the post. \"Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid! Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!\"",
      "He posted as international markets were experienced significant losses, with indices in Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, Shanghai, South Korea, Taiwan and Tokyo all dropping. U.S. markets went on to have a roller-coaster day, with the S&P 500 ending down a modest 12 points, or 0.2%, at 5,062, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 349 points, or 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite eked out a small gain, rising 15 points to close up 0.1%.",
      "Additional tariffs on China",
      "Mr. Trump vowed on Monday, April 7, to raise duties imposed on China to 50% after Beijing issued retaliatory tariffs of 34% on the U.S. over the weekend.",
      "On Truth Social, the president said Beijing had acted despite his previous \"warning\" that the U.S. would only respond to retaliatory tariffs with even higher taxes for the issuing country, and urged its leaders to withdraw the 34% increase or face higher costs.",
      "\"Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!\" Mr. Trump said. \"Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "China did not withdraw its tariffs and the ratcheting up continued, with Mr. Trump increasing U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to 104% and then and then 125% as China upped\u00a0its tariffs on U.S. goods to 84%.",

      "A global trade war is brewing as the U.S. imposes tariffs on a growing list of countries, heightening concerns about economic growth and roiling stock markets around the world.",
      "President Trump on April 2 announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations that are above a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S. Describing the announcement as \"Liberation Day,\" the president said the new taxes are needed to erase a trade deficit between the U.S. and other countries, ranging from China to the European Union.",
      "Some nations are facing only the universal tariff of 10%, while imports from dozens of other countries are charged a higher specific reciprocal import levy. For instance, Australian imports face the baseline rate of 10%, while China-made products are now paying an import duty that has jumped to 104%\u00a0\u2014 the reciprocal tariffs combined with previously announced duties of 20% \u2014 after slapping its own tariffs on U.S. imports.",
      "\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in his April 2 remarks.",
      "However, on April 9 Mr. Trump backed away from parts of his plan, announcing a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs and lowering the tariff rate to 10% for almost all nations. The notable exception was China, with Mr. Trump saying that he's instead raising the tariff rate on the country's imports to 125%.",
      "\"Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Stocks soared after Mr. Trump's April 9 announcement, with the S&P 500 gaining 8.4% in afternoon trading and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surging 7%. Still, some on Wall Street cautioned that the pause is still on track to end in 90 days, which could signal more volatility ahead.",
      "\"The tariff clouds parted for the first time today, but it's too soon to know how sunny the skies will be tomorrow \u2014 or 90 days from now,\" said Daniel Skelly, head of Morgan Stanley's Wealth Management Market Research & Strategy Team, in an email.",
      "Worst-hit countries",
      "Before he announced the pause, Asian nations were set to face the worst of the brunt, with Cambodia facing a tax rate at 49% and Vietnam at 46%, according to Nationwide Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic.",
      "Mr. Trump also said such levies will boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products. Still, economists are forecasting that the tariffs will cause inflation to reignite, while also prompting some trade partners to retaliate with higher tariffs on American imports to their nations.",
      "If the tariffs are maintained by the Trump administration and if other nations impose retaliatory tariffs, both the U.S. and other countries \"will suffer serious recessions,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "China retaliated by saying it planned to impose a retaliatory\u00a034% import fee\u00a0on American products, followed by Mr. Trump retaliating with plans to impose an additional 50% tariff on its imports and China ratcheting up its rate to 84%.",
      "Full list of Trump's reciprocal tariffs by country",
      "When do these tariffs go into effect?",
      "The reciprocal rates were originally set to go into effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 9, but later that day President Trump announced a\u00a0postponement for 90 days. That's in addition to a baseline 10% tariff which took effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 5.",
      "How did the Trump administration decide what tariffs to charge which countries?",
      "Mr. Trump said his administration determined the tariff rate for each country based on the monetary levies those nations charge on U.S. imports, as well as non-monetary trade barriers like regulations that make it tougher for American products to enter those markets.",
      "The president added that the reciprocal tariffs are still only half the rates charged by those nations on U.S. products, characterizing his new levies as \"kind.\"",
      "Are other countries retaliating against U.S. tariffs?",
      "Yes. China said it would impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10, and then raised the level to 84%. The Chinese Commerce Ministry also said it would implement tighter restrictions on exports of rare earths \u2014materials used in products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries \u2014 as well impose 27 additional U.S. companies to trade sanctions.",

      "In a move that threatens to raise costs on all electronics, including iPhones, the White House on Tuesday said it would follow through on a threat to enact a 104% tariff on all Chinese goods imported into the U.S. The levy took effect Wednesday at 12:01 a.m. EDT. Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump raised the tariff rate to 125%, effective immediately.",
      "The price for the popular tech tool, which starts at $599 for the most basic model, the iPhone 16e, is poised to increase by hundreds of dollars, depending on how Apple responds to the sweeping levies. The iPhone 16 Pro 128 GB, which features Apple Intelligence, costs $999.",
      "The iPhone accounts for about half of Apple's revenue. Most of its smartphones are manufactured in China.",
      "Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives said in a research note Tuesday that the added levies could create a \"category 5 price storm\" for personal electronics and other gadgets. Taxing China and other nations at such rates is the equivalent of \"flipping a boat upside down in the ocean with no life rafts,\" he added.",
      "How much more could an iPhone cost?",
      "The iPhone 16 Pro Max 256 GB, which is among the devices that are assembled in China, retails for $1,199. Under the new tariffs on Chinese imports, the price of the device could rise by $675, or 56%, lifting the price tag to $1,874, an April 9 analysts from UBS Investment Research shows.",

      "Apple didn't respond to a request for comment on how the Trump tariffs could affect iPhone prices.",
      "What if Apple moved production to the U.S.?",
      "President Trump has said the new U.S. tariffs are aimed at spurring both domestic and foreign companies to build in the U.S. But for Apple and other companies, manufacturing their products in the U.S. entail significantly higher labor costs \u2014 costs that would largely be passed on to consumers.",
      "If Apple were to begin assembling iPhones in the U.S, a Chinese-made device that previously sold for $1,000 would cost $3,500 if manufactured in New Jersey, Texas or some other state, Ives estimated.",
      "\"Saying we can just make this in the USA is a statement that incredibly understates the complexity of the Asia supply chain and the way electronics, chips, semi fabs, hardware, smartphones, etc. are made for U.S. consumers over the last 30 years,\" he said in a report.",
      "As a result, Ives is highly skeptical that tariffs alone will lead companies to shift their manufacturing plants from low-cost havens like China to the U.S., calling the idea \"absurd.\"",
      "But some companies, including Apple, could attempt to rejigger supply chains to avoid the steepest tariffs. For example, Apple plans to manufacture more iPhones in India to reduce its reliance on China, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported, citing people familiar with the matter.",

      "According to the exhibit, the IRS will review all requests and account for disclosures made under the memorandum. While some of the memo is highly redacted, it reveals that the IRS will disclose to ICE the names and addresses of immigrants, among other information.",
      "The new data-sharing arrangement will allow ICE to cross-verify the names and addresses of immigrants inside the U.S. illegally with their IRS tax records.",
      "Treasury argues that the agreement will help carry out President Trump's agenda to secure U.S. borders and is part of his larger nationwide immigration crackdown, which has resulted in deportations, workplace raids, and the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants.",
      "Advocates say the IRS-DHS information sharing agreement violates longstanding privacy laws and diminishes the privacy of all Americans.",
      "A Treasury official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to explain the agency's thinking on the agreement said the basis for the agreement is founded in \"longstanding authorities granted by Congress, which serve to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans while streamlining the ability to pursue criminals.\"",
      "Todd Lyons, acting ICE director, told reporters at the Border Security Expo in Phoenix on Tuesday that the agreement would help ICE find people who are collecting benefits they aren't entitled to and are \"kind of hiding in plain sight\" using someone else's identity.",
      "Working with Treasury and other departments is \"strictly for the major criminal cases,\" Lyons said.",
      "The IRS has already been called upon once to help with immigration enforcement earlier this year.",
      "Noem in February sent a request to Bessent to borrow IRS Criminal Investigation workers to help with the immigration crackdown, according to a letter obtained by The Associated Press. It cites the IRS' boost in funding, though the $80 billion infusion of funds the federal tax collection agency received under the Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act has already been clawed back.",
      "Tax law experts for the NYU Tax Law Center wrote Monday that the agreement \"threatens to violate the rights that many more Americans have under longstanding laws that protect their tax information from wrongful disclosure or dissemination.\"",

      "London \u2014\u00a0Producers and importers of alcoholic beverages say President Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs will hit many American drinkers right in the wallet, with price hikes on some favored tipples even exceeding the rates of the levies he's imposed.",
      "On April 2, Mr. Trump announced what he called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on virtually every nation the U.S. does trade with. Despite stock markets around the globe descending into tumult and economists warning for months that it will be consumers who pay the price for the levies, Mr. Trump has not backed down, insisting the measures will help the U.S. balance its trade deficit with other nations in the longer term.",
      "But in the near term, many Americans' adult beverages of choice, including European wines and Scotch whisky, are likely to come at more of a premium, according to industry insiders.",
      "Bartholomew Broadbent, who owns the Virginia-based wine wholesaler and importer Broadbent Selections, warned the impact on retail prices in the U.S. is going to be \"a lot worse than people think.\"",
      "French wines, as an example, will be subject to 20% tariffs under the measures announced by Mr. Trump. But Broadbent told CBS News the real-world price increase will be closer to 30%, because the cost of the tariff will be compounded at every stage of a bottle or crate's journey to a store shelf \u2014 with producers in France and other nations, along with importers like himself and then distributors and retailers all adding their own mark-ups.",
      "\"The price is going to have to go up,\" he said.",
      "In real terms, Broadbent estimated that the retail price on a bottle of wine that currently sells for $9.99 could go up to $13 or $14.",
      "Broadbent, whose company imports wines from 11 different countries and it also works with wineries in California, said more than 80% of his business will now face new tariffs. Wines from South Africa will be the most heavily impacted, he said, as the White House has hit the country with a steep 30% tariff.",
      "\"I don't see a single person who can benefit from this,\" Broadbent said. \"Even the wineries in America will suffer badly because they're all buying barrels and corks from Europe.\"",
      "The tariffs sent shockwaves through the global wine industry, with France's Bourgogne Wine Board (BIVB) warning the levies risked \"pushing our wines past a psychological price threshold.\"",
      "Bourgogne \u2014 or the Burgundy region as it's known in English \u2014 exported nearly 21 million bottles of wine to the U.S. in 2024, according to the BIVB, which agreed with the assessment that Mr. Trump's tariffs will have a negative impact on everyone, from French exporters and their distributor partners to American consumers.",
      "\"The industry deeply regrets this decision,\" the BIVB said in a press release",
      "The people who make, sell and enjoy Scotland's world renowned distilled spirits are also staring down the barrel of Mr. Trump's tariffs. Last year alone, about 132 million bottles of Scotch whisky were imported into the U.S. market, according to the Scotch Whisky Association.",
      "The mood in Scotland is one of \"frustration and uncertainty,\" according to Drew McKenzie Smith, who founded and runs the Lindores Abbey Distillery just north of Edinburgh.",
      "McKenzie Smith estimated that the 10% baseline tariff Mr. Trump imposed on the U.K. would see the price of a bottle of his Scotch hiked by about the same amount for American consumers. So a bottle that currently costs $60 will soon jump to $66, be believes.",
      "While that \"may not sound severe,\" McKenzie Smith told CBS News, \"it still adds a meaningful burden \u2014 especially for smaller producers like us.\"",

The House budget resolution relied on the current law baseline and acknowledges that continuing the tax cuts will cost $3.8 trillion.

    "summary": "Consumers fraudulently enrolled in Affordable Care Act coverage could receive unexpected tax bills \u2014 possibly their only clue they've been victimized.",
    "story": [
      "Because of past fraud by rogue brokers, some Affordable Care Act policyholders may get an unexpected tax bill this season.",
      "But that isn't the only potential shock. Other changes coming soon - stemming from proposals by the administration of President Donald Trump - could affect their coverage and its cost. And sorting out related problems and challenges may take longer as federal workers are laid off and funding for assistance programs is cut.",
      "First up: taxes",
      "Tax season is when some consumers learn they were fraudulently enrolled in an ACA plan or switched to a different one without their knowledge.",
      "Those unauthorized enrollments or changes took off in late 2023 and continued through last year, drawing more than 274,000 complaints in the first eight months of 2024 to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, mostly about rogue agents or call centers.",
      "Tax problems can arise if those enrollments resulted in premium tax credits exceeding the amount the consumer should have received. In those cases, consumers may have to pay all or part of those credits back. The amount owed could range from a few hundred dollars to thousands, with some caps based on income.",
      "The first clue some people have is when they get a 1095-A form in the mail.",
      "Those documents are sent out by the state and federal marketplaces to the IRS and ACA enrollees, showing any tax credit payments made to health insurers on a taxpayer's behalf. Taxpayers use the premium tax credit information from the 1095-A when completing their return.",
      "Returns can be held up if the IRS has information indicating the taxpayer has ACA coverage that they failed to report on their return, or if there are other discrepancies.",
      "The Biden administration last year took steps to slow the fraudulent switching, including requiring a three-way call between the broker, client, and marketplace for some enrollment issues.",
      "\"While we may be seeing less [fraud], we're still dealing with 2024 taxes,\" said Erin Kinard, director of systems and intake for the Health and Economic Opportunity Program at Pisgah Legal Services, a nonprofit serving western North Carolina that offers both legal help and assistance with ACA problems.",
      "Consumers who suspect they were fraudulently enrolled should immediately call their federal or state ACA marketplace, experts say. Some consumers will be referred to special federal caseworkers throught he marketplaces. But some of those caseworkers are now part of the broad reduction in force by theTrump administration.",
      "In recent days, \"they laid off two divisions on the Affordable Care Act side,\" said Jeffrey Grant, who oversaw ACA issues as CMS' deputy director for operations in the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight before leaving in February.",
      "With fewer caseworkers, \"it will take longer to get problems taken care of,\" said Grant, who is now president of Schedule F Healthcare Strategies, a consulting group that aims to help laid-off federal workers find new jobs. \"The marketplace is twice as big as it was the last time the Trump administration was here, and now they are cutting caseworkers to less than were around then.\"",
      "CBS News 24/7 is answering your questions about tariffs in a special airing on Wednesday at 6 p.m. ET. Download the\u00a0CBS News app\u00a0on your phone or connected TV to watch it live.",
      "And these cases are difficult because the rogue brokers who enrolled consumers sometimes misstated their income so they would qualify for the largest tax credits possible. Other consumers have found they were enrolled even though they had affordable employer coverage, making them ineligible for ACA subsidies.",
      "That's what happened to Anthony Akra and his wife, Ashley Zukoski, in Charlotte, North Carolina. They were enrolled in a plan without their knowledge in 2023, by a broker in Florida with whom they had never spoken. The couple had health insurance through Zukoski's employer. The broker listed an income that qualified the household for a large subsidy that fully offset the monthly premium cost, so the couple never received a bill. One day, a 1095-A form showed up in their mailbox.",
      "\"I didn't know what the hell it was,\" said Akra, who said the form showed that he had been receiving hundreds of dollars a month in premium tax credits.",
      "He would owe a big chunk of that back unless he could get the plan retroactively canceled. Because their pharmacy, part of a national chain, had switched them to the new plan, also without telling them, they had used the new coverage every time they filled a prescription. That inadvertent use of the policy complicated their efforts to get the fraudulent coverage revoked.",
      "Meanwhile, the IRS withheld more than $4,000 from their tax refund based on the information sent through that 1095-A form.\u00a0 Months passed, but with assistance from a \"navigator\" program \u2014 a government-fundednonprofit that helps people deal with insurance problems \u2014 they were able to get the incorrectinsurance canceled and a refund at the end of October.",
      "It is not unusual for people to spend weeks or even months trying to sort out the mess, said Kinard, whose organization is similar to the one that helped Akra.",
      "While navigator programs nationwide are still operating to help people sign up for health coverage or address issues, the Trump administration has targeted their funding for a 90% cut. Meanwhile, ACA enrollees may face a range of other surprises due to policy and budget steps proposed by the Trump administration.",
      "More Potential Changes",
      "Congress must decide whether to extend premium tax credits that were enhanced during the covid pandemic, which expanded eligibility for the credits and made them larger for many enrollees. Keeping them in place would be expensive, with the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation estimating it would add $335 billion to the deficit through 2034.",
      "That debate will come amid another deficit-affecting decision: whether to extend tax cuts enacted during the first Trump administration, which would add trillions to the budget deficit through 2034.",
      "If the enhanced subsidies are not renewed, monthly premium costs would rise by an average of over 75%, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. Premiums could more than double in some states, including many GOP-led ones, such as Texas, Mississippi, Utah, Wyoming, and West Virginia.",
      "That could spark a political backlash. Additionally, the enhanced subsidies are seen as a main reason for strong enrollment growth, leading to more than 24 million people signing up for ACA plans for this year.",
      "A recent KFF study found the 15 states with the most enrollment growth since 2020 were all won by Trump in 2024.",
      "A proposed rule released last month by the Trump administration includes provisions to shorten the annual enrollment period, get rid of a special open enrollment period that allows low-income people to sign up year-round, and require stricter verification of income and other information when people apply for coverage. The administration says most of these steps are needed to reduce fraud in the system.",
      "The administration estimates that 750,000 to 2 million fewer people would enroll in coverage as a result of the changes.",
      "The new rule, if finalized, will make it harder for people to enroll, said Xonjenese Jacobs, director of Florida Covering Kids & Families at the University of South Florida College of Public Health. Losing the year-round enrollment for very low-income people, for example, would affect people short on cash who move often to stay with relatives or friends, and those who have unsteady employment, making it hard to know when or where to enroll and what their income might be in the coming year.",
      "\"They don't have the same ability to plan,\" Jacobs said. \"It's definitely going to make a difference for a lot of the individuals that we service.\""

      "Starting tomorrow, the White House will begin collecting steep levies on imported goods from China, as President Trump follows through on a threat issued against Beijing on Truth Social Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump on Monday threatened to slap an additional 50% tariff on imports from China after the nation said it would impose a 34% import fee on American products. China's retaliatory move came after Mr. Trump said China would face a 34% tariff on all goods imported to the U.S., a rate tailored specifically to China.",
      "Mr. Trump also said in his Truth Social post that the U.S. would cease all negotiations with China, while proceeding with trade talks with other nations.",
      "China's commerce ministry on Tuesday asserted that Beijing would \"fight to the end\" and take countermeasures against the U.S. if Mr. Trump did not walk back his latest threat.",
      "In the press briefing Tuesday, Leavitt said retaliatory tariffs on roughly 90 countries were designed to open negotiations with the U.S.'s trade partners.",
      "\"To countries around the world, bring us your best offers and he will listen,\" Leavitt said of Mr. Trump. \"Deals will only be made if they benefit American workers.\"",
      "She added that 70 nations have already approached the White House to begin negotiations and presumably lower their assigned tariff rates in exchange for concessions that Mr. Trump deems beneficial to the U.S.",
      "\"On the other hand, countries like China, who have chosen to retaliate, and try to double down on their mistreatment of American workers are making a mistake,\" Leavitt said.",
      "She also reiterated Mr. Trump's \"firm belief\" that the U.S. needs to prioritize the bringing of manufacturing back to the U.S.",
      "\"President Trump has a spine of steel and will not break,\" she said, later adding that \"a strong America cannot be solely dependent on foreign countries for our food, medicines and critical minerals.\"",

    "summary": "Small business owner Emily Ley says new U.S. tariffs on China will devastate her stationery store, calling the added costs \"catastrophic.\"",
    "story": [
      "Many U.S. small businesses could face a financial crunch as President Trump's reciprocal tariffs take effect on Wednesday, slapping new import duties on products from almost every nation across the globe.",
      "Some small businesses told CBS News they're worried about the impact from the sharp increase in tariffs that they'll soon be required to pay to the federal government. After paying the levies, they said they'll be left with two choices: raise the prices they charge customers or swallow the costs and take a financial hit.",
      "Small businesses, generally defined as enterprises with fewer than 500 employees and revenue of less than $7.5 million, account for almost half of all private-sector employment in the U.S. But they're also more vulnerable to tariff costs because they don't have the deep pockets or financial flexibility of large businesses, noted Aaron Terrazas, an economist at Gusto, which provides payroll and HR services to small and midsize businesses.",
      "\"For many small businesses, this is a one-two punch,\" Terrazas said. \"They are getting higher prices from suppliers, and their customers are more skittish\" just as they're grappling with heavier tariffs.",
      "Among those businesses reckoning with the added costs is Simplified, an online stationery business that has manufactured its colorful planners in China since 2013. Its owner, Emily Ley, told CBS News that the new reciprocal tariffs \"will have a devastating impact\" on her business, costing her an additional $630,000 in fees over the next year.",
      "On April 3, Ley filed a lawsuit\u00a0alleging Mr. Trump has exceeded his authority in dictating the import duties. Under the Constitution, Congress has the power to impose tariffs and regulate foreign commerce.",
      "\"This additional tax burden is catastrophic to our business,\" Ley added. \"We've already raised our prices as much as possible to absorb previous tariff increases. There's a limit to how much we can increase prices before we price ourselves out of the market.\"",
      "To cope with the costs, she said the company is reducing salaries and scaling back expansion plans.",
      "Recipe for a revival?",
      "Mr. Trump has said tariffs will revive American manufacturing by incentivizing both domestic and foreign companies to build factories in the U.S. But small businesses, which typically operate on thin margins, generally don't have the capacity to quickly shift their supply chains or build local production facilities given the higher cost of labor in the U.S.",
      "Even large businesses that have the financial heft to move its plants back to the U.S., such as Apple, would require years to build a factory in the U.S., noted Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in an April 8 research note.",
      "\"Maybe over time, we will build a supplier base, but that takes time,\" Terrazas said. \"But in the interim there is this transition period that is very perilous for small businesses.\"",
      "Not all small businesses can wait that long. Alyssa Chambers, the founder of NOVA Essence Inside Out, which makes candles and other wellness products, said she plans to absorb the cost of tariffs applied to the Chinese-made candle jars and waxes she relies on \u2014 for now.",
      "Chambers said she would reassess her business' pricing toward the end of summer and depending on the state of the economy.",
      "For small businesses, buying from American manufacturers isn't really an option, Chambers added, noting that a U.S.-made candle jar costs about $12 each. By contrast, she can buy a 15-pack of jars made in China for about $20. Although she expects that price to rise to about $40 after the tariffs hit home, it's still cheaper than buying domestically.",
      "Other small businesses simply don't have the option of buying from domestic manufacturers, said Matt Weyandt, co-founder of chocolate maker Xocolatl. Because cocoa is grown near the equator, very little of it can be grown in the U.S., he noted.",
      "\"Despite that, we'll now be paying an additional 10% or more for all of our cocoa beans on top of their already elevated prices,\" Weyandt said. \"This is not going to bring cocoa farming jobs to the U.S. or increase American manufacturing \u2014 it's just going to hurt American chocolate manufacturers.\"",
      "To be sure, there are some small businesses that could continue to thrive even with higher tariffs Terrazas said. That includes domestic food manufacturers or health care businesses that don't rely on imports, such as elder or child care companies.",
      "Skittish consumers",
      "Small businesses are coping with the tariffs just as Americans are growing more pessimistic about the economy, with consumer confidence slumping to a 12-year low last month.",
      "\"In the long term, American consumers are really remarkable. But in the short term, it's hard,\" said Kevin Klowden, an economist with the Milken Institute, a think tank. \"It is definitely different because this is an intent to force a structural shift.\"",
      "But, Klowden added, Mr. Trump is doing so \"by significantly putting pressure on the cost structure of the entire system.\"",
      "Whether inflation-weary consumers will accept price hikes from businesses remains to be seen. If the tariffs aren't reduced, inflation could pick up this year, reaching as high as 4% by year end, up from about 2.8% currently, according to Wall Street economists.",
      "\"This is a moment of elevated risk for the economy,\" Terrazas said.",

    "summary": "President Trump's reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries go into effect Wednesday. Here's what to know about the import taxes.",
    "story": [
      "A core element of the protectionist trade policies President Trump\u00a0announced last week\u00a0\u2014 an import tax blitz on long-standing global trade partners he referred to as \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 are so-called reciprocal tariffs.",
      "The additive tariffs were unveiled alongside an across-the-board levy of 10% on\u00a0dozens of nations and territories, from major exporters to the U.S. such as China to the British-controlled Falkland Islands, which has fewer than 4,000 residents.",
      "\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in the April 2 news conference, touting the tariffs as a way to boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with countries he said impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products.",
      "But economists note that that in addition to roiling global commerce and driving up costs\u00a0for U.S. consumers and businesses, the tit-for-tat tariffs with key trading partners are hard to structure.",
      "While the 10% baseline tariffs on all U.S. trading partners went into effect on April 5, the reciprocal levies are\u00a0 set to take effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 9.",
      "Here's what to know about Mr. Trump's reciprocal tariffs.",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "Truly reciprocal tariffs would impose the same tax on U.S. imports that other countries charge on American exports on a product-by-product basis. For example, if a country imposed a 6% levy on American-made shoes, Mr. Trump would tax that nation's footwear at the same rate.",
      "Currently, the U.S. and its trading partners charge each other different levies on the same products. Germany, for instance, puts higher tariffs on vehicles made in the U.S. than what Washington, D.C., charges for German vehicle imports.",
      "\"Reciprocal means that if a country has higher tariffs than we do on certain products, we would raise it to that level,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning public policy think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "But applying tariffs that match other countries' exactly would be an administratively complex task given the tens of thousands of codes that determine the tariff rates on a variety of products, noted Jacquez.",
      "CBS News 24/7 is answering your questions about tariffs in a special airing on Wednesday at 6 p.m. ET. Download the\u00a0CBS News app\u00a0on your phone or connected TV to watch it live.",
      "\"Setting up reciprocal tariffs across every product category with every trade partner would be completely infeasible with our administrative capacity,\" he said.",
      "Other experts have suggested that Trump's goal behind the levies is less about driving companies to shift their production to the U.S., or generating federal revenue, than about pressuring other nations to strike trade deals with the Trump administration.",
      "Are reciprocal tariffs the same as country-specific tariffs?",
      "Rather than impose perfectly reciprocal tariffs across the board, the White House announced country-specific tariff rates calibrated to their trade imbalances with the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump on April said his administration would impose reciprocal tariffs at roughly half the rate of duties charged by other nations. In calculating the percentage of taxes charged by each nation on U.S. exports, the White House said it included not just levies, but all trade practices on a country-by-country basis that it deemed unfair, including currency manipulation, tariffs and other barriers. Mr. Trump characterized the discounted tariff rates as \"kind.\"",
      "For example, the U.S. said it would match China's 67% rate with a 34% tariff on Chinese exports to the U.S. China retaliated last week, saying it would impose its own\u00a034% import fee\u00a0on American products, to which Mr. Trump threatened an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports. If Mr. Trump carries through with the threat, U.S. tariffs on imports from China would reach a combined 104%.",
      "At 50%, Lesotho, an African nation, and French territories Saint Pierre and Miquelon face the highest country-specific tariff rates. Vietnam, where Apple produces some of its iPhones, is subject to a 46% tariff under Mr. Trump's plan.",
      "Jacquez, who formerly worked as an economic policy analyst in the Biden administration, anticipated that the White House would \"come up with a blended rate that is not reciprocal by product, but is reciprocal by saying their tariffs are 10% higher than ours on average, so we'll be imposing 10% tariff across-the-board on all goods.\"",
      "As a result, the U.S. would tax some other nations' products at vastly different rate than they do ours, in a scenario Jacquez predicted would lead to retaliation against the U.S.",
      "\"It will hit a lot of products very differently in a proximate way, because it would be balanced by country but not by import or export,\" Jacquez said. \"That is where complications will arise, and you could see a scenario in which countries retaliate against us.\"",
      "Who are the \"Dirty 15\"?",
      "Trump administration officials have singled out a group of nations they dubbed the \"Dirty 15,\" a reference to the 15% of countries expected to be hit hardest by the new reciprocal tariffs given their trade surplus with the U.S.",
      "Those nations account for \"a huge amount of our trading volume,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on March 18, without naming the trade partners. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also told Fox News that the White House is targeting 10 to 15 nations with the biggest trade surplus with the U.S. Like Bessent, he also refrained from naming those nations.",
      "Simon MacAdam, deputy chief global economist with Capital Economics, anticipated that likely targets would include leading U.S. trading partners such as China, the European Union and Vietnam. In 2024, the largest U.S. trade deficits around the globe \u2014 meaning countries from which the U.S. imports more than it exports \u2014 were with the following nations, according to federal data:",

      "While the levies have not yet gone into effect, experts say any reciprocal tariffs would mean added costs for U.S. businesses, which in turn would likely raise consumer prices\u00a0as companies look to protect their profit margins.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tax on a business bringing a product into the country. When they receive it at a port of entry, whether it be an airport or seaport, they have to pay the duty to have it admitted into the country,\" Chris Barrett, a professor at Cornell SC Johnson School of Business, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You've just added a cost on for the business, and those costs get passed on, at least to some degree, to consumers.\"",
      "Consumer costs are likely to rise more sharply for products for which there are no comparable substitutes.",
      "\"The more price-insensitive they are, the more likely they are to shoulder the burden of the tax,\" Barrett said.",

      "The Supreme Court went on to say that the intended scope of the term \"effectuate\" in the lower court's decision is unclear and may exceed its authority. The high court directed the district court to provide more clarification with the case sent back for further proceedings.",
      "\"The district court should clarify its directive, with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs,\" the court said in an unsigned opinion. \"For its part, the Government should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps.\"",
      "There were no noted dissents, and the three liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, noted their respect for the court's disposition of the application. Sotomayor said in a statement joined by Kagan and Jackson that there is agreement among the justices \"that the proper remedy is to provide Abrego Garcia with all the process to which he would have been entitled had he not been unlawfully removed to El Salvador.\"",
      "\"As the Supreme Court correctly recognized, it is the exclusive prerogative of the President to conduct foreign affairs,\" a Department of Justice spokesperson said Thursday. \"By directly noting the deference owed to the Executive Branch, this ruling once again illustrates that activist judges do not have the jurisdiction to seize control of the President's authority to conduct foreign policy.\"",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to step in after a federal district judge on Friday ordered it to take immediate action to return Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. The 29-year-old Salvadoran national was arrested by immigration authorities on March 15 and was among the more than 200 people sent on deportation flights to El Salvador last month. They are now being held at the notorious Salvadoran supermax prison known as CECOT.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case sparked backlash after a federal immigration official acknowledged in a court filing last week that his removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error\" and \"oversight.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. illegally in 2011 when he was 16 years old and was arrested in 2019, according to court documents. During immigration proceedings, the Department of Homeland Security claimed that Abrego Garcia was a member of the gang MS-13, citing a Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie he was wearing and allegations from a confidential informant who said he belonged to a branch of MS-13 that operates on Long Island, New York, court records show.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers said he has never lived on Long Island and has no affiliation with MS-13. They also said he has no criminal history and has never been charged or convicted of any criminal offenses in the U.S. or El Salvador.",
      "An immigration judge detained Abrego Garcia after denying a request for release on bond, which was upheld by an immigration appeals board. But he was ultimately granted withholding of removal to El Salvador, a legal status that prohibits the government from returning him to his home country because he is more likely than not to face persecution from local gangs, according to court records.",
      "Abrego Garcia was released from custody following that decision and has lived for six years in Maryland with his wife and their children. He had regular check-ins with immigration authorities, according to court filings, but was arrested on March 12 after he was stopped by immigration agents while driving with his son in the back seat. Abrego Garcia was taken into custody and transported to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities in Baltimore, Louisiana and Texas before he was flown to El Salvador, according to legal filings.",
      "After Abrego Garcia was sent to the Salvarodan prison last month, he and his wife, a U.S. citizen, filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Maryland alleging his removal violated federal immigration law and seeking an order requiring his return to U.S. custody.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis granted that request following a hearing Friday and directed the government to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. no later than 11:59 p.m. Monday. The Justice Department asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit to halt that order, and while its request was pending, asked the Supreme Court to intervene. The 4th Circuit then declined to pause the district court's decision.",
      "In a filing with the Supreme Court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the lower court order \"sets the United States up for failure\" because it interfered with President Trump's ability to conduct foreign diplomacy and set a tight timeline for compliance. He wrote that the U.S. cannot force the release of Abrego Garcia because he is now in the custody of the Salvadoran government.",
      "\"The United States does not control the sovereign nation of El Salvador, nor can it compel El Salvador to follow a federal judge's bidding,\" the solicitor general wrote.",
      "Sotomayor warned in her statement that the government's argument \"implies that it could deport and incarcerate any person, including U. S. citizens, without legal consequence, so long as it does so before a court can intervene.\"",
      "Lawyers for Abrego Garcia called his case \"one of one,\" and argued in court papers that requiring the government to facilitate their client's return is \"not novel,\" because the district court's order just requires the Trump administration to correct its own error.",
      "\"The executive branch may not seize individuals from the streets, deposit them in foreign prisons in violation of court orders, and then invoke the separation of powers to insulate its unlawful actions from judicial scrutiny,\" they wrote.",
      "Abrego Garcia's legal team called the government's mistake in removing him \"Kafka-esque,\" and noted that he has lived in the U.S. for several years without any issues.",
      "\"The government offers no evidence that he has become a threat overnight,\" they wrote.",
      "Migrants removed from the U.S. are being housed in CECOT as a result of a temporary agreement the Trump administration reached with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, under which the U.S. government is paying the Salvadoran government $6 million to hold U.S. detainees for a year.",
      "Citing this arrangement, Abrego Garcia's lawyers argued that the U.S. government \"functionally controls Abrego Garcia's detention \u2014 it has simply contracted with El Salvador to be the jailer.\"",
      "Lower courts also said that the government has control over Abrego Garcia, since he is being temporarily housed in CECOT at the Trump administration's request.",
      "\"The government's claim that it can remove an individual from the United States pursuant to such an agreement and thereby lose the ability to reclaim that individual and return him to the country for process (or for any other purpose) cannot stand,\" Judge Stephanie Thacker, who sits on the 4th Circuit, wrote in an opinion. She added that \"the government's actions in this case most assuredly violated the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.\"",
      "Thacker, who was joined by Judge Robert King, wrote that \"the government cannot escape its responsibility to return Abrego Garcia to the United States by claiming it now lacks authority to control El Salvador.\"",
      "While the Trump administration has acknowledged that it inadvertently sent Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, it has argued that the federal courts do not have the power to demand his return since he's no longer in U.S. custody. Administration officials have also claimed that he is an MS-13 \"leader,\" though they have not produced evidence to support the allegations.",
      "During last week's hearing before Xinis, Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni repeatedly struggled to answer the judge's questions but said he wasn't given sufficient information by the administration.",
      "\"The facts are conceded, plaintiff Abrego Garcia should not have been removed,\" Reuveni said.",
      "When questioned about why the government is not able to return Abrego Garcia, Reuveni said he \"asked the government the same question\" and did not receive an answer. The Justice Department lawyer said multiple times he was \"frustrated\" with the government's lack of cooperation in the case.",
      "Following Friday's argument, Reuveni was placed on administrative leave, and Sauer said in a filing that his statements were \"inappropriate\" and \"do not reflect the position of the United States.\"",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News about Reuveni's employment status, Attorney General Pam Bondi said, \"At my direction, every Department of Justice attorney is required to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States. Any attorney who fails to abide by this direction will face consequences.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 18:48:25 -0400",
    "summary": "In the memo, which was obtained by CBS News, Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote that Mahmoud Khalil's role in Columbia's protests is in conflict with American foreign policy objectives\u200b.",
    "story": [
      "Faced with a deadline to provide evidence in its deportation case against activist Mahmoud Khalil, lawyers for the federal government instead filed a memorandum by Secretary of State Marco Rubio to a Louisiana immigration court.",
      "In the memo, which was obtained by CBS News, Rubio wrote that Khalil's role in protests on the campus of Columbia University is in conflict with American foreign policy objectives. Rubio did not cite specific evidence against Khalil. He stated that Khalil is deportable under a little-known statute in federal immigration law that provides the government is entitled to deport noncitizens whose presence in the U.S. damages national foreign policy interests.",
      "Rubio argued that the presence of Khalil, a 30-year-old legal permanent resident, undermines \"U.S. policy to combat anti-Semitism around the world and in the United States, in addition to efforts to protect Jewish students from harassment and violence in the United States.\"",
      "Khalil was a prominent voice in the spring 2024 pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University, where he earned a master's degree from the School of International and Public Affairs in December 2024. He was detained by federal immigration authorities at his university-owned apartment as his pregnant wife looked on. He was moved from New York to a detention center in New Jersey before being flown to a remote facility in Jena, Louisiana.",
      "The government claims that Khalil has supported Hamas, and can be deported if it is determined his presence and activities threaten the foreign policy interests of the U.S., citing alleged support for Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group. To date, CBS News has not found evidence that Khalil has said he supports Hamas.",
      "Assistant chief immigration Judge Jamee Comans on Tuesday said she would terminate the case unless the government showed evidence supporting the removal of the former Columbia student. Khalil's attorney Marc Van Der Hout said at the hearing that he had \"not received a single document\" of evidence from the government.",
      "\"I'd like to see the evidence,\" Comans said, demanding that the government make a filing within 24 hours.",
      "In response, the Department of Homeland Security submitted the two-page memo from Rubio, which includes references to Khalil and one other lawful permanent resident whose name was redacted.",
      "Rubio wrote that they should be removed from the country because their \"presence or activities would compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest.\"",
      "\"The foreign policy of the United States champions core American interests and American citizens,\" he continued, \"and condoning anti-Semitic conduct and disruptive protests in the United States would severely undermine that significant foreign policy objective.\"",
      "Rubio pointed to Khalil's participation in what he descirbed as \"antisemitic protests and disruptive activities,\" which he said creates a \"hostile environment for Jewish students,\" as well as \"unlawful activity\" during those protests.",
      "\"The government can't just operate on hidden law based on one executive official's say so,\" said Baher Azmy, Legal Director of the Center of Constitutional Rights during a press call about Khalil on Thursday. \"Does anyone here know what conduct they would have to engage in that would trigger an adverse foreign policy interest to The United States? No one does. No one can. Which is what's so dangerous about this law.\"",
      "Comans has set a removability hearing for Khalil on Friday at 1 p.m., at which she could determine whether sufficient evidence has been provided to support the continuation of his immigration case.",
      "The government had previously said Khalil should be expelled for what it's described as \"material support\" for the militant group Hamas via his role in campus protests against Israel.",
      "Khalil's attorneys, who have also sued the government on his behalf, lambasted the government, saying the government was depriving him of his right to free speech.",
      "\"After a month of hiding the ball since Mahmoud's late-night unjust arrest in New York and taking him away to a remote detention center in Louisiana, immigration authorities have finally admitted that they have no case whatsoever against him,\" said Van Der Hout. \"Instead, the government is clearly going after Mahmoud and persecuting him for exercising his First Amendment rights.\"",
      "After Khalil's arrest, President Trump said it was just the first \"of many to come.\" His statement heralded a crackdown on students and alleged \"agitators\" who have protested against Israel.",
      "Foreign-born students across the country have since faced the knocks of immigration agents at the door, and deportation proceedings.",
      "\"If the secretary of state claims the power to arrest, detain and deport someone, including a lawful permanent resident, simply because that person dissents from US foreign policy, there are no limits. There's no beginning and no end to that kind of executive power,\" said Johnny Sinodis, an attorney for Khalil's immigration case.",
      "\"This is not a routine immigration case or even routine habeas case,\" he added. \"This case is intentionally projecting a message of repression about who can say what in this country and the consequences to your liberty and your life if you object to U.S. policy.\""

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 16:36:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The SAVE Act could change voter registration requirements for millions of people. Here's how.",
    "story": [
      "A claim circulating on social media suggests that married people who changed their last name will face difficulties when trying to vote under the proposed Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act.",
      "Experts say the bill, which\u00a0passed in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday, April 10, would not explicitly prevent these voters from casting a ballot, but it could create barriers to registration by requiring them to show additional documentation.",
      "The measure now heads to the Senate. If it passes in the Senate and is\u00a0signed into law, the act would amend the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, which requires states\u00a0to offer voter registration when obtaining a driver's license, to mandate documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration.",
      "This means that common forms of ID used for voter registration, including driver's licenses, would no longer be accepted as they are not generally considered proof of citizenship. Instead, voters would have to present documents such as a U.S. passport, a birth certificate, or naturalization paperwork to register.",
      "The Center for American Progress analysis estimated as many as 69 million have taken their spouse's name but do not have a matching birth certificate. \"The fate of those 69 million women are basically up in the air, the way the bill is written,\" said Greta Bedekovics, associate director of democracy policy at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy and advocacy group.",
      "Opponents argue that the law could also make voting more difficult for military and rural voters by upending both mail-in and online voter registration. Bedekovic said it would make an in-person trip to the election office the only \"viable way for Americans across the country to register to vote,\" adding that rural voters are less likely to have a passport and may have to travel hours to obtain and submit documents.",
      "According to Congress.gov, the bill also \"establishes criminal penalties\" for registering someone who does not have the right documents to vote.",
      "Eliza Sweren-Becker, senior counsel in the Brennan Center's Voting Rights and Elections Program, noted that the bill \"does not specify what extra documents\" married individuals would need to produce, adding that \"election officials, who would face legal risks under the bill, would be hesitant to register women whose documentation name does not match their current name.\"",
      "\"This in-person 'show your papers' requirement would keep many eligible voters out of the voting booth \u2014 beyond the millions who already lack ready access to their citizenship documents \u2014 and cause chaos for election administration,\" said Sweren-Becker.",
      "As of January 2025, eight states require proof of citizenship to register to vote, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Americans widely support both voter ID requirements and proof of citizenship. A\u00a02024 Gallup survey found more than 4 in 5 respondents supported proof of citizenship requirements for first-time voters.",
      "Supporters of the bill, including U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly, a Republican from Pennsylvania, argue that it is necessary to prevent noncitizens from voting.",
      "However,\u00a0noncitizen voting is already illegal and rare. In a study following the 2016 election, the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice found just 30 suspected cases of noncitizen voting out of 23.5 million votes cast in the 42 jurisdictions reviewed.",
      "A 2023 Pew Research survey found\u00a0that about 80% of women married to men in the U.S. take their husband's last name. Under the SAVE Act, if their voter registration name differs from the name on their birth certificate or passport, they may need to show additional documents.",
      "If the SAVE Act were to become law, Bedekovics said married women who have changed their names should obtain certified copies of all marriage certificates, locate their birth certificates, and keep any change-of-name documentation on hand for any updates to their voter registration.",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 16:14:04 -0400",
    "summary": "The vote was initially delayed amid conservatives' concerns about the level of spending cuts.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House on Thursday adopted a budget blueprint for President Trump's agenda after Republican leaders scrambled to convince GOP holdouts who want deeper spending cuts to back it.",
      "The resolution was adopted in a 216-214 vote, with two Republicans \u2014 Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Victoria Spartz of Indiana \u2014 joining all Democrats to vote against it.",
      "About a dozen House conservatives ultimately flipped their opposition after receiving assurances from leaders that the Senate would pursue $1.5 trillion in savings, at a minimum.",
      "\"Our two chambers are directly aligned,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said before the vote. \"We're committed to finding at least $1.5 trillion in savings for the American people while also preserving our essential programs.\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, echoed that the Senate is \"aligned with the House in terms of what their budget resolution outlined in terms of savings.\"",
      "\"The speaker talked about $1.5 trillion dollars. We have a lot of United States senators who believe that is a minimum,\" Thune said.",
      "The lower chamber was set to vote Wednesday evening on the budget resolution but punted after several House conservatives resisted increasing pressure from Mr. Trump to accept the blueprint that would open the door to implementing his border security, defense, energy priorities and extending expiring tax cuts.",
      "Approving the budget plan in both chambers is the first step in the reconciliation process, which allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation in the Senate and pass Mr. Trump's agenda with a simple majority. Going that route allows Republicans, who have control of the House and Senate, to pass the measure without any support from Democrats.",
      "The House and Senate worked on separate blueprints earlier this year but more recently reached a compromise resolution, which the Senate adopted early Saturday morning. Republican leaders in the House worked to unite their divided party behind the budget plan this week before Congress leaves town for a two-week recess.",
      "The Senate set much lower minimum floors for spending cuts at just about $4 billion, though committees could find far more. The compromise resolution also allows for the House to slash at least $1.5 trillion in spending.",
      "The Senate also wants to account for tax cuts enacted during Mr. Trump's first term with a tactic known as \"current policy baseline,\" which assumes that continuing expiring policies will cost nothing. Under that baseline, the nearly $4 trillion it would cost to extend the 2017 tax cuts would not be counted, further frustrating House conservatives.",
      "Johnson said House and Senate committees would be working in a \"collaborative fashion\" over the two-week recess to find savings.",
      "Before backing the resolution, House conservatives wanted assurances from the Senate that there will be deeper spending cuts, which sent leadership scrambling to find another compromise.",
      "\"We just don't trust the Senate,\" Rep. Eric Burlison, a Missouri Republican, told reporters Wednesday night after fiscal hawks huddled with Johnson for more than hour as the vote was delayed. \"We all campaign on spending cuts, but again and again, that doesn't happen. And when the Senate sent over something that said $4 billion is their floor, that was unacceptable to a lot of us.\"",
      "Burlison was among those who changed their minds and voted in favor of the resolution. Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas said he and other holdouts were moved to support the resolution by a White House commitment to making \"significant cuts,\" Johnson's \"firm commitment\" to maintain House Republicans' framework of tying tax cuts to spending cuts and Thune's \"strong statement\" promising at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts.",
      "Massie, one of the two Republicans who held firm on his \"no\" vote, called it \"a framework for financial collapse.\"",
      "\"I don't believe they're going to make any cuts of any consequence. Now they may change spending, reduce spending here, and increase spending there, but overall, the money spent next year is going to be more than the money spent this year,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump increased pressure on House Republicans in recent days to swallow the blueprint, telling holdouts on Tuesday night, \"close your eyes and get there.\" He added that individual lawmakers may not get \"every little ounce\" of what they want in the legislation.",
      "\"It's a phenomenal bill. Stop grandstanding,\" Mr. Trump said at the House GOP campaign arm's fundraising dinner.",
      "Democrats have railed against the proposed cuts, arguing the Republican plan will lead to massive cuts in entitlement programs such as Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security.",
      "\"The budget resolution that passed the House today will set in motion some of the most extreme cuts to health care, nutritional assistance and the things that matter to everyday Americans in our nation's nearly 250-year history,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said Thursday. \"It's a disgrace.\"",

    "story": [
      "A Senate committee heard from several experts Thursday on setting a year-round time standard instead of switching back and forth with daylight saving time. President Trump recently called it a \"50/50 issue,\" but he previously vowed to get rid of daylight saving.",
      "At the hearing, the committee's chairman, Sen. Ted Cruz, said there is a general consensus among his colleagues that the system of switching the clocks needs to be changed, but he said there is disagreement about whether to adopt universal standard time or daylight saving time.",
      "\"I personally struggle with the two choices here, because it's a question of what do you care about more: sunshine and joy and fun and money, or health, mental health, physical health,\" said Cruz, a Republican from Texas. \"And the honest answer for most people, gosh, I care about all that stuff.\"",
      "Cruz said an alternative has been discussed to pick daylight saving time, but letting states opt out. Arizona and Hawaii current opt out of changing the clock. But others said in Thursday's hearing that having different standards for different states could cause widespread confusion.",
      "The Senate Commerce Committee hearing notice did not set a preference for daylight saving time or standard time, but instead said it would focus on \"various issues around whether the country should continue 'springing forward' and 'falling back' each year with time.\"",
      "Daylight saving time begins in March, when clocks are moved forward an hour, and ends in October, when the clocks go back to standard time.",
      "The twice-yearly time changes are\u00a0generally unpopular\u00a0among Americans, with 63% saying they\u00a0would like to eliminate\u00a0them completely, compared to just 16% who said they would not, according to an Economist/YouGov poll in November 2021.",

It is something we have been stuck with since World War I, and this is our opportunity to finally fix it.\"",
      "A 2020\u00a0commentary\u00a0for the journal JAMA Neurology found evidence linking the annual transition to daylight saving time to\u00a0increased strokes,\u00a0heart attacks\u00a0and\u00a0teen sleep deprivation.",
      "The Senate in 2022 passed a bill called the Sunshine Protection Act to make daylight saving time permanent, but the bill never went anywhere in the House. The 2022 bill had 17 cosponsors from both parties and was spearheaded by then-Sen. Marco Rubio, who is now the Secretary of State in the Trump administration.",
      "It's unclear where President Trump stands on the issue. Mr. Trump said in March that it's a \"50/50 issue,\" saying \"it's hard to get excited about it. I assume people would like to have more light later, but some people want to have more light earlier because they don't want to take their kids to school in the dark.\"",
      "But back in December, he posted on social media: \"Daylight Saving Time is inconvenient, and very costly to our Nation.\" In the same post, he said the \"Republican Party will use its best efforts to eliminate Daylight Saving Time, which has a small but strong constituency, but shouldn't!\"",
      "Mr. Trump in the past had supported making daylight saving time\u00a0permanent \u2014 that is, keeping clocks shifted one hour ahead, which happens in the spring. His\u00a0December comment\u00a0called for daylight saving time to be eliminated.",
      "In addition to Yates, testifying Thursday was Jay Karen, chief executive officer of the National Golf Course Owners Association; Karin Johnson, practicing physician and professor of neurology at UMass Chan School of Medicine Baystate, on behalf of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine; and David Harkey, president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.",

    "story": [
      "Meta whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams told senators in testimony Wednesday on Capitol Hill that the social media company worked \"hand in glove\" with the Chinese government to censor its platforms, among other allegations.",
      "\"I saw Meta executives repeatedly undermine U.S. national security and betray American values,\" Wynn-Williams said in her opening remarks, which were obtained by CBS News before the hearing.",
      "Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism and led the bipartisan hearing, said Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \"made censorship his business model.\"",
      "\"The evidence that we have in black and white is a company and leadership that is willing to do anything, anything, work with America's chief competitor, work with our chief adversary,\" Hawley said.",
      "Hawley sent a letter to Zuckerberg Thursday requesting his testimony before the subcommittee, writing, \"The American people deserve to know the truth about your company.\"",
      "Wynn-Williams began working at Meta, then known as Facebook, as the director of Global Public Policy in 2011. In her almost seven years with the company, Wynn-Williams told the panel she witnessed the company provide \"custom built censorship tools\" for the Chinese Communist Party. She said a Chinese dissident living in the United States was removed from Facebook in 2017 after pressure from Chinese officials. Facebook said at the time it took action against the regime critic, Guo Wengui, for sharing someone else's personal information.",
      "Wynn-Williams described the use of a \"virality counter\" that flagged posts with over 10,000 views for review by a \"chief editor,\" which Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called \"an Orwellian censor.\" These \"virality counters\" were used not only in Mainland China, but also in Hong Kong and Taiwan, according to Wynn-Williams's testimony.",
      "Wynn-Williams also told senators Chinese officials could \"potentially access\" the data of American users. When Meta engineers expressed concern about data security, Wynn-Williams testified that Meta leadership, including Zuckerberg, were indifferent.",
      "Wynn-Williams testified Zuckerberg was \"personally invested\" in Meta's business relationship with China, claiming he committed to learning Mandarin and \"had weekly Mandarin sessions with employees.\"",
      "Wynn-Williams alleged Meta's artificial intelligence model known as \"Llama\" was used to help DeepSeek. DeepSeek is a Chinese AI company that sent shockwaves through the American technology industry earlier this year when its AI model was shown to be competitive with OpenAI's ChatGPT at a fraction of the cost.",
      "In a statement last year on Llama, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone wrote, \"The alleged role of a single and outdated version of an American open-source model is irrelevant when we know China is already investing over 1T to surpass the US technologically, and Chinese tech companies are releasing their own open AI models as fast, or faster, than US ones.\"",
      "Wynn-Williams encouraged senators to continue investigating Meta's role in the development of artificial intelligence in China, as they continue their probe into the social media company founded by Zuckerberg.",
      "\"The greatest trick Mark Zuckerberg ever pulled was wrapping the American flag around himself and calling himself a patriot and saying he didn't offer services in China, while he spent the last decade building an $18 billion business there,\" she said.",
      "In response to her opening statement, a Meta spokesperson called Wynn-Williams' testimony \"divorced from reality and riddled with false claims.\"",
      "\"While Mark Zuckerberg himself was public about our interest in offering our services in China and details were widely reported beginning over a decade ago, the fact is this: we do not operate our services in China today,\" Meta said in a statement.",
      "Meta, which changed its name from Facebook in 2021, operates some of the most popular social media platforms in the United States, including its previous namesake Facebook as well as Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads.",
      "Washington is taking a more aggressive posture toward China and its growing threat to American economic interests and national security. The Trump administration increased tariffs on imported goods from China to 125% Wednesday. The administration also continues to pursue the sale of TikTtok, a short-form video platform owned by Chinese company ByteDance, to an American buyer. And on Capitol Hill in 2023, the House of Representatives created the Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party to investigate China's challenge to American global power.",

      "A man already jailed on federal charges of attempting to assassinate then-presidential candidate President Mr. Trump as he golfed last fall will face additional state terrorism and attempted murder charges, Florida's attorney general said Thursday.",
      "Ryan Routh tried to undermine the country's political system and will face state attempted first-degree murder and terrorism charges, Attorney General James Uthmeier said.",
      "\"Attempting to take the life of a former president and a leading presidential candidate isn't just an attack on one man, this was a political attack against our Republican form of government and our shares American values,\" Uthmeier said.",
      "Routh's lead attorney, Kristy Militello, didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "According to prosecutors, Routh plotted to kill Mr. Trump as Trump golfed at his West Palm Beach golf course in September. Secret Service officers spotted Routh before Trump came into view. Routh aimed his rifle at an agent, who opened fire, which led Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing, they said.",
      "Uthmeier, a Republican, criticized the Biden administration, accusing it of trying to \"frustrate our efforts\" and \"block\" his office's investigation. He lauded FBI director Kash Patel and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi for being willing to \"work together to pursue justice.\"",
      "Routh is jailed on federal charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, assaulting a federal officer, being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition, and possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number.",
      "He is due in court on the federal charges in September. The lag between his arrest and his next court date was granted to give his attorneys time to review hundreds of hours of footage from police body cameras and surveillance cameras, and to pore over material from Routh's 17 cellphones and other electronic devices.",
      "On Tuesday, the government submitted new evidence against Routh, alleging that in March and April 2024, Routh spent over a week in West Palm Beach, \"engaging in apparent reconnaissance for his assassination attempt.\"",
      "\"Routh's acidity is undeniably necessary context for the jury to understand the significance of Routh's conduct on September 15 at Trump International because it shows his planning for what happened that day and his familiarity with locations he revisited on and leading up to September 15, including the South Bay area where he camped in the weeks beforehand, and Southern Boulevard, the main road from South Bay to Trump International,\" the government wrote in the court documents.",
      "The government also alleged that Routh sought to acquire anti-aircraft weapons to shoot down Mr. Trump's plane.",
      "Shortly after Routh's arrest, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said the state would conduct its own investigation and could bring charges that aren't available at the federal level.",
      "If convicted of the attempted assassination charge, Routh could be sentenced to life in prison.",

      "U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink intends to resign from her post early, three sources told CBS News.",
      "The State Department confirmed her intent to step down\u00a0Thursday afternoon.",
      "\"Ambassador Brink is stepping down. She's been the ambassador there for three years \u2013 that's a long time in a war zone. And frankly, the war has gone on for far too long,\" a State Department spokesperson said in a statement. \"The real issue is whether the Russians and Ukrainians are ready to do what's necessary to end this war.\"",
      "Brink has not formally submitted resignation papers but she has been making farewell calls to colleagues, sources said.",
      "Ambassador Brink has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "One senior U.S. official told CBS that her resignation stems from an unusual mix of personal and policy concerns, including the recent USAID layoffs. Brink is serving in a war zone far from her family, since Kyiv is designated as an unaccompanied post, where officers serve without bringing their families with them.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio intended to keep Brink, a career foreign service officer, in the job and declined the initial resignation she had submitted in January as part of the standard turnover between administrations.",
      "Brink's resignation comes at a pivotal moment for U.S.-Ukraine relations. The Trump administration has tried to broker an end to the Russian invasion in part by ending the policy of diplomatically isolating Vladimir Putin, who invaded Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "While Ukraine accepted a U.S. ceasefire proposal, Russia has not. It is not clear whether President Trump has set any deadline for conclusion of the diplomacy, but he's continuing to have special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff at the fore of outreach to Russia.",
      "At NATO meeting last week, Rubio indicated U.S. patience with Russia was wearing thin.",
      "\"We will know soon enough, in a matter of weeks, not months, whether Russia is serious about peace or not. I hope they are,\" Rubio said on April 4.",
      "Mr. Trump's longtime fascination with Putin and frustration with Ukraine's Zelenskyy has complicated the diplomacy, and prompted concern from Western allies.",
      "His distrust of Zelenskyy was visible in an explosive Oval Office confrontation in February. Mr. Trump told Zelenskyy to reach a ceasefire agreement with Russia or \"we're out,\" and Vice President JD Vance accused the Ukrainian president of being \"disrespectful\" after he challenged the vice president's assertion that the war had dragged on because of a lack of diplomacy from Ukraine and the Biden administration. Vice President JD Vance also admonished Zelensky: \"Have you said 'thank you' once, this entire meeting?\"",
      "The Trump administration subsequently paused military and intelligence aid to Ukraine amid the fallout. That intelligence support resumed once Ukraine agreed to go along with the Trump administration's outreach to Putin. Mr. Trump continues to sit on the nearly $4 billion in remaining U.S. military aid already designated for Ukraine. The U.S. has been a key supplier of weapons since the Russian invasion began.",

      "As President Trump announced a pause to his sweeping reciprocal tariffs Wednesday, his trade representative, Jamieson Greer, was in the middle of testifying at a House hearing on the administration's trade policy.",
      "Greer appeared to learn of the president's decision to pause the tariffs for 90 days the same time the public did, as he was sitting before members of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade.",
      "Asked when he was made aware of the pause by Rep. Steven Horsford, a Democrat from Nevada, Greer said, \"Well, I understood the decision was made a few minutes ago. It's something that's been under discussion.\"",
      "\"So did you know that this was under discussion and why did you not include that as part of your opening remarks?\" Horsford asked.",

      "Immediately after Mr. Trump announced the pause, the U.S. stock market surged. It had fallen significantly after the president's initial announcement on the tariffs. A universal tariff of 10% remained in place for nearly every country, except China, which faces an even higher tariff of 125%. China raised its own tariffs against the U.S.",
      "Horsford pressed Greer for details of the pause.",

      "\"And what do you know about those details?\" Horsford asked. Before Greer could answer, he said, \"It looks like your boss just pulled the rug out from under you.\"",
      "\"There's no strategy,\" Horsford said. \"You just found out. Three seconds ago. Sitting here. We saw you. If you came here knowing that you were going to be turned off, that these tariffs were going to be turned off, why didn't you include that in your opening statement? Why didn't you reference that as part of your testimony?\"",
      "Greer repeated he doesn't disclose his conversations with the president.",
      "\"These were specific questions we asked you all along,\" Horsford said. \"What's the strategy? These are real consequences for the American people and small businesses. \u2026 This is amateur hour and it needs to stop. What does this even mean for your negotiating strategy? How are you in charge of negotiation if the president is tweeting about this from wherever the hell he is?\"",
      "\"The president was elected and he runs the trade policy and I advise him and execute his policy,\" Greer said.",
      "\"Did you know that this was happening?\" Horsford pressed.",
      "\"We had been discussing all kinds of options, Sir,\" Greer said.",
      "\"There was no strategy. There was no plan,\" Horsford said, adding that Mr. Trump \"put our economy in disarray and near collapse.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued the tariffs were a \"negotiating strategy.\"",
      "Horsford asked Greer if this was market manipulation.",
      "When Greer answered, \"No,\" Horsford, said \"Why not? If it was a plan. If it was always the plan, how is this not market manipulation?\"",
      "\"We're trying to reset the global trade system,\" Greer said.",
      "\"And what has that done? How have you achieved any of that? But to enact enormous harm on the American people?\" Horsford said. \"Tariffs are a tool. It can be used in the appropriate way to protect U.S. jobs and small businesses, but that's not what this does, so if it's not market manipulation, what is it? Who's benefitting? What billionaire just got richer?\"",
      "Horsford then slammed Republicans for their budget plan and repeated to Greer, \"Who's in charge? Because it sure doesn't look like it's the trade representative. You just got the rug pulled out from under you.\"",
      "\"I wish I could feel some empathy, but the empathy I have is for the American people whose very wellbeing and livelihoods are being effected. This is not a game. This is real life,\" Horsford said before yielding his time.",

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed her release in a social media post early Thursday, but offered no information about the terms of her release.",

The swap of the two detainees was carried out in Abu Dhabi.",
      "Ratcliffe was directly involved in the negotiations, which he conducted with an unnamed senior Russian intelligence official, the CIA said.",

      "In exchange for Karelina, who lives in California, the CIA official confirmed that the U.S. had freed Arthur Petrov, a German-Russian national arrested in Cyprus 2023 at the request of U.S. authorities. According to the Journal, he was being held on allegations of exporting sensitive microelectronics.",
      "\"Much of the swap was negotiated by the U.S. government, with CIA playing a key role engaging with Russian intelligence,\" a CIA spokesperson said Thursday, adding, \"The exchange shows the importance of keeping lines of communication open with Russia, despite the deep challenges in our bilateral relationship.\"",

She didn't expect that her donation would end up supporting anti-Russian activities, according to her lawyers.",
      "Karelina's boyfriend, Chris Van Heerden, told CBS News last year that she had made the small donation in 2022, \"exercising her First Amendment rights,\" adding that \"she has done nothing wrong.\"",
      "Van Heerden said he was uneasy about Karelina's decision to return to Russia for a visit, given the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, but he said she \"had no worry in the world,\" and that she had assured him it would be safe since she was entering the country as a dual American-Russian citizen.",
      "\"She wanted to go home. She made it very clear that she wanted to go home,\" Van Heerden told Gayle King on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Wanting to fulfill her wish to visit home, Van Heerden said he bought her a plane ticket as a birthday gift, and the pair first traveled together to Istanbul.

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 06:09:33 -0400",
    "summary": "The candidates are set for this year's Virginia gubernatorial race, a closely watched bellwether just one year after President Trump's 2024 win.",
    "story": [
      "In what could be a key 2025 bellwether, Virginia's race for governor will also make history, all but guaranteeing the Commonwealth's first female governor. Democrat Abigail Spanberger, a former congresswoman and CIA officer, will face Republican Lt. Governor Winsome Earle-Sears, a Marine veteran, after both state parties confirmed their nominees in recent days.",
      "One of the only competitive races of the year, the Virginia gubernatorial contest will be closely watched by both parties \u2014 and is often treated as a referendum on the president's party. Historically, Virginia has voted for a governor of the opposite political party, every time a new president has been elected since 1977.",
      "The race is already breaking state records for fundraising, with Earle-Sears raising more than $3 million from January to March and Spanberger raising around $6.7 million during the same period, according to the campaigns.",
      "In an interview with \"America Decides,\" Spanberger told CBS News she believes national issues will weigh heavily on the race, from the Trump administration's mass layoffs of federal employees, more than 144,000 of whom live in Virginia, as well as what she called an \"antagonistic trade war.\"",
      "\"All of this impacts Virginia, and the stakes of this election reflect that,\" said Spanberger.",
      "When asked whether Earle-Sears supports President Trump's tariff policy, her campaign deflected but said in a statement, \"After leftists like Joe Biden and Abigail Spanberger devastated our economy and standing in the world\u2014President Trump is doing the work to put America first again.\"",
      "Earle-Sears has attacked Spanberger for her votes in Congress supporting Biden administration policies including the Inflation Reduction Act, which passed in 2022 with no Republican support. Earle-Sears argues it has contributed to inflation.",
      "\"I think it's a ridiculous assertion given that my opponent has been eager to claim credit for some of the funding that came through some of those federal dollars to Virginia's Commonwealth,\" Spanberger told CBS News. \"But, the reality is that my opponent is endeavoring to distract, because she's not talking about the fact that we've seen an absolute tanking of the stock market because of Donald Trump's actions.\"",
      "While the economy is a top issue for Virginians and both candidates, advocates are also hoping gun safety mobilizes voters.",
      "Spanberger is set to receive the endorsement of Everytown for Gun Safety Thursday, the group first told CBS News. Everytown, established by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, is also contributing $1 million to the race, which will include organizing efforts and political ads.",
      "Spanberger herself became a volunteer for pro-gun control group Moms Demand Action after leaving the CIA.",
      "\"Abigail Spanberger understands that common-sense laws to keep guns out of dangerous hands are crucial to ensuring public safety,\" John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, said of the endorsement.",
      "Everytown also points to their success at the state legislative level in 2023 when nine gun safety volunteers won races and helped flip the House of Delegates, the lower house of Virginia's legislature, to Democratic control.",
      "The group says internal polling from that year revealed it's a top three issue for Virginia voters in battleground districts across Northern Virginia, Richmond and Hampton Roads.",
      "Youngkin vetoed an assault weapons ban and other gun control bills that passed the state legislature last year.",
      "He did sign two other gun measures, including one that bans auto sears, a device that converts semi-automatic handguns into automatic weapons. He also signed \"Lucia's Law,\" making it a crime for parents who allow children deemed as threats to access firearms.",
      "Earle-Sears has supported the governor's vetoes.",
      "In 2021, Earle-Sears became the first Black woman ever elected to statewide office in Virginia. She will have to appeal to moderates and independent voters in the blue-leaning state but has given mixed messages on her support for Mr. Trump in recent years.",
      "In 2020, she co-chaired the group \"Black Americans to re-elect President Trump,\" but in 2022, following the midterms, she told FOX Business it was \"time to move on.\"",
      "\"A true leader understands when they have become a liability,\" she said during the interview. \"A true leader understands when it's time to step off the stage.\"",
      "She went on to vote for Mr. Trump in 2024. A source close to the campaign says she sees the president as a federal partner. It remains to be seen if Mr. Trump offers Earle-Sears an endorsement given the high stakes of this year's few marquee races.",
      "While Mr. Trump made inroads in Virginia during the 2024 presidential election, the state comfortably went for Vice President Kamala Harris in November.",
      "Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who is barred from serving back-to-back terms, endorsed his Lt. Governor early in the race.",

    "story": [
      "The Justice Department seeks to drop its criminal case against a Virginia man accused of being the \"East Coast leader\" of the MS-13 gang, weeks after Attorney General Pam Bondi announced his arrest in a nationally televised press conference last month.",
      "Bondi referred to Henrry Villatoro Santos as \"one of the top members and head of the East Coast\" of the violent MS-13 gang during a March 27 news conference in Manassas, Virginia. She also accused Villatoro Santos of being responsible for \"very violent crimes, anything you can associate with MS-13. He was the leader over it \u2014 all of the violent crimes.\"",
      "In a court filing Wednesday in Alexandria, Virginia, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia asked a judge \"to dismiss without prejudice the criminal complaint presently pending against the defendant.\" When asked why the government was moving to drop the case, a spokesperson for Bondi responded with a clip of Bondi saying on March 27 that Villatoro Santos \"won't be in this country much longer.\"",
      "Two sources familiar with the matter told CBS News the department is likely to seek to deport Villatoro Santos.",
      "\"As a terrorist, he will now face the removal process,\" Bondi said in a statement following CBS News' reporting.",
      "Any decision to deport Villatoro-Santos without first securing a criminal conviction on the crimes alleged by Bondi would break historical precedent, according to two former Justice Department officials who spoke with CBS News.",
      "Scott Fredericksen, a former federal prosecutor, told CBS News, \"Historically and consistently, if someone truly is a leader of a violent gang, we would always prosecute them first and convict them first \u2014 and make sure they can't get back into the country.\"",
      "Later Wednesday, in an unusual move, defense attorneys for Villatoro Santos asked a judge to delay the dismissal of his case, accusing the Justice Department, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and others of creating a media circus with \"breathless pronouncements\" about the allegations against Villatoro Santos.",
      "\"The danger of Mr. Villatoro Santos being unlawfully deported by ICE without due process and removed to El Salvador, where he would almost certainly be immediately detained at one of the worst prisons in the world without any right to contest his removal, is substantial, both in light of the Government's recent actions and the very public pronouncements in this particular case,\" his attorneys wrote in Wednesday's filing, citing the ongoing legal battle concerning alleged Venezuelan gang members who were sent to a Salvadoran prison, seemingly without due process.",
      "His attorneys said they feared the same fate would befall their client if the judge agreed to drop the case immediately.",
      "Villatoro Santos also noted they were \"keenly aware of the unusual nature of this motion. But these are unusual times.\"",
      "Charging documents filed against Villatoro Santos last month made only a fleeting reference to his alleged affiliation to MS-13. The charging documents said, \"FBI agents and (task force officers) also observed indicia of MS-13 association in the garage bedroom\" of Villatoro Santos' home. He was charged with one count of unlawful possession of a firearm and was ordered detained by a magistrate judge, pending future hearings.",
      "At the March 27 news conference, Virginia Gov. Glenn Younkin also appeared and referred to Villatoro-Santos as \"One of the top operatives in MS-13.\"",

    "summary": "Republicans' budget resolution was expected to get a final vote Wednesday night. But a number of Republicans have withheld their support.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on a Republican budget plan, lacking enough GOP support to get it over the finish line on Wednesday.",
      "Several House Republicans have resisted increasing pressure from President Trump to swallow a blueprint that's key to extending his tax cuts, which are set to expire this year.",
      "The resolution's passage was in peril heading into the planned vote, making it a gamble for Johnson, who huddled with conservatives off the House floor as the preceding vote was held open for more than an hour while he tried to flip the holdouts. It's the latest setback for Johnson and creates further uncertainty about the future of Mr. Trump's agenda.",
      "Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said the vote could be rescheduled for Thursday morning.",
      "At a fundraiser for House Republicans Tuesday night, Mr. Trump told GOP holdouts to \"close your eyes and get there.\" Earlier in the day, he met with some of them at the White House, urging them to back the budget resolution adopted by the Senate\u00a0on Saturday.",
      "But more than a dozen members have balked at the low level of spending cuts in the Senate resolution \u2014 just about $4 billion \u2014 compared with the nearly $1.5 trillion in cuts in the House version. The budget resolution serves as a blueprint for implementing Mr. Trump's border security, defense, energy and tax priorities.",
      "\"They have to do this. They have to get there,\" Mr. Trump said at the House GOP campaign arm's fundraising dinner, adding that he had a great meeting with some of the holdouts, but \"just in case there are a couple of Republicans out there \u2014 you just got to get there. Close your eyes and get there. It's a phenomenal bill. Stop grandstanding.\"",
      "The president criticized Democrats on their policies, but admired the fact that \"they always vote in unison,\" saying, \"you don't see somebody that's holding up.\"",
      "\"One little thing the Republican Party has to do is get together and damn vote,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that individual lawmakers may not get \"every little ounce \u2014 it doesn't work that way.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, who's played a key role in shepherding the House GOP on legislation in recent months, promised a \"massive victory\" in the 2026 midterm elections if Republicans follow through on the budget resolution and enact his agenda more broadly. He argued \"they will not be able to even touch your seat,\" and he predicted they'd pick up \"40, 50, or even 60\" seats in the House, an outcome that would defy conventional political dynamics, with the party in control of the White House often losing control of the House in the midterms.",
      "\"If we don't get it done because of stupidity or a couple of people that want to show how great they are, you just have to laugh at them or smile at them or cry right in their face,\" the president continued.",
      "On Wednesday morning, as the House Rules Committee prepared to consider the budget resolution, the president posted on Truth Social to coax the conference to fall in line.",
      "\"Republicans, it is more important now, than ever, that we pass THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL,\" he said. \"The USA will Soar like never before!!!\"",
      "Congressional leaders are pushing to get the budget plan adopted this week before they leave town for a two-week recess. Adopting the budget resolution marks the first step in the reconciliation process, a maneuver that enables Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation in the Senate and pass the measure with a simple majority. It will allow Republicans to approve the legislation funding the president's agenda without support from Democrats.",
      "After Republicans in the House and Senate had forged ahead on their own budget blueprints earlier this year, the Senate on Saturday adopted the compromise resolution, giving the House just days to overcome opposition and get it over the finish line before the recess. And while GOP leaders came together on the path forward in recent weeks, the approach has frustrated many House Republicans.",
      "The Senate set relatively low minimum floors for spending cuts for several committees, at just about $4 billion dollars, though they expect to find far more. At the same time, it allows for House plans to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending. On top of that, the Senate-adopted plan relies on a budget scoring method known as \"current policy,\" which assumes that continuing the expiring current policies will incur no cost. Under that baseline, the $3.8 trillion it would cost to extend the Trump tax cuts would not be counted.",
      "The Trump tax cuts were originally passed in 2017 using a \"current law\" baseline, and they were set to expire this year. This scoring method, which was also used in the House budget resolution, means that the $3.8 trillion cost to extend the tax cuts is counted as new spending.",
      "Fiscal hawks have criticized the Senate-backed plan, including Rep. Eric Burlison, a Missouri Republican, who told reporters Tuesday that \"there's no way\" the House adopts it at this point. Burlison said he could be convinced by a guarantee that the Senate will make deeper spending cuts, calling the levels currently outlined in the resolution \"anemic\" and \"a joke.\"",
      "GOP Rep. Eli Crane of Arizona, when asked if he'd consider backing the measure if he had assurances on spending cuts from the president, told reporters he would have to \"see some product from the Senate that actually shows that they're serious about cutting.\"",
      "Crane called the pressure from House GOP leadership to fall in line on the resolution to avoid jeopardizing the president's agenda \"nonsense.\"",
      "\"I think it's just another tactic to try and pressure us into the status quo,\" he added.",
      "During the House Rules Committee hearing on the resolution Wednesday, House Budget Committee chairman Jodey Arrington, a Texas Republican, said he has \"concerns\" about the Senate's resolution guiding the reconciliation process.",
      "Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican, reiterated during the meeting that \"the math still doesn't math.\"",
      "\"The Senate budget is all tax cuts and no spending cuts,\" Roy said, adding that he doesn't trust a promise from the Senate to cut spending.",
      "Roy said his message to the Senate and House GOP leaders, along with the White House, is to \"come show me the math.\"",

      "The tariff rate of 10% includes the European Union. It's unclear what will happen after the 90-day period concludes, while countries negotiate with the Trump administration. Previous tariff rates on steel, aluminum and auto imports remain unchanged, a White House official said.",
      "Mr. Trump wrote: \"Conversely, and based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters during a race car event at the White House on Wednesday afternoon, the president was asked to explain how he reached a decision to issue the pause.",
      "\"Well, l thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line, they were getting yippy, you know?\" the president said. \"They were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid, unlike these champions.\"",
      "\"I was watching the bond market,\" he added. \"The bond market is very tricky. I was watching it. But if you look at it now, it's, it's beautiful. The bond market right now is beautiful. But yeah, I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy.\"",
      "The president said he \"did a 90-day pause for the people that didn't retaliate.\"",
      "Bessent said he expects the number of countries trying to negotiate with the U.S., which is over 75 now, to climb even higher.",
      "\"President Trump wants to be personally involved,\" Bessent said in explaining the reason for the 90-day pause.",

      "\"We have dealt with people calling our line who have either taken measures to end their life or are sitting at home with a gun in their lap,\" she said.",
      "A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association outlines that, while calls have gone up, access to care after those initial calls has not increased. The study's authors are pushing for more awareness and funding to make 988 more effective for those in need.",
      "\"We want them to have a full crisis continuum of care,\" Morris said. \"We need more resources, we need more therapists, we need technology. We want to be able to answer those calls in the most efficient way possible.\"",
      "One in four adults in the U.S. lives with a diagnosable mental illness, according to the National Institutes of Health. But many more could be struggling without a diagnosis, and the numbers are expected to go up.",
      "Meanwhile, public health services nationwide could face further federal cuts.",
      "More than 10% of the staff working for the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA, which oversees the 988 hotline, were fired last month amid cuts by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. One SAMHSA employee said about a quarter of the agency's communication team, who work to raise awareness about the hotline, were let go.",
      "\"The ultimate goal is for all Americans to have access to crisis care for mental health and substance use issues, in the way that 911 provides rapid response for physical health emergencies,\" SAMHSA told CBS News in a statement. \"The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration is working diligently to support the development and sustainability of local treatment and support connected to 988, including the expansion of mobile crisis services and 24/7 walk-in crisis care clinics across the country. Transformation of this scale and building a cohesive crisis care system takes time, and there is more work needed to be able to deliver these critical services to the American public.\"",
      "Morris said additional cuts could lead to \"a very dire situation.\"",
      "\"If there was any funding cut to 988 or other mental health services, there would be more hospitalizations, more death, and more mental health issues,\" she said.",
      "If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can reach the\u00a0988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\u00a0by calling or texting 988. You can also\u00a0chat with the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline here.",

      "Glossip was convicted in the 1997 murder of a man who had been beaten to death. When Drummond examined the case, he learned the state knew its key witness lied during Glossip's trial.",
      "\"I think by Mr. Glossip's own testimony, he's guilty of at least accessory after the fact,\" Drummond explained. \"So he's guilty. But is he guilty of murder? That was the question.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily halted lower court decisions that voided President Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board, allowing their removals to go back into effect for now.",
      "Roberts issued an administrative stay that gives the Supreme Court more time to consider a Justice Department request to allow Mr. Trump's removal of Cathy Harris from the Merit Systems Protection Board and Gwynne Wilcox from the National Labor Relations Board. He gave lawyers for Harris and Wilcox until 5 p.m. on April 15 to file a response with the court.",
      "The Justice Department asked the Supreme Court earlier Wednesday to block a pair of district court decisions that restored Harris and Wilcox to their roles at the two independent boards. In a request for emergency relief from the high court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the orders harm the president and the separation of powers.",
      "Sauer asked the high court to issue a stay of district court decisions that found the firings unlawful and said the justices could also take up the case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rules. If the Supreme Court chooses that route, Sauer asked it to consider the constitutionality of federal laws that provide removal protections for members of the NLRB and MSPB.",
      "\"The president should not be forced to delegate his executive power to agency heads who are demonstrably at odds with the administration's policy objectives for a single day \u2014 much less for the months that it would likely take for the courts to resolve this litigation,\" he wrote.",
      "The bid for the Supreme Court's intervention comes as the justices have been faced with a flurry of requests for emergency relief from the Trump administration. More than 150 cases challenging Mr. Trump's second-term agenda have been filed in courts across the country and are progressing through the federal judiciary.",
      "At the center of these disputes is the president's authority to remove executive branch officers from their positions at independent agencies. Wilcox was appointed to the NLRB by former President Joe Biden in 2021 and confirmed to a second, five-year term in 2023. Harris, meanwhile, was named to the MSPB for a seven-year term by Biden in 2022 and designated its chair in 2024.",
      "But Wilcox and Harris received emails soon after Mr. Trump returned to the White House informing them that they were being removed from their positions on their respective boards. They each challenged their firing in federal district court, asserting that their termination violated federal laws that limited the grounds for their removal to neglect of duty or malfeasance, and sought relief restoring them to their roles.",
      "In early March, two separate federal judges in Washington, D.C., ruled for Harris and Wilcox, finding that it was unlawful for Mr. Trump to fire them. The judges declared the removals null and void, and said the two each remained members of their respective boards.",
      "But the D.C. Circuit last month agreed to pause those decisions, clearing the way for the president to remove Harris and Wilcox once again. The officials asked the full complement of judges to reconsider their cases, and earlier this week, the full D.C. Circuit ruled 7-4 to put the district court orders back in place, meaning Wilcox and Harris could go back to their jobs at the NLRB and MSPB while they challenged the removals.",
      "In the emergency appeal with the Supreme Court, Sauer argued that Article II of the Constitution empowers the president to remove at-will members of multi-member boards that exercise \"substantial executive power,\" like the NLRB and MSPB.",
      "\"Federal courts lack any constitutional, statutory, or equitable authority to order the reinstatement of agency heads whom the president has removed and to force the president to rely on principal officers whom the president believes should not be exercising any executive power,\" he wrote.",
      "Sauer said that the NLRB and MSPB both fall outside an exception to the president's power to remove executive officers established by the Supreme Court in 1935. In that case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States, the high court found that Congress could impose for-cause removal protections to multi-member commissions of experts that are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power.",
      "Both agencies, he said, exercise \"substantial\" executive power in executing laws governing the workforce or labor relations.",

      "President Trump has shaken up\u00a0stock markets\u00a0around the world as he announced\u00a0sweeping tariffs\u00a0on what he dubbed \"Liberation Day\"\u00a0last week, then partially reversed course shortly after. The Trump administration's imposition and walkback of tariffs has led to stock volatility and sparked worries of a global trade war and recession.",
      "In the United States, many are concerned about levies driving up the price of everyday goods, and Goldman Sachs economists on Monday cited them in a report\u00a0raising the odds of a recession to 45%. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned the tariffs could slow the economy and\u00a0\"will likely increase inflation.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's April 2 announcement set out a baseline 10% tax on all U.S. imports, plus additional \"reciprocal\" tariffs on imports from 90 countries. He pitched the tariffs as a strategy to reduce the trade deficit between the U.S. and other global powers, including China and the European Union.",
      "Exactly a week later, the president paused many of the newly announced reciprocal duties, with the exception of those placed on China.",
      "The reversal came a little over a month after Mr. Trump imposed 25% tariffs\u00a0on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, and\u00a0then announced a pause just two days later.",

      "Trump reverses course, pauses tariffs",
      "Two days after Mr. Trump said during a\u00a0meeting with Israeli Prime Minister\u00a0Benjamin Netanyahu that he's not looking at any pauses in tariffs, he announced a 90-day pause on most of his planned tariffs and a lowering of the \"reciprocal tariff\" rate to 10% \u2014 with the exception of China.",
      "The U.S.\u00a0stock market surged\u00a0immediately after the president's announcement.",
      "When reporters asked about mixed messages from his administration on whether the tariffs are permanent or open to negotiation, the president said on April 7, \"they both can be true.\"",
      "\"We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and they're going to be fair deals,\" Mr. Trump said. \"No other president's going to do this, what I'm doing.\"",
      "On April 9, citing China's unwillingness to negotiate, Mr. Trump announced on Truth Social that he's raising taxes on China to 125%. China announced earlier in the day that it would\u00a0raise its tariffs on U.S. products to 84%.",
      "The president previously said there are \"other things besides tariffs\" that could be open to negotiation, like other countries' \"standards and tests\" that Mr. Trump said make trading more difficult, but he didn't provide further details.",
      "\"Hang tough\"",
      "In a Truth Social post on April 5 as his 10% universal tariffs took effect, Mr. Trump urged Americans to \"hang tough\" and acknowledged things \"won't be easy.\"",
      "\"China has been hit much harder than the USA, not even close. They, and many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly,\" he wrote.",
      "\"We have been the dumb and helpless 'whipping post,' but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before. Already, more than FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT, and rising fast! THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"",
      "\"Sometimes you have to take medicine\"",
      "Mr. Trump doubled down on his trade position while speaking to reporters on April 6 on Air Force One, making clear he did not intend to budge on the reciprocal tariffs set to take effect later this week, nor the universal levies already implemented.",
      "Addressing the U.S. market plunge\u00a0that followed his April 2 announcement \u2014 Wall Street's worst in five years \u2014 and seemingly preparing Americans for more potential market pain to come, the president said, \"I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\"",
      "\"What's going to happen with the market I can't tell you, but I can tell you our country has gotten a lot stronger,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "He also said various world leaders had expressed interest in negotiating to roll back tariffs as global markets, reacting to the levies, began to nosedive, too.",
      "\"I spoke to a lot of leaders, European, Asian, from all over the world,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They're dying to make a deal. And I said, we're not going to have deficits with your country. We're not going to do that, because to me a deficit is a loss. We're going to have surpluses or at worst, going to be breaking even.\"",
      "Echoing Mr. Trump's sentiment, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick suggested the administration would not waver on the new round of tariffs, in an interview on\u00a0\"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"\u00a0Arguing the policies will help protect U.S. factories and \"reset the power of the United States of America,\" Lutnick acknowledged that \"it is going to be a big change.\"",
      "\"This is the moment that the United States of America takes hold of itself, and Donald Trump has been talking about this his whole life,\" Lutnick said. \"This is Donald Trump's agenda, and we're all here to help him execute.\"",
      "\"Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!)\"",
      "In the hour before trading opened on Wall Street on Monday, April 7, the president took to Truth Social to support his flurry of tariffs and appeared to coin a new Trump-ism referencing panic.",
      "\"The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,\" Mr. Trump said in the post. \"Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid! Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!\"",
      "He posted as international markets were experienced significant losses, with indices in Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, Shanghai, South Korea, Taiwan and Tokyo all dropping. U.S. markets went on to have a roller-coaster day, with the S&P 500 ending down a modest 12 points, or 0.2%, at 5,062, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 349 points, or 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite eked out a small gain, rising 15 points to close up 0.1%.",
      "Additional tariffs on China",
      "Mr. Trump vowed on Monday, April 7, to raise duties imposed on China to 50% after Beijing issued retaliatory tariffs of 34% on the U.S. over the weekend.",
      "On Truth Social, the president said Beijing had acted despite his previous \"warning\" that the U.S. would only respond to retaliatory tariffs with even higher taxes for the issuing country, and urged its leaders to withdraw the 34% increase or face higher costs.",
      "\"Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!\" Mr. Trump said. \"Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "China did not withdraw its tariffs and the ratcheting up continued, with Mr. Trump increasing U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to 104% and then and then 125% as China upped\u00a0its tariffs on U.S. goods to 84%.",

      "President Trump on April 2 announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations that are above a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S. Describing the announcement as \"Liberation Day,\" the president said the new taxes are needed to erase a trade deficit between the U.S. and other countries, ranging from China to the European Union.",
      "Some nations are facing only the universal tariff of 10%, while imports from dozens of other countries are charged a higher specific reciprocal import levy. For instance, Australian imports face the baseline rate of 10%, while China-made products are now paying an import duty that has jumped to 104%\u00a0\u2014 the reciprocal tariffs combined with previously announced duties of 20% \u2014 after slapping its own tariffs on U.S. imports.",
      "\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in his April 2 remarks.",
      "However, on April 9 Mr. Trump backed away from parts of his plan, announcing a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs and lowering the tariff rate to 10% for almost all nations. The notable exception was China, with Mr. Trump saying that he's instead raising the tariff rate on the country's imports to 125%.",
      "\"Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Stocks soared after Mr. Trump's April 9 announcement, with the S&P 500 gaining 8.4% in afternoon trading and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surging 7%. Still, some on Wall Street cautioned that the pause is still on track to end in 90 days, which could signal more volatility ahead.",
      "\"The tariff clouds parted for the first time today, but it's too soon to know how sunny the skies will be tomorrow \u2014 or 90 days from now,\" said Daniel Skelly, head of Morgan Stanley's Wealth Management Market Research & Strategy Team, in an email.",
      "Worst-hit countries",
      "Before he announced the pause, Asian nations were set to face the worst of the brunt, with Cambodia facing a tax rate at 49% and Vietnam at 46%, according to Nationwide Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic.",
      "Mr. Trump also said such levies will boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products. Still, economists are forecasting that the tariffs will cause inflation to reignite, while also prompting some trade partners to retaliate with higher tariffs on American imports to their nations.",
      "If the tariffs are maintained by the Trump administration and if other nations impose retaliatory tariffs, both the U.S. and other countries \"will suffer serious recessions,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "When do these tariffs go into effect?",
      "The reciprocal rates were originally set to go into effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 9, but later that day President Trump announced a\u00a0postponement for 90 days. That's in addition to a baseline 10% tariff which took effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 5.",
      "How did the Trump administration decide what tariffs to charge which countries?",
      "Mr. Trump said his administration determined the tariff rate for each country based on the monetary levies those nations charge on U.S. imports, as well as non-monetary trade barriers like regulations that make it tougher for American products to enter those markets.",
      "The president added that the reciprocal tariffs are still only half the rates charged by those nations on U.S. products, characterizing his new levies as \"kind.\"",
      "Are other countries retaliating against U.S. tariffs?",
      "Yes. China said it would impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10, and then raised the level to 84%. The Chinese Commerce Ministry also said it would implement tighter restrictions on exports of rare earths \u2014materials used in products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries \u2014 as well impose 27 additional U.S. companies to trade sanctions.",

      "Washington \u2014 Backlash to President Trump's tariffs cropped up throughout Capitol Hill in recent days, as Democrats, and some Republicans, expressed concern about the sweeping levies on foreign imports \u2014 while putting forward a handful of possible methods to counter them.",
      "On April 2, the president announced a 10% baseline tariff on all U.S. trading partners while increasing levies on dozens of countries that charge higher taxes on American exports. And after what Mr. Trump described as \"Liberation Day,\" investors appeared spooked, with members of Congress unclear on the path forward.",
      "The response from some lawmakers was swift. Sens. Maria Cantwell, a Washington Democrat and Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, introduced bipartisan legislation the next day aimed at reasserting Congress' role over trade policy. The measure, known as the Trade Review Act of 2025, would require the president to give Congress 48 hours' notice before imposing or raising tariffs. The president would have to include an explanation and analysis of the potential impact, while lawmakers would have the ability to end the levy with a joint resolution.",
      "Grassley said in a statement that Congress has for too long \"delegated its clear authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce to the executive branch,\" while Cantwell argued that the same check and balance that prevents the president from unilaterally declaring war should exist \"as it relates to protecting our commerce activities.\"Rep. Don Bacon is sponsoring\u00a0companion legislation\u00a0in the House, which he introduced Monday.",
      "Another House effort to address the president's tariffs also got underway this week. Rep. Gregory Meeks, a New York Democrat who serves as the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, introduced a resolution Tuesday to force a vote to block the president's newest round of tariffs, after pledging to do so when Mr. Trump made the announcement.",
      "\"Republicans can't keep ducking this \u2014 it's time they show whether they support the economic pain Trump is inflicting on their constituents,\" Meeks said in a post on X last week.",
      "The move would force a vote on the House floor within 15 days. But the resolution would ultimately require the president's signature or a veto-proof majority, making it a gambit unlikely to succeed.",
      "The efforts come after the Senate approved a resolution last week aimed at blocking the president's Canada tariffs, as a handful of Republicans bucked their party leader to support the measure. The bill would have to be approved by the House, and Meeks announced plans last week to introduce a discharge petition to force the House to take a vote on the issue.",
      "Meanwhile, House Republican leadership has taken steps to quash efforts to block Mr. Trump's tariffs. Last month, they included as part of a\u00a0bill to keep the government funded\u00a0a provision that widely blocks members from forcing a vote on the Canada and Mexico tariffs amid a similar push by Meeks. And this week, as the House prepared to vote on another major piece of legislation, a provision that would prevent members from forcing a vote to block Mr. Trump's tariffs announced April 2 was tucked into a rule governing the measure. When Democratic Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez of New Mexico introduced an amendment to strike the provision, Republicans on the House Rules Committee opposed it.",
      "\"Republicans, through this rule, are refusing to follow the Constitution, which says that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations,\" Leger Fernandez said, noting that just a handful of Republican would need to side with Democrats to review and effectively block the tariffs. \"But Republicans think that they can stop time and stop debate, and in that way, avoid actually voting on the tariffs, actually debating on the tariffs, which is our job.\"",
      "Whether any of the moves can make it through both chambers and have an impact on the tariffs or trade situation more broadly remains to be seen.",

    "summary": "A federal judge granted the Associated Press' request for a preliminary injunction and ordered White House officials to restore its access to certain spaces.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday ruled for the Associated Press in its ongoing legal dispute with the White House and ordered top officials to restore the news outlet's access to the Oval Office, Air Force One and other spaces and events when they are open to White House reporters.",
      "In a 41-page decision, U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden granted the AP a preliminary injunction blocking the federal government from restricting its access to certain media events because of its decision to continue using the name Gulf of Mexico. President Trump on his first day in office issued an executive order renaming the body of water the Gulf of America.",
      "\"The AP seeks restored eligibility for admission to the press pool and limited-access press events, untainted by an impermissible viewpoint-based exclusion,\" McFadden wrote. \"That is all the court orders today: For the government to put the AP on an equal playing field as similarly situated outlets, despite the AP's use of disfavored terminology.\"",
      "McFadden, appointed to the federal bench by Mr. Trump, said his injunction doesn't limit the \"various permissible reasons\" the government may have from excluding journalists from events where access is limited or mandate that all eligible reporters be given access to the president or private government spaces.",
      "He clarified that his decision also does not bar government officials from choosing which journalists to participate in interviews with or from publicly expressing their own views.",
      "\"The court simply holds that under the First Amendment, if the government opens its doors to some journalists \u2014 be it to the Oval Office, the East Room, or elsewhere \u2014 it cannot then shut those doors to other journalists because of their viewpoints.\u00a0 The Constitution requires no less,\" McFadden wrote in his opinion.",
      "McFadden put his decision on hold through April 13 to allow the government time to seek emergency relief from a higher court and prepare to implement the injunction. The Trump administration notified the court\u00a0on Wednesday that it is appealing the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "McFadden found that AP reporters have been \"systematically banned\" from White House events that the broader press corps has been able to attend since Feb. 13, resulting in an \"erosion of quality and capability\" of the news outlet's reporting, and leaving the agency with a product that is \"a shadow of its former self.\"",
      "\"To state the obvious, if the AP's wire reporters are not in the room when news happens, they can hardly be the first to break the news.\u00a0 Instead, they are forced to wait and pick up whatever scraps of verifiable information they can find as they watch their competitors break the story first,\" McFadden wrote, adding that AP reporters \"cannot ask questions from outside a closed door.\"",
      "The dispute between the AP and the White House began after Mr. Trump declared that the name for the Gulf of Mexico would be changed to the Gulf of America. In the wake of that decision, the AP declined to update its influential Stylebook \u2014 used in many newsrooms worldwide \u2014 to reflect the name-change.",
      "The AP said in an announcement on Jan. 23 that Mr. Trump's order renaming the Gulf of Mexico only carries authority within the United States, and other countries did not have to recognize the change. It said that as an international news agency, \"the AP must ensure that places, names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences.\"",
      "The AP, a news wire service, is a regular outlet in the White House press pool, which is a group of rotating reporters, videographers and photographers who cover the president daily and travel with him when he leaves the White House grounds. Because of the broad reach of the AP's coverage, local newspapers increasingly rely on it and other syndicated news outlets.",
      "An estimated 4 billion people read the AP daily, the wire service estimates, and it has journalists reporting in nearly 100 countries.",
      "After the AP said it would continue using the name Gulf of Mexico, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt informed its chief White House correspondent on February 11 that the outlet would no longer be allowed in the Oval Office as part of the press pool until the AP changed its Stylebook to use Gulf of America, according to court filings.",
      "AP reporters were then barred from attending press pool events at the White House, including executive order signings in the Oval Office and a press conference, as well as other gatherings covered by the pool in places where Mr. Trump was speaking, the outlet said.",
      "Reporters with the AP who have credentials, known as a \"hard pass,\" that allow general access to White House facilities have also been denied access to events including Mr. Trump's Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as the president's meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda at a convention center in Maryland, according to filings.",
      "But the AP has argued that its access has been restricted beyond those events covered by the press pool to include those covered by the wider White House press corps.",
      "The news outlet filed its lawsuit against White House officials in late February, and the court initially denied the AP's request for a temporary restraining order. But following a hearing last month for a longer preliminary injunction, McFadden granted that relief.",
      "\"The court concludes that the AP is likely to succeed on the merits of its First Amendment viewpoint-discrimination and retaliation claims for both its press pool and East Room allegations,\" the judge wrote.",
      "McFadden found that while the AP does not have a constitutional right to enter the Oval Office, it does have a right not to be excluded based on viewpoint.",
      "\"The AP says that is exactly what is happening. The court agrees,\" he said. \"Indeed, the government has been brazen about this. Several high ranking officials have repeatedly said that they are restricting the AP's access precisely because of the organization's viewpoint.\"",
      "While the White House has said that the AP enjoys the same general media access as other hard-pass holders, McFadden wrote in his decision that \"the AP indeed has been excluded from large events far more often than its peers,\" and found that the wire service is likely to succeed on its claim that White House officials are impermissibly excluding it from limited-access events, like those held in the East Room of the White House and off its grounds.",
      "\"The AP made an editorial decision to continue using 'Gulf of Mexico' in its Stylebook. The government responded publicly with displeasure and explicitly announced it was curtailing the AP's access to the Oval Office, press pool events, and East Room activities,\" the judge wrote. \"If there is a benign explanation for the government's decision, it has not been presented here.\"",
      "McFadden said the disadvantages of having its access restricted have \"poisoned the AP's business model,\" as its ability to disseminate photographs and breaking news has dwindled.",
      "The AP, he said \"cannot be treated worse than its peer wire services either. The court merely declares that the AP's exclusion has been contrary to the First Amendment, and it enjoins the government from continuing down that unlawful path.\"",
      "During the preliminary injunction hearing last month, AP photographer Evan Vucci, who took the infamous photo of Mr. Trump with his fist in the air after the president was hit in the ear with a bullet last July in Pennsylvania, testified on the stand in support of returning his access.",
      "\"It kills us,\" Vucci said, arguing that the outlet's photographers are the \"gold standard\" of photojournalism.",
      "In initial arguments in the case, an attorney for the Trump administration argued that the \"content of a journalist's speech\" can be considered in whether to grant access or not and that Mr. Trump has the ability to block any media he wants from access.",
      "\"There is no right to have special access to the Oval Office,\" the attorney said.",
      "White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, one of three administration officials sued by the AP, argued in a court filing in support of the administration's ban that the determination to ban the outlet from covering Mr. Trump as part of the White House press pool was not about cutting it off entirely from accessing the White House, but rather, \"losing special media access to the president \u2014 a quintessentially discretionary presidential choice that infringes no constitutional right.\"",

    "summary": "Federal judges in New York and Texas temporarily blocked the deportations of certain Venezuelan migrants facing removal under Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act.",
    "story": [
      "Federal judges in both New York and Texas have blocked the deportations of Venezuelan men likely to be deported under the Trump administration's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, again stopping the White House's attempts to remove alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang after the Supreme Court cleared the way for their deportations this week.",
      "In one case filed in Manhattan, attorneys for two Venezuelan men who are currently being detained in Orange County, New York, successfully argued to block their clients' deportations and movement outside of the state and the United States. U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein, appointed to the federal bench by President Clinton, granted the temporary relief.",
      "After their arrests, both men were first transferred to an ICE detention center in Texas before being moved to New York. One man, who is 21, came to the U.S. to escape Tren de Aragua violence, and the other, who is 32, actively protested the regime of Venezuelan dictator Nicholas Maduro, their attorneys wrote.",
      "The new case in Texas was brought on behalf of the same Venezuelans who challenged their potential deportation in Washington, D.C., where the initial block of the deportations was entered by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg before it was lifted by the Supreme Court on Monday in a 5-4 decision. The Texas judge overseeing the petition, Fernando Rodriguez Jr., was appointed to the federal bench by President Trump during his first term.",
      "In a brief order shortly after the habeas petition was filed, Rodriguez blocked the Trump administration from transferring or removing from the El Valle Detention Center the three Venezuelan men or any other Venezuelan citizen held in the Southern District of Texas who are subject to deportation under Mr. Trump's proclamation.",
      "The temporary order also prevents the Trump administration from unilaterally transporting those migrants outside of Willacy County \u2014 where the detention facility is located \u2014 or neighboring Cameron County, Texas.",
      "The temporary restraining order from Rodriguez will remain in place until April 23, or until he weighs in further. He is set to consider whether to extend his order or issue other forms of emergency relief at a hearing set for Friday.",
      "Rodriguez wrote in his decision that absent emergency relief, there is a \"substantial likelihood\" that federal immigration officials will remove the Venezuelan migrants who face deportation under the Alien Enemies Act from the U.S.",
      "\"In the present matter, the court finds that the removal of J.A.V, J.G.G., W.G.H., or any other individual subject to the proclamation, by the United States would cause immediate and irreparable injury to the removed individuals, as they would be unable to seek habeas relief,\" he wrote. \"Furthermore, if the United States erroneously removed an individual to another country based on the proclamation, a substantial likelihood exists that the individual could not be returned to the United States\"",
      "Rodriguez referenced the ongoing case brought by a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was arrested by immigration authorities last month and sent to El Salvador, where he is currently in the notorious prison known as CECOT. A Trump administration official acknowledged Abrego Garcia's removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error,\" but the government has said he is now in custody of the Salvadoran government.",
      "An emergency appeal involving Abrego Garcia is currently pending before the Supreme Court.",
      "Both sets of plaintiffs are attempting to convince judges not just to block the deportations of the men who filed suit, but to block all future deportations of any Venezuelans under this statute. They argue that the Trump administration's invocation of the law is unconstitutional because the U.S. is not at war with Venezuela and dispute the government's categorization of the plaintiffs as gang members, arguing they have been falsely accused of being in the Tren de Aragua gang.",
      "\"Tren de Aragua, a criminal organization, is not a nation or a foreign government and is not part of the Venezuelan government,\" the complaint filed in Texas says, adding that the government's evidence for Tren de Aragua membership \"relies heavily on physical attributes like tattoos, hand gestures, symbols, logos, graffiti and manner of dress,\" none of which, attorneys argue, are \"reliable ways of identifying gang members.\"",
      "The Alien Enemies Act of 1798 has only been used three times, and all during declared wars.",
      "Attorneys in the New York case argued in their habeas petition that the two men \"and others similarly situated to them are now all at imminent risk of removal,\" under the Alien Enemies Act, adding that since Monday, \"the government is resuming its summary removals of Venezuelans who are in ongoing immigration proceedings, including petitioners here, without any judicial review.\"",
      "The new cases were filed after the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to restart for now deportations of migrants it claims are members of a Venezuelan gang. But the court specified that any migrants facing removal under the Alien Enemies Act are subject to due process, and said that as of Monday night, detainees must receive notice that they are subject to deportation.",
      "The Supreme Court said in an unsigned opinion that \"the notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs.\"",
      "The court also specified that any claims brought by migrants that the administration says are covered by Mr. Trump's proclamation belong in habeas corpus proceedings to be brought in the district where they are confined.",
      "While the high court struck down the judge's lower court block on further deportations under the statute after the Trump administration sent two planes carrying alleged gang members deported under the Alien Enemies Act to El Salvador, it also ruled that those subject to removal under the law are entitled to judicial review. There was no judicial review, multiple courts found, for over 230 migrants who were sent to El Salvador in March, where they remain detained at a maximum security prison there.",

      "When asked by LaPook if he personally approved the more than $11 billion proposed in cuts to local and state programs that address infectious disease, mental health, addiction and childhood vaccination, Kennedy said, \"No I'm not familiar with those cuts. We'd have to go \u2026 the cuts were mainly DEI cuts, which the president ordered.\"",
      "LaPook provided Kennedy with an example of a $750,000 University of Michigan grant focused on adolescent diabetes, which was eliminated.",
      "\"I didn't know that, and that's something that we'll look at,\" Kennedy said. He added that he could not speak to if it should be considered a DOGE cut.",
      "\"I just, I'm not familiar with that particular study. But there's a number of studies that were cut that came to our attention and that did not deserve to be cut, and we reinstated them. Our purpose is not to reduce any level of scientific research that's important.\"",
      "Around\u00a010,000 HHS employees\u00a0are being laid off in a restructuring move by Kennedy and Elon Musk's\u00a0DOGE. The secretary acknowledged that some of the DOGE cuts will\u00a0need to be reinstated.",
      "\"HHS's job is to make America healthy, and we're spending $1.9 trillion a year, and people are not getting healthy. ... What Elon said is that, when you do a disruption of this, a lot of times, 80% of the people that get cut ... You may make mistakes, as much as 20[%], and then you go back and remedy that.\"",
      "With billions of dollars in cuts at stake, Kennedy addressed the cost of health care.",
      "\"People have a choice about how sick they are going to be, many people. If you don't have any choice, then we should give you all the resources that you want, but I mean... it's a moral question too, and it's a philosophical question,\" the secretary said. \"If you're smoking three packs of cigarettes a day, should you expect society to pay when you get sick?\"",
      "Measles vaccine",
      "For decades, Kennedy has been a vaccine skeptic and promoted false claims that vaccines cause autism. But now, Kennedy told CBS News he encourages people to get the measles vaccine.",
      "\"The federal government's position, my position, is that people should get the measles vaccine, but ... the government should not be mandating those,\" he said.",
      "Kennedy had previously said the measles vaccine is the most effective way to prevent the virus from spreading, but until now had stopped short of recommending it.",
      "Yet he also continued to raise\u00a0doubts, despite decades of research and extensive testing that backs up the effectiveness and safety of vaccines.",
      "\"When I say they're not safety tested, what I mean is they're not adequately \u2014 many of the vaccines are tested for only three or four days with no placebo group,\" Kennedy said. \"I always said during my campaign and every part, every public statement I've made: I'm not gonna take people's vaccines away from them. What I'm gonna do is make sure that we have good science so that people can make an informed choice.\"",

      "Routh is suspected of hiding in some bushes with a gun near Trump International, about 300-500 yards away from Mr. Trump, who was then the Republican presidential nominee, while he was playing golf in West Palm Beach in September 2024. A member of Mr. Trump's Secret Service detail spotted his rifle in the tree line and opened fire at the suspect, who didn't fire back. He fled by car, and Routh was detained about 50 miles north of the golf course.",

      "The enormous city-state of Tikal, whose towering temples still stand in the jungle, battled for centuries with the Kaanul dynasty for dominance of the Maya world.",
      "Far to the north in Mexico, just outside present day Mexico City, Teotihuacan \u2014 \"the city of the gods\" or \"the place where men become gods\" \u2014 is best known for its twin Temples of the Sun and Moon. It was actually a large city that housed over 100,000 inhabitants and covered around 8 square miles.",
      "The still mysterious city was one of the largest in the world at its peak between 100 B.C. and A.D. 750. But it was abandoned before the rise of the Aztecs in the 14th century.",
      "Lorena Paiz, the archaeologist who led the discovery, said that the Teotihuacan altar was believed to have been used for sacrifices, \"especially of children.\"",
      "\"The remains of three children not older than 4 years were found on three sides of the altar,\" Paiz told The Associated Press.",
      "\"The Teotihuacan were traders who traveled all over the country (Guatemala),\" Paiz said. \"The Teotihuacan residential complexes were houses with rooms and in the center altars; that's what the residence that was found is like, with an altar with the figure representing the Storm Goddess.\"",

      "Rom\u00e1n said the discovery also reinforces the idea that Tikal was a cosmopolitan center at that time, a place where people visited from other cultures, affirming its importance as a center of cultural convergence.",
      "Mar\u00eda Bel\u00e9n M\u00e9ndez, an archaeologist who was not involved with the project, said the discovery confirms \"that there has been an interconnection between both cultures and what their relationships with their gods and celestial bodies was like.\"",

    "story": [
      "For the first time ever, scientists say they have made a species de-extinct, bringing the dire wolf back into the world thousands of years after it died off.",
      "Colossal Biosciences, a company based in Dallas, says it successfully birthed three dire wolves \u2014 a species that once roamed North America but has been extinct for more than 12,500 years \u2014 using revolutionary science.",
      "Colossal CEO Ben Lamm said the team used DNA from a 13,000-year-old tooth and a 72,000-year-old skull to analyze the full genome of the species and create three healthy dire wolf puppies, according to a news release.",
      "The Colossal website explains that many dire wolf fossils were preserved in the La Brea tar pits, in the Los Angeles area, but the species' DNA was not preserved in the tar.",
      "But using two dire wolf samples from an international study on the extinct species, Colossal was able to uncover more dire wolf DNA that ever previously found. Company scientists were eventually able to analyze the species' genome \u2014 or its entire DNA set.",
      "Then they used CRISPR, a gene-editing technology, to genetically modify cells from a living gray wolf. Usually, cloning relies on tissue samples, but Colossal was able to use these modified cells to create embryos, then transferred them to a surrogate (a domestic dog, The Associated Press reported) to grow.",
      "Three litters of dire wolf puppies yielded two males, named Romulus and Remus, and a female, named Khaleesi after the \"Game of Thrones\" character \u2014 a nod to the HBO fantasy drama that featured dire wolves.",

      "\"All you can do now is make something look superficially like something else,\" Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University at Buffalo who was not involved in the research, told the AP.",
      "\"Whatever ecological function the dire wolf performed before it went extinct, it can't perform those functions\" in today's environment, Lynch said.",
      "The company says the animals are being cared for on a 2,000-acre preserve, \"certified by the American Humane Society and registered with USDA,\" enclosed by a 10-foot-tall fence and perimeter security.",
      "Colossal was also able to create two litters of cloned red wolves, which are the most critically endangered wolf in the world.",
      "The company says its de-extinction process could help support conservation efforts globally. \"Preserving, expanding, and testing genetic diversity should be done well before important endangered animal species like the red wolf are lost,\" said Harvard geneticist and co-founder of Colossal, Dr. George Church.",
      "In 2021, Colossal announced plans to de-extinct the woolly mammoth \u2014 a concept Church had been developing for years. He told \"60 Minutes\" in 2019, \"I would say that probably in five years we'll know whether we can get this to work for mice, and maybe pigs and elephants. And then if we can get embryos to grow in the laboratory all the way to term, then it's probably a decade.\"",
      "Last month, the company said its scientists have simultaneously edited seven genes in mice embryos to create mice with long, thick, woolly hair \u2014 dubbing its creation\u00a0the \"Colossal woolly mouse.\"",
      "While the results and images of the the shaggy-haired mice were posted online, Colossal did not publish its research in a peer-reviewed journal and it has not been vetted by independent scientists.",
      "The scientists edited mouse genes related to their hair and fat metabolism \u2014 two qualities woolly mammoths needed to survive in their Arctic habitat. After confirming the gene modification process works in mice, they planned on testing it with elephants, which are woolly mammoth's closest living relatives.

      "With veteran commander Sergey Ryzhikov, 50, at the controls, flanked on the left by rookie cosmonaut Alexey Zubritsky, 32, and on the right by Kim, 41, the Soyuz MS-27/73S ferry ship rocketed away from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 1:47 a.m. EDT (10:47 a.m. local time).",
      "\"The crew is feeling good, everything is nominal,\" Ryzhikov periodically assured Russian flight controllers as the rocket climbed toward orbit.",
      "Eight minutes and 46 seconds later, the third stage engine of the Soyuz 2.1a rocket shut down and the crew ship was released to fly on its own, followed moments later by deployment of its two solar panels and navigation antennas.",
      "The ferry ship then carried out an automated rendezvous with the space station, moving in for docking at the multiport Prichal module at 4:57 a.m. as the two spacecraft sailed 260 miles above western Russia.",
      "\"Congratulations, Sergey, congratulations on your arrival at the International Space Station,\" Russian mission control radioed. After extensive leak checks to verify an airtight structural seal, hatches were opened at 7:28 a.m., allowing Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim to float into the station.",
      "Welcoming them aboard were Soyuz MS-26/72S crewmates Alexey Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Donald Pettit, along with SpaceX Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, NASA astronaut Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov.",
      "\"It was the trip of a lifetime and an honor to be here,\" Kim told flight controllers during a traditional postdocking video conference.",
      "Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim are replacing Ovchinin, Vagner and Pettit, who were launched to the ISS on Sept. 11 and who plan to return to Earth aboard their own Soyuz on April 19 to wrap up a 219-day stay in space.",
      "The Crew 10 fliers, launched on March 14, replaced their Crew 9 predecessors \u2014 Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov and Starliner astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams \u2014 who returned to Earth on March 18.",
      "Rotating space station crews have typically carried out, on average, six-month tours of duty aboard the lab complex. But starting with Kim's flight, the Russians are increasing Soyuz durations to eight months to gather more data on the effects of long-term stays in space.",
      "As such, Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim are expected to return to Earth around Dec. 9.",
      "In a pre-flight interview with CBS News, Jonathan Yong \"Jonny\" Kim, the son of South Korean immigrants and a father of three, said he first heard of the Navy's SEALs when he was 16 years old. He eventually joined the elite corps and went on to participate in more than 100 combat operations as a member of SEAL Team Three in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.",
      "\"To me, it is the strongest calling I've ever had in my life, even to this day,\" he said. \"I've had additional callings in life. But it was really that first calling I had to be a SEAL that I will remember for the rest of my life. Because it was the first time that I felt I had a purpose, and I had a dream.\"",
      "That dream was to serve as a warrior.",
      "\"Back then, I used to have a really narrow focus on that,\" he said. \"But to me, a warrior is someone that is in continued pursuit of excellence in their craft. It doesn't have to be combat. It can be in medicine. It can be as a NASA astronaut. It can be in politics. It can be anything.",
      "\"But it's someone who's passionate and in pursuit of continued excellence. And the reason why it just resonated so well with me is because it was everything I wasn't at the time, but I wanted to be.\"",
      "Kim said he had \"some terrible moments\" in combat and ended up \"just really burnt out. I was very burnt out from the combat, from the war and the loss. ... I needed a way to continue serving, and it seemed logical that medicine would be that vehicle.\"",
      "Already a veteran combat medic, Kim was accepted in Harvard Medical School. Along the way, he said, he \"probably went a little too extreme in ensuring that previous successes did not set myself up for the future.\"",
      "\"I ensured that the people I worked with in the hospital didn't know I was previously a SEAL, because I wanted my patients, I wanted my colleagues to think of me as dependable and proficient and a good physician. Not because I used to be a SEAL, but because that's who I was.\"",
      "Then, as he was wrapping up medical school and preparing for his residency, Kim watched the initial test flight of NASA's Orion moonship in 2014 on YouTube and became a self-described \"space nerd.\" He met physician and former astronaut Scott Parazynski, who encouraged him to apply to NASA for astronaut training.",
      "Out of 18,000 applications for the class of 2017, NASA chose 12, including Kim.",
      "He said learning Russian was the most challenging aspect of training to fly aboard a Soyuz, but added that his crewmates spoke excellent English and had gone out of their way to welcome him aboard.",
      "\"We are friends. I mean, we're very, very professional,\" Kim said. \"We work well together. ... I've had Alexey and Sergey over for dinner and they've done the same thing for me. So our relationships are personal and there's a lot of trust and friendship there.",
      "As for being assigned to a Soyuz flight, riding a vehicle that's been around for decades as opposed to the roomier touchscreen-equipped SpaceX Crew Dragon, Kim said he was more than happy to fly with the Russians.",
      "\"I just love technology (but) there's also something to be said about reliability, or as the saying goes, 'If it's not broke, don't fix it,'\" he said. \"The amount of testing and the reliability the Soyuz has shown over decades is unsurpassed and is absolutely admirable.\"",
      "During the course of his stay aboard the station, Kim said, he hopes to venture outside the lab for a spacewalk at some point, but added he would be more that happy to serve in any capacity.",
      "\"The modern day astronaut is a jack of all trades,\" he told CBS News. \"You know, we train to do spacewalks. We train to support space walks, train to do research. One day we might be plumbers or mechanics, we might be technicians repairing a radio or we might be pipetting various fluids into other fluids for research.",

    "story": [
      "Jonny Kim, a former Navy SEAL, Harvard Medical School graduate and now a NASA astronaut, blasted off with two cosmonaut crewmates aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket early Tuesday, chased down the International Space Station and moved in for a picture-perfect docking three hours after liftoff.",
      "With veteran commander Sergey Ryzhikov, 50, at the controls, flanked on the left by rookie cosmonaut Alexey Zubritsky, 32, and on the right by Kim, 41, the Soyuz MS-27/73S ferry ship rocketed away from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 1:47 a.m. EDT (10:47 a.m. local time).",
      "\"The crew is feeling good, everything is nominal,\" Ryzhikov periodically assured Russian flight controllers as the rocket climbed toward orbit.",
      "Eight minutes and 46 seconds later, the third stage engine of the Soyuz 2.1a rocket shut down and the crew ship was released to fly on its own, followed moments later by deployment of its two solar panels and navigation antennas.",
      "The ferry ship then carried out an automated rendezvous with the space station, moving in for docking at the multiport Prichal module at 4:57 a.m. as the two spacecraft sailed 260 miles above western Russia.",
      "\"Congratulations, Sergey, congratulations on your arrival at the International Space Station,\" Russian mission control radioed. After extensive leak checks to verify an airtight structural seal, hatches were opened at 7:28 a.m., allowing Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim to float into the station.",
      "Welcoming them aboard were Soyuz MS-26/72S crewmates Alexey Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Donald Pettit, along with SpaceX Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, NASA astronaut Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov.",
      "\"It was the trip of a lifetime and an honor to be here,\" Kim told flight controllers during a traditional postdocking video conference.",
      "Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim are replacing Ovchinin, Vagner and Pettit, who were launched to the ISS on Sept. 11 and who plan to return to Earth aboard their own Soyuz on April 19 to wrap up a 219-day stay in space.",
      "The Crew 10 fliers, launched on March 14, replaced their Crew 9 predecessors \u2014 Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov and Starliner astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams \u2014 who returned to Earth on March 18.",
      "Rotating space station crews have typically carried out, on average, six-month tours of duty aboard the lab complex. But starting with Kim's flight, the Russians are increasing Soyuz durations to eight months to gather more data on the effects of long-term stays in space.",
      "As such, Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim are expected to return to Earth around Dec. 9.",
      "In a pre-flight interview with CBS News, Jonathan Yong \"Jonny\" Kim, the son of South Korean immigrants and a father of three, said he first heard of the Navy's SEALs when he was 16 years old. He eventually joined the elite corps and went on to participate in more than 100 combat operations as a member of SEAL Team Three in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.",
      "\"To me, it is the strongest calling I've ever had in my life, even to this day,\" he said. \"I've had additional callings in life. But it was really that first calling I had to be a SEAL that I will remember for the rest of my life. Because it was the first time that I felt I had a purpose, and I had a dream.\"",
      "That dream was to serve as a warrior.",
      "\"Back then, I used to have a really narrow focus on that,\" he said. \"But to me, a warrior is someone that is in continued pursuit of excellence in their craft. It doesn't have to be combat. It can be in medicine. It can be as a NASA astronaut. It can be in politics. It can be anything.",
      "\"But it's someone who's passionate and in pursuit of continued excellence. And the reason why it just resonated so well with me is because it was everything I wasn't at the time, but I wanted to be.\"",
      "Kim said he had \"some terrible moments\" in combat and ended up \"just really burnt out. I was very burnt out from the combat, from the war and the loss. ... I needed a way to continue serving, and it seemed logical that medicine would be that vehicle.\"",
      "Already a veteran combat medic, Kim was accepted in Harvard Medical School. Along the way, he said, he \"probably went a little too extreme in ensuring that previous successes did not set myself up for the future.\"",
      "\"I ensured that the people I worked with in the hospital didn't know I was previously a SEAL, because I wanted my patients, I wanted my colleagues to think of me as dependable and proficient and a good physician. Not because I used to be a SEAL, but because that's who I was.\"",
      "Then, as he was wrapping up medical school and preparing for his residency, Kim watched the initial test flight of NASA's Orion moonship in 2014 on YouTube and became a self-described \"space nerd.\" He met physician and former astronaut Scott Parazynski, who encouraged him to apply to NASA for astronaut training.",
      "Out of 18,000 applications for the class of 2017, NASA chose 12, including Kim.",
      "He said learning Russian was the most challenging aspect of training to fly aboard a Soyuz, but added that his crewmates spoke excellent English and had gone out of their way to welcome him aboard.",
      "\"We are friends. I mean, we're very, very professional,\" Kim said. \"We work well together. ... I've had Alexey and Sergey over for dinner and they've done the same thing for me. So our relationships are personal and there's a lot of trust and friendship there.",
      "As for being assigned to a Soyuz flight, riding a vehicle that's been around for decades as opposed to the roomier touchscreen-equipped SpaceX Crew Dragon, Kim said he was more than happy to fly with the Russians.",
      "\"I just love technology (but) there's also something to be said about reliability, or as the saying goes, 'If it's not broke, don't fix it,'\" he said. \"The amount of testing and the reliability the Soyuz has shown over decades is unsurpassed and is absolutely admirable.\"",
      "During the course of his stay aboard the station, Kim said, he hopes to venture outside the lab for a spacewalk at some point, but added he would be more that happy to serve in any capacity.",
      "\"The modern day astronaut is a jack of all trades,\" he told CBS News. \"You know, we train to do spacewalks. We train to support space walks, train to do research. One day we might be plumbers or mechanics, we might be technicians repairing a radio or we might be pipetting various fluids into other fluids for research.",
      "\"So it's kind of all of the above, whatever the demands that the space station need at a time.\"",

      "Even with spotty weather in some states, millions of people from coast to coast saw a partial solar eclipse, in which the moon partially covers the sun. However, only those within the path of totality experienced the darkness of the total solar eclipse.",
      "When is the next total solar eclipse in the U.S. after the 2024 eclipse?",
      "Solar eclipses happen about twice a year, said Arav. \"Eclipses happen all over the Earth evenly,\" he told CBS News \u2014 but noted the timings when they occur are not regular. That means\u00a0eclipses can occur within just a few years, or every few decades, in North America.",
      "Before the eclipse in 2024, the last total solar eclipses visible from the U.S. were in 2017 and\u00a01979. The 2017 solar eclipse was the first whose path of totality crossed the entire continent in 99 years.",
      "Even though eclipses may seem to occur randomly, scientists can pinpoint exactly when and where they will happen.",
      "\"There is no ambiguity, as we know exactly where it will land,\" said Arav.",
      "There will be eight total solar eclipses visible from parts of the continental U.S. in the 21st century, Arav said, with one occurring about every 12 years, on average.",
      "The next one is predicted to occur on Aug. 23, 2044, NASA said. However, the path of totality from this eclipse will only touch three states, according to\u00a0The Planetary Society, a nonprofit organization dedicated to public interest in space.",

      "The path of totality will cross Williston and Dickinson, North Dakota, and Great Falls, Montana.",
      "Path of totality for the 2045 total solar eclipse",
      "The next solar eclipse that crosses a significant portion of the continental U.S. will be in 2045, said Arav. That year, a solar eclipse on Aug. 12 will darken skies in parts of the U.S., Haiti, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Guyana, French Guiana, Suriname and Brazil.",
      "It will be visible in many states as it moves from coast to coast. The eclipse will start in California and move east to end in Florida, similar to 2017, Arav said.",

    "summary": "Meta whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams testified Wednesday afternoon before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism.",
    "story": [
      "Meta whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams told senators in testimony Wednesday on Capitol Hill that the social media company worked \"hand in glove\" with the Chinese government to censor its platforms, among other allegations.",
      "\"I saw Meta executives repeatedly undermine U.S. national security and betray American values,\" Wynn-Williams said in her opening remarks, which were obtained by CBS News before the hearing.",
      "Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism and led the bipartisan hearing, said Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \"made censorship his business model.\"",
      "\"The evidence that we have in black and white is a company and leadership that is willing to do anything, anything, work with America's chief competitor, work with our chief adversary,\" Hawley said.",
      "Hawley sent a letter to Zuckerberg Thursday requesting his testimony before the subcommittee, writing, \"The American people deserve to know the truth about your company.\"",
      "Wynn-Williams began working at Meta, then known as Facebook, as the director of Global Public Policy in 2011. In her almost seven years with the company, Wynn-Williams told the panel she witnessed the company provide \"custom built censorship tools\" for the Chinese Communist Party. She said a Chinese dissident living in the United States was removed from Facebook in 2017 after pressure from Chinese officials. Facebook said at the time it took action against the regime critic, Guo Wengui, for sharing someone else's personal information.",
      "Wynn-Williams described the use of a \"virality counter\" that flagged posts with over 10,000 views for review by a \"chief editor,\" which Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called \"an Orwellian censor.\" These \"virality counters\" were used not only in Mainland China, but also in Hong Kong and Taiwan, according to Wynn-Williams's testimony.",
      "Wynn-Williams also told senators Chinese officials could \"potentially access\" the data of American users. When Meta engineers expressed concern about data security, Wynn-Williams testified that Meta leadership, including Zuckerberg, were indifferent.",
      "Wynn-Williams testified Zuckerberg was \"personally invested\" in Meta's business relationship with China, claiming he committed to learning Mandarin and \"had weekly Mandarin sessions with employees.\"",
      "Wynn-Williams alleged Meta's artificial intelligence model known as \"Llama\" was used to help DeepSeek. DeepSeek is a Chinese AI company that sent shockwaves through the American technology industry earlier this year when its AI model was shown to be competitive with OpenAI's ChatGPT at a fraction of the cost.",
      "In a statement last year on Llama, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone wrote, \"The alleged role of a single and outdated version of an American open-source model is irrelevant when we know China is already investing over 1T to surpass the US technologically, and Chinese tech companies are releasing their own open AI models as fast, or faster, than US ones.\"",
      "Wynn-Williams encouraged senators to continue investigating Meta's role in the development of artificial intelligence in China, as they continue their probe into the social media company founded by Zuckerberg.",
      "\"The greatest trick Mark Zuckerberg ever pulled was wrapping the American flag around himself and calling himself a patriot and saying he didn't offer services in China, while he spent the last decade building an $18 billion business there,\" she said.",
      "In response to her opening statement, a Meta spokesperson called Wynn-Williams' testimony \"divorced from reality and riddled with false claims.\"",
      "\"While Mark Zuckerberg himself was public about our interest in offering our services in China and details were widely reported beginning over a decade ago, the fact is this: we do not operate our services in China today,\" Meta said in a statement.",
      "Meta, which changed its name from Facebook in 2021, operates some of the most popular social media platforms in the United States, including its previous namesake Facebook as well as Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads.",
      "Washington is taking a more aggressive posture toward China and its growing threat to American economic interests and national security. The Trump administration increased tariffs on imported goods from China to 125% Wednesday. The administration also continues to pursue the sale of TikTtok, a short-form video platform owned by Chinese company ByteDance, to an American buyer. And on Capitol Hill in 2023, the House of Representatives created the Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party to investigate China's challenge to American global power.",

      "Apple chartered cargo flights to transport the smartphones to the U.S. because it \"wanted to beat the tariff,\" a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.

    "summary": "U.S. tariffs on China could add hundreds of dollars to the cost an iPhone, a new analysis shows.",
    "story": [
      "Apple iPhones could become even pricier under President Trump's reciprocal tariffs on roughly 90 foreign nations, which were slated to take effect Wednesday, but are now on hold for 90 days, with the exception of levies on China.",
      "In a move that threatens to raise costs on all electronics, including iPhones, the White House on Tuesday said it would follow through on a threat to enact a 104% tariff on all Chinese goods imported into the U.S. The levy took effect Wednesday at 12:01 a.m. EDT. Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump raised the tariff rate to 125%, effective immediately.",
      "The price for the popular tech tool, which starts at $599 for the most basic model, the iPhone 16e, is poised to increase by hundreds of dollars, depending on how Apple responds to the sweeping levies. The iPhone 16 Pro 128 GB, which features Apple Intelligence, costs $999.",
      "The iPhone accounts for about half of Apple's revenue. Most of its smartphones are manufactured in China.",
      "Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives said in a research note Tuesday that the added levies could create a \"category 5 price storm\" for personal electronics and other gadgets. Taxing China and other nations at such rates is the equivalent of \"flipping a boat upside down in the ocean with no life rafts,\" he added.",
      "How much more could an iPhone cost?",
      "The iPhone 16 Pro Max 256 GB, which is among the devices that are assembled in China, retails for $1,199. Under the new tariffs on Chinese imports, the price of the device could rise by $675, or 56%, lifting the price tag to $1,874, an April 9 analysts from UBS Investment Research shows.",
      "The cost of an iPhone 16 Pro 128 GB, which is made in India and costs $999, could increase to $1,119, an increase of 12%, the investment bank found.",
      "An April 3 analysis from Rosenblatt Securities found that the Cupertino, California-based company could raise iPhone prices by 43% to offset the effects of reciprocal tariffs.",
      "Apple didn't respond to a request for comment on how the Trump tariffs could affect iPhone prices.",
      "What if Apple moved production to the U.S.?",
      "President Trump has said the new U.S. tariffs are aimed at spurring both domestic and foreign companies to build in the U.S. But for Apple and other companies, manufacturing their products in the U.S. entail significantly higher labor costs \u2014 costs that would largely be passed on to consumers.",
      "If Apple were to begin assembling iPhones in the U.S, a Chinese-made device that previously sold for $1,000 would cost $3,500 if manufactured in New Jersey, Texas or some other state, Ives estimated.",
      "\"Saying we can just make this in the USA is a statement that incredibly understates the complexity of the Asia supply chain and the way electronics, chips, semi fabs, hardware, smartphones, etc. are made for U.S. consumers over the last 30 years,\" he said in a report.",
      "As a result, Ives is highly skeptical that tariffs alone will lead companies to shift their manufacturing plants from low-cost havens like China to the U.S., calling the idea \"absurd.\"",
      "But some companies, including Apple, could attempt to rejigger supply chains to avoid the steepest tariffs. For example, Apple plans to manufacture more iPhones in India to reduce its reliance on China, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported, citing people familiar with the matter.",

    "summary": "Inflation cooled in March, but economists expect prices to reaccelerate as some of President Trump's tariffs kick in.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index in March rose 2.4% on an annual basis, showing progress in the Federal Reserve's battle to bring down inflation to a 2% rate.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was forecast to rise 2.6% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in those prices over time.",
      "March's report comes after\u00a0inflation rose 2.8% on an annual basis in February.",
      "On a monthly basis, prices actually fell 0.1% in March, the first monthly drop in nearly five years.",
      "Inflation eased last month due partly to lower fuel prices, with gasoline tumbling 9.8% on an annual basis, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said.",
      "Another reason prices fell was sharp drops in travel-related costs, including airfares, which decreased 5.3% just from February to March. Hotel room prices dropped 3.5%.",
      "Economists said those declines in part reflected much slower international demand as the number of tourists visiting the United States has fallen sharply amid Trump's aggressive trade policy.",
      "Visits to the United States from overseas fell nearly 12% last month, according to government data.",
      "What experts say",
      "Easing inflation combined with President Trump's announcement yesterday of a 90-day pause in his reciprocal tariffs should help alleviate some concerns for the Federal Reserve when it meets on May 7 to make its next interest rate decision, said Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank.",
      "But because other tariffs orchestrated by Mr. Trump have recently gone into effect \u2014 such as auto tariffs \u2013 inflation nevertheless could pick up later this year, experts say.",
      "Yet March's data is \"backward looking\" and doesn't reflect the trade policy changes orchestrated by the Trump administration, noted Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs are still expected to lift inflation later in the year as the impact of the import duties trickle through the economy. Because tariffs are paid by U.S. importers like Walmart when they accept shipments of foreign goods, they typically pass off all or some of the tariff cost onto consumers through higher prices.",
      "The president's 90-day pause excludes China, a major exporter to the U.S., which will continue to face tariffs of 125% on its goods. And Mr. Trump's 10% universal duty will also likely to push up prices in the coming months, economists say. The higher import taxes will likely weigh on the economy's growth as well.",
      "What the CPI shows about egg prices",
      "Although consumer prices cooled in March, the CPI data showed egg prices continued to inch higher last month. According to the CPI figures, egg prices increased in March to reach a new record-high of $6.23 despite a drop in wholesale prices and no egg farms having bird flu outbreaks.",
      "More recently, grocers have told CBS News that egg prices are\u00a0showing signs of easing.",
      "Bird flu outbreaks were cited as the major cause of price spikes in January and February after more than 30 million egg-laying chickens were killed to prevent the spread of the disease.",
      "Since the current bird flu outbreak began, more than 168 million birds have been slaughtered, most of them egg-laying chickens. Any time a bird gets sick, the entire flock is killed to help keep bird flu from spreading. That can have an effect on the egg supply because massive egg farms may have millions of birds.",
      "What the CPI means for your money",
      "Despite today's cooler-than-expected CPI numbers, inflationary risks are still a threat to the U.S. economy, especially as some of Mr. Trump's tariffs are still in place while others are merely delayed, experts say.",
      "\"Going forward, the Fed is likely to face a difficult trade-off as tariff-driven price increases start to feed through to the inflation data and activity remains soft,\" Haigh said. \"We expect the Fed's initial reaction to be cautious, but the risks remain that a sharper than expected slowdown in the economy could result in a resumption of the Fed's easing cycle.\"",
      "Three of four economists polled by FactSet expect the Fed will hold rates steady at its next meeting on May 7. The current federal funds \u2014 the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 now stands in a range 4.5% to 4.75%.",
      "That means consumers and businesses are unlikely to see any relief on loan rates in the near term, although economists are penciling in cuts later in the year, with the majority forecasting a reduction at the Fed's June 18 meeting.",
      "The Associated  Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "A federal immigration official acknowledged last week that the removal of a Maryland man to El Salvador was an \"administrative error.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday said the Trump administration must facilitate the release of a Maryland man mistakenly deported from custody in El Salvador, but ordered additional proceedings before a federal district court.",
      "In an unsigned decision, the high court acknowledged that a late Monday deadline set by the district court judge to secure the return to the U.S. of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, and paused by Chief Justice John Roberts had already passed, effectively granting in part the emergency relief sought by the Trump administration.",
      "But the court said that district court's order \"properly requires the government to 'facilitate'\" Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody and to \"ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\"",
      "The Supreme Court went on to say that the intended scope of the term \"effectuate\" in the lower court's decision is unclear and may exceed its authority. The high court directed the district court to provide more clarification with the case sent back for further proceedings.",
      "\"The district court should clarify its directive, with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs,\" the court said in an unsigned opinion. \"For its part, the Government should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps.\"",
      "There were no noted dissents, and the three liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, noted their respect for the court's disposition of the application. Sotomayor said in a statement joined by Kagan and Jackson that there is agreement among the justices \"that the proper remedy is to provide Abrego Garcia with all the process to which he would have been entitled had he not been unlawfully removed to El Salvador.\"",
      "\"As the Supreme Court correctly recognized, it is the exclusive prerogative of the President to conduct foreign affairs,\" a Department of Justice spokesperson said Thursday. \"By directly noting the deference owed to the Executive Branch, this ruling once again illustrates that activist judges do not have the jurisdiction to seize control of the President's authority to conduct foreign policy.\"",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to step in after a federal district judge on Friday ordered it to take immediate action to return Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. The 29-year-old Salvadoran national was arrested by immigration authorities on March 15 and was among the more than 200 people sent on deportation flights to El Salvador last month. They are now being held at the notorious Salvadoran supermax prison known as CECOT.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case sparked backlash after a federal immigration official acknowledged in a court filing last week that his removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error\" and \"oversight.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. illegally in 2011 when he was 16 years old and was arrested in 2019, according to court documents. During immigration proceedings, the Department of Homeland Security claimed that Abrego Garcia was a member of the gang MS-13, citing a Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie he was wearing and allegations from a confidential informant who said he belonged to a branch of MS-13 that operates on Long Island, New York, court records show.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers said he has never lived on Long Island and has no affiliation with MS-13. They also said he has no criminal history and has never been charged or convicted of any criminal offenses in the U.S. or El Salvador.",
      "An immigration judge detained Abrego Garcia after denying a request for release on bond, which was upheld by an immigration appeals board. But he was ultimately granted withholding of removal to El Salvador, a legal status that prohibits the government from returning him to his home country because he is more likely than not to face persecution from local gangs, according to court records.",
      "Abrego Garcia was released from custody following that decision and has lived for six years in Maryland with his wife and their children. He had regular check-ins with immigration authorities, according to court filings, but was arrested on March 12 after he was stopped by immigration agents while driving with his son in the back seat. Abrego Garcia was taken into custody and transported to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities in Baltimore, Louisiana and Texas before he was flown to El Salvador, according to legal filings.",
      "After Abrego Garcia was sent to the Salvarodan prison last month, he and his wife, a U.S. citizen, filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Maryland alleging his removal violated federal immigration law and seeking an order requiring his return to U.S. custody.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis granted that request following a hearing Friday and directed the government to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. no later than 11:59 p.m. Monday. The Justice Department asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit to halt that order, and while its request was pending, asked the Supreme Court to intervene. The 4th Circuit then declined to pause the district court's decision.",
      "In a filing with the Supreme Court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the lower court order \"sets the United States up for failure\" because it interfered with President Trump's ability to conduct foreign diplomacy and set a tight timeline for compliance. He wrote that the U.S. cannot force the release of Abrego Garcia because he is now in the custody of the Salvadoran government.",
      "\"The United States does not control the sovereign nation of El Salvador, nor can it compel El Salvador to follow a federal judge's bidding,\" the solicitor general wrote.",
      "Sotomayor warned in her statement that the government's argument \"implies that it could deport and incarcerate any person, including U. S. citizens, without legal consequence, so long as it does so before a court can intervene.\"",
      "Lawyers for Abrego Garcia called his case \"one of one,\" and argued in court papers that requiring the government to facilitate their client's return is \"not novel,\" because the district court's order just requires the Trump administration to correct its own error.",
      "\"The executive branch may not seize individuals from the streets, deposit them in foreign prisons in violation of court orders, and then invoke the separation of powers to insulate its unlawful actions from judicial scrutiny,\" they wrote.",
      "Abrego Garcia's legal team called the government's mistake in removing him \"Kafka-esque,\" and noted that he has lived in the U.S. for several years without any issues.",
      "\"The government offers no evidence that he has become a threat overnight,\" they wrote.",
      "Migrants removed from the U.S. are being housed in CECOT as a result of a temporary agreement the Trump administration reached with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, under which the U.S. government is paying the Salvadoran government $6 million to hold U.S. detainees for a year.",
      "Citing this arrangement, Abrego Garcia's lawyers argued that the U.S. government \"functionally controls Abrego Garcia's detention \u2014 it has simply contracted with El Salvador to be the jailer.\"",
      "Lower courts also said that the government has control over Abrego Garcia, since he is being temporarily housed in CECOT at the Trump administration's request.",
      "\"The government's claim that it can remove an individual from the United States pursuant to such an agreement and thereby lose the ability to reclaim that individual and return him to the country for process (or for any other purpose) cannot stand,\" Judge Stephanie Thacker, who sits on the 4th Circuit, wrote in an opinion. She added that \"the government's actions in this case most assuredly violated the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.\"",
      "Thacker, who was joined by Judge Robert King, wrote that \"the government cannot escape its responsibility to return Abrego Garcia to the United States by claiming it now lacks authority to control El Salvador.\"",
      "While the Trump administration has acknowledged that it inadvertently sent Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, it has argued that the federal courts do not have the power to demand his return since he's no longer in U.S. custody. Administration officials have also claimed that he is an MS-13 \"leader,\" though they have not produced evidence to support the allegations.",
      "During last week's hearing before Xinis, Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni repeatedly struggled to answer the judge's questions but said he wasn't given sufficient information by the administration.",
      "\"The facts are conceded, plaintiff Abrego Garcia should not have been removed,\" Reuveni said.",
      "When questioned about why the government is not able to return Abrego Garcia, Reuveni said he \"asked the government the same question\" and did not receive an answer. The Justice Department lawyer said multiple times he was \"frustrated\" with the government's lack of cooperation in the case.",
      "Following Friday's argument, Reuveni was placed on administrative leave, and Sauer said in a filing that his statements were \"inappropriate\" and \"do not reflect the position of the United States.\"",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News about Reuveni's employment status, Attorney General Pam Bondi said, \"At my direction, every Department of Justice attorney is required to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States. Any attorney who fails to abide by this direction will face consequences.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now backing an additional measles vaccine shot for some travelers within the United States, multiple health officials tell CBS News, in response to record outbreaks of the highly contagious virus this year.",
      "In a letter shared with health departments on April 8, the CDC said it would now be recommending that visitors to areas affected by measles outbreaks within the United States follow stepped up vaccination guidance issued by local authorities.",
      "Most adults still do not need an additional dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, the CDC says. But for \"people going to or living in areas in the United States with ongoing community-wide measles transmission,\" the CDC says doctors should \"reassess need\" for vaccination.",
      "This means that adult and teen travelers to some counties in Texas and Kansas \u2014 the states that have updated their recommendations \u2014 should get a second dose if they have not received two doses already or get two doses if they are unvaccinated. Infants should get an early first dose before the typically recommended age of 12 months old, followed by two more doses, and children over 12 months old should get an early second dose if they already have one, or two doses if they are unvaccinated.",
      "Previously, the CDC had said that one dose of the measles vaccine or other evidence of immunity was \"sufficient for most adults.\"",
      "But the CDC has long had stepped up recommendations for Americans preparing for international travel. Under those recommendations, children over 12 months old, teenagers and adults should have two doses if they do not have other evidence of immunity, and infants should get an early first dose.",
      "Local outbreaks of the virus have also been reported to the CDC from New Jersey, Georgia and Ohio, the agency said last week. Other states have since reported local spread, including Indiana and Colorado.",
      "More than 600 measles cases across at least 21 states have been reported so far this year, the most since a record 2019 wave of the virus that reached 1,274 cases nationwide. Two unvaccinated children in Texas, and an unvaccinated adult in neighboring New Mexico, have died.",
      "While the CDC said that health departments could share the updated guidance with providers in their state, it is unclear why the agency did not publish their latest recommendations on its own website. A bulletin issued by the agency on April 8 about measles did not mention the new vaccination recommendations for domestic travel.",
      "\"CDC's clinical vaccination guidance for measles outbreaks has not changed. During measles outbreaks, health departments may provide additional recommendations to protect their communities,\" a spokesperson for the agency said in a statement.",
      "They said that the decision to offer an early dose of vaccine to young children \"should be made carefully after weighing the risks of the potential long-term impact of lower immune responses\" compared to the benefit of early protection.",
      "\"There are no recommendations to receive a third dose of MMR vaccine during measles outbreaks,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Who should get another measles shot?",
      "Vaccination of visitors to areas affected by outbreaks should follow the same recommendations issued by health authorities for those areas, which are being published on the agency's website, the CDC told doctors.",
      "So far, only two states \u2014 Texas and Kansas \u2014 are listed by the CDC as having issued \"updated outbreak recommendations\" in response to the virus, which are broken down by age for most residents.",
      "The states say in counties facing outbreaks, adults and teenagers should get a second dose if they've only had one previously. If they are unvaccinated, they should get one dose immediately, followed by a second dose at least 28 days later.",
      "Infants 6 to 11 months old should get an early first dose, the recommendations say. They then should receive a second dose at 12 to 15 months and a third at 4 to 6 years old.",
      "Children over 12 months old who have one dose should get an early second dose, as long as it's been at least 28 days since the first. If they haven't been vaccinated, they should get one dose immediately, followed by another at least 28 days later.",
      "Additionally, individuals born between 1957 and 1968 who received an older MMR vaccine, are recommended to get at least one dose of the current vaccine. Texas recommends those individuals get two doses.",

      "Faced with a deadline to provide evidence in its deportation case against activist Mahmoud Khalil, lawyers for the federal government instead filed a memorandum by Secretary of State Marco Rubio to a Louisiana immigration court.",
      "In the memo, which was obtained by CBS News, Rubio wrote that Khalil's role in protests on the campus of Columbia University is in conflict with American foreign policy objectives. Rubio did not cite specific evidence against Khalil. He stated that Khalil is deportable under a little-known statute in federal immigration law that provides the government is entitled to deport noncitizens whose presence in the U.S. damages national foreign policy interests.",
      "Rubio argued that the presence of Khalil, a 30-year-old legal permanent resident, undermines \"U.S. policy to combat anti-Semitism around the world and in the United States, in addition to efforts to protect Jewish students from harassment and violence in the United States.\"",
      "Khalil was a prominent voice in the spring 2024 pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University, where he earned a master's degree from the School of International and Public Affairs in December 2024. He was detained by federal immigration authorities at his university-owned apartment as his pregnant wife looked on. He was moved from New York to a detention center in New Jersey before being flown to a remote facility in Jena, Louisiana.",
      "The government claims that Khalil has supported Hamas, and can be deported if it is determined his presence and activities threaten the foreign policy interests of the U.S., citing alleged support for Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group. To date, CBS News has not found evidence that Khalil has said he supports Hamas.",
      "Assistant chief immigration Judge Jamee Comans on Tuesday said she would terminate the case unless the government showed evidence supporting the removal of the former Columbia student. Khalil's attorney Marc Van Der Hout said at the hearing that he had \"not received a single document\" of evidence from the government.",
      "\"I'd like to see the evidence,\" Comans said, demanding that the government make a filing within 24 hours.",
      "In response, the Department of Homeland Security submitted the two-page memo from Rubio, which includes references to Khalil and one other lawful permanent resident whose name was redacted.",
      "Rubio wrote that they should be removed from the country because their \"presence or activities would compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest.\"",
      "\"The foreign policy of the United States champions core American interests and American citizens,\" he continued, \"and condoning anti-Semitic conduct and disruptive protests in the United States would severely undermine that significant foreign policy objective.\"",
      "Rubio pointed to Khalil's participation in what he descirbed as \"antisemitic protests and disruptive activities,\" which he said creates a \"hostile environment for Jewish students,\" as well as \"unlawful activity\" during those protests.",
      "\"The government can't just operate on hidden law based on one executive official's say so,\" said Baher Azmy, Legal Director of the Center of Constitutional Rights during a press call about Khalil on Thursday. \"Does anyone here know what conduct they would have to engage in that would trigger an adverse foreign policy interest to The United States? No one does. No one can. Which is what's so dangerous about this law.\"",
      "Comans has set a removability hearing for Khalil on Friday at 1 p.m., at which she could determine whether sufficient evidence has been provided to support the continuation of his immigration case.",
      "The government had previously said Khalil should be expelled for what it's described as \"material support\" for the militant group Hamas via his role in campus protests against Israel.",
      "Khalil's attorneys, who have also sued the government on his behalf, lambasted the government, saying the government was depriving him of his right to free speech.",
      "\"After a month of hiding the ball since Mahmoud's late-night unjust arrest in New York and taking him away to a remote detention center in Louisiana, immigration authorities have finally admitted that they have no case whatsoever against him,\" said Van Der Hout. \"Instead, the government is clearly going after Mahmoud and persecuting him for exercising his First Amendment rights.\"",
      "After Khalil's arrest, President Trump said it was just the first \"of many to come.\" His statement heralded a crackdown on students and alleged \"agitators\" who have protested against Israel.",
      "Foreign-born students across the country have since faced the knocks of immigration agents at the door, and deportation proceedings.",
      "\"If the secretary of state claims the power to arrest, detain and deport someone, including a lawful permanent resident, simply because that person dissents from US foreign policy, there are no limits. There's no beginning and no end to that kind of executive power,\" said Johnny Sinodis, an attorney for Khalil's immigration case.",
      "\"This is not a routine immigration case or even routine habeas case,\" he added. \"This case is intentionally projecting a message of repression about who can say what in this country and the consequences to your liberty and your life if you object to U.S. policy.\""

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 18:45:25 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump had brushed off the stock market's plunge, but turmoil in the bond market got his administration's attention.",
    "story": [
      "Even as stocks plunged in reaction to his administration's sweeping tariffs, President Trump expressed\u00a0confidence in his trade policies, saying last week that \"markets are going to boom.\" But by Wednesday, a collective thumb's down to the tariffs by bond investors had given Mr. Trump pause.",
      "With U.S. and global financial market tumbling, he abruptly suspended his administration's \"reciprocal tariffs\" on dozens of other countries for 90 days, acknowledging that the bond market was \"getting a little queasy.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's about-face was by no means the first time a sitting American president had blinked in the face of bond investors expressing alarm over U.S. policies they viewed as fiscally reckless and harmful to their portfolios. In their first terms, both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama also found themselves knocked back when the bond market rebelled at the cost of some of their strategic priorities.",
      "The \"bond vigilantes\" ride again",
      "Americans might think of bonds as a less risky asset class they turn to in their 401(k)s to offset more volatile investments, such as stock. But the $2.8 trillion Treasury market is also a bedrock of the U.S. government. The federal government finances the country's debt by selling Treasury bills to investors, who prize the asset because of the country's sterling credit rating and its guarantee of making good on interest payments.",
      "As the Trump administration's reciprocal tariffs went into effect on Wednesday, the bond prices slid and the yield on 2-year Treasury notes rose by as much as 0.3 percentage points, marking the biggest intraday move since 2009, according to financial data firm FactSet. (Bond prices move in inverse relation to their interest rates, or yields.)",
      "Such sudden moves can signal that investors are dumping their bonds. That pushes bond prices lower but boosts yields, which are the returns that bond holders pay to investors.",
      "\"Why is this happening? Fixed-income investors may be starting to worry that the Chinese and other foreigners might start selling their U.S. Treasuries,\" economist Ed Yardeni said in an April 8 research note.",
      "Yardeni, who coined the term \"bond vigilantes\" in the 1980s to describe fixed-income investors who express their disapproval of government policies by dumping Treasuries, added that the bond market was cautioning that \"the Trump administration may be playing with liquid nitro.\"",
      "In another report after Mr. Trump announced the tariff pause, Yardeni noted, \"The Bond Vigilantes have struck again. As far as we can tell, at least with respect to U.S. financial markets, they are the only 1.000 hitters in history.\"",
      "Some Trump administration officials acknowledged that the bond market's hostile reaction to the tariffs influenced the decision to pause the tariffs.",
      "\"[The] bond market was telling us, 'Hey, it is probably time to move,'\" White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett\u00a0said\u00a0on CNBC on Thursday.",
      "Soon after Mr. Trump announced his April 2 tariffs, economists raised concerns\u00a0about the potential impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "The president claimed the tariffs, which he called \"reciprocal\" because they were aimed at equalizing the trade barriers between the U.S. and its trading partners, would help revive manufacturing to the U.S. and raise revenue for the federal government.",
      "But experts warned that the tariffs, which ranged from a baseline 10% for most nations up to more than 100% for Chinese imports, raised the risks of a recession and would likely reignite inflation. Investors dumped stocks and bonds as they digested the economic risks of Mr. Trump's tariff barrage.",
      "While the stock market plunge hurt millions of Americans' retirement savings, the turmoil in the bond market creates very real pressures on the nation's finances. Because the Treasury Department pays interest to debt holders, any increase in yields puts more financial strain on the nation's coffers.",
      "\"Developments in the last 24 hours suggest we may be headed for serious financial crisis wholly induced by U.S. government tariff policy,\" Harvard University economist and former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers\u00a0said\u00a0in an April 9 thread on social media.",
      "He added, \"Long-term interest rates are gapping up, even as the stock market moves sharply downwards. This highly unusual pattern suggests a generalized aversion to U.S. assets in global financial markets.  We are being treated by global financial markets like a problematic emerging market.\"",
      "An expensive problem",
      "Given the size of the Treasury market, the surging bond yields and broader market turmoil could create an expensive problem for the federal government. For Mr. Trump, the timing was especially poor as he pushes Congress to pass an extension of his 2017 tax cuts, which are forecast to cost trillions over the next decade.",
      "In 2024, the U.S. spent more than $1 trillion to service its debt, more than double its roughly $500 billion in 2020, according to Treasury data. That's largely due to higher interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve to battle the post-pandemic surge in inflation.",
      "An increase in bond yields could add to that expense, putting even more pressure on the federal budget.",
      "\"Although President Donald Trump was able to resist the stock market selloff, once the bond market began to weaken, too, it was only a matter of time before he folded on his eye-wateringly high tariffs,\" noted economist Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics in an April 9 research note.",

      "\"I have all my customers putting on the brakes, asking, 'What are we going to do? How are we going to handle this? Where can we move production to?'\" said Lyn Alessi, who began selling luxury fabrics in 1989.",
      "According to the American Apparel and Footwear Association, 97% of the clothes and shoes sold in the U.S. are imported. Most of these items come from China, India and Vietnam, according to the World Bank.",
      "The Trump administration confirmed Thursday that some Chinese goods will be subject to so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" reaching as high as 145%, while imports from Vietnam and India face tariffs of 46% and 27%, respectively. Mr. Trump suspended the tariffs on most countries for 90 days to allow more time for trade talks, but the levies on China remain in place.",
      "The onslaught of new U.S. tariffs has ratcheted up import taxes to their highest level in more than a century, with Mr. Trump touting the policies as a way to revitalize\u00a0domestic manufacturers.",
      "For the Alessi sisters, this additional tax on imports will impact nearly every aspect of garment production, resulting in higher costs for the business and for consumers. They predict this will lead to shoppers seeking out alternative clothing options.",
      "\"A Veronica Beard jacket was $800. Now it's going to be $1,000. And that just takes it out of the market. The secondhand market is going to thrive,\" Alessi said.",
      "Down the block from Alessi International is Apparel Production, a manufacturing group that has survived the industry's ups and downs since its founding in 1948. The company, co-owned by Karen Sadaka and Teddy Sadaka, works with brands including Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren and Kenneth Cole, but most of its plants have shut down as garment jobs were shipped overseas.",
      "\"We had factories in North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, and Kentucky,\" Karen Sadaka said. \"It wasn't a problem. Today, they're all out of business.\"",
      "Today, the average age of workers at Apparel Production is 50, and filling those jobs when they retire is likely to prove challenging. Sadaka said it is too son to tell if Mr. Trump's tariffs will spur domestic production, but she fears the shift \"is too much, too fast.\"",

      "\"Despite Wednesday's announcements to lower the reciprocal tariff rate for most countries to 10%, the escalation between the U.S. and China could dramatically impact trade between the world's two largest economies,\" said Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer for wealth management at UBS, in a research note.",
      "Taking into account Mr. Trump's 145% levy on Chinese imports, UBS currently estimates the overall U.S.\u00a0effective tariff rate at 27%, versus 9% prior to April 2. \"Excluding trade with China, the effective tariff rate is 11%,\" Haefele added.",
      "\"Everything is still very volatile, because with Donald Trump, you don't know what to expect,\" said Francis Lun, chief executive of Geo Securities. \"This is really big uncertainty in the market. The threat of recession has not faded.\"",
      "Markets had been sinking earlier Wednesday on worries that Mr. Trump's trade war could drag the global economy into a recession. But then came the posting on social media that investors worldwide had been waiting and wishing for.",
      "\"I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE,\" Mr. Trump said, saying more than 75 countries are negotiating on trade and not retaliating against his latest increases in tariffs. China was a huge exception, with the president raising tariffs\u00a0 on its products to 145%.",
      "Investors went \"from fear to euphoria,\" Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, said in a commentary. On Wednesday, following Mr. Trump's tariff-pause announcement, the S&P 500 surged 9.5%, its third-best day since 1940. The index is still below where it was when Trump announced his sweeping set of tariffs last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shot to a gain of nearly 3,000 points, or 7.9%. The Nasdaq composite leaped 12.2%.",
      "\"It's now a manageable risk, especially as global recession tail bets get unwound, and most of Asia's exporters breathe a massive sigh of relief,\" Innes said. Analysts had expected the global comeback given that U.S. stocks had one of their best days in history on Wednesday as investors registered their relief over Trump's decision.",
      "The trade war isn't over, and an escalating battle between the world's two largest economies can create plenty of damage. U.S. stocks are also still below where they were just a week ago. Technology stocks were the biggest drag on markets in early trading Thursday, followed by the industrial and the financial sectors.",
      "CPI report brings good news",
      "On a positive note, the U.S. government's latest consumer inflation data revealed inflation in March\u00a0rose\u00a02.4% on an annual basis, a sign of progress in the Federal Reserve's battle to\u00a0bring down inflation\u00a0to a 2% rate.",
      "\"This month's inflation report showed that CPI dropped across the board in March, which is welcome news for the Federal Reserve, which would like to cut rates if significant damage is done to the economy through increased tariffs, but otherwise would be reluctant to cut rates in the face of an inflation threat,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management.",
      "March \"saw a fairly big cooling in inflation (both headline and core) and this, coupled w/the healthy job adds from last week, point to robust underlying economic fundamentals. The downtick in inflation gives breathing room for the Fed to be more forceful in responding to market turmoil,\" said equity analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, in a report.",
      "From bear investors' perspective, however, \"inflation is still running above the Fed's target and regardless, Mar and Q1 numbers are irrelevant given how much the world has changed. Trump's tariffs are only hitting the economy now, and it will take months before they fully show up in the data,\" Crisafulli added.",
      "In other words, according to most analysts, the situation is still too uncertain to call.",
      "\"It's much too soon to blow the all clear \u2014 both on tariffs or on inflation \u2014 since the tariff damage has only been postponed as of now, and will only be relieved if tariff deals can be struck across the board,\" Zaccarelli said.",
      "\"Inflation still remains a concern because the full impact of tariffs is yet to be felt, however, at least the underlying trends (e.g. non-tariff related inflation) seems benign at this time. We will be keeping a close eye on PPI tomorrow in order to determine whether or not future inflation is already in the pipeline,\" he added.",
      "In report Thursday, TD Securities analysts echoed that sentiment, saying, \"Indeed, uncertainty remains in the air as the outlook for consumer price inflation remains blurred by ongoing trade policy developments.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 16:14:04 -0400",
    "summary": "The vote was initially delayed amid conservatives' concerns about the level of spending cuts.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House on Thursday adopted a budget blueprint for President Trump's agenda after Republican leaders scrambled to convince GOP holdouts who want deeper spending cuts to back it.",
      "The resolution was adopted in a 216-214 vote, with two Republicans \u2014 Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Victoria Spartz of Indiana \u2014 joining all Democrats to vote against it.",
      "About a dozen House conservatives ultimately flipped their opposition after receiving assurances from leaders that the Senate would pursue $1.5 trillion in savings, at a minimum.",
      "\"Our two chambers are directly aligned,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said before the vote. \"We're committed to finding at least $1.5 trillion in savings for the American people while also preserving our essential programs.\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, echoed that the Senate is \"aligned with the House in terms of what their budget resolution outlined in terms of savings.\"",
      "\"The speaker talked about $1.5 trillion dollars. We have a lot of United States senators who believe that is a minimum,\" Thune said.",
      "The lower chamber was set to vote Wednesday evening on the budget resolution but punted after several House conservatives resisted increasing pressure from Mr. Trump to accept the blueprint that would open the door to implementing his border security, defense, energy priorities and extending expiring tax cuts.",
      "Approving the budget plan in both chambers is the first step in the reconciliation process, which allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation in the Senate and pass Mr. Trump's agenda with a simple majority. Going that route allows Republicans, who have control of the House and Senate, to pass the measure without any support from Democrats.",
      "The House and Senate worked on separate blueprints earlier this year but more recently reached a compromise resolution, which the Senate adopted early Saturday morning. Republican leaders in the House worked to unite their divided party behind the budget plan this week before Congress leaves town for a two-week recess.",
      "The Senate set much lower minimum floors for spending cuts at just about $4 billion, though committees could find far more. The compromise resolution also allows for the House to slash at least $1.5 trillion in spending.",
      "The Senate also wants to account for tax cuts enacted during Mr. Trump's first term with a tactic known as \"current policy baseline,\" which assumes that continuing expiring policies will cost nothing. Under that baseline, the nearly $4 trillion it would cost to extend the 2017 tax cuts would not be counted, further frustrating House conservatives.",
      "Johnson said House and Senate committees would be working in a \"collaborative fashion\" over the two-week recess to find savings.",
      "Before backing the resolution, House conservatives wanted assurances from the Senate that there will be deeper spending cuts, which sent leadership scrambling to find another compromise.",
      "\"We just don't trust the Senate,\" Rep. Eric Burlison, a Missouri Republican, told reporters Wednesday night after fiscal hawks huddled with Johnson for more than hour as the vote was delayed. \"We all campaign on spending cuts, but again and again, that doesn't happen. And when the Senate sent over something that said $4 billion is their floor, that was unacceptable to a lot of us.\"",
      "Burlison was among those who changed their minds and voted in favor of the resolution. Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas said he and other holdouts were moved to support the resolution by a White House commitment to making \"significant cuts,\" Johnson's \"firm commitment\" to maintain House Republicans' framework of tying tax cuts to spending cuts and Thune's \"strong statement\" promising at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts.",
      "Massie, one of the two Republicans who held firm on his \"no\" vote, called it \"a framework for financial collapse.\"",
      "\"I don't believe they're going to make any cuts of any consequence. Now they may change spending, reduce spending here, and increase spending there, but overall, the money spent next year is going to be more than the money spent this year,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump increased pressure on House Republicans in recent days to swallow the blueprint, telling holdouts on Tuesday night, \"close your eyes and get there.\" He added that individual lawmakers may not get \"every little ounce\" of what they want in the legislation.",
      "\"It's a phenomenal bill. Stop grandstanding,\" Mr. Trump said at the House GOP campaign arm's fundraising dinner.",
      "Democrats have railed against the proposed cuts, arguing the Republican plan will lead to massive cuts in entitlement programs such as Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security.",
      "\"The budget resolution that passed the House today will set in motion some of the most extreme cuts to health care, nutritional assistance and the things that matter to everyday Americans in our nation's nearly 250-year history,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said Thursday. \"It's a disgrace.\"",

    "story": [
      "A Senate committee heard from several experts Thursday on setting a year-round time standard instead of switching back and forth with daylight saving time. President Trump recently called it a \"50/50 issue,\" but he previously vowed to get rid of daylight saving.",
      "At the hearing, the committee's chairman, Sen. Ted Cruz, said there is a general consensus among his colleagues that the system of switching the clocks needs to be changed, but he said there is disagreement about whether to adopt universal standard time or daylight saving time.",
      "\"I personally struggle with the two choices here, because it's a question of what do you care about more: sunshine and joy and fun and money, or health, mental health, physical health,\" said Cruz, a Republican from Texas. \"And the honest answer for most people, gosh, I care about all that stuff.\"",
      "Cruz said an alternative has been discussed to pick daylight saving time, but letting states opt out. Arizona and Hawaii current opt out of changing the clock. But others said in Thursday's hearing that having different standards for different states could cause widespread confusion.",
      "The Senate Commerce Committee hearing notice did not set a preference for daylight saving time or standard time, but instead said it would focus on \"various issues around whether the country should continue 'springing forward' and 'falling back' each year with time.\"",
      "Daylight saving time begins in March, when clocks are moved forward an hour, and ends in October, when the clocks go back to standard time.",
      "The twice-yearly time changes are\u00a0generally unpopular\u00a0among Americans, with 63% saying they\u00a0would like to eliminate\u00a0them completely, compared to just 16% who said they would not, according to an Economist/YouGov poll in November 2021.",

      "\"The sun moving around the earth doesn't actually have anything to do with time,\" Yates said. \"We need this system, but this system has this bug right now, and the bug is daylight saving time, the switching of the clocks. And so if we have a little bit of time, a couple of years, so the individual states can address all of these complexities and make those decisions, then we will be able to get rid of this bug permanently. It is something we have been stuck with since World War I, and this is our opportunity to finally fix it.\"",
      "A 2020\u00a0commentary\u00a0for the journal JAMA Neurology found evidence linking the annual transition to daylight saving time to\u00a0increased strokes,\u00a0heart attacks\u00a0and\u00a0teen sleep deprivation.",
      "The Senate in 2022 passed a bill called the Sunshine Protection Act to make daylight saving time permanent, but the bill never went anywhere in the House.

      "It's unclear where President Trump stands on the issue. Mr. Trump said in March that it's a \"50/50 issue,\" saying \"it's hard to get excited about it. I assume people would like to have more light later, but some people want to have more light earlier because they don't want to take their kids to school in the dark.\"",
      "But back in December, he posted on social media: \"Daylight Saving Time is inconvenient, and very costly to our Nation.\" In the same post, he said the \"Republican Party will use its best efforts to eliminate Daylight Saving Time, which has a small but strong constituency, but shouldn't!\"",
      "Mr. Trump in the past had supported making daylight saving time\u00a0permanent \u2014 that is, keeping clocks shifted one hour ahead, which happens in the spring. His\u00a0December comment\u00a0called for daylight saving time to be eliminated.",

      "The Masters began Thursday at Augusta National. Defending champion Scottie Scheffler will try to win his third green jacket and\u00a0Rory McIlroy will try again to win his first as the biggest names in golf come together amid the Georgia pines for 2025's first major championship.",
      "There are 95 players in the field, the largest in a decade, even without five-time champion Tiger Woods, who had surgery in March to repair a torn Achilles tendon. Last year, Woods set a record by making the cut for the 24th time in a row.",
      "There is still a schism in the game, and just 12 from the breakaway LIV Golf league will be teeing up among the pink dogwoods and blooming azaleas. That includes Jon Rahm, the winner two years ago, and U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau.",
      "Here is a look at what you need to know about the Masters. CBS Sports will update its live leaderboard with player standings as the tournament goes on.",
      "When will the Masters start?",
      "The first round began at about 7:25 a.m. EDT Thursday, when honorary starters Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player and Tom Watson teed off on Tea Olive, the first hole at Augusta National. Jock Hutchison and Fred McLeod were the first honorary starters in 1963, but it was not until Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen took over in 1981 that it became a treasured tradition.",
      "Who is playing in the Masters?",
      "Davis Riley and Patton Kizzire were the first competitors off at 7:40 a.m., followed by groups of three. After the second round, the top 50 players and ties make the cut for the weekend and are paired according to score for the final two rounds.",
      "Scheffler, who has yet to win this season, is the 9-2 favorite, according to BetMGM Sportsbook. McIlory is second at 13-2 after his wins at Pebble Beach and The Players Championship. Collin Morikawa is 14-1 while Rahm and DeChambeau are 16-1.",
      "Scheffler, who along with his green jacket and Olympic gold medal won seven times on the PGA Tour last year, got a late start to this season after cutting himself on a wine glass in December. But the world No. 1 comes into the Masters with momentum after a final-round 63 left him one shot back of winner Min Woo Lee in his last start at the Houston Open.",
      "McIlroy has been playing some of the best golf of his career. His collapse in the U.S. Open at Pinehurst last year in a Sunday duel with DeChambeau seems to have made the 35-year-old from Northern Ireland an even bigger sentimental favorite.",
      "Xander Schauffele won two majors last year and is seeking his first green jacket, though he seems to be still rounding into form following a rib injury. Five-time major winner Brooks Koepka has twice finished second at Augusta National.",
      "Morikawa, Lee and Joaquin Niemann teed off at 9:47 a.m. Thursday, beginning a run of high-profile groups. Phil Mickelson, Jason Day and Keegan Bradley played next, followed by Scheffler, who is grouped with Justin Thomas and U.S. Amateur champ Jose Luis Ballester. Jordan Spieth, Tom Kim and Tyrrell Hatton went off at 10:26 a.m.",
      "In the afternoon, McIlroy is grouped with Ludvig Aberg and Akshay Bhatia and tees off at 1:12 p.m., just behind the group of Schauffele, Adam Scott and Viktor Hoveland. DeChambeau, Hideki Matsuyama and Shane Lowery are off at 1:23 p.m., followed by Rahm, Wyndham Clark and Tommy Fleetwood.",
      "How to watch the Masters",
      "The Masters stream on its website began Thursday at 7:15 a.m. and runs throughout the day. Cameras highlight holes and featured groups. The first two rounds are broadcast on ESPN beginning at 3 p.m. Thursday and Friday. CBS takes over Saturday and Sunday with coverage on its Paramount+ platform at noon and on the network beginning at 2 p.m.",
      "What has happened at the Masters so far?",
      "While most of Monday's practice round was washed out, Tuesday and Wednesday were warm and sunny. The forecast for Thursday is clear, but storms could arrive overnight and the rain could continue into the early part of Friday.",
      "Scheffler birdied the fourth hole of the course for the first time in his career. He has now birdied, or scored one stroke under par, on all 18 holes at the course at least once, CBS Sports reported.",
      "Before the competition got underway Thursday, players took part in the Masters Par 3 Contest, where golfers aim to complete each step of the nine-hole course in three strokes or less. The contest was held Wednesday. It dates back to 1960 and is set around DeSoto Springs Pond and Ike's Pond, the PGA said.",
      "Nicolas Echavarria and J.J. Spaun finished atop the leaderboard at 5 under in the family friendly event, but they may come to regret it \u2014 nobody has won the\u00a0Par 3 Tournament and gone on to win the Masters in the same year.",

    "story": [
      "As President Trump announced a pause to his sweeping reciprocal tariffs Wednesday, his trade representative, Jamieson Greer, was in the middle of testifying at a House hearing on the administration's trade policy.",
      "Greer appeared to learn of the president's decision to pause the tariffs for 90 days the same time the public did, as he was sitting before members of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade.",
      "Asked when he was made aware of the pause by Rep. Steven Horsford, a Democrat from Nevada, Greer said, \"Well, I understood the decision was made a few minutes ago. It's something that's been under discussion.\"",
      "\"So did you know that this was under discussion and why did you not include that as part of your opening remarks?\" Horsford asked.",
      "Greer replied he doesn't share the contents of his discussions with Mr. Trump.",
      "Immediately after Mr. Trump announced the pause, the U.S. stock market surged. It had fallen significantly after the president's initial announcement on the tariffs. A universal tariff of 10% remained in place for nearly every country, except China, which faces an even higher tariff of 125%. China raised its own tariffs against the U.S.",
      "Horsford pressed Greer for details of the pause.",
      "\"I understand it's 90 days. I haven't spoken to the president since I've been in this hearing,\" Greer said.",
      "Horsford interrupted, \"So the trade representative hasn't spoken to the president of the United States about a global re-ordering of trade?\"",
      "\"Yes I have, I'm just here in a hearing with you,\" Greer interjected.",
      "\"And yet he announced it on a tweet? W.T.F.? Who's in charge?\" Horsford yelled.",
      "\"The president of the United States is in charge,\" Greer said.",
      "\"And what do you know about those details?\" Horsford asked. Before Greer could answer, he said, \"It looks like your boss just pulled the rug out from under you.\"",
      "\"There's no strategy,\" Horsford said. \"You just found out. Three seconds ago. Sitting here. We saw you. If you came here knowing that you were going to be turned off, that these tariffs were going to be turned off, why didn't you include that in your opening statement? Why didn't you reference that as part of your testimony?\"",
      "Greer repeated he doesn't disclose his conversations with the president.",
      "\"These were specific questions we asked you all along,\" Horsford said. \"What's the strategy? These are real consequences for the American people and small businesses. \u2026 This is amateur hour and it needs to stop. What does this even mean for your negotiating strategy? How are you in charge of negotiation if the president is tweeting about this from wherever the hell he is?\"",
      "\"The president was elected and he runs the trade policy and I advise him and execute his policy,\" Greer said.",
      "\"Did you know that this was happening?\" Horsford pressed.",
      "\"We had been discussing all kinds of options, Sir,\" Greer said.",
      "\"There was no strategy. There was no plan,\" Horsford said, adding that Mr. Trump \"put our economy in disarray and near collapse.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued the tariffs were a \"negotiating strategy.\"",
      "Horsford asked Greer if this was market manipulation.",
      "When Greer answered, \"No,\" Horsford, said \"Why not? If it was a plan. If it was always the plan, how is this not market manipulation?\"",
      "\"We're trying to reset the global trade system,\" Greer said.",
      "\"And what has that done? How have you achieved any of that? But to enact enormous harm on the American people?\" Horsford said. \"Tariffs are a tool. It can be used in the appropriate way to protect U.S. jobs and small businesses, but that's not what this does, so if it's not market manipulation, what is it? Who's benefitting? What billionaire just got richer?\"",
      "Horsford then slammed Republicans for their budget plan and repeated to Greer, \"Who's in charge? Because it sure doesn't look like it's the trade representative. You just got the rug pulled out from under you.\"",
      "\"I wish I could feel some empathy, but the empathy I have is for the American people whose very wellbeing and livelihoods are being effected. This is not a game. This is real life,\" Horsford said before yielding his time.",

    "summary": "A new breed of veterinary clinic is changing how pets \u2014 and their owners \u2014 are treated. \"I'd rather see four pets a day,\" one vet said.",
    "story": [
      "When Kathleen Whitman's daughter's Bernadoodle, Cody, swallowed a Kong toy, the family faced a veterinary emergency requiring immediate surgery.",
      "X-rays at their local suburban clinic suggested what looked like a hair tie tangled in Cody's intestines. When referred to a corporate emergency hospital, the family was quoted $10,000 for the procedure.",
      "\"They literally told me in the waiting room with a clipboard, thinking I was just coming in and we were doing $10,000,\" Whitman said. \"I said, 'No, I'm just coming in to hear the price.\"",
      "Desperate for an alternative, Whitman reached out to Vetique, a boutique veterinary clinic in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood. There, Dr. Jessica Trice and Dr. Jennifer Remnes performed the surgery for what Whitman called \"an appropriate fee\" that was significantly less than $10,000.",
      "During the surgery, she and her daughter waited in the clinic's lobby with glasses of Prosecco while receiving regular updates.",
      "\"The humans were taken care of just as much as the puppy in distress was,\" Whitman said.",
      "This experience mirrors what many pet owners report when comparing corporate-owned emergency animal hospitals to independent practices. Kara Adams, whose 16-year-old rescue dog Shadow needed emergency eye surgery, also chose Vetique over corporate alternatives.",
      "When Adams called Vetique explaining she had only $1,000 available, staff accommodated her financial constraints.",
      "\"The planning manager came out with a payment plan for me,\" Adams said. \"I was crying because otherwise, what would I do? I didn't have any other options.\"",
      "\"You literally burn people out\"",
      "Drs. Trice and Remnes founded Vetique after witnessing firsthand how corporate consolidation was transforming veterinary medicine \u2014 often for the worse.",
      "\"Just coming from a corporation for many years, the whole thing is about quantity, getting all those pets,\" Trice explained after spending 10 years at Banfield Pet Hospital, followed by five years as a medical director at VCA Animal Hospitals. \"We feel the best way is not pushing about the number of quantity, because it gets very sloppy and you lose that interaction and relationship with the clients.\"",
      "Remnes' experience echoed her partner's concerns. At Banfield as a new graduate, she found herself overwhelmed by volume demands.",
      "\"As a new grad, you're still learning and trying to break into this brand-new world. I was seeing like 30 pets a day,\" Remnes said.",
      "She later moved to VCA before its Mars acquisition, initially enjoying the autonomy because \"each hospital was able to operate as they liked to.\" After the corporate takeover, however, the pressure intensified.",
      "\"It was like, 'Oh, you need to see this number of pets, or we're decreasing your salary.' That's what's burning out the industry,\" Remnes said. \"You literally burn people out doing that. You can't possibly offer your best when you're crammed with all of these patients.\"",
      "These pressures contribute to a profession in crisis. A 2024 study in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association found that U.S. veterinarians are more likely to experience serious mental health struggles than most people.",
      "\"We have forums on Facebook where our industry has one of the highest suicide rates,\" Remnes noted. \"It's because of things like this, when you're given spreadsheets and quotas rather than focusing on patient care.\"",
      "Their solution was to create a different business model. Instead of maximizing patient volume, Vetique prioritizes extended appointment times and a calming environment with luxury touches like sparkling epoxy floors, examination tables with faux fur coverings and exam rooms named after the founders' pets.",
      "\"I'd rather see four pets a day. That meant that family was getting my full attention, that pet was getting everything that I do,\" Remnes explained.",
      "Alongside traditional veterinary medicine, Trice offers acupuncture, herbal remedies and chiropractic treatments \u2014 holistic approaches she had wanted to pursue at corporate practices but was discouraged from using.",
      "Surging pet care prices",
      "Setting prices at Vetique involves balancing fair market rates with the clinic's added value. What Remnes found surprising was how significantly corporate prices have increased in recent years. \"Prices are so drastically different from when I was at VCA seven years ago. They're charging actually close to what we're charging as a general practice for an exam,\" she noted.",
      "This observation led her to reconsider Vetique's own pricing strategy.",
      "\"It's like, 'Well, we can actually probably charge more, because we offer all these experiences along with it.' It's trying to find a happy medium, trying to be fair, but also knowing our value.\"",
      "Despite the appeal of the boutique model, both Remnes and Trice acknowledge significant business challenges. The clinic is in its third year of operation, still within the typical three-to-five-year window before seeing substantial returns. Unlike corporate-backed veterinary chains, Vetique is entirely funded through a bank loan.",
      "Vetique's founders see their clinic not as a competitor to corporate chains but as an alternative model for the industry. \"We're not competing,\" Trice said. \"We're creating a new veterinary culture.\"",
      "Corporate giants reshape vet landscape",
      "John Volk, senior consultant with Brakke Consulting, said veterinary practices historically grow 4-5% annually and carry minimal accounts receivable, making them attractive to investors.",
      "\"Pet care in general is very attractive to the financial community,\" Volk said. \"It's a very steady growth industry, and it's a cash business, so they carry very little accounts receivable because pet owners pay for their services at time of service.\"",
      "Mars Inc., best known for candy brands like M&M's and Snickers, has quietly become the largest owner of veterinary hospitals in the U.S. through a series of major acquisitions.",
      "The privately held company owns three of the nation's largest veterinary chains: Banfield Pet Hospital, VCA Animal Hospitals, and BluePearl Specialty and Emergency Pet Hospital \u2014 giving it control of more than 2,000 clinics across North America.",
      "Mars entered the pet care industry in 2007 by acquiring Banfield, which primarily operates inside PetSmart locations. In 2017, it significantly expanded its footprint by purchasing VCA for $9.1 billion \u2014 one of the largest acquisitions in veterinary history,\u00a0according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.",
      "VCA operates more than 900 hospitals in the U.S. and Canada, while Banfield has over 1,000 clinics nationwide. Unlike VCA, which grew by acquiring independent practices, Banfield has mostly launched new locations within retail stores.",
      "Mars's scale allows for standardized protocols, shared technology platforms and subscription-based wellness plans across its network. According to the company website, Mars Veterinary Health serves more than 25 million pets annually.",
      "While private equity firms have been acquiring veterinary practices since the late 1980s, the trend has accelerated significantly over the past 15 years. Volk estimates approximately 30% of veterinary practices are now corporate-owned.",
      "Despite the growth in corporate ownership, Volk sees no evidence that care quality differs significantly between corporate and independent practices.",
      "\"I've not seen any data to suggest that the services provided by corporately owned practices are materially different than services provided by independently owned practices,\" he said.",
      "However, some policymakers have raised concerns about the impact of consolidation on pricing. In January 2023, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, specifically called out Mars Veterinary Health and other large veterinary corporations in a letter to the Federal Trade Commission. Warren cited \"troubling reports of anti-competitive consolidation\" and suggested these corporate entities were using market power to \"raise prices for consumers and lower wages for veterinarians.\"",
      "Even as consolidation continues, Volk finds that independent practices remain viable. \"If you have a DVM degree and don't have a bad personal history, you can get money to buy or start a practice,\" he said. \"Veterinarians are one of the lowest-risk borrowers of any category.\"",
      "For new veterinarians, the industry offers growing opportunities. The American Veterinary Medical Association reports the average starting salary in companion animal medicine reached approximately $137,000 in 2024.",
      "Design, investment, and a human touch",
      "When clients walk into a Bond Vet clinic, they won't find the sterile environment or cluttered waiting rooms traditionally associated with veterinary offices. Instead, they'll encounter soft pastel colors, comfortable seating and an atmosphere deliberately designed to feel more like a high-end hospitality experience than a medical facility.",
      "\"The industry has two categories of clinics historically \u2014 many designed very clinical, cold and sterile, and then others called mom and pop, which could be cluttered or dirty,\" said Garrett Lewis, CEO of Bond Vet. \"The question is how to solve both problems.\"",
      "That solution \u2013 creating premium veterinary experiences with transparent pricing and greater accessibility \u2013 has attracted significant private equity investment.",
      "While these premium services might suggest significantly higher costs, Lewis emphasizes transparency in Bond Vet's pricing model. \"When someone comes in, you can look at the laptop and see exactly what the pricing is,\" he said. \"Our prices are just a little bit above average, but the experience is what differentiates us.\"",
      "This transparency extends to digital platforms, where clients can check prices online or via text before visiting. During appointments, veterinarians show pricing information directly to clients on laptops, allowing for discussion about options.",
      "Bond Vet, backed by a $170 million investment from Warburg Pincus, has expanded to 57 locations across the Northeast and Midwest since its founding in 2019. The company was inspired by human-focused healthcare models like One Medical, focusing on convenience, design, and a better experience for both pets and owners.",
      "\"They saw the same issue, which was that the industry wasn't serving clients and pets at a much higher level,\" Lewis said of Bond Vet's founders, who included a veterinarian and her husband. \"They quickly found it was very different to change culture and design in existing practices, so they rebooted from the ground up.\"",
      "Bond Vet's approach represents a broader trend in veterinary medicine, where traditional practices are being reinvented with a focus on client experience alongside medical care.",
      "Bond Vet's model bridges the gap between traditional veterinary practices and emergency hospitals, offering urgent care alongside preventative services \u2013 all with a hospitality-focused approach.",
      "\"In the 90s, if you needed sick care, your veterinarian would say, 'Come on in.' If you needed preventive care, they'd say, 'Come on in,'\" Lewis explained. \"What happened in the 2000s is a lot of specialization occurred where practices became just preventative and started referring out anything that looked urgent or sick.\"",
      "Bond Vet handles non-emergency urgent cases that might otherwise end up in expensive emergency rooms. \"ER practices see about 40% of their volume as urgent rather than emergent cases. Clients go to ER and spend twice as much, often having to wait longer,\" Lewis noted.",
      "These clinics feature design elements specifically created to reduce stress for pets \u2014 an approach that appears to be working. \"I always see dogs dragging their owners into the clinic, which is not a common thing,\" Lewis said.",
      "The \"no walls\" philosophy breaking ground",
      "Imagine walking into a veterinary emergency room and instead of being separated from your pet during a crisis, you're welcomed directly onto the treatment floor. At  VEG ER for Pets, this isn't just possible \u2014 it's mandatory.",
      "\"We built an entire business around it,\" said Dr. David Bessler, founder and CEO of VEG ER for Pets. \"It's much easier doing something 100% of the time than trying to do it 90% of the time.\"",
      "With 102 locations across 28 states, VEG ER for Pets represents an approach to emergency veterinary medicine that stands apart from both traditional practices and newer primary care models.",
      "Unlike other veterinary innovators that blend primary and urgent care, VEG ER for Pets focuses exclusively on emergency medicine \u2013 a deliberate strategy that Bessler calls \"a bit of a crazy bet.\"",
      "\"We took the hardest part of an industry, emergency, and created an entire business around that,\" said David Gladstein, co-founder and president of VEG ER for Pets. \"It's hard to make money, it's hard to get the team, it's hard to recruit, it's hard to train.\"",
      "VEG ER for Pets' most distinctive feature is its commitment to keeping pets with their owners throughout the entire treatment process, even during emergencies \u2014 an approach not found in traditional emergency hospitals, where pets are typically treated in back rooms away from owners.",
      "This transparency extends to the physical design of newer hospitals, which have eliminated traditional waiting rooms entirely. \"Our newer hospitals don't even have a lobby,\" Gladstein explained. \"You literally walk in and you're in the middle of the treatment floor.\"",
      "In a notable departure from many veterinary innovators, VEG ER for Pets has achieved financial independence from its initial investors and now funds its expansion through its own operations.",
      "\"VEG ER for Pets is now independently able to do that,\" Gladstein stated. \"We don't need anyone else to advocate for us or to pay for us. We're not beholden to anybody. We're beholden to our customers, and we're beholden to our veggies.\"",
      "This independence allows the company to maintain its distinctive approach while continuing to open 25-30 new locations annually.",
      "The company's exclusive focus on emergency care, while limiting in some ways, has allowed it to \"crack the code\" on veterinary emergencies according to Gladstein. \"We've kind of cracked the code on one way of doing things in emergency that results in a better experience for all of the souls that are there experiencing that at the same time.\"",

      "A set of remains found in Kansas in 1973 have been identified after decades thanks to advanced DNA testing, officials said Tuesday.",
      "The Kansas Bureau of Investigation said in a news release that the decomposing remains of an unidentified young man were found three miles southeast of Garnett, Kansas on April 18, 1973. The man was believed to have brown hair and a slender build, and was wearing a brown corduroy jacket, green long-sleeved buttoned shirt, jeans, black leather belt with a large buckle, brown hiking boots and a navy blue stocking cap. He also wore two gold rings with crosses, a ring with the number \"78,\" and a silver chain with a large cross, the bureau said.",
      "An autopsy found signs of trauma and determined he had been murdered, officials said.",
      "\"Many attempts\" were made to identify the man over the years, the bureau said, including listing the man's description in the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, but to no avail. In 2024, DNA extracted from the remains was sent to the forensic company Othram for forensic genetic genealogy testing, the bureau said. Othram created a DNA profile and searched for relatives of the unknown man.",
      "In early 2025, the Kansas Bureau of Investigation learned that Othram had identified a match. Agents from the bureau and officials from the Anderson County Sheriff's Office were able to locate people who DNA showed were the siblings of the unidentified man.",
      "Interviews and a DNA sample from one sibling allowed officials to identify the remains as belonging to Jimmy Allen Dollison, the bureau said.",
      "Dollison had been living in Kansas City, Kansas when he went missing, sometime in October or November 1972, the Kansas Bureau of Investigation said. He was 16 at the time of his disappearance. He was reported missing by his parents, family members told the bureau, but relatives never received any answers.",
      "The bureau did not say how long the remains had been decomposing when they were found in April 1973, six months after Dollison's disappearance. Dollison's entry in the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System notes that he \"had likely been deceased 2-4 weeks\" before his remains were found.",
      "Kansas City is about 80 miles from Garnett, where the remains were found.",
      "The Kansas Bureau of Investigation and the Anderson County Sheriff's Office are continuing to investigate Dollison's death. Anyone with information about the case is asked to contact the authorities.",

Working with the 388th Fighter Wing Maintenance Group and the defense manufacturer Lockheed Martin, they sought to remove the nose from one inoperative jet and transfer it onto another, an undertaking that the Air Force called a \"first-of-its-kind and seemingly impossible task.\"",
      "Past accidents had rendered both planes involved in the project out of service. One had experienced an engine fire in 2014, and the other's landing gear malfunctioned in 2020, according to the Air Force. To minimize waste \u2014 and the cost of military aircraft repairs for taxpayers \u2014 engineers put their experiment to the test.",
      "\"The scope and complexity of this project was an exemplary demonstration of overcoming barriers,\" said Tomas Barber, an F-35 repair team engineer, in a statement. Barber also said its completion marked a new level of repair capabilities for advanced stealth fighters.",
      "Building \"Frankenjet\" ultimately took two years and five months, the Air Force said. The project cost $11.7 million, which was $2.8 million less than anticipated, and resulted in $63 million overall in savings for the Department of Defense.",
      "The warplane took its first flight in January from Hill Air Force Base in Utah to the Lockheed Martin facility in Fort Worth, Texas, the Air Force said. By the end of March, it was prepared to resume full service as part of the 4th Fighter Generation Squadron's 388th Fighter Wing. The jet successfully traveled back from Fort Worth to the Utah base around that time, and afterward was officially considered fully operational.",

    "story": [
      "When F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote \"The Great Gatsby\" at the height of the roaring '20s, he couldn't possibly realize that the book would emerge as one of the very top contenders for \"the great American novel.\"",
      "In fact, when Fitzgerald \u2013 a St. Paul, Minnesota native whose debut novel \"This Side of Paradise\" launched him into national prominence at the age of 24 \u2013 died in 1940 at the early age of 44, the book was already in danger of falling into obscurity.",
      "Now, 100 years after the book's first publication on April 10, 1925, it endures as one of the country's foremost tales of American hubris, modern yearning and class consciousness. And its clear-eyed assessment of the attainability of the American dream remains incisive with each passing decade.",
      "Fitzgerald's book, long a staple in high school literature classes, tells the story of Nick Carraway, a Midwesterner (and veiled Fitzgerald stand-in) who becomes enamored with the bon vivant, Jazz Age lifestyle on Long Island, specifically the effects of mutli-millioniare Jay Gatsby.",
      "Like Carraway, Gatsby is a Midwesterner who has trekked to the East Coast to make a name for himself. It's Carraway's cousin Daisy Buchanan who serves as the catalyst for Gatsby's downfall, and ultimately Carraway's own disillusionment. All the while, a symbolic green light beckons from the distance.",
      "When the book was first published, reviews were largely positive, though not unanimous. Fitzgerald, who originally wanted to title the book \"Trimalchio in West Egg\" before being persuaded to go with a title he thought far more generic, watched as the book languished on the vine commercially, selling fewer than 25,000 copies in the initial push.",
      "He would only complete one further novel in his lifetime: 1934's \"Tender is the Night,\" a thinly-veiled roman \u00e0 clef of Fitzgerald's own marriage to socialite Zelda Sayre, detailing their mutual descent into alcoholism and mental illness. Fitzgerald's early death from a heart attack was likely fuelled by years and years of alcohol abuse. Ironically, he'd gone sober just ahead of the cardiac event.",
      "If \"The Great Gatsby\" never achieved the level of esteem it now enjoys during the author's own life, it wasn't long after his death that Fitgerald's literary reputation took off.",
      "When the Modern Library asked authors, historians, critics and publishers on the eve of Y2K to rank their picks for the world's best novels of the 20th century, it was \"The Great Gatsby\" that\u00a0stood above all other U.S. contenders near the top of the poll. (The novel landed in second place, bookended by Irish author James Joyce's \"Ulysses\" and \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" in the top three.)",
      "The novel has since launched multiple film adaptations, has been transposed to the stage, and since going into the public domain in 2021, has been the subject of an endless array of reimaginings, remixes and mashups. It's even cleared space around itself as a modern-day meme, in the form of an animated .GIF depicting Leonardo Dicaprio (playing Gatsby in Baz Luhrmann's 2013 film adaptation) smirking as he offers a champagne toast flanked by ostentatious fireworks.",
      "Host of \"Gatsby\" centennial events planned in New York, Minnesota",
      "A host of \"Gatsby\"-themed events are planned to mark the novel's centennial anniversary. In New York, the Empire State Building announced plans to light up in green Thursday, in a nod to the novel's symbolic green light at the end of Tom and Daisy's dock.",
      "There is also a rowdy \"Roaring Twenties\" party scheduled at the Empire Steak House in New York, which was an opulent opera house in Fitzgerald's era. Billed as the \"nation's most extravagant celebration,\" the event will feature live jazz, period dancing, and speeches from officials with the New York Public Library.",
      "In Fitzgerald's hometown of St. Paul, the events include a new exhibit of the author's life and times at the Minnesota History Center, as well as various, less-than-sober events leaning into the novel's party-friendly Prohibition-era setting.",
      "If you managed to get through high school without having been assigned to read the book, there are a number of live readings of the book scheduled this month, including at St. Paul's Gale Family Library.",

    "story": [
      "A New York jury on Wednesday awarded $1.68 billion in damages to 40 women who accused writer and director James Toback of sexual abuse and other crimes over a span of 35 years, according to lawyers representing the plaintiffs.",
      "The decision stems from a lawsuit filed in Manhattan in 2022 after New York state instituted a one-year window for people to file lawsuits over sexual assault claims even if they took place decades ago. The \"Adult Survivors Act,\" which New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has called \"a victory for justice,\" gave accusers older than 18 a chance to sue in civil court when the statute of limitations on their allegations would have otherwise expired.",
      "Wednesday's jury award marks one of the largest of its kind since the advent of the #MeToo movement, as well as in New York state history, said attorney Brad Beckworth, of the law firm Nix Patterson LLP, in an interview. The plaintiffs, he said, believe such a large verdict will send a message to powerful individuals \"who don't treat women appropriately.\"",

      "\"This verdict is about justice,\" Beckworth said in a statement. \"But more importantly, It's about taking power back from the abusers \u2014 and their and enablers \u2014 and returning it to those he tried to control and silence.\"",
      "Beckworth said the abuse took place between 1979 and 2014.",
      "Toback was nominated for an Oscar for writing 1991's \"Bugsy,\" and his career in Hollywood has spanned more than 40 years.",
      "Accusations that he engaged in years of sexual abuse surfaced in late 2017 as the #MeToo movement gained attention. They were first reported by the Los Angeles Times. In that report, 38 women accused Toback of sexual harassment, with many alleging he approached them on the streets of New York City and promised them stardom. Thirty-one of the women spoke on the record.",
      "In 2018, Los Angeles prosecutors said the statutes of limitations had expired in five cases they reviewed, and declined to bring criminal charges against Toback.",
      "The plaintiffs then filed a lawsuit in New York a few days after the state's Adult Survivors Act went into effect. The lawyers said they discovered a pattern of Toback attempting to lure young women on the streets of New York into meeting him by falsely promising roles in his films and then subjecting them to sexual acts, threats and psychological coercion.",
      "Mary Monahan, a lead plaintiff in the case, called the jury award \"validation\" for her and the other women.",
      "\"For decades, I carried this trauma in silence, and today, a jury believed me. Believed us. That changes everything,\" she said in a statement. \"This verdict is more than a number \u2014 it's a declaration. We are not disposable. We are not liars. We are not collateral damage in someone else's power trip. The world knows now what we've always known: what he did was real.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 08:42:32 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump's aggressive use of tariffs has fueled concerns about the economy and roiled the stock market.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's barrage of \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on countries around the world this year has rattled consumers, businesses and investors. Although President Trump on Wednesday announced a 90-day pause on most of his new tariffs, he upped import duties on Chinese goods to 125% \u2014 escalating a conflict between the world's two largest economies.",
      "We asked you what questions you had about tariffs and answered some of those in a CBS News 24/7 special. Read on for some answers to your questions below.",
      "Are global tariffs legal, and have U.S. levies on other countries risen or fallen over the years?",
      "CBS MoneyWatch: Tariffs are legal under World Trade Organization rules, although participating countries must comply with certain restrictions and levies are generally capped.",
      "As a result, nations have long had the right to impose multilateral tariffs, although those costs vary widely based on trade agreements, product type and many other factors.",
      "In the 19th century, average U.S. tariff rates on trading partners routinely exceeded 30%. The government sharply reduced those levies after the Great Depression, cutting them to single digits. After resuming power in 2025, President Trump raised the effective U.S. tariff to 22% \u2014 the highest since 1909.",
      "For the Trump administration, are these massive tariffs intended to pressure other nations into more favorable trade deals, or is the goal to push American businesses to invest more in domestic manufacturing? Or both?",
      "Both, correct. These historically large tariffs have several main objectives. In the short term, the tariffs are intended to pressure countries to come to the table to negotiate what Mr. Trump sees as more favorable trade deals.",
      "Over the long term, Trump administration officials say that sharply raising U.S. tariffs will spur both domestic and foreign companies eager to avoid the added costs to expand here at home, creating jobs, reinvigorating manufacturers and boosting economic growth.",
      "President Trump has also long argued that global trade rules, enshrined in entities like the World Trade Organization, disdvantage the U.S. by, for example, permitting countries like China, Germany and Japan to subsidize key industries. He blames those rules for fueling large global trade imbalances that have saddled the U.S. with a large, and growing, trade deficit.",
      "Another goal of tariffs is to generate federal revenue \u2014 funds that Mr. Trump will likely need to offset additional tax cuts he has promised to Americans and to corporations.",
      "Why do some people oppose deploying tariffs against countries that impose tariffs on the U.S.?",
      "Most mainstream economists think the kind of sweeping tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump on nearly all U.S. imports act as a tax on businesses and consumers. Such levies raise the cost of many essential items, leading to higher prices for American households; depress economic growth; and could even trigger a recession.",
      "Under this view, a trade war in which countries jack up tariffs on their economic partners effectively makes them all poorer.",
      "By contrast, trade experts also say that targeted tariffs \u2014 implemented as but one element in a larger industrial strategy \u2014 can help protect critical U.S. industries and workers from unfair foreign competition.",
      "How do these tariffs impact consumers, especially when it comes to prices on everyday items like groceries or housewares?",
      "Tariffs are taxes paid by importers such as Walmart, which must pay the fees to the U.S.\u00a0 Customs and Border Protection when it accepts shipments at American ports. As a result, U.S. businesses typically pass on most or all of that cost to consumers through higher prices.",
      "For instance, after Mr. Trump added tariffs to imported washing machines during his first term, the median price of those appliances jumped more than 11%, tacking on about $86 to the cost of a new unit, according to University of Chicago researchers.",
      "While consumers can opt for U.S.-made merchandise, domestic manufacturers also may raise their prices due to tariffs. Sometimes that's due to an increase in the cost of imported goods they need to manufacture their products. But some companies also take the opportunity to hike prices because the newly expensive foreign-made products provide them with more pricing flexibility.",
      "Without Mr. Trump's pause, imported vegetables, fruit and nuts were set to rise by 19% due to the tariffs, according to a recent analysis from the Yale Budget Lab, a public policy think tank. That would have boosted prices for those foods by more than 6%, after adjusting for an expected 0.6% increase in the cost of the same items grown in the U.S.",
      "What's the long-term outlook \u2014 are these tariffs likely to strengthen the U.S. economy or just cause temporary disruption?",
      "Economists say Mr. Trump's tariffs have increased the risk that the U.S. and other nations could tumble into a recession in the next year. Because tariffs raise prices, Americans are expected to cut back on spending \u2014 a potentially major problem given that 70 cents of every $1 in the nation's gross domestic product is based on consumer spending.",
      "For instance, the tariffs could slow GDP growth to 1.4% in 2025, while core inflation could rise to 3.9% this year, according to an April 2 forecast from Oxford Economics. That would represent a significant slowdown from the economy's 2.8% growth rate in 2024.",
      "Other experts say leaving sharply higher U.S. tariffs in place could leave much deeper scars. GDP growth could fall by 0.6 percentage points over the next decade, the Yale Budget Lab estimated.",
      "What is the end goal for the Trump administration's tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump has said he believes tariffs will bring back manufacturing jobs. By making it more expensive to sell foreign-made goods in the U.S., the president wants to convince American and foreign companies to build factories here.",
      "But he's also highlighted other goals for his tariff barrage, such as convincing other nations to give more favorable trading terms to the U.S.",
      "Lastly, Mr. Trump has pointed to tariffs as a way to raise billions in revenue for the U.S. government, even though economists point out that tariffs are essentially a sales tax which are paid by American consumers.",
      "Does Mr. Trump really think he's going to be able to rebuild manufacturing in America again?",
      "Mr. Trump is adamant that tariffs can revive manufacturing in the U.S., which has been on the decline for at least half a century. Yet economists and other experts aren't so sure.",
      "There are several reasons for their skepticism. For one, building the types of factories and infrastructure to support the manufacturing that is now handled by other nations, such as China and Vietnam, would require years and billions in investment.",
      "The U.S. manufacturing sector has been shrinking for decades, so companies repatriating factories from abroad would struggle to find enough skilled workers, especially in technology and other areas higher up the industrial value chain",
      "And because of the uncertainty caused by Mr. Trump's tariffs, some businesses might not want to commit to such an investment given that the import duties might disappear or be sharply lowered \u2014 as they were today.",
      "What could happen to block the U.S. tariff increases?",
      "Several factors could halt the tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump, according to experts.",
      "First, Congress could introduce a resolution to terminate the emergency declaration used by Mr. Trump to issue the tariffs. Since both the Senate and House are controlled by Republicans, that would require several members of the GOP to join Democrats in voting against Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "But Mr. Trump would likely veto any such measure that reached his desk, which means that two-thirds of both chambers would need to vote in favor of the measure in order to make it veto-proof.",
      "Second, the courts could intervene and rule that Mr. Trump has exceeded his authority. Already, there has been a lawsuit filed by a small business in Florida that argues that Mr. Trump has overstepped by issuing the April 2 tariffs, and that the power should belong to Congress alone.",
      "Third, the violent reaction in financial markets that followed Mr. Trump's latest tariff salvo could persuade him to change course. His move on Wednesday to pause many of the tariffs followed a five-day plunge in stocks that put the S&P 500 on the verge of entering a bear market \u2014 when equities fall at least 20% from their most recent high.",
      "That steep decline in stock prices hurts tens of millions of Americans saving for retirement and could lead them to cut their spending, a big drag on economic growth.",

    "story": [
      "The stock market exploded higher on Wednesday to one of their best days in history after President Trump said he would place a 90-day pause on his \"reciprocal tariffs,\" adding that he would lower that rate to 10% for most countries effective immediately.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 2,963 points, or 7.9%, to close at 40,608, while the broad-based S&P 500 climbed 474 points, or 9.5%, to 5,457. The tech heavy-Nasdaq composite index jumped 1,857 points, or 12.2%.",
      "The S&P 500's gain was the biggest one-day increase since October 2008, according to financial services company Factset. The Nasdaq's gains were its\u00a0largest since 2001, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "One notable exception to Mr. Trump's decision is China, with the president saying he's increasing the tariff rate on goods imported from that nation to 125%.",
      "\"Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,\" he wrote.",
      "Prior to the announcement, the S&P 500 had been down about 17% from its mid-February peak, pushing stocks toward a bear market, or when shares fall more than 20% from their most recent high, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "Even with today's gain, the S&P 500 remains 11% below its February 19 peak of 6,147.",
      "Investors have been spooked by Mr. Trump's escalating trade war, which Wall Street economists warn could raise the risk of a recession and hurt U.S. corporations and consumers by hiking prices on products from almost every nation.",
      "Even before Mr. Trump's announcement, some on Wall Street had expressed optimism that the White House could back down from the latest tariffs, which slapped rates of between 10% to 84% on U.S. trade partners.",
      "Despite the pause, experts noted that uncertainty remains an issue for U.S. businesses, given that the tariffs could restart in 90 days and that the penalties on China \u2014 a major trading partner \u2014 are likely to dampen economic growth.",
      "\"Businesses will be relieved that the destination for trade policy looks like it could be less disruptive than seemed possible yesterday,\" said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank. \"Even so, the huge overhang of policy uncertainty will weigh on investment and weak decisions in the next few months.\"",
      "He noted, \"Also, 125% tariffs on Chinese imports will be a huge problem for many businesses if they stay in place.\"",
      "Best stock performers today",
      "The gains were widespread across the U.S. stock market, and 98% of the stocks in the S&P 500 index rallied.",
      "Among the best performers were tech stocks, including chipmaker Nvidia, which gained 18.7%, and Apple, which jumped more than 15%.",
      "Also leading the way were airlines and other stocks that depend on customers feeling confident enough to travel for work or for vacation. Delta Air Lines soared 23.4%, while American Airlines gained 22.6%.",
      "China trade war intensifies",
      "Still, the trade war continues between the U.S. and China continues to rage. On Wednesday, China said it is raising its tariffs on U.S. products to 84%, up from its previously announced 34%, after President Trump's import duties on Chinese good\u00a0went into effect\u00a0today at a rate of 104%. The retaliation signals Beijing isn't backing down from Mr. Trump's global trade war.",
      "Mr. Trump's broad-based \"reciprocal tariffs,\" which apply to imports of almost every nation, had kicked in after midnight Eastern time in the U.S.",
      "Already, there are signs that some corporations are feeling the impact of Mr. Trump's tariff policies, with Delta on Wednesday pulling its guidance for 2025 as the trade war depresses bookings across the travel sector.",
      "\"With broad economic uncertainty around global trade, growth has largely stalled,\" CEO Ed Bastian said in a statement on Wednesday. \"In this slower-growth environment, we are protecting margins and cash flow by focusing on what we can control.\"",
      "With corporate earnings season starting in the U.S., investors will be carefully watching the guidance from large companies such as Delta. On Wednesday, Walmart said it is standing behind its full-year sales and operating income outlook even amidst the growing trade war.",
      "The nation's largest retailer said that it expects first-quarter sales growth of 3% to 4%, but added that its range of outcomes has \"widened due to less favorable category mix\" and \"the desire to maintain flexibility to invest in price as tariffs are implemented.\"",

    "story": [
      "An Alabama teen who narrowly survived a fierce shark attack last year said she hopes a proposed alert system before state lawmakers can help keep others safe in the water.",
      "Lulu Gribbin, now 16, was one of three people bitten by a shark on June 7, 2024, during a string of attacks off the Florida Panhandle. She lost her left hand and a portion of her leg. On Wednesday, she asked Alabama lawmakers to support a proposed shark attack alert system.",
      "The bill by Republican Rep. David Faulkner would establish an alert system, similar to the Amber Alert system, that would issue a notice to the public when there's been an unprovoked shark attack in the vicinity.",
      "\"Ninety minutes before me, there was another shark attack a couple miles down the coast,\" Gribbin said. Had she known about that attack, she and her friend would not have ventured into the water that day, she said. \"This bill will help prevent future attacks and accidents.\"",
      "The Alabama House Public Safety and Homeland Security Committee advanced the bill Wednesday. It now moves to the full Alabama House of Representatives.",
      "Gribbin and her friend had been diving for sand dollars before the attack. They were riding the waves back to the beach when her friend screamed, \"shark!\"",
      "\"I saw a big shadow, but we all just started swimming for our lives,\" She recalled. She said she tried to remain calm, remembering that sharks were supposed to be attracted to frantic motion. Then the shark attacked her and her friend.",
      "\"My hand was bitten first. I remember just lifting it out of the water, and I was stunned because there was no hand there. I couldn't feel it because of all the shock I was in. Then the shark latched onto my leg,\" she recalled.",
      "A man she describes as a hero ran to pull her from the water. She blacked out and came to on the shore where a doctor and other medical workers, who were on the beach that day, rushed to save her. \"I remember being focused just to keep my eyes open and to breathe, to just be able to make it to the hospital,\" she said.",
      "CBS affiliate WIAT reported she was flown to Sacred Heart Hospital in Pensacola where her mom said the first words she spoke after the breathing tube was removed were \"I made it.\"",
      "The station reported Gribbin shared last month what she meant by that expression: \"Through the pain, agony, sorrow and grief I made it,\" she said.",
      "Her lengthy recovery has been documented on social media. As she visited the Alabama Statehouse, people frequently stopped to ask for photographs and to tell her that her story has been an inspiration.",
      "Sharks commonly found but attacks are rare",
      "While sharks are commonly found in the waters off Alabama and Florida, shark attacks are rare, said Gavin Naylor, director of the Florida Museum of Natural History's shark research program. He said there are between 50 and 90 unprovoked bites around the world each year. And a trio of bites in a single day in close proximity is extremely rare, he said.",
      "He said, generally speaking, the data shows that one shark bite does not increase the likelihood of another happening soon. However, Naylor said weather conditions that day likely brought an abundance of small fish closer to shore.",
      "\"The bait fish were very close into shore along that same beach and sharks were following them. But on any day in Alabama, you can see 20 or 30 bull sharks 400 meters offshore, but they just don't interact with the public because they are much farther away,\" Naylor said.",
      "Naylor noted that rip currents kill far more people than sharks each year. Four people were killed worldwide in shark attacks last year. The U.S. Lifesaving Association estimated there are about 100 deaths each year in the U.S. from rip currents.",
      "A database run by the Florida Museum of Natural History and the University of Florida showed that shark attacks decreased dramatically in 2024 and was far below the annual average.\u00a0 Half of U.S. attacks took place in\u00a0Florida last year, continuing a yearly trend.",
      "While the proposal would only impact the Alabama coast, Faulkner hopes other states will pursue similar systems or that federal legislation would expand its use.",
      "\"There had been a shark attack just down the beach, and yet she had no notice. And I felt like in this day and age, that's something we shouldn't let happen,\" Faulkner said.",
      "The bill, which would name the alert system for Gribbin, was changed to issue an alert only when an unprovoked attack occurred off the coast.",
      "An earlier version would have allowed an alert for an \"imminent danger\" from sharks. There were concerns from beach communities that language was too vague and could lead to an excessive alerts, causing panic and potentially hurting the tourism industry.",
      "Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey on Wednesday urged lawmakers to approve the legislation, saying it will be an \"added tool\" to keep people safe, calling the teen \"an inspiration and an awesome example of courage.\"",
      "Gribbin also launched the Lulu Strong Foundation, WIAT reported, and she wants to help amputees get prosthetics faster, and to make them lighter.",
      "\"Through my foundation I would love to have kids be able to experience what I've experienced and have just an amazing life an amputee,\" she said.",

      "Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic \u2014 Rescue crews in the Dominican Republic dug through the remains of a legendary nightclub Thursday whose roof collapsed earlier this week, killing at least 221 people, but hopes of finding survivors were slim.",
      "Meanwhile, dozens of people in the capital of Santo Domingo were still searching for their loved ones and growing frustrated that they weren't getting any answers after visiting hospitals and the country's forensic institute.",
      "Doctors warned that some of the two dozen patients who remained hospitalized were still not in the clear, especially the eight who were in critical condition.",
      "\"If the trauma is too great, there's not a lot of time\" left to save patients in that condition, said Health Minister Dr. V\u00edctor Atallah.",
      "He and other doctors said injuries include fractures of the skull, femur and pelvis caused by cement slabs falling on people attending a merengue concert at the Jet Set nightclub in Santo Domingo. More than 200 were injured.",
      "The government said Wednesday night that it was moving to a recovery phase focused on finding bodies, but Juan Manuel M\u00e9ndez, director of the Center of Emergency Operations, said crews at the scene were still looking for victims and potential survivors, though no one has been found alive since Tuesday afternoon.",
      "\"We're not going to abandon anyone. Our work will continue,\" he said.",
      "Names of victims emerging",
      "The legendary club was packed with musicians, professional athletes and government officials when dust began falling from the ceiling and into people's drinks early Tuesday. Minutes later, the roof collapsed.",
      "Victims include merengue icon Rubby P\u00e9rez, who'd been singing to the crowd before the roof fell; former MLB players Octavio Dotel and Tony Enrique Blanco Cabrera; and Nelsy Cruz, the governor of the northwestern province of Montecristi whose brother is seven-time Major League Baseball All-Star Nelson Cruz.",
      "Also killed were a retired United Nations official; saxophonist Luis Sol\u00eds, who was playing onstage when the roof fell; New York-based fashion designer Mart\u00edn Polanco; the son and daughter-in-law of the minister of public works; the brother of the vice minister of the Ministry of Youth; and three employees of Grupo Popular, a financial services company, including the president of AFP Popular Bank and his wife.",
      "Randolfo Rijo G\u00f3mez, director of the country's 911 system, said it received more than 100 calls, including several from people buried under the rubble. He noted that police arrived at the scene in 90 seconds, followed minutes later by first response units. In less than half an hour, 25 soldiers, seven fire brigades and 77 ambulances were activated, he said.",
      "Crews used dogs and thermal cameras to search for victims and rescued 145 survivors from the rubble, authorities said.",
      "Attention to turn soon to probing collapse's cause",
      "It wasn't immediately clear what caused the roof to collapse, or when the Jet Set building was last inspected.",
      "The government said late Wednesday that once the recovery phase ends, it will launch a thorough investigation.",
      "The club issued a statement saying it was cooperating with authorities. A spokesperson for the family that owns the club told The Associated Press that she passed along questions about potential inspections.",
      "Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Public Works referred questions to the mayor's office. A spokesperson for the mayor's office didn't respond to a request for comment.",

    "summary": "Bridget Brink's resignation comes at a pivotal moment for U.S.-Ukraine relations.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink intends to resign from her post early, three sources told CBS News.",
      "The State Department confirmed her intent to step down\u00a0Thursday afternoon.",
      "\"Ambassador Brink is stepping down. She's been the ambassador there for three years \u2013 that's a long time in a war zone. And frankly, the war has gone on for far too long,\" a State Department spokesperson said in a statement. \"The real issue is whether the Russians and Ukrainians are ready to do what's necessary to end this war.\"",
      "Brink has not formally submitted resignation papers but she has been making farewell calls to colleagues, sources said.",
      "Ambassador Brink has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "One senior U.S. official told CBS that her resignation stems from an unusual mix of personal and policy concerns, including the recent USAID layoffs. Brink is serving in a war zone far from her family, since Kyiv is designated as an unaccompanied post, where officers serve without bringing their families with them.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio intended to keep Brink, a career foreign service officer, in the job and declined the initial resignation she had submitted in January as part of the standard turnover between administrations.",
      "Brink's resignation comes at a pivotal moment for U.S.-Ukraine relations. The Trump administration has tried to broker an end to the Russian invasion in part by ending the policy of diplomatically isolating Vladimir Putin, who invaded Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "While Ukraine accepted a U.S. ceasefire proposal, Russia has not. It is not clear whether President Trump has set any deadline for conclusion of the diplomacy, but he's continuing to have special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff at the fore of outreach to Russia.",
      "At NATO meeting last week, Rubio indicated U.S. patience with Russia was wearing thin.",
      "\"We will know soon enough, in a matter of weeks, not months, whether Russia is serious about peace or not. I hope they are,\" Rubio said on April 4.",
      "Mr. Trump's longtime fascination with Putin and frustration with Ukraine's Zelenskyy has complicated the diplomacy, and prompted concern from Western allies.",
      "His distrust of Zelenskyy was visible in an explosive Oval Office confrontation in February. Mr. Trump told Zelenskyy to reach a ceasefire agreement with Russia or \"we're out,\" and Vice President JD Vance accused the Ukrainian president of being \"disrespectful\" after he challenged the vice president's assertion that the war had dragged on because of a lack of diplomacy from Ukraine and the Biden administration. Vice President JD Vance also admonished Zelensky: \"Have you said 'thank you' once, this entire meeting?\"",
      "The Trump administration subsequently paused military and intelligence aid to Ukraine amid the fallout. That intelligence support resumed once Ukraine agreed to go along with the Trump administration's outreach to Putin. Mr. Trump continues to sit on the nearly $4 billion in remaining U.S. military aid already designated for Ukraine. The U.S. has been a key supplier of weapons since the Russian invasion began.",
      "Margaret Brennan is moderator of \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on CBS. Based in Washington, D.C., Brennan is also the Network's chief foreign affairs correspondent and a contributing correspondent to 60 Minutes. Additionally, she appears regularly on the \"CBS Evening News,\" leading coverage from Washington when news breaks on the political and foreign affairs fronts."

    "story": [
      "Russia released Ksenia Karelina, a dual U.S.-Russian national who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for treason in August last year, in a new prison swap on Thursday. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed her release in a social media post early Thursday, but offered no information about the terms of her release.",
      "The Wall Street Journal first reported\u00a0Karelina's release, saying she was freed in a swap arranged by the two countries' intelligence agencies, and a CIA official later told CBS News that the agency had played a central role in the deal on behalf of the U.S. government.",
      "\"American Ksenia Karelina is on a plane back home to the United States,\" Rubio said in his post. \"She was wrongfully detained by Russia for over a year and President Trump secured her release.\"",
      "In a statement first published by the Journal and later provided to CBS News, CIA Director John Ratcliffe said, \"President Trump brought home another wrongfully detained American from Russia,\" and added his praise for \"the CIA officers who worked tirelessly to support this effort\" and for the United Arab Emirate of Abu Dhabi, which he said had enabled the exchange. The swap of the two detainees was carried out in Abu Dhabi.",
      "Ratcliffe was directly involved in the negotiations, which he conducted with an unnamed senior Russian intelligence official, the CIA said.",
      "The top level communication indicates a deepening of efforts by the Trump administration to improve ties with Moscow. Mr. Trump has been pushing both Russia and Ukraine to negotiate a peace agreement to end the three-year war sparked by Russia's ongoing full-scale invasion of its neighbor.",
      "In exchange for Karelina, who lives in California, the CIA official confirmed that the U.S. had freed Arthur Petrov, a German-Russian national arrested in Cyprus 2023 at the request of U.S. authorities. According to the Journal, he was being held on allegations of exporting sensitive microelectronics.",
      "\"Much of the swap was negotiated by the U.S. government, with CIA playing a key role engaging with Russian intelligence,\" a CIA spokesperson said Thursday, adding, \"The exchange shows the importance of keeping lines of communication open with Russia, despite the deep challenges in our bilateral relationship.\"",

      "Her lawyers said she acknowledged transferring the funds, though she did not admit she intentionally directed them to organizations that might have used the money for actions against Russia. She didn't expect that her donation would end up supporting anti-Russian activities, according to her lawyers.",
      "Karelina's boyfriend, Chris Van Heerden, told CBS News last year that she had made the small donation in 2022, \"exercising her First Amendment rights,\" adding that \"she has done nothing wrong.\"",
      "Van Heerden said he was uneasy about Karelina's decision to return to Russia for a visit, given the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, but he said she \"had no worry in the world,\" and that she had assured him it would be safe since she was entering the country as a dual American-Russian citizen.",
      "\"She wanted to go home. She made it very clear that she wanted to go home,\" Van Heerden told Gayle King on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Wanting to fulfill her wish to visit home, Van Heerden said he bought her a plane ticket as a birthday gift, and the pair first traveled together to Istanbul. He had originally intended to travel with her to Russia from there, but he didn't feel comfortable, so she traveled alone to Russia, and he returned to Los Angeles.",
      "Russia imprisoned a number of Americans as tension with Washington soared amid the build up to, and eventually the full-scale war in Ukraine. Paul Whelan, Wall Street Journal reporter\u00a0Evan Gershkovich\u00a0and teacher\u00a0Marc Fogel\u00a0were all designated wrongfully detained like Karelina and freed in previous prisoner swaps with Moscow.",
      "Among the U.S. nationals still jailed in Russia is U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Gordon Black, whose three-year, nine-month prison sentence for robbing and threatening his Russian girlfriend was reduced earlier this week by seven months by a Russian court.",

      "\"China's position is clear and consistent: the door to talks is open, but dialogue must be conducted on an equal basis with mutual respect,\" Commerce Ministry spokeswoman He Yongqian said. \"China will stand by its position until the end.

      "\"The remains of three children not older than 4 years were found on three sides of the altar,\" Paiz told The Associated Press.",
      "\"The Teotihuacan were traders who traveled all over the country (Guatemala),\" Paiz said. \"The Teotihuacan residential complexes were houses with rooms and in the center altars; that's what the residence that was found is like, with an altar with the figure representing the Storm Goddess.\"",

      "Rom\u00e1n said the discovery also reinforces the idea that Tikal was a cosmopolitan center at that time, a place where people visited from other cultures, affirming its importance as a center of cultural convergence.",
      "Mar\u00eda Bel\u00e9n M\u00e9ndez, an archaeologist who was not involved with the project, said the discovery confirms \"that there has been an interconnection between both cultures and what their relationships with their gods and celestial bodies was like.\"",
      "\"We see how the issue of sacrifice exists in both cultures. It was a practice; it's not that they were violent, it was their way of connecting with the celestial bodies,\" she said.",
      "The altar is just over a yard wide from east to west and about 2 yards from north to south. It is about a yard tall and covered with limestone.",

    "summary": "Trump hit Europe with 20% tariffs, but a Virginia wholesaler says Americans could see 30% price hikes on some wines, and even U.S. producers face higher costs.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Producers and importers of alcoholic beverages say President Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs will hit many American drinkers right in the wallet, with price hikes on some favored tipples even exceeding the rates of the levies he's imposed.",
      "On April 2, Mr. Trump announced what he called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on virtually every nation the U.S. does trade with. Despite stock markets around the globe descending into tumult and economists warning for months that it will be consumers who pay the price for the levies, Mr. Trump has not backed down, insisting the measures will help the U.S. balance its trade deficit with other nations in the longer term.",
      "But in the near term, many Americans' adult beverages of choice, including European wines and Scotch whisky, are likely to come at more of a premium, according to industry insiders.",
      "Bartholomew Broadbent, who owns the Virginia-based wine wholesaler and importer Broadbent Selections, warned the impact on retail prices in the U.S. is going to be \"a lot worse than people think.\"",
      "French wines, as an example, will be subject to 20% tariffs under the measures announced by Mr. Trump. But Broadbent told CBS News the real-world price increase will be closer to 30%, because the cost of the tariff will be compounded at every stage of a bottle or crate's journey to a store shelf \u2014 with producers in France and other nations, along with importers like himself and then distributors and retailers all adding their own mark-ups.",
      "\"The price is going to have to go up,\" he said.",
      "In real terms, Broadbent estimated that the retail price on a bottle of wine that currently sells for $9.99 could go up to $13 or $14.",
      "Broadbent, whose company imports wines from 11 different countries and it also works with wineries in California, said more than 80% of his business will now face new tariffs. Wines from South Africa will be the most heavily impacted, he said, as the White House has hit the country with a steep 30% tariff.",
      "\"I don't see a single person who can benefit from this,\" Broadbent said. \"Even the wineries in America will suffer badly because they're all buying barrels and corks from Europe.\"",
      "The tariffs sent shockwaves through the global wine industry, with France's Bourgogne Wine Board (BIVB) warning the levies risked \"pushing our wines past a psychological price threshold.\"",
      "Bourgogne \u2014 or the Burgundy region as it's known in English \u2014 exported nearly 21 million bottles of wine to the U.S. in 2024, according to the BIVB, which agreed with the assessment that Mr. Trump's tariffs will have a negative impact on everyone, from French exporters and their distributor partners to American consumers.",
      "\"The industry deeply regrets this decision,\" the BIVB said in a press release",
      "The people who make, sell and enjoy Scotland's world renowned distilled spirits are also staring down the barrel of Mr. Trump's tariffs. Last year alone, about 132 million bottles of Scotch whisky were imported into the U.S. market, according to the Scotch Whisky Association.",
      "The mood in Scotland is one of \"frustration and uncertainty,\" according to Drew McKenzie Smith, who founded and runs the Lindores Abbey Distillery just north of Edinburgh.",
      "McKenzie Smith estimated that the 10% baseline tariff Mr. Trump imposed on the U.K. would see the price of a bottle of his Scotch hiked by about the same amount for American consumers. So a bottle that currently costs $60 will soon jump to $66, be believes.",
      "While that \"may not sound severe,\" McKenzie Smith told CBS News, \"it still adds a meaningful burden \u2014 especially for smaller producers like us.\"",
      "He said while larger Scotch whisky brands may be able to offset costs across multiple markets, but for smaller distilleries, the tariffs could mean devastation.",

    "summary": "The area around Kanlaon Volcano in the Philippines was still under evacuation orders from an eruption in December\u200b.",
    "story": [
      "A volcano in the central Philippines erupted early Tuesday morning, sending a plume of ash about 2.5 miles into the sky and forcing authorities to suspend school in four villages due to ashfall.",
      "The area on the island of Negros around Kanlaon Volcano, one of 24 active volcanoes in the Southeast Asian nation, was still under evacuation orders from an eruption in December.",
      "There were no reports of injuries or damage from Tuesday's eruption that scattered ash in at least four farming villages, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said.",
      "The agency said in a statement that the \"explosive eruption\" started at 5:51 a.m. local time.",
      "The volcano produced \"a voluminous bent plume approximately 4,000 meters tall that is drifting southwest,\" it said.",
      "The eruption stopped at 6:47 a.m. (6:47 p.m. EDT Monday), the institute reported later.",
      "Videos posted on social media showed a wide, billowing plume of smoke slowly stretching into the sky.",
      "\"We were prepared for the eruption. The families within the 4 to 6 kilometers (about 2.5 miles to about 3.7 miles) were already evacuated during the previous eruption last December,\" John De Asis, a rescue official in Negros Occidental province's La Castellana municipality, told French news agency AFP.",
      "Channel Nicor, 22, said she was waiting for a bus to take her to school when the eruption struck.",
      "\"The sound seemed like a big rock had fallen from a high place, then I looked up and saw the (ash cloud) getting bigger and bigger from the volcano,\" she told AFP.",
      "\"When I saw the ash of course I felt nervous, but not as nervous as the previous eruption, because this time we know what to do,\" she said.",
      "The level three alert \u2014 out of a scale of five \u2014 put in place during December's eruption, remained unchanged.",
      "Ben Edwards, a professor of geosciences at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania, said on \"CBS Evening News Plus\" Monday that eruptions around the world are almost daily occurrences.",
      "\"The Earth is made of tectonic plates, and at the edges of the plates are where all the activity happens mostly, that's where there are earthquakes, that's where there are volcanoes and other things, and so in a general sense, all of that activity is related to the fact that we live on a active planet where literally the surface of the planet under your feet is moving essentially every day, but very, very slowly,\" Edwards said.",
      "In September, hundreds of nearby residents were evacuated after Kanlaon spurted thousands of tons of harmful gases in a single day.",
      "In 1996, three hikers were killed near the peak and several others were later rescued when Kanlaon erupted without warning, officials said then.",
      "Where is Kanlaon Volcano located in the Philippines?",
      "The volcano is located in the central part of the Philippines, which is in the Pacific \"Ring of Fire,\" a region prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The archipelago is also lashed by about 20 typhoons and storms a year, making it one of the world's most disaster-prone countries.",

    "summary": "President Trump said he will slap more tariffs on imports from China if it doesn't withdraw a retaliatory tariff on U.S. products. Beijing bristled at his latest threat.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday said the U.S. will apply an additional 50% tariff on imports from China if the Asian nation doesn't withdraw its plan to impose a retaliatory\u00a034% import fee on American products.",
      "In a post on his Truth Social app, Mr. Trump said \"any country that Retaliates against the U.S. by issuing additional Tariffs, above and beyond their already existing long term Tariff abuse of our Nation, will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs, over and above those initially set.\"",
      "He added, \"Therefore, if China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th.\"",

      "China's commerce ministry vowed Tuesday that Beijing would \"fight to the end\" and take countermeasures against the U.S. if the president doesn't back away from his latest threat.",
      "On April 2, Mr. Trump announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations, adding to a 10% global tax applied to all products shipped to the U.S. Describing the announcement as \"Liberation Day,\" the president said the\u00a0new taxes\u00a0are needed to erase trade imbalances between the U.S. and other countries, ranging from China to members of the European Union.",
      "In response to Mr. Trump's imposition of a 34% tariff on Chinese imports, which is set to go into effect on April 9, Beijing last week announced it would add a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products beginning April 10.",
      "If Mr. Trump implements his plans, U.S. tariffs on imports from China would reach a combined 104%. The new taxes would be on top of 20% tariffs aimed at spurring China to crack down on fentanyl trafficking and his separate 34% tariffs announced last week.",
      "Last year, the U.S. imported about $439 billion worth of goods from China, ranging from Apple iPhones to clothing, according to data from the U.S. Trade Representative.",
      "Excluding the threat of an added 50% levy on Chinese imports, American consumers could face higher costs of about $3,789 per year due to the previously announced tariffs, according to an analysis from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "Consumers generally bear the brunt of tariffs because importers like Walmart, which must pay the import duties when they accept shipments from other nations, typically seek to spread all or most of the cost through higher price tags on imported goods. Because of those dynamics, many economists say inflation is likely to reignite this year.",
      "Wall Street has been spooked by Mr. Trump's growing trade war, with economists warning that the conflict could slam economic growth and even potentially trigger a recession.",
      "In his social media post threatening to add new tariffs to China, Mr. Trump added that he plans to start negotiations with other nations \"immediately.\"",
      "In a separate Truth Social post on Monday, Mr. Trump also said he spoke with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to start trade negotiations. He complained, \"they have treated the U.S. very poorly on Trade\" and \"they don't take our cars, but we take MILLIONS of theirs.\"",
      "White House trade adviser Peter Navarro suggested countries would need to do much more than simply lower their own tariff rates to reach deals, saying they would have to make structural changes to their tax and regulatory codes.",
      "\"Let's take Vietnam,\" he said on CNBC. \"When they come to us and say, 'We'll go to zero tariffs,' that means nothing to us because it's the non-tariff cheating that matters.\"",

      "Investors have panned President Trump's tariffs, saying they are likely to hit U.S. economic growth and drive up inflation. Goldman Sachs economists cited the barrage of levies on Monday in raising the odds of a recession to 45%.",
      "\"The combination of larger tariffs, greater policy uncertainty, declining business and consumer confidence, and messaging from the administration indicating greater willingness to tolerate near-term economic weakness in pursuit of its policies increase downside risk,\" Goldman analysts said in a report.",
      "Stocks plummeted last week after Mr. Trump on April 2 announced a 10% global duty on all U.S. imports and \"reciprocal\" tariffs on nearly 90 countries. The new trade measures sent markets into a tailspin, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq recording their biggest two-day drop since March 2020.",
      "Overseas stock markets also suffered steep losses Monday, continuing their skid from last week. Hong Kong's Hang Seng plunged 13.2% \u2014 its steepest drop since the 1997 Asian financial crisis, while Taiwan's Taiex fell 9.7%, its heaviest loss on record. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index tumbled 7.8%, the Shanghai Composite index sank 7.3%, South Korea's Kospi dropped 5.6% and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 declined 4.2%.",
      "In Europe, Germany's DAX index ended the day down 4.8%, Paris' CAC 40 shed 4.8%, and Britain's FTSE 100 lost 4.4%.",

      "The study, led by The Lundquist Institute for Biomedical Innovation at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in collaboration with researchers across multiple institutes, assessed 100 participants following a long-term keto diet who developed elevated levels of LDL cholesterol (known as the \"bad\" type).",
      "Other than the elevated cholesterol, all participants were \"metabolically healthy\" and had followed the key diet for an average of five years, according to an April 7 press release.",
      "HEART DISEASE RISK HIGHER FOR WOMEN WHO HAVE THESE UNHEALTHY LIFESTYLE HABITS",
      "They all qualified as LMHR (lean mass hyper-responder), which indicates people who adopt a carbohydrate-restricted diet and experience a significant rise in cholesterol.",
      "High cholesterol has long gotten a bad rap for causing poor heart health \u2014 but a new study suggests that the low-carb ketogenic diet may not be linked to cardiovascular disease. (iStock)",
      "Using advanced cardiac imaging, the researchers found that traditional cholesterol markers (ApoB and LDL-C) were not associated with changes in plaque levels in the heart\u2019s arteries or with baseline heart disease over a one-year period.",
      "Instead, existing plaque levels seemed to be a better predictor of future plaque accumulation.",
      "\"This population of people \u2014 metabolically healthy with elevated LDL due to being in ketosis \u2014 are not automatically at increased cardiac risk simply because their LDL is elevated,\" Bret Scher, MD, medical director of Baszucki Group, which provided funding for the study, told Fox News Digital.",
      "'I'M A HEART SURGEON AND THIS IS WHAT I COOK FOR DINNER'",
      "\"Therefore, we should likely shift away from LDL and ApoB and toward vascular imaging with CAC or CTA for better risk prediction and informing how or if to treat someone's cardiac risk factors,\" added the California-based doctor.",

      "Using advanced cardiac imaging, the researchers found that traditional cholesterol markers (ApoB and LDL-C) were not associated with changes in plaque levels in the heart\u2019s arteries or with baseline heart disease over a one-year period. (iStock)",

      "Dr. Nick Norwitz, a study leader and independent researcher at the University of Oxford, noted that this is the first study to isolate very high LDL and ApoB as risk factors for heart disease.",

      "This is the first prospective trial of its kind in a unique population often labeled \u2018high-risk\u2019 by traditional guidelines, one doctor said, raising important questions about how cardiovascular risk is assessed in the context of low-carb, high-fat diets. (iStock)",
      "According to Norwitz, cardiac imaging, including a CAC score, has \"far more value\" than cholesterol levels in predicting plaque progression.",
      "\"Thus, CAC scores can be used to risk-stratify patients and help individualize care,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "Scher noted that \"ketogenic therapy\" can be effective in treating certain metabolic-related conditions, but some people are afraid of continuing a keto diet because of their cholesterol.",
      "\"This study provides support that they do not necessarily need to stop the diet or treat their cholesterol \u2014 rather, they can work with their healthcare team for a more individualized and appropriate cardiac workup,\" he advised.",
      "Raising important questions",
      "Dr. Ken Berry, a family physician and\u00a0diabetes specialist in Tennessee, was not involved in the research but shared his thoughts on what he described as a \"groundbreaking\" study.",
      "\"The study found no association between LDL-C, ApoB and progression of coronary plaque over one year using high-resolution CT angiography,\" he said to Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Instead, the strongest predictor of plaque progression was pre-existing plaque, not cholesterol levels \u2014 leading researchers to conclude that \u2018plaque begets plaque, ApoB does not.\u2019\"",

      "Potential study limitations",

      "FIRST ON FOX: A Trump administration official confirmed Thursday that states failing to comply with federal orders to house inmates based on their biological sex can expect \"imminent changes\" \u2013 and Maine \"will not be the last\" state to have prison funds slashed.",
      "While the Trump administration's decision to pull federal funding from Maine\u2019s Department of Corrections due to a transgender inmate being housed in a women\u2019s facility is not an isolated case, similar situations involving transgender inmates in female facilities have occurred across the country.",
      "In addition to Maine, California, New York, Minnesota, New Jersey and Washington state allow transgender people to be housed in jail and prison facilities that align with their gender identity. Most provide transgender treatments on the taxpayer dime or through other sources of state funding, though it may vary from prison to prison. Following a consent decree, Colorado is the only state to have housing facilities specific for transgender people.",

      "The official, who declined to be identified, explained that while much of prison funding is handled at the state level, states still must comply with their own versions of the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA), which is often modeled after federal standards. As federal changes to those regulations are expected, current PREA guidelines discourage housing inmates in isolation. That, the spokesperson said, has led some states to feel obligated to house transgender women in female facilities, even if they might prefer to create separate spaces.",
      "\"I think that that's a state call. But, right now, states are really not encouraged to make that call,\" the official said. \"They're encouraged to put those men with women. So, I think some states will just put these men dressed as women, with the men. Some of them will put them in some sort of separate space. I have no opinion on which is better.\"",
      "Prior to Trump's executive order prohibiting trans procedures and treatments in federal prisons, federal funding was allotted to some Bureau of Prisons facilities to cover cosmetic procedures and treatments that were considered \"gender-affirming\" for incarcerated men \u2013 but not provided to women \u2013 such as laser hair removal and other feminine procedures. Guidelines for such services were first earmarked under the Obama administration's second term, and California was the first state to establish policies granting transgender surgeries to state prison inmates in 2017.",

Balcer was convicted in 2018 of stabbing both parents to death, along with the family dog, and was sentenced to 40 years in prison for a crime that was attributed to struggles with gender identity.",

In court testimony, Moore frequently referenced \"Nikki,\" claiming prison wardens promised gender reassignment surgery, feminine cosmetics, and transfer to a women\u2019s facility. Moore also described a regimen of daily cross-sex hormone treatments and Vitamin B-12 injections.",

      "As of February, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) houses 2,198 transgender inmates, including 22 transgender women currently serving sentences in women\u2019s facilities. This figure does not account for state-level facilities, which may also receive federal funding.",

      "In February, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth \u2013 a Reagan-appointed judge \u2013 temporarily blocked the transfer of three transgender women to men's prisons, citing concerns over their safety. Later that month, another judge issued a restraining order preventing the transfer of a transgender woman from a women's prison to a men's facility.

      "Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, is introducing legislation that would allow American victims of terror groups to hold the organizations that fund those groups accountable in a court of law. The Texas Republican is reintroducing the Limiting Immunity for Assisting Backers of Lethal Extremism (LIABLE) Act, which is similar to a bill he introduced during the last Congress. That version had the backing of then-Sen. Marco Rubio.",
      "As of now, Americans are able to sue foreign governments in specific cases outlined in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), but they are unable to sue international organizations, which enjoy immunity under the International Organization Immunities Act (IOIA).

      "\"UNRWA has knowingly provided salaries and materials to Hamas for decades. That support enabled Hamas to arm itself, create its vast underground terrorist infrastructure, and launch its October 7th atrocities on Israel,\" Cruz said in a statement on the original piece of legislation introduced in 2024. \"That attack included the murder and kidnapping of dozens of Americans. The victims and their families deserve the ability to hold UNRWA accountable in court for its support of Hamas and for what happened on October 7th.\"",
      "The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) is a major target of this legislation. UNRWA has faced accusations of aiding Hamas before, during and after the terror group carried out its Oct. 7 massacre. In August 2024, the agency fired nine workers who were allegedly involved in the attacks, which left 1,200 dead and 251 taken hostage.",
      "\"The legislation is premised on a false narrative that was debunked more than a year ago by the U.S. National Intelligence Council, which confirmed that UNRWA is not aligned in any way with Hamas,\" William Deere, Director of UNRWA's Representative Office in Washington, told Fox News Digital.",
      "Fox News Digital did not provide Deere with a copy of the updated legislation and used the 2024 bill as a reference in its request for comment.",
      "\"The report also noted that Israeli dislike of UNRWA serves to mischaracterize its assessments of the agency resulting in distortions.

      "Imagine receiving a notification about suspicious charges on a credit card you haven\u2019t even received yet. How could that happen?",
      "While it sounds surprising and unsettling, it's increasingly common due to the rise of digital credit card fraud. Criminals no longer need physical cards to make unauthorized transactions, thanks to methods such as data breaches, phishing schemes and card-not-present fraud.",
      "Here's how these schemes work and what steps you should take immediately to protect yourself.",
      "STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS \u2013 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S \u2018THE CYBERGUY REPORT\u2019 NOW",
      "Illustration of a crook stealing credit card info (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How it happens",
      "Even if a new credit card hasn\u2019t arrived yet, it may already be vulnerable. In many cases, the issue isn\u2019t about the card being physically stolen but about someone gaining access to your information digitally. Criminals can exploit online account features, mobile wallets or leaked personal data to start using your card before you\u2019ve even opened the envelope. Below are some of the most common ways this type of fraud happens.",
      "If a scammer already has access to your account, either through stolen login credentials, a hacked email or\u00a0malware, they can view the newly issued card number in the online dashboard or mobile app. Many credit card companies now allow instant access to digital card numbers for use in Apple Pay, Google Wallet or online purchases. This means that as soon as a new card is issued, it may be visible digitally before the physical card is even shipped. If a fraudster has access to your account, they can add the number to a digital wallet and begin spending before the envelope ever hits your mailbox.",
      "Some card issuers allow you to add your credit card to mobile wallets instantly, even before the physical card arrives. While this feature is convenient, it can also expose you to specific security risks tied to mobile wallet activation. Criminals may exploit this process by using stolen personal information to bypass security checks and add your card to their own Apple Pay or Google Wallet accounts. They might pose as you to request a new card, intercept or reroute the digital activation process, or even start making fraudulent purchases immediately. This type of fraud can be hard to detect, especially if you're not expecting a new card or if unauthorized charges blend in with legitimate transactions.",
      "Illustration of someone using their digital wallet (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THIS IS HOW TO PROTECT YOUR CREDIT AND BANK CARDS FROM GETTING HACKED",
      "Another common scenario involves your personal information being compromised in a\u00a0phishing attack or large-scale\u00a0data breach. Thieves use this stolen data, such as your name, Social Security number, address and security question answers, to impersonate you and gain access to your account dashboard or reset login credentials. Once inside, they can retrieve new card details directly from the source or request a replacement card. Phishing scams often trick victims into revealing sensitive information through fake emails or websites, while data breaches expose vast amounts of personal data that criminals can exploit for fraudulent activities.",
      "Although charges made before a new credit card is received are rarely due to mail theft, this type of traditional fraud still poses a risk. Criminals may intercept your mail to steal sensitive documents, including credit cards, which can then be used for unauthorized purchases. To reduce this risk, avoid leaving important mail unattended in your mailbox. Consider using\u00a0Informed Delivery by USPS to track incoming mail or request that your credit card be delivered to a secure location, such as a P.O. box or directly to your bank branch.",

Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "2.

To protect yourself, install strong antivirus software on all your devices.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Enable multifactor authentication (MFA): Add\u00a0MFA to all accounts tied to your financial information. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second verification step (e.g., a code sent to your phone) before accessing sensitive accounts.",

      "4.\u00a0Use an identity theft protection service:\u00a0Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "5. Invest in personal data removal services: Consider using a personal data removal service to reduce your online exposure. These services continuously monitor and remove your sensitive information from data brokers and websites that could be exploited by criminals. This lowers the chances of your data being used in phishing scams or other fraudulent activities. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6. Ask your credit card company to investigate:\u00a0Contact your credit card provider directly and request a full investigation. Ask if there was any suspicious account activity, such as a login from a new device, before the fraudulent charges occurred. They may be able to trace when and how your account was accessed. Most card issuers will reverse fraudulent charges and can reissue a new card with a different number.",
      "7. Notify law enforcement:\u00a0File a report with the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission. If necessary, a police report should also be filed to document the fraud. This can be helpful for disputing charges and clearing your record.",

      "So, we've uncovered how those sneaky credit card charges can surface even before you've held the card in your hands. It's a reflection of the increasingly digital world we live in, where our personal information can be vulnerable in surprising ways. Remember, use strong antivirus software and consider a personal data removal service to minimize your online footprint.

      "What you need to know",
      "The X data leak is believed to stem from a combination of breaches, including a massive one that allegedly occurred in January 2025 and another in 2023. The leaked dataset, reportedly a 34 GB CSV file, contains 201,186,753 entries with information such as X screen names, user IDs, full names, locations, email addresses (from the 2023 breach), follower counts, profile data, time zones and profile images.",

      "If you have an account on X or think your data may have been part of the breach, here are seven important steps you can take to protect yourself.",
      "1) Use strong antivirus software",
      "This breach included email addresses linked to X accounts, prime fuel for phishing attacks. Hackers may now send emails that look like they\u2019re from X, Musk or support, asking you to \"verify your account\" or \"reset your password.\" These often contain links or attachments that can install malware or steal personal data.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Remove your personal data from the internet",
      "Since this X leak exposed full names, email addresses and other public-facing profile details, hackers can easily cross-reference it with other data broker sites to build a full profile on you. This could lead to impersonation or spear-phishing.",
      "To reduce your exposure, use a trusted data removal service that scans data broker websites and requests the deletion of your personal information. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3) Change your X account password",
      "Even though this particular breach may not have included passwords, there\u2019s still a significant risk, especially if you use the same password across multiple platforms. Once attackers have your email, they often try using it with common or previously leaked passwords to break into accounts.",
      "To change your X account password, go to Settings and privacy from your profile menu, then select\u00a0Your account and tap on\u00a0Change your password. Enter your current password, set a new strong password and confirm the change. You can do this via the mobile app or by logging in through the web. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "4) Make your X profile more private to reduce future risk",
      "Adjust your X account's privacy settings to limit the visibility of personal information, such as making your profile private. Ensure that only necessary information is publicly visible. Information that seems harmless, like your location, job title or birthday, can be used by cybercriminals to impersonate you or guess your login credentials. If your X profile includes any personal details that aren\u2019t necessary, now is the time to remove them.",
      "Keeping your profile minimal not only protects your privacy but also makes it harder for scammers to craft convincing phishing messages or social engineering attacks. Think twice before posting personal updates or details publicly, especially if they can be used to guess passwords or verify your identity.",
      "Go to\u00a0Settings > Privacy and safety and lock down your account visibility.",
      "5) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for your X and email accounts",
      "If hackers got your email from the X breach, they may try to reset your password.\u00a02FA helps stop this by requiring a second code to log in:",
      "Use an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy, not SMS, which can be interceptedSecure your email accounts, too, since they can be used to reset your X credentials",
      "Use an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy, not SMS, which can be intercepted",
      "Secure your email accounts, too, since they can be used to reset your X credentials",
      "6) Use a VPN on public Wi-Fi",
      "Protect your data when accessing X or other platforms on public networks by using a VPN to encrypt your connection. This will help safeguard your information from being intercepted by malicious actors. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "7) Sign up for identity theft protection to catch if your X-linked info is abused",
      "With 200-plus million names and email addresses exposed, scammers may try opening accounts in your name or use your email in fraud attempts. Good identity protection can alert you if your info is being sold on the dark web. It can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my\u00a0tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "NEW PHISHING SCAM OUTSMARTS SECURITY CODES TO STEAL YOUR INFO",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The X breach is yet another reminder that patching a vulnerability is only one piece of a much larger puzzle. The persistence of leaked data \u2013 years after the original flaw was disclosed and fixed \u2013 highlights the long tail of exposure that comes with large-scale breaches. Even when credentials aren\u2019t involved, the combination of identifiers like email addresses, names and social connections can be weaponized through correlation attacks, data enrichment and AI-assisted social engineering.",

      "SafetyCore is an interesting addition to Android, offering on-device content filtering with machine learning. While it aims to enhance privacy and security, some users might have questions about its presence and functionality.

    "story": [
      "Kurt \"The CyberGuy\" Knutsson explains step-by-step how to protect your Smart TV from hackers.",
      "Nowadays, double-clicking on something on a website without thinking can set you up for hackers to reach your information.",

      "Illustration of an individual being scammed. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is doubleclickjacking?",
      "Doubleclickjacking is a new spin on an old hacking trick known as clickjacking. Normally, clickjacking works by hiding malicious buttons underneath real ones, so when you think you\u2019re clicking something harmless, you\u2019re actually giving permission for something dangerous. With doubleclickjacking, it takes things a step further. It\u2019s triggered when you double-click, allowing hackers to sneak in an extra, invisible command. Your first click might do something normal. The second click? That\u2019s where the damage happens.",

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",

      "Click \"Allow\" on a hidden pop-up",
      "Share your location",
      "Approve a login, payment or even a crypto transaction",
      "What makes doubleclickjacking especially dangerous is that most websites weren\u2019t designed to defend against it. Traditional security features usually protect against a single click, but they often fail when a second click is involved. That small detail opens the door for attackers to bypass layers of protection.",
      "This trick doesn\u2019t just affect websites, either. It can also interfere with browser extensions like crypto wallets and VPNs, sometimes tricking users into approving actions or turning off protection without realizing it. On mobile devices, a simple double-tap can trigger the same effect. To make matters worse, this vulnerability is more widespread than you might expect. Many well-known websites haven\u2019t fixed it yet. All it takes is one quick double-click in the wrong place, and you could unknowingly give away access to sensitive parts of your device.",
      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "How does doubleclickjacking work?",
      "Here\u2019s a simplified version of how the trick plays out. A malicious website quietly loads invisible elements behind or over visible ones, like an embedded frame, hidden button, or disguised pop-up. On your first click, the attacker uses that action to reposition those hidden elements so that your next click lands exactly where they want it. On your second click, you unknowingly interact with the hidden content. You might be clicking \"Allow\" on a browser permission, authorizing a login, or disabling a setting, without ever realizing it. Because modern browsers are lightning fast, this all happens in a split second. The entire setup and switch are virtually invisible to the user. From your perspective, it just feels like a normal double-click.",

      "Doubleclickjacking might be sneaky, but there are simple ways to keep yourself safer online. Here are some practical steps you can take right now:",
      "1. Be cautious about double-clicking on unfamiliar websites: It might sound obvious, but most of us click (and double-click) automatically. If a site prompts you to double-click anything, especially for a login, permission or download, ask yourself if it\u2019s really necessary. Hackers rely on you acting quickly without thinking.",
      "2. Keep your browser updated: Browsers like Chrome, Edge and Safari regularly release patches for these vulnerabilities. That means delaying updates could leave you exposed to tricks like doubleclickjacking. Turn on automatic updates if possible, or make sure to manually keep up with updates so you\u2019re always protected.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software: Browser-based tools and extensions can help block hidden or malicious scripts before they run, but they\u2019re not foolproof. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Use strong, unique passwords for every account:\u00a0Don\u2019t reuse passwords. If one account gets compromised, hackers can use it to access your other accounts. A password manager helps you create and store strong passwords effortlessly. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Limit unnecessary permissions: Take control of your privacy by reviewing which websites have access to your camera, microphone, and location. Many sites request these permissions by default, even when they don\u2019t need them. Head into your browser\u2019s privacy settings and revoke access from any site you don\u2019t fully trust. For example, here's a guide on\u00a0how to navigate Google's privacy settings.",
      "6. Avoid sketchy sites and pop-ups: If a website looks outdated, spammy or aggressively pushes you to click something, get out of there. Avoid downloading random files, and don\u2019t trust pop-ups that claim you\u2019ve won something, need to \"fix\" your device or \"verify\" your login info.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Doubleclickjacking is a clever new spin on a classic hacking trick that allows cybercriminals to take control over your device or account, just from a simple double-click. Because this kind of attack is nearly invisible and works on popular browsers, it\u2019s important to stay alert. Always be cautious when interacting with unfamiliar websites, especially if you're being asked to double-click. Keeping your browser updated and limiting unnecessary permissions can go a long way in reducing your risk. Most importantly, having the right digital protection tools in place can help stop these types of threats before they ever reach you.",

    "summary": "Bryan Kohberger asked Idaho Judge Steven Hippler to remove key pieces of evidence ahead of his murder trial, but many rulings did not go his way.",
    "story": [
      "Idaho student murders suspect Bryan Kohberger returned to court for a hearing on what evidence may and may not be allowed at his upcoming trial, Fox News' Dan Springer reports.",
      "Bryan Kohberger's defense struggled with prosecutors over what evidence should and shouldn't be allowed in his upcoming quadruple murder trial at a full-day hearing in front of Judge Steven Hippler in Boise, Idaho, on Wednesday.",
      "Kohberger, 30, faces four charges of first-degree murder in the deaths of Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20. He also faces a felony burglary count.",
      "Hippler decided some motions from the bench but said he would announce other orders later in writing \u2014 including his findings on defense motions to strike the death penalty as a potential punishment due to Kohberger's diagnosis of autism and defense claims the prosecutors have missed key discovery deadlines.",
      "IDAHO PROSECUTORS SAY THEY WILL CALL \u2018A FEW\u2019 OF BRYAN KOHBERGER'S FAMILY MEMBERS TO TESTIFY AT TRIAL",
      "Bryan Kohberger's attorneys struggled with prosecutors over what evidence should be allowed at his quadruple murder trial.",
      "Defense attorney Anne Taylor cited the recent Lori Vallow case, in which the court threw out the death penalty over missed deadlines. Kohberger, however, has waived his right to a speedy trial, and Hippler asked Taylor why she hadn't raised the issue months ago or requested more resources, like a half-dozen additional paralegals to help her go through discovery.",
      "Deputy Latah County Prosecutor Ashley Jennings also flat out denied Taylor's accusations that prosecutors were slow-walking discovery and said everything the defense has asked for has been provided, a point that Taylor conceded in front of the judge.",
      "READ BRYAN KOHBERGER'S COLLEGE ESSAY ON HANDLING A CRIME SCENE",
      "[It's] all incriminating evidence, that's why the state is offering it.",
      "\"This motion is not about withheld discovery,\" she said. It was instead about a vast amount of data, dozens of terabytes, that she said will take years to go through. Hippler told her he expects most of it is irrelevant surveillance video that doesn't need to be gone through, but he said he would likely require the prosecution to certify that it has disclosed all potentially exculpatory evidence that it is aware of and that the defense has not already flagged.",
      "Madison Mogen, top left, smiles on the shoulders of her best friend, Kaylee Goncalves, as they pose with Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, and two other housemates in Goncalves' final Instagram post, shared the day before the four students were stabbed to death. (@kayleegoncalves/Instagram)",
      "He said he would issue a written order later.",
      "After arguments over Kohberger's alibi, which prosecutors say cannot be corroborated by anyone other than the defendant himself, the judge and both sides appeared to agree that defense expert Sy Ray could testify about Kohberger's whereabouts at the time his phone was shut off, more than an hour before the murders. But Latah County Prosecuting Attorney Bill Thompson made clear that is not an alibi.",

      "\"Who is gonna say he was out driving around looking at the stars?\" Hippler asked Taylor.",

      "\"The question is whether you have a witness who is going to testify to that,\" Hippler said.",

      "FOLLOW THE FOX TRUE CRIME TEAM ON X",
      "Hippler partially agreed to a defense motion to block prosecutors from using the words \"murderer,\" \"psychopath\" and \"sociopath\" in the trial, but noted that what the defense had asked for amounted to issuing \"an order that says the state shall not commit prosecutorial misconduct.\"",
      "He said he expected the rules to be followed, that the term \"murderer\" could potentially be used during closing arguments, and that the words \"psycho-\" and \"sociopath\" could not be used unless an expert evaluation determined they accurately apply to Kohberger, something that has not happened as of Thursday.",
      "As for \"inflammatory evidence\" that the defense wants kept out of trial, like overuse of gruesome crime scene photos, Hippler said the murders were \"brutal and horrific\" and he expected the evidence to reflect that.",

      "In one key moment, Taylor claimed that the defense had uncovered a new lead regarding a potential alternate suspect and was investigating. In another, she said there are a hundred hours of interviews with people who knew Kohberger from Washington State University \u2014 and many of them had \"unkind things to say about him.\"",
      "Kohberger was studying for a Ph.D. in criminology there. The campus is about 10 miles from the University of Idaho crime scene.",
      "Prosecutors revealed that they do not expect any of the inconclusive DNA samples under Mogen's fingernails to belong to Kohberger \u2014 because they believe the attacker wore clothes to sufficiently cover himself up. The defense sought unsuccessfully to have a 2020 college essay Kohberger wrote about crime scene handling for DeSales University, where he studied for a master's degree in criminal justice, excluded from the trial.",
      "University of Idaho victims Madison Mogen and Xana Kernodle. (Instagram @xanakernodle)",
      "Judge Hippler also took issue with a defense expert witness who he said accused prosecutors of severe misconduct involving discovery materials regarding Kohberger's phone tracking records without evidence.",

      "BRYAN KOHBERGER DOESN'T WANT AMAZON SHOPPING LIST REVEALED AT TRIAL",
      "At issue are timing advance records, detailed location data from a phone that is only preserved for seven days. The prosecution's initial search warrant sought this information in November. Kohberger wasn't identified as a suspect until Dec. 19. Jennings said she did not have the records. Hippler asked Taylor what evidence she had that they even exist.",
      "The hearing touched on other issues, such as whether Kohberger's immediate family has a right to courtroom seating. Prosecutors noted that some relatives will be on the witness list, and as such, shouldn't be allowed to observe testimony in the case prior to taking the stand themselves.",
      "Latah County Prosecuting Attorney Bill Thompson walks through the courtroom before a hearing at the Latah County Courthouse in Moscow, Idaho. (August Frank/Tribune, Pool)",
      "While Kohberger's defense attorney Elisa Massoth said the family has \"no interest in helping\" the prosecution and predicted that prosecutors would only call one relative, \"at best,\" Jennings revealed that prosecutors intend to call \"a few.\"",
      "The defense wanted the 911 audio blocked from being played before the jury. Hippler said he would likely allow it but redact some statements that could be considered hearsay. Similarly, he said he would consider redacting portions of a traffic stop in which Kohberger had a back-and-forth with the officer in the months before the murders. Prosecutors said they intended to use it to show his ownership of the white Hyundai Elantra.",
      "Massoth took issue with referring to Kohberger's car as the suspect vehicle.",
      "\"You don't get to, and I don't get to, tell the state how to try their case unless they're violating the rules of evidence,\" Hippler said.",
      "Hippler appeared unsympathetic to the defense's opposition to including Kohberger's Amazon records, which show the purchase of a Ka-Bar knife and sheath set before the murders as well as searching the app for the same items after the murders.",
      "Prosecutors allege Bryan Kohberger took this selfie photo at 10:31 a.m. on Nov. 13, 2022 \u2014 about six hours after the murders of four University of Idaho students he is accused of committing. (Ada County Court)",

      "Hippler said he would take a defense motion to block surviving roommate \"DM\" from using the phrase \"bushy eyebrows\" during her testimony. Taylor also revealed that in addition to DM's text messages and phone history that were released last month, the roommate's phone data shows she was also editing photos, saving new contacts, using social media and \"a whole lot more.\"",
      "Hippler said that while older adults may pick up the phone and call someone, younger people are just as likely to reach out over social media.",

      "KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan \u2014 Taiwanese President William Lai is struggling to contain both open hostility and private \"wooing\" by China. In late March, four Taiwanese soldiers, three of whom were part of a unit that provides security for Taiwan\u2019s Presidential Office, were jailed for up to seven years after being convicted of selling pictures of sensitive information to China.",
      "The verdicts came after last month\u2019s speech in which Lai condemned the\u00a0Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the harshest terms used by a Taiwanese leader in modern history. In his remarks, the president said Taiwan will not be \"bullied or manipulated\" and promised repercussions against those who make \"expressions of loyalty to the enemy.\"",
      "Lai, aware of Beijing\u2019s \"carrot and stick\" campaign, warned Taiwanese to be wary of China\u2019s \"United Front,\"\u00a0a political strategy employed by the CCP in which they \u2013 with plenty of smiles and often \"investment\" capital \u2013 enter international organizations and various influential groups and plant agents who then build alliances with targeted individuals, political parties and other interests.",

Last week,\u00a0Presidential Office consultant Wu Shang-yu, along with two others from the president\u2019s ruling party, were reportedly detained on suspicion of spying for the CCP.",
      "For many Taiwanese, Lai\u2019s enough-is-enough speech and subsequent actions by his government are a welcome change from a period of perceived vulnerability. Lai\u2019s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) insiders told Fox News Digital that they feel \"Taiwan has been on the defensive for far too long\" and that their voters \"are tired of us being a punching bag.\"",
      "The DPP government is also promising to take a harder stance against what it calls Chinese infiltration. Taiwanese citizens found to have Chinese identity cards have had their Taiwan nationality revoked because it is illegal to be a Taiwan/China dual citizen or dual ID holder.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping (AP Photo/Andy Wong/File)",
      "China does not accept Taiwanese passports, so those here who wish to travel there must obtain a substitute passport known as \"Taiwan Compatriot ID,\" but these are for temporary stays. Some Taiwanese have sought a Chinese ID card to make living and working in China easier, but the days of divided loyalties are over, according to Taiwan\u2019s government.",

      "Taiwan has some of the most liberal free-speech laws in Asia; here one can stand near government buildings, wave China\u2019s national flag and advocate for communism without fear of arrest. But calling for the \"violent overthrow of Taiwan\u2019s government by the military of the People\u2019s Republic of China\" is a red line, which internet influencer \"Yaya in Taiwan\" crossed, according to Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of the Interior. \"Yaya,\" a Chinese national whose real name is Liu Zhenya, lived in Taiwan on a spousal visa and has three children with her Taiwanese husband.",
      "But instead of treating her visa as a privilege, says Taiwan\u2019s government, \"Yaya\" openly supported the forceful annexation of Taiwan by China. Yaya\u2019s defenders argue that she, and others recently evicted from Taiwan, are being selectively prosecuted.",
      "Yet some here are not buying Lai's threats. Dr. Huang Kwei-bo, a professor in the Department of Diplomacy at Taiwan\u2019s National Chengchi University, told Fox News Digital that all this \"get tough with China\" talk is mostly political theater: \"These dramatic Lai administration policy proposals are firstly maneuvers aimed at regaining control over Taiwan\u2019s parliament, as well as building momentum for upcoming local elections in late 2026.\"",
      "Huang also said Taiwan\u2019s ruling party, the DPP, is \"crying out to get the Trump administration\u2019s attention in the hope that Trump\u2019s officials will be more willing to endorse the DPP in power and work with, or include, the Lai administration in any \u2018countering China\u2019 policy.\"",

      "A broad majority of Taiwanese appear to want tougher measures against acts that threaten Taiwan\u2019s national sovereignty, but some analysts note the new tough talk has arrived just in time for Lai\u2019s party as it hopes to succeed in an ongoing effort to remove opposition Chinese Nationalist Party legislators from office, win control of municipal governments in local elections in November 2026 and then help Lai secure a second term in 2028.",

      "While it's not yet known what the talks will achieve, experts continue to warn that time is running out to not only block Iran\u2019s nuclear program but to utilize existing tools to counter Tehran\u2019s dismissal of international law, a mechanism known as \"snapback\" sanctions.",
      "\"This is the one time that we have the ability to sort of put new sanctions on Iran where we don't need Russia and China's help, and we can just do it unilaterally,\" Gabriel Noronha of the Jewish Institute for National Security of America told Fox News Digital.

      "The provision for snapback sanctions was enacted under UNSC Resolution 2231, which was agreed to just days after the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was signed in 2015 as a way to ensure that if Iran was found to be violating the nuclear deal, stiff international sanctions could once again be reimposed.",
      "The JCPOA has increasingly been considered a collapsed agreement after the U.S. withdrew in 2018 under the first Trump administration, followed by increasingly flagrant violations by Iran of the nuclear deal.",
      "This has culminated in the rapid expansion of Tehran\u2019s nuclear program and the assessment by the U.N. nuclear watchdog earlier this year that Tehran had amassed enough near-weapons-grade uranium to develop five nuclear weapons if it were to be further enriched.",
      "Centrifuge machines are shown in the Natanz uranium enrichment facility in central Iran in 2019. (Atomic Energy Organization of Iran via AP)",
      "European nations for years have refused to enact snapback sanctions in a move to try and encourage Tehran to come back to the negotiating table and diplomatically find a solution to end its nuclear program.",
      "Any participant in the JCPOA can unilaterally call up snapback sanctions if Iran is found to have violated the terms of the agreement. But the U.S., which has been calling for snapbacks since 2018, was found by the U.N. and all JCPOA members to no longer be legally eligible to utilize the sanction mechanism after its withdrawal from the international agreement.",
      "But as Iran continues to develop its nuclear program, the tone among European leaders has also become increasingly frustrated.",

      "With France serving as UNSC president in April and the bureaucratic red tape Russia could employ, UNSC members supportive of blocking Iran\u2019s nuclear program must immediately call up snapback sanctions, Noronha said.",
      "\"It takes about\u00a0six weeks to actually be implemented properly,\" said Noronha, author of \"Iran Sanctions, U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231, and the Path to Snapback,\" which was released last week. \"And second, because the distribution of the presidencies and leadership of the U.N. Security Council is weighted towards more favorable leaders right now in the spring before it goes to pretty adversarial leadership in the summer and fall.\"",

      "A single veto is enough to block a resolution being enacted, and progress in the council has become stagnant following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.",
      "But even if Russia objects to reimposing sanctions on Iran, as Tehran has become a close ally of Moscow\u2019s, it actually has very few options for blocking the snapback mechanism that it previously agreed to, so long as at least one other nation actually calls for the sanction tool.",

      "\"This is the only time this has ever happened at the U.N. before,\" Noronha said. \"They basically said, when we invoke snapback, what it does is it says U.N. sanctions will automatically return unless there's a vote by the council to unanimously allow sanctions relief to remain on the books.\"",
      "The snapback mechanism would legally enforce all 15 UNSC member nations to reimpose sanctions on Iran, including Russia and any nation that may be sympathetic to Tehran.",
      "If the snapback mechanism expires come October, the U.N.\u2019s hands will likely be tied when it comes to countering Iran\u2019s nuclear program, as it is unlikely any new resolutions on the issue will be able to pass through the council given the current geopolitical climate between the West and Russia.",

The updated figures contradict Hamas' earlier claims that most casualties were women and children.",
      "Salo Aizenberg, from the U.S.-based nonprofit HonestReporting, uncovered the changes through a detailed analysis of Hamas\u2019 casualty lists. The investigation revealed that 3,400 names, including over 1,080 children, were removed from the group\u2019s March 2025 report after being listed in 2024.",
      "Aizenberg pointed out that the original reports, published by the Hamas-controlled Gaza Ministry of Health, were widely cited by major international organizations, including the United Nations and the International Criminal Court (ICC). \"These \u2018deaths\u2019 never happened.

Some families submitting false claims, Wahidi said, may have been motivated by the promise of government financial assistance.",
      "Adesnik referenced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s previous comments about Gaza war casualties. \"He said 30,000 dead \u2013 14,000 fighters, 16,000 civilians \u2013 while Hamas claimed 70% were women and children.

      "The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index was hit hardest Thursday, dropping as much as 7.2%, while the S&P 500 at one point fell a total of 6.3% \u2014 not far off from the 7% level at which trading is paused for all U.S. stocks.",
      "The Nasdaq did recover a bit, but closed down 4.3%. The S&P 500 ended the day down about 3.5%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average had dropped 1,000 points, or about 2.5%. The Russell 2000 index, which includes smaller companies, was down 5.2%.",
      "The S&P 500 is now off about 14% from its February highs.",
      "Even with most tariffs targeting individual nations now ostensibly on hold, Trump\u2019s plan still entails the United States\u2019 average effective tariff rate climbing considerably, as a baseline fee of 10% for all imports and 145% for ones from China snaps into place \u2014 suggesting the cost of imports are still likely to surge.",
      "The president also still plans to impose \u201csectoral\u201d tariffs on entire swaths of goods, including pharmaceuticals and lumber.",
      "\u201cWe do not see the scenario as being as encouraging as markets do,\u201d analysts with Citi wrote in a note Thursday morning, adding there was no guarantee the negotiations Trump touted as he announced his pause would result in deals or actually lower tariffs.",
      "\u201cWe continue to expect growth to slow, inflation to rise and the Fed to return to rate cuts as soon as hard data confirm the slowdown,\u201d the Citi analysts wrote."

      "Some of the stiffest new tariffs are on hold, but experts say shoppers\u2019 bills for White House trade policies are coming due soon.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s surprise 90-day suspension Wednesday of much of his April 2 tariff announcement doesn\u2019t change the likelihood that consumers will pay more for many goods and services in the months ahead, economists warn.",
      "All the tariffs he has announced this year would dent households\u2019 purchasing power by an average $4,400 annually, the Yale University Budget Lab forecast Thursday. While inflation dipped more than expected in March, analysts say it\u2019s likely just a temporary reprieve.",
      "\u201cThat was nice, but don\u2019t get used to it,\u201d Greg McBride, Bankrate chief financial analyst, said in a statement Thursday.",
      "The president\u2019s rapidly shifting trade war has created enormous uncertainty for businesses around the world, threatening price stability, and his steep new import taxes are merely delayed, not called off. A 10% across-the-board duty that went into effect this week remains in place, as well as a massive 145% tariff on Chinese imports.",
      "\u201cWith both inflation and the overall economy, uncertainty abounds about what might be lurking around the bend,\u201d McBride said.",
      "Here\u2019s where consumers could feel the most pain in their pockets.",
      "Electronics",
      "Consumers have been scurrying to Apple stores in recent days to upgrade their iPhones, and with good reason: the company\u2019s best-selling product is manufactured in China, and its highest-end version could see a price hike of at least $350, according to UBS analysts.",
      "Other electronics from laptops to televisions could see similar jumps. Electronic parts \u2014 such as computing machinery, cameras, TV and radio transmitters \u2014 will account for the largest revenues from Trump\u2019s tariff regime by far, according to an analysis of trade data by Global Trade Alert, a nonprofit research group.",
      "Vehicles and auto parts",
      "Trump\u2019s 25% tariff on imported vehicles has already taken effect, costing Americans an additional $2,500 to $20,000 per vehicle, depending on its size and type, according to estimates by Anderson Economic Group.",
      "Additional import taxes in the pipeline could prove inescapable even for those who don\u2019t buy a new car, experts say. Uncertainty remains about which auto parts would be exempt under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that Trump negotiated during his first term, while the U.S. imported a record 63% of its tires last year from countries such as Thailand (37% tariff) and South Korea (25% tariff). The U.S. gets almost all of its natural rubber from other countries, which means domestic producers will be hobbled, as well.",
      "In other words, there\u2019s a good chance that auto tuneup is about to cost Americans more.",
      "Nuts",
      "\u201cWhile the domestic production of peanuts and tree nuts is bountiful, not every nut commodity can be grown within the United States,\u201d the Peanut and Tree Nut Processors Association said in a statement last week.",
      "That includes cashews, one of the main exports of Vietnam, which the president hit with a 46% tariff April 2. Shoppers will also see pricier Brazil nuts, a major product of the Ivory Coast (whose exports face a 21% tariff), and macadamias, produced in South Africa (31%).",
      "Coffee",
      "The United States is the second-largest importer of coffee in the world, with about 80% of unroasted beans coming from Brazil and Colombia, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. While both countries are subject to Trump\u2019s 10% baseline tariff, recent droughts in key growing regions have already been pushing up prices this year.",
      "Rice",
      "More than a quarter of the rice sold in the U.S. is imported from countries such as Thailand (facing a 36% tariff) and India (26%), according to the USDA. Consumers can expect to see more expensive aromatic rice, such as jasmine and basmati, as a result of the steeper import taxes.",
      "Wine and spirits",
      "The White House has also slapped new tariffs on the nation\u2019s top alcohol sources, including the European Union (subject to 20% tariffs), which accounts for 80% of all the wine the U.S. imported last year.",
      "Combined with the 25% tariff on Mexican and Canadian goods \u2014 and the expansion of Trump\u2019s aluminum duties to include canned beer imports \u2014 some households might end up considering a dry summer.",
      "\u201cThe increased costs of living that will result from the recently enacted tariffs, along with the significant increase in prices for wines that will result, will only push down consumption further,\u201d the National Association of Wine Retailers said in a statement last week. The trade group said the policies risked \u201charming the American wine industry to a degree from which many of its participants will not recover.\u201d",
      "Clothing",
      "Some of the largest American retailers source apparel and footwear from Asian countries including China, Bangladesh (37%), and Vietnam, which in recent years became a manufacturing hub for U.S. businesses seeking to duck trade barriers on China. That looks set to change when the new 46% tariff on Vietnamese products goes into effect.",
      "Those three countries are among the top manufacturing hubs for VF Corporation, owner of brands including Timberland, Dickies, the North Face, and Vans. Gap, which operates Old Navy, Gap and Banana Republic, sourced most of its apparel from factories in Vietnam, India, Indonesia (32%), Bangladesh and Sri Lanka (44%).",
      "\u201cThe 2025 tariffs disproportionately affect clothing and textiles, with consumers facing 58% higher apparel prices in the short-run, the Yale Budget Lab researchers wrote. \u201cApparel prices stay 26% higher in the long-run.\u201d",
      "A trade group that represents major brands including Nike and Skechers recently told Reuters that tariffs threatened to jack the price of a $155 running shoe made in Vietnam as high as $220.",
      "Toys",
      "Almost 80% of the toys sold in the U.S. are imported from China, according to the Toy Association. Greg Ahearn, the trade group\u2019s president, told PBS in March that he projected price increases of 15-20% on toys such as games, dolls, race cars.",
      "That was before Trump\u2019s 104% levy on Chinese goods. Basic Fun, a Florida-based toymaker responsible for classic playsets such as Tonka Trucks and Lincoln Logs, told the New York Post on Monday that it was pausing shipments to the U.S. altogether, as passing along those costs to consumers was \u201cimpossible.\u201d",
      "Seafood",
      "A seafood dinner could soon become an infrequent luxury.\u00a0 Top fish and shellfish exporters Chile and India were hit with new tariffs of 10% and 26%, respectively.",
      "\u201cAbout 70 to 80% of the U.S. seafood food supply is imported, and so that is not a number that the U.S. domestic industry can plug,\u201d said Andy Harig, an executive at the Food Industry Association, told Today.com last week. \u201cSo you\u2019re going to see that the cost of the seafood department go up."

      "Wealthy investors have made the best trade over the past week \u2014 largely doing nothing.",
      "While many hedge funds and institutions have been selling over the past week, wealthy individual investors were largely sitting tight or even doing a little buying.",
      "Interviews with several top executives in wealth management suggest that unlike the crashes in 2020 or 2008, high-net-worth investors were feeling less pressure to sell over the past week. Some started buying Friday afternoon. And many used the lower prices as an opportunity to do some tax-loss harvesting and estate planning.",
      "Here\u2019s what advisors to the wealthy say their clients are responding to the market roller coaster.",
      "John Mathews, head of private wealth management for the Americas at UBS",
      "Like most Americans, wealthy investors are feeling a wide range of emotions from the market and policy turmoil. They\u2019re split down political lines, which shape their economic outlook and investment impulses, according to Mathews.",
      "\u201cOur job is to take the emotion out of it and try to level-set,\u201d Mathews said. \u201cMost of the time we\u2019re psychologists.\u201d",
      "That helped clients to avoid making big trades or financial decisions based on feeling over logic. Mathews said many UBS clients started trimming their stocks and \u201cde-risking\u201d in January. While markets were soaring in the first two months of the year on hopes for the new Trump administration, many of the wealthy were selling and adding cash. Their large cash cushion helped keep them calmer during the past week\u2019s market turbulence and provided funding for later buying opportunities.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot of dry powder on the sidelines right now,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of the really wealthy clients were thinking [in January], \u2018I made a lot of money, it\u2019s been easy for two years in a row and everything was working exactly how we wanted it to. But in 2025, we\u2019re going to start to see some different things pop up so why not take profits now?\u2019\u201d",
      "Many clients were buying on Friday, when the Dow dropped 2,200 points, Mathews said.",
      "\u201cFriday afternoon, we saw a lot of buying,\u201d he said. \u201cClients were asking whether they should buy individual stocks that have been punished that they always wanted to get into, or just go ahead and buy the indexes.\u201d",
      "For the most part, wealthy clients have stopped trading, waiting for more clarity on policy and markets. Others added money to private equity, which is less volatile on a day-to-day basis but still faces challenges with a lack of IPOs and liquidity.",
      "\u201cThe question is exits,\u201d Mathews said. \u201cHow are you going to get exits and when? Our wealthier clients have time horizons of 10 or 15 years to get their money back, so they\u2019re not as concerned.\u201d",
      "Gold is another big theme among wealthy investors. While it\u2019s come off its highs over the past week, gold has been seen as a safe haven even before the week\u2019s market gyrations.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot of questions about gold,\u201d Mathews said. \u201cEverybody is interested in having a piece of gold as a hedge right now.\u201d",
      "Mathews said one client summed up the broader dilemma for investors this week with a property analogy: \u201cHe said, \u2018It\u2019s like I wanted to buy a property that had been $10 million and it goes to $8 million. It\u2019s cheaper, and I still like it. But now it could also go to $5 million. So what do I do?\u2019\u201d",
      "Pamela Lucina, head of family office solutions at Northern Trust",
      "During market shocks, Lucina guides wealthy clients according to her \u201cthree Ps\u201d \u2014 don\u2019t panic, don\u2019t predict and engage in planning.",
      "She said Northern Trust makes sure clients always have plenty of cash and other liquid holdings on hand when markets fall, so they don\u2019t have to sell at a loss. These so-called \u201cportfolio reserves\u201d can provide cash for spending when they need daily liquidity.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been telling them forever to plan for volatility, which is inevitable,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can pull from those risk-off assets to fund their lifestyle.\u201d",
      "Lucina said her clients didn\u2019t make big moves to buy last week. But she said some clients who had just sold their businesses and excess liquidity started putting some of the money into the market.",
      "\u201cSome of them are starting to deploy it into equities,\u201d she said.",
      "The main advice Northern Trust has given clients over the past week is to engage in estate and tax planning, she said. The market slide created three main planning opportunities.",
      "First, lower asset prices make grantor retained annuity trusts, or GRATs, more attractive. Many clients were creating or \u201cfreezing\u201d GRATs while stocks were down to create tax savings when transferring wealth to family members.",
      "She also said more wealthy clients were doing Roth conversions, or transferring funds from a pre-tax retirement account to a Roth IRA. Converting at market lows allows investors to pay taxes on the lower valuations and hedge the risk of higher tax rates in the future.",
      "Finally, she said, clients were tax-loss harvesting, or selling their losers and using tax losses to offset investment gains later in the year.",
      "\u201cWhat we found is that when we were able to turn the conversation more towards planning opportunities, people feel more in control,\u201d Lucina said.",
      "Matthew Fleissig, CEO of Pathstone",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re getting less fear from our clients right now and more, \u2018Should we be buying?\u2019\u201d Fleissig said.",
      "Fleissig said the fear levels from his clients didn\u2019t feel anything like 2000, 2008 or 2020.",
      "Family office clients, or those with $100 million or more, were \u201clayering in\u201d to the market and buying. Clients were also interested in structured products, which can offer protection on the downside but strong upside.",
      "\u201cIn times like these, it\u2019s our ability to find asymmetric opportunities, like opportunities in private markets or structured products that investors look to us for,\u201d he said.",
      "One warning: private credit. Wealthy investors and family offices have poured into private credit in recent years, leading to a flood of capital chasing deals with less regard for risk or returns.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of deals in private credit are extremely covenant-light,\u201d Fleissig said.",
      "Dmitriy Katsnelson, deputy chief investment office at Wealthspire",
      "Katsnelson noted wealthy investors tend to hold more cash at the end of the first quarter for tax payments. This year, the cash is serving the added purpose of buffering them from stock and bond losses.",
      "\u201cThat timing has been helpful,\u201d Katsnelson said. \u201cAnd people are asking whether this is a good time to start buying and becoming more aggressive.\u201d",
      "For the most part, investors across the wealth spectrum are avoiding major changes in their portfolio, he said. Yet smaller investors, those with $2 million or $3 million, and those who are close to retirement were feeling the volatility more than the ultra-wealthy clients. That latter cohort has more investments in alternatives, like private equity and direct deals, which don\u2019t price on a daily basis.",
      "\u201cMainly people are venting,\u201d Katsnelson said. \u201cThey have direct exposure, and we\u2019re there to listen.\u201d",

      "Rita Daniels learned at 9 that she is the great-great-great-grandniece of famed abolitionist Harriet Tubman, who led countless enslaved Africans to freedom through the Underground Railroad. It was a moment that changed how she viewed herself and American history for the rest of her life.",
      "So when Daniels, now 70, learned in recent days that the National Park Service drastically altered its webpage on Tubman and the Underground Railroad in February, she was devastated.",
      "\u201cIt tore me apart when I saw the news clip flash across my phone,\u201d said Daniels, who recently co-authored a book about Tubman\u2019s life.",
      "In elementary school, Daniels was assigned to write about Tubman, but books she could access at her school in Auburn, New York \u2014 where Tubman settled in 1859 after fleeing enslavement in Maryland \u2014 described her as \u201ca thief,\u201d Daniels recalled. \u201cIt said she stole slaves, that there was a bounty on her head, those kind of things.\u201d",
      "When Daniels told her mother what she found, her mother not only told her it was untrue, she told Daniels that Tubman was her ancestor.",
      "That began a life in which Daniels leaned on Tubman\u2019s legacy for strength while also working to preserve history as an author and the founder of the Harriet Tubman Learning Center.",
      "The page had been changed in February, The Washington Post reported, swapping out a large image of Tubman for one of five postage stamps celebrating \u201cBlack/white cooperation.\u201d The description of the Underground Railroad was changed from \u201cthe resistance to enslavement through escape and flight\u201d to one that downplays the role of slavery, instead saying it was an expression of the \u201cAmerican civil rights movement\u201d that bridged \u201cthe divides of race.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was just basically shocked and hurt at the same time,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cMost of my adult life, I pretty much wanted to make sure that people know that her story is a critical part of Black history, which is American history.\u201d",
      "Daniels said that as a child, it felt both shocking and empowering to learn she came from the bloodline of one of the most significant figures in American history.",
      "\u201cAt that age, I didn\u2019t fully understand the race war in the country or why they would describe her that way in books,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I knew having her as a relative was special.\u201d",
      "She said Tubman\u2019s tenacity has been a significant influence in her life. When she was tormented for years by a stalker, Daniels sought strength from her ancestor.",
      "After years of persistent harassment that began when Daniels was 17, the man broke into her home and stabbed her repeatedly, including on her face, sending her for an extended hospital stay.",
      "\u201cI keep my aunt in my mindset when I fall or when I get into a mood of not wanting to move on or keep going,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cHer words were, \u2018Keep going. Never give up.\u2019 And that\u2019s what kept me going. Even when I had been beaten up, I referred to her words. So I kept going, no matter what. She\u2019s in my bloodlines and her words are in my head always.\u201d",
      "After the NPS website was changed to remove Tubman\u2019s words and a short account of her work shuttling dozens of enslaved people from bondage in the South to freedom in northern states, plus mention of the racist laws that forced the existence of the Underground Railroad,\u00a0public outcry came fast and loud. On Monday, the NPS said in a statement that the page had been deleted \u201cwithout approval\u201d from the agency\u2019s top brass and the original version was \u201cimmediately restored.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy question is: Why do they want to erase our Black history?\u201d Daniels asked. \u201cWhy are we such a threat to certain Americans? They want to remove or ignore very reputable Americans, Black Americans? Why? The answer is racism.\u201d",
      "The change was one of many on government websites that had been updated or erased as part of the Trump administration\u2019s sweeping effort to delete what it considers references to diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI. Jackie Robinson, who broke the color barrier in baseball, was also removed from the Army website and later restored, as was Colin Powell and Pearl Harbor hero Doris Miller.",
      "The backlash over attempts to gloss over Tubman\u2019s history and that of the Underground Railroad only underscores how important it is to preserve it, Daniels said.",
      "\u201cThis is the kind of impact Harriett Tubman had on many people, not just me,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cAnd they want to erase that? No. She\u2019s too important to our family and to American history to just be pushed aside. They can\u2019t call what she\u2019s done DEI.\u201d"

      "There were no dissenting votes, but the court's three liberal justices signed onto a separate statement authored by Justice Sonia Sotomayor saying they agreed that \"the proper remedy is to provide Abrego Garcia with all the process to which he would have been entitled had he not been unlawfully removed to El Salvador.\"",
      "But Sotomayor added that she believed Chief Justice John Roberts should not have issued a temporary stay on Monday that meant the deadline for the government to act was missed.",
      "Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to a notorious El Salvador prison on March 15 as part of the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive and heavily contested plan to send alleged members of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua there.",
      "Immigration officials allege Abrego Garcia, who entered the United States illegally, is a member of the MS-13 gang but have conceded he should not have been sent to El Salvador, his country of birth, calling it an \u201cadministrative error.\u201d",
      "Abrego Garcia lived in Beltsville, Maryland, with his wife and three children, all of whom have special needs. He came to the United States to escape gang violence, his lawyers say.",
      "In 2019, the government began an effort to deport him, alleging that he was an MS-13 gang member. An immigration judge ruled Abrego Garcia could not be deported to El Salvador because there was \u201ca clear probability of future persecution.\u201d",
      "Until he was detained in March, he worked as a sheet metal worker in Maryland and checked in with immigration officials when required, his lawyers said.",
      "Last week, Maryland-based U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered that the government \u201cfacilitate and effectuate the return\u201d of Abrego Garcia by 11:59 p.m. on Monday.",
      "After failing to overturn the finding at an appeals court, the Trump administration turned to the Supreme Court.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in court papers that judges do not have the power to \u201cseize control over foreign relations\u201d by forcing officials to negotiate with El Salvador. He said the Trump administration has guaranteed that no one deported to the prison in El Salvador will be tortured.",
      "Abrego Garcia\u2019s lawyers described his removal to El Salvador as a \u201cKafka-esque mistake,\u201d saying the Salvadoran government was not actively seeking his extradition and that he had never been charged with a crime.",
      "His case is the latest high-profile legal battle arising from President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to exert broad presidential power to deport immigrants, often leading to claims that their rights have been violated.",
      "A Justice Department lawyer in the case was placed on administrative leave because of comments he made in court when he told the judge he was \u201cfrustrated\u201d that he could not answer some of her questions.",
      "In another case, the Supreme Court on Monday blocked a ruling by a federal judge that prevented alleged Venezuelan gang members being deported under a rarely invoked law called the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "In doing so the court said that Venezuelans targeted for deportation should be given a chance to challenge the government's action.",
      "Thursday's decision could give a boost to Venezuelans who were deported without due process before courts intervened."

    "story": [
      "Faced with a judge's deadline to provide evidence that Mahmoud Khalil poses a national security threat to the U.S., the Trump administration responded with a brief memo citing the Columbia student protester's beliefs in justifying his deportation.",
      "Khalil, a graduate student who helped lead protests against the war in Gaza last year, was arrested by immigration authorities on March 8. On Tuesday, an immigration judge in Louisiana ordered the federal government to provide evidence by Wednesday justifying its attempt to deport him.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio responded Wednesday evening in a memo obtained by NBC News. In a one-and-a-half-page memo, he cited an obscure\u00a0provision of the\u00a0Immigration and Nationality Act\u00a0of 1952 to justify Khalil\u2019s removal from the U.S.",
      "Rubio said that while Khalil's \u201cpast, current or expected beliefs, statements, or associations that are otherwise lawful,\" the provision allows the secretary of state alone to \u201cpersonally determine\u201d whether he should remain in the country.",
      "He said that allowing Khalil to stay in the U.S. would create a \"hostile environment for Jewish students in the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe foreign policy of the United States champions core American interests and American citizens and condoning anti-Semitic conduct and disruptive protests in the United States would severely undermine that significant foreign policy objective,\u201d he wrote.",
      "In response, Khalil's lawyer, Baher Azmy, said that \"immigration authorities have finally admitted that they have no case whatsoever against him.\"",
      "\"What this case is really about is whether lawful permanent residents \u2014 and other immigrants to this country \u2014 can speak out about Israel\u2019s brutal attacks on Gaza and Palestine, or any other important matters of discussion in the national discourse, without fear of deportation for expressing beliefs that the First Amendment completely protects,\" Azmy said at a virtual news briefing Thursday. \"Are U.S. citizens going to be next?\u201d",
      "Assistant Chief Immigration Judge Jamee Comans will decide at a hearing scheduled for Friday in Louisiana whether Khalil can be removed from the United States or should be released. If she rules that Khalil can be deported, his legal team can appeal.",
      "Marc Van Der Hout, another attorney for Khalil, said at the briefing that the Rubio memo is the only piece of evidence the government submitted to justify that Khalil\u2019s presence in the U.S. would have \u201cpotentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe government submitted, as you all have seen now, a two-page document. Two pages, that\u2019s it,\" Van Der Hout said. \"And in that, Secretary of State Rubio says that Mahmoud\u2019s presence here would create adverse foreign policy interests. But what does he talk about? He talks about First Amendment activity in the United States and the effect on people in the United States. His determination, quote, unquote, has absolutely nothing to do with foreign policy.\u201d",
      "In less than five weeks since Khalil's arrest, immigration authorities have arrested dozens of foreign students \u2014 many of whom are Muslim \u2014 at universities across the country or revoked their visas.",
      "Rubio\u00a0said last month that the State Department had revoked more than 300 student visas. \u201cWe do it every day,\" he said. \"Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visas.\"",
      "On Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security announced the creation of a task force to monitor the social media activity of immigrants, including foreign students, for antisemitism. Three sources familiar with the operation told NBC News that the task force will be screening an estimated 1.5 million foreign students studying in the United States for potential grounds to revoke their visas.",
      "The unprecedented actions by the immigration system come amid the federal government's broader crackdown on universities in the name of combatting antisemitism.",
      "In February, the Department of Justice launched a task force to \u201croot out\u201d what it calls\u00a0\u201canti-Semitic harassment in schools and on college campuses.\u201d",
      "The administration has also halted hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding to several universities in recent weeks, including Columbia, Harvard and Princeton, citing dissatisfaction with how they handled last year\u2019s protests against the war in Gaza."

      "A federal indictment accuses Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs of dangling someone over a balcony in an allegation that is strikingly similar to an encounter alleged in separate lawsuits two women filed against the music mogul.",
      "Combs, 55, is charged in a five-count indictment with sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution.",
      "Combs, the founder of Bad Boy Records and one of the most prominent figures in the music industry, is being detained in a jail in Brooklyn, New York, until his trial, which is scheduled to start next month.",
      "Sign up for the \u201cDiddy on Trial\u201d newsletter for key developments and analysis",
      "The indictment has been amended three times with new allegations or charges, most recently last week to include an additional charge each of sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution.",
      "The second amended indictment, filed last month, alleged that Combs forced some of his employees to work long hours with little sleep and coerced an employee into having sex. The first amended indictment accused Combs of having coerced two additional women into sex acts and of having \u201cdangled a victim over an apartment balcony.\u201d",
      "He has pleaded not guilty to all of the allegations and charges, except for those filed last week. He is scheduled to enter a plea on those counts April 25.",
      "The criminal indictment was preceded by a civil suit filed in 2023 by his former longtime girlfriend, model and singer Casandra Ventura, 38. She alleged in the lawsuit that Combs had dangled a friend of hers over the balcony of a 17th-floor hotel suite in or around August 2015.",
      "Ventura alleged in the suit, which she and Combs settled privately within a day without his admitting any wrongdoing, that he subjected her to \u201csavage\u201d beatings, in which he punched, kicked and stomped on her, leaving her with bruises, burst lips and black eyes.",
      "She also claimed in the document that he plied her with drugs and forced her to have sex with male sex workers while he masturbated and recorded them. Ventura\u2019s suit and the indictment said Combs referred to the drug-fueled encounters as \u201cfreak offs.\u201d During some freak offs, the suit said, Combs would become extremely intoxicated and violent, hitting Ventura in the presence of the male sex workers.",
      "The original indictment referred only to Victim-1, whose accusations closely align with those in Ventura\u2019s suit.",
      "Ventura alleged in the lawsuit filed in 2023 that in the middle of a surprise dinner for her 29th birthday around August 2015, Combs insisted she leave the party to go to a hotel to participate in a freak off.",
      "When Ventura told him that she did not want to go, Combs had her cornered by his security staff to force her to leave with him, the suit said. After the alleged freak off, it said, the two went back to her hotel room where some of her friends were hanging out. While he was severely intoxicated, Combs lifted one of her friends and dangled the friend over the balcony of the 17th-floor suite, causing Ventura and her friends to fear Combs\u2019 \u201cerratic behavior,\u201d it said.",
      "Ventura was heavily sedated because of the drugs she took to participate in the freak off and was unable to respond to Combs\u2019 \u201cterrifying behavior,\u201d according to the suit.",
      "Ventura\u2019s attorney declined to comment for this article.",
      "In a different lawsuit filed against Combs last year in Los Angeles, Bryana Bongolan alleges there was a balcony encounter that she said occurred in 2016 instead of 2015, as Ventura said in her suit. The federal indictment did not include a date or any other details except that the victim was female.",
      "The two lawsuits also differed about whether Ventura responded to the alleged dangling. Whereas Ventura said she was heavily sedated and unable to respond, Bongolan said in her lawsuit that when Ventura saw Combs dangling Bongolan over the balcony, she shouted at Combs to stop.",
      "Bongolan, 33,\u00a0said in her lawsuit that she met Combs through her friendship with Ventura and that early on or about Sept. 26, 2016, she was sleeping in Ventura\u2019s apartment when Combs began shouting and banging on the door. The suit says he entered the apartment and \u201cadvanced on her\u201d while she was on the balcony.",
      "\u201cHe grabbed her, turned her back to his chest, and molested her by groping her breasts as she yelled to be left alone,\u201d the suit alleges.",
      "Bongolan, who is 4-foot-11 and weighed less than 100 pounds at the time, tried to resist Combs by throwing her weight back while he lifted her up on the banister of the 17th-floor balcony, but he \u201ceasily overpowered her,\u201d the suit says, adding that he lifted her up higher and over the balcony.",
      "Ventura emerged from her bedroom to see Combs holding Bongolan over the balcony and screamed for him to stop, the lawsuit says. Combs moved Bongolan from the balcony and slammed her onto patio furniture, including a table, it says.",
      "Bongolan\u2019s complaint says that she was an aspiring fashion designer when she met Combs and that she completed numerous design projects for him from 2016 to 2018.",
      "Bongolan\u2019s attorney, James Nikraftar, did not reply to emails and phone calls seeking comment for this article. He has previously told NBC News that Bongolan would not be speaking publicly.",
      "Representatives for Combs did not immediately reply to requests for comment. In a statement to Rolling Stone after Bongolan\u2019s suit was filed, a legal representative for Combs denied her allegations.",
      "\u201cAnyone has the right to file a lawsuit, regardless of the evidence they may or may not have,\u201d the representative told publication. \u201cSince last year, Ms. Bongolan has expressed an intention to sue Mr. Combs and has sought legal representation to pursue her claims.",
      "\u201cMr. Combs firmly denies these serious allegations and remains confident they will ultimately be proven baseless.\u201d",
      "Bongolan is seeking a jury trial and more than $10 million in damages for sexual battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress and false imprisonment. More than 50 civil lawsuits have been filed against Combs, accusing him of sexual misconduct. He has denied all of the allegations.",
      "Jury selection for Combs\u2019 criminal trial is scheduled to begin at the end of the month, and opening statements are scheduled to begin May 12."

The lawmaker not only circulated the girl\u2019s name but included a side-by-side image of her competing in the boy\u2019s division two years before.",
      "As the Feb. 17 post went viral in conservative media, it drew the attention of the Trump administration, which had, in an executive order, effectively banned transgender students from participating in girls' and women's sports. President Donald Trump confronted Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, demanding that her state comply with the order. She hasn\u2019t agreed. And the school district hasn\u2019t backed down.",
      "Now Greely High School is at the center of a conflict over Title IX, the civil rights law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in education. The Trump administration has threatened to pull all federal education funding \u2014 over $200 million per year \u2014 if the state doesn\u2019t comply by Friday.

    "summary": "After Trump pulled Stefanik\u2019s nomination to be U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Johnson faces a conundrum on how to place her on a key committee.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 When President Donald Trump withdrew Rep. Elise Stefanik\u2019s nomination to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, she was given private assurances that she would not only rejoin the House GOP leadership team, but also reclaim her coveted spot on the House Intelligence Committee, according to two Republican sources with knowledge of the deliberations.",
      "Two weeks later, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is still scrambling to figure out how to deliver on the promise to place her back on the committee, even after the move was announced publicly Wednesday.",
      "The conundrum for Johnson is that he has to either remove a Republican who currently sits on the high-profile Intelligence Committee, which could cause strife among existing members, or be forced to change House rules to add a member. House rules dictate that the committee may be made up of no more than 25 members with a maximum of 14 from one party, which is how many Republicans are currently on the panel.",
      "Adding a member would increase the size of the committee, which some members have already complained is too bloated. It could also force Johnson to allow House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., to add another Democrat.",
      "In a statement to NBC News, Johnson\u2019s office said the speaker and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rick Crawford, R-Ark., are committed to finding a solution to accommodate Stefanik in the coming weeks.",
      "\u201cThe Speaker will be working with Chairman Crawford and HPSCI members to get Rep. Stefanik reintegrated into the Intelligence Committee in the coming weeks,\u201d a spokesman for Johnson said. \u201cThey both look forward to having her expertise back on the committee.\u201d",
      "Stefanik\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "The awkward situation has created tension between Johnson and Stefanik, on the influential panel and within the broader GOP conference. Adding to the drama, three senior House Republicans say Stefanik strong-armed Johnson into publicly announcing her new leadership arrangement ahead of a key budget vote in the House for which her support was sorely needed.",
      "Johnson has yet to signal his intentions to the Intelligence Committee members, leaving several worried whether their spots could be on the chopping block.",
      "In private conversations hashing out Stefanik\u2019s new arrangement, a source familiar with the discussion said, Johnson floated several Republicans whom he could ask to step down. They include Rep. Pat Fallon of Texas, who is the most junior Republican on the panel; Rep. Claudia Tenney, who, like Stefanik, is from New York; and Rep. French Hill of Arkansas, who chairs the powerful Financial Services Committee. Johnson appointed Fallon and Tenney to the panel on Jan. 16.",
      "But despite Johnson\u2019s initial suggestions, no decisions have been made, and no members have been approached about whether they\u2019d be willing to forfeit their spots, according to multiple GOP sources.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a fluid process,\u201d said a House Republican who is familiar with the discussions on the panel. \u201cI think they\u2019re trying to see if they bump somebody off to make room for her or whether they add two more \u2014 add a Democrat and a Republican.\u201d",
      "The lawmaker opposed adding more members, saying the Intelligence Committee had already been \u201cexpanded twice in the last two years.\u201d",
      "Johnson needs to tread carefully, as his past picks for the Intelligence Committee, which provides oversight of the National Intelligence Director\u2019s Office and the CIA, have landed him in hot water with some members of the conference.",
      "Johnson upset moderates in the last Congress when he passed over more pragmatic members, like Stephanie Bice, R-Okla.; Zach Nunn, R-Iowa; and Laurel Lee, R-Fla., and instead named two controversial firebrands to the panel, Scott Perry, R-Pa., and Ronny Jackson, R-Texas. And Johnson this year booted the panel\u2019s former chairman, Mike Turner, R-Ohio, who wasn\u2019t well-liked in Trump\u2019s orbit.",
      "Stefanik's role collides with key budget vote",
      "The consternation over how to accommodate Stefanik is just one example of the disruption Trump caused by pulling her nomination. And it\u2019s a situation she may be using to her advantage, asserting her close relationship with Trump and the fact that her vote is crucial for Republicans in the narrowly divided House.",
      "On Wednesday, House leaders were preparing to take a procedural step toward adopting a budget resolution to advance Trump\u2019s legislative agenda. At that point, Johnson had yet to announce Stefanik\u2019s new role, even though there were behind-the-scenes talks.",
      "Stefanik, who hadn\u2019t voted in the House since Trump withdrew her nomination on March 27, made the White House aware of the situation as officials were calling to whip budget votes, according to two sources familiar with the situation. Under pressure from Stefanik, Johnson decided to greenlight a public announcement about her new arrangement, the sources said.",
      "Stefanik then showed up to the Capitol for the key procedural vote, but she withheld her vote until the very last second, making her decisive in putting the measure over the finish line. Whether it was intentional or not, the maneuver was an unmistakable reminder to Stefanik\u2019s colleagues that they need her vote, which is why Trump asked her to stay in Congress.",
      "Moments after the vote, Stefanik \u2014 who gave up her post as House GOP conference chair when she was nominated for the ambassadorship \u2014 publicly announced her new role: chair of the House Republican leadership, a post that will come with additional staff and resources. Stefanik also announced she will return to her positions on the Intelligence, Education and Workforce, and Armed Services committees. Stefanik and Johnson then issued a joint release about the news 2\u00bd hours later.",
      "Some top Republicans, including other members on Johnson\u2019s leadership team, said they were caught off guard by the announcement. Stefanik\u2019s allies, however, note that Trump made it clear that he wants her to have a plum landing spot as quickly as possible and argue she has been nothing but the ultimate team player throughout the entire saga.",
      "There\u2019s still a question of what kind of leadership role, if any, Stefanik would assume on the Intelligence Committee. In the last Congress, she had been one of its most senior members. Had she not been tapped for the U.N. post, she would have been in contention to lead the panel after Johnson ousted Turner. Johnson named Crawford as the new chairman and made Rep. Trent Kelly, R-Miss., the vice chair.",
      "But Stefanik would have more seniority on the panel than Kelly, \u201cwhich would make her vice chair, technically,\u201d said the House lawmaker familiar with the deliberations about the panel. And subcommittee gavels have been awarded already\u00a0for the 119th Congress, the person said."

      "The people tasked with keeping the country safe from foreign government hackers and cybercriminal gangs say they feel like they\u2019re under attack, not from their usual adversaries but from the administration they work under.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s Wednesday order calling for a Justice Department investigation into Chris Krebs, the former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), has sent fresh shock waves through that agency\u2019s hallways, according to five employees who spoke with NBC News. Each spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "The order comes as the White House is downsizing the agency for at least the third time in three months.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a really tough time for all of us right now,\u201d said one employee. \u201cEvery day feels somehow more bizarre than the last. It is incredibly difficult to focus on our mission.\u201d",
      "Krebs, whom Trump appointed as CISA\u2019s inaugural director during his first term, quickly built the agency into the country\u2019s front-line digital defender of critical systems. But he also emerged as a surprising counterpoint to the president, particularly around his efforts to advance false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.",
      "The order Trump signed cites Krebs\u2019 insistence that there is no credible evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, despite Trump\u2019s false but often-repeated claims. Also signed by the homeland security secretary, it directs the attorney general to \u201ctake all appropriate action to review\u201d Krebs\u2019 activities.",
      "Employees who spoke to NBC News largely believe Trump\u2019s action was politically motivated. Trump also revoked Krebs\u2019 security clearance.",
      "\u201cI feel so sickened by this. It\u2019s a shocking abuse of power,\u201d one said.",
      "Trump\u2019s moves on Krebs and CISA come as the U.S. faces mounting cybersecurity challenges, most notably from China, which has in just the last two years shown its capability to penetrate deep into sensitive U.S. infrastructure as well as government systems, federal officials say. For-profit hackers have also turned ransomware into a  billion dollar criminal enterprise that shuts down hospitals, schools and many businesses.",
      "Republicans quickly coalesced around Trump\u2019s election claims and politicized the agency\u2019s efforts to coordinate with technology companies to secure elections, including how to counter the spread of foreign propaganda.",
      "Under Krebs, CISA coordinated a unified response from government agencies and states disputing false claims of election fraud, many of which Trump and his allies used to justify his attempts to stay in office. Trump fired Krebs two weeks after that election.",
      "\u201cThis EO targeting former director Krebs seems based in personal vendetta, and no American should be comfortable with that,\u201d another CISA employee said.",
      "Krebs declined to comment. On Wednesday evening, he reposted to X the message he first published in 2020 after Trump fired him: \u201cHonored to serve. We did it right. Defend Today, Secure Tomorrow. #Protect2020.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration is also currently purging CISA\u2019s workforce, according to emails to staff obtained by NBC News. The Department of Homeland Security, CISA\u2019s parent agency, sent a memo Monday evening that encouraged employees to retire early or take a buyout package by Monday.",
      "A\u00a0second email, sent by CISA acting director Bridget Bean, reiterated that offer.\u00a0Trump has nominated a permanent director, Sean Plankey, who has yet to be confirmed by the Senate. A CISA spokesperson declined to comment. The White House didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "A DHS spokesperson declined to share how many employees it expected to cut, but said in an emailed statement: \u201cEvery dollar spent and position filled at DHS should be focused on our core mission of securing our homeland and keeping the American people safe.\u201d",
      "Those buyout offers echo a round of emails that DHS sent to CISA employees in February. A DHS spokesperson told NBC News that month it had also cut more than 130 employees who had probationary status and that it deemed \u201cnon-mission critical personnel.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, before the Krebs news and as rumors spread that the second round of buyout offers was going out, Jen Easterly, who succeeded Krebs as CISA\u2019s director under President Joe Biden, posted to LinkedIn about why the cuts could hurt U.S. security.",
      "\u201cDegrading the capability and capacity of the federal cyber ecosystem\u2014whether by laying off hundreds of highly talented cyber professionals at America\u2019s cyber defense agency or by decapitating the highly effective, nonpartisan, and principled leadership of America\u2019s most important technical intelligence agency\u2014will only make Americans less safe and more vulnerable to our adversaries,\u201d Easterly wrote.",
      "One CISA employee said the repeated staff reductions hampered the agency\u2019s ability to secure critical infrastructure, which often relies on experts who are familiar with highly specialized computer programs and operating systems.",
      "\u201cThe cuts that happened initially have already severely degraded our capacity to defend critical infrastructure,\u201d the employee said. \u201cThe cuts that may come \u2014 I don\u2019t know what the numbers are going to look like \u2014 but they without a doubt will further degrade our ability to defend critical infrastructure.\u201c",
      "Trump\u2019s executive order also suspended the security clearances of employees at the cybersecurity company where Krebs works, SentinelOne.",
      "SentinelOne released a statement Thursday evening it would \u201cactively cooperate in any review of security clearances held by any of our personnel\u201d and that it views \u201cthe White House as a crucial collaborator.\u201d It did not defend Krebs.",
      "Another CISA employee said Trump\u2019s decision to target SentinelOne could start a chilling effect where employees feel pressured to ignore software vulnerabilities that might upset the president.",
      "\u201cWill there be pressure to not have a public vulnerability in a car company if the CEO is close to the president?\u201d the employee said. \u201cIt\u2019s like Iraq war intelligence. We\u2019re only going to say what they want to be the message, rather than telling the country about real threat.\u201d"

      "A federal indictment accuses Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs of dangling someone over a balcony in an allegation that is strikingly similar to an encounter alleged in separate lawsuits two women filed against the music mogul.",
      "Combs, 55, is charged in a five-count indictment with sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution.",
      "Combs, the founder of Bad Boy Records and one of the most prominent figures in the music industry, is being detained in a jail in Brooklyn, New York, until his trial, which is scheduled to start next month.",
      "Sign up for the \u201cDiddy on Trial\u201d newsletter for key developments and analysis",
      "The indictment has been amended three times with new allegations or charges, most recently last week to include an additional charge each of sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution.",
      "The second amended indictment, filed last month, alleged that Combs forced some of his employees to work long hours with little sleep and coerced an employee into having sex. The first amended indictment accused Combs of having coerced two additional women into sex acts and of having \u201cdangled a victim over an apartment balcony.\u201d",
      "He has pleaded not guilty to all of the allegations and charges, except for those filed last week. He is scheduled to enter a plea on those counts April 25.",
      "The criminal indictment was preceded by a civil suit filed in 2023 by his former longtime girlfriend, model and singer Casandra Ventura, 38. She alleged in the lawsuit that Combs had dangled a friend of hers over the balcony of a 17th-floor hotel suite in or around August 2015.",
      "Ventura alleged in the suit, which she and Combs settled privately within a day without his admitting any wrongdoing, that he subjected her to \u201csavage\u201d beatings, in which he punched, kicked and stomped on her, leaving her with bruises, burst lips and black eyes.",
      "She also claimed in the document that he plied her with drugs and forced her to have sex with male sex workers while he masturbated and recorded them. Ventura\u2019s suit and the indictment said Combs referred to the drug-fueled encounters as \u201cfreak offs.\u201d During some freak offs, the suit said, Combs would become extremely intoxicated and violent, hitting Ventura in the presence of the male sex workers.",
      "The original indictment referred only to Victim-1, whose accusations closely align with those in Ventura\u2019s suit.",
      "Ventura alleged in the lawsuit filed in 2023 that in the middle of a surprise dinner for her 29th birthday around August 2015, Combs insisted she leave the party to go to a hotel to participate in a freak off.",
      "When Ventura told him that she did not want to go, Combs had her cornered by his security staff to force her to leave with him, the suit said. After the alleged freak off, it said, the two went back to her hotel room where some of her friends were hanging out. While he was severely intoxicated, Combs lifted one of her friends and dangled the friend over the balcony of the 17th-floor suite, causing Ventura and her friends to fear Combs\u2019 \u201cerratic behavior,\u201d it said.",
      "Ventura was heavily sedated because of the drugs she took to participate in the freak off and was unable to respond to Combs\u2019 \u201cterrifying behavior,\u201d according to the suit.",
      "Ventura\u2019s attorney declined to comment for this article.",
      "In a different lawsuit filed against Combs last year in Los Angeles, Bryana Bongolan alleges there was a balcony encounter that she said occurred in 2016 instead of 2015, as Ventura said in her suit. The federal indictment did not include a date or any other details except that the victim was female.",
      "The two lawsuits also differed about whether Ventura responded to the alleged dangling. Whereas Ventura said she was heavily sedated and unable to respond, Bongolan said in her lawsuit that when Ventura saw Combs dangling Bongolan over the balcony, she shouted at Combs to stop.",
      "Bongolan, 33,\u00a0said in her lawsuit that she met Combs through her friendship with Ventura and that early on or about Sept. 26, 2016, she was sleeping in Ventura\u2019s apartment when Combs began shouting and banging on the door. The suit says he entered the apartment and \u201cadvanced on her\u201d while she was on the balcony.",
      "\u201cHe grabbed her, turned her back to his chest, and molested her by groping her breasts as she yelled to be left alone,\u201d the suit alleges.",
      "Bongolan, who is 4-foot-11 and weighed less than 100 pounds at the time, tried to resist Combs by throwing her weight back while he lifted her up on the banister of the 17th-floor balcony, but he \u201ceasily overpowered her,\u201d the suit says, adding that he lifted her up higher and over the balcony.",
      "Ventura emerged from her bedroom to see Combs holding Bongolan over the balcony and screamed for him to stop, the lawsuit says. Combs moved Bongolan from the balcony and slammed her onto patio furniture, including a table, it says.",
      "Bongolan\u2019s complaint says that she was an aspiring fashion designer when she met Combs and that she completed numerous design projects for him from 2016 to 2018.",
      "Bongolan\u2019s attorney, James Nikraftar, did not reply to emails and phone calls seeking comment for this article. He has previously told NBC News that Bongolan would not be speaking publicly.",
      "Representatives for Combs did not immediately reply to requests for comment. In a statement to Rolling Stone after Bongolan\u2019s suit was filed, a legal representative for Combs denied her allegations.",
      "\u201cAnyone has the right to file a lawsuit, regardless of the evidence they may or may not have,\u201d the representative told publication. \u201cSince last year, Ms. Bongolan has expressed an intention to sue Mr. Combs and has sought legal representation to pursue her claims.",
      "\u201cMr. Combs firmly denies these serious allegations and remains confident they will ultimately be proven baseless.\u201d",
      "Bongolan is seeking a jury trial and more than $10 million in damages for sexual battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress and false imprisonment. More than 50 civil lawsuits have been filed against Combs, accusing him of sexual misconduct. He has denied all of the allegations.",
      "Jury selection for Combs\u2019 criminal trial is scheduled to begin at the end of the month, and opening statements are scheduled to begin May 12."

    "summary": "The Trump administration conceded that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who officials allege is a member of the MS-13 gang, was wrongly deported to El Salvador.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday said that the Trump administration is required to \"facilitate\" the release of a Maryland man who was wrongly deported to an El Salvador prison.",
      "The court partly granted and partly rejected an emergency request filed by the Justice Department contesting a judge\u2019s order that Kilmar Abrego Garcia be retrieved from a prison in El Salvador where he was sent on March 15 along with alleged Venezuelan gang members.",
      "\u201cThe rule of law won today.\u00a0Time to bring him home,\" Andrew Rossman, one of Abrego Garcia's lawyers, said in an email.",
      "The decision means the administration does not immediately have to try to return Abrego Garcia to the United States because a judge-imposed deadline has already expired but \"should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps,\" the unsigned decision said.",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "The district court judge may have exceeded her authority in saying the government had to not just \"facilitate\" but also \"effectuate\" Abrego Garcia's return, the court added. The judge has to \"clarify its directive, with due regard to the deference owed to the executive branch in the conduct of foreign affairs,\" the court order said.",
      "There were no dissenting votes, but the court's three liberal justices signed onto a separate statement authored by Justice Sonia Sotomayor saying they agreed that \"the proper remedy is to provide Abrego Garcia with all the process to which he would have been entitled had he not been unlawfully removed to El Salvador.\"",
      "But Sotomayor added that she believed Chief Justice John Roberts should not have issued a temporary stay on Monday that meant the deadline for the government to act was missed.",
      "Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to a notorious El Salvador prison on March 15 as part of the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive and heavily contested plan to send alleged members of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua there.",
      "Immigration officials allege Abrego Garcia, who entered the United States illegally, is a member of the MS-13 gang but have conceded he should not have been sent to El Salvador, his country of birth, calling it an \u201cadministrative error.\u201d",
      "Abrego Garcia lived in Beltsville, Maryland, with his wife and three children, all of whom have special needs. He came to the United States to escape gang violence, his lawyers say.",
      "In 2019, the government began an effort to deport him, alleging that he was an MS-13 gang member. An immigration judge ruled Abrego Garcia could not be deported to El Salvador because there was \u201ca clear probability of future persecution.\u201d",
      "Until he was detained in March, he worked as a sheet metal worker in Maryland and checked in with immigration officials when required, his lawyers said.",
      "Last week, Maryland-based U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered that the government \u201cfacilitate and effectuate the return\u201d of Abrego Garcia by 11:59 p.m. on Monday.",
      "After failing to overturn the finding at an appeals court, the Trump administration turned to the Supreme Court.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in court papers that judges do not have the power to \u201cseize control over foreign relations\u201d by forcing officials to negotiate with El Salvador. He said the Trump administration has guaranteed that no one deported to the prison in El Salvador will be tortured.",
      "Abrego Garcia\u2019s lawyers described his removal to El Salvador as a \u201cKafka-esque mistake,\u201d saying the Salvadoran government was not actively seeking his extradition and that he had never been charged with a crime.",
      "His case is the latest high-profile legal battle arising from President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to exert broad presidential power to deport immigrants, often leading to claims that their rights have been violated.",
      "A Justice Department lawyer in the case was placed on administrative leave because of comments he made in court when he told the judge he was \u201cfrustrated\u201d that he could not answer some of her questions.",
      "In another case, the Supreme Court on Monday blocked a ruling by a federal judge that prevented alleged Venezuelan gang members being deported under a rarely invoked law called the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "In doing so the court said that Venezuelans targeted for deportation should be given a chance to challenge the government's action.",
      "Thursday's decision could give a boost to Venezuelans who were deported without due process before courts intervened."

    "story": [
      "Rita Daniels learned at 9 that she is the great-great-great-grandniece of famed abolitionist Harriet Tubman, who led countless enslaved Africans to freedom through the Underground Railroad. It was a moment that changed how she viewed herself and American history for the rest of her life.",
      "So when Daniels, now 70, learned in recent days that the National Park Service drastically altered its webpage on Tubman and the Underground Railroad in February, she was devastated.",
      "\u201cIt tore me apart when I saw the news clip flash across my phone,\u201d said Daniels, who recently co-authored a book about Tubman\u2019s life.",
      "In elementary school, Daniels was assigned to write about Tubman, but books she could access at her school in Auburn, New York \u2014 where Tubman settled in 1859 after fleeing enslavement in Maryland \u2014 described her as \u201ca thief,\u201d Daniels recalled. \u201cIt said she stole slaves, that there was a bounty on her head, those kind of things.\u201d",
      "When Daniels told her mother what she found, her mother not only told her it was untrue, she told Daniels that Tubman was her ancestor.",
      "That began a life in which Daniels leaned on Tubman\u2019s legacy for strength while also working to preserve history as an author and the founder of the Harriet Tubman Learning Center.",
      "The page had been changed in February, The Washington Post reported, swapping out a large image of Tubman for one of five postage stamps celebrating \u201cBlack/white cooperation.\u201d The description of the Underground Railroad was changed from \u201cthe resistance to enslavement through escape and flight\u201d to one that downplays the role of slavery, instead saying it was an expression of the \u201cAmerican civil rights movement\u201d that bridged \u201cthe divides of race.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was just basically shocked and hurt at the same time,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cMost of my adult life, I pretty much wanted to make sure that people know that her story is a critical part of Black history, which is American history.\u201d",
      "Daniels said that as a child, it felt both shocking and empowering to learn she came from the bloodline of one of the most significant figures in American history.",
      "\u201cAt that age, I didn\u2019t fully understand the race war in the country or why they would describe her that way in books,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I knew having her as a relative was special.\u201d",
      "She said Tubman\u2019s tenacity has been a significant influence in her life. When she was tormented for years by a stalker, Daniels sought strength from her ancestor.",
      "After years of persistent harassment that began when Daniels was 17, the man broke into her home and stabbed her repeatedly, including on her face, sending her for an extended hospital stay.",
      "\u201cI keep my aunt in my mindset when I fall or when I get into a mood of not wanting to move on or keep going,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cHer words were, \u2018Keep going. Never give up.\u2019 And that\u2019s what kept me going. Even when I had been beaten up, I referred to her words. So I kept going, no matter what. She\u2019s in my bloodlines and her words are in my head always.\u201d",
      "After the NPS website was changed to remove Tubman\u2019s words and a short account of her work shuttling dozens of enslaved people from bondage in the South to freedom in northern states, plus mention of the racist laws that forced the existence of the Underground Railroad,\u00a0public outcry came fast and loud. On Monday, the NPS said in a statement that the page had been deleted \u201cwithout approval\u201d from the agency\u2019s top brass and the original version was \u201cimmediately restored.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy question is: Why do they want to erase our Black history?\u201d Daniels asked. \u201cWhy are we such a threat to certain Americans? They want to remove or ignore very reputable Americans, Black Americans? Why? The answer is racism.\u201d",
      "The change was one of many on government websites that had been updated or erased as part of the Trump administration\u2019s sweeping effort to delete what it considers references to diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI. Jackie Robinson, who broke the color barrier in baseball, was also removed from the Army website and later restored, as was Colin Powell and Pearl Harbor hero Doris Miller.",
      "The backlash over attempts to gloss over Tubman\u2019s history and that of the Underground Railroad only underscores how important it is to preserve it, Daniels said.",
      "\u201cThis is the kind of impact Harriett Tubman had on many people, not just me,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cAnd they want to erase that? No. She\u2019s too important to our family and to American history to just be pushed aside. They can\u2019t call what she\u2019s done DEI.\u201d"

      "President Donald Trump suggested at a Cabinet meeting Thursday that undocumented people working on farms and in hotels would be allowed to leave the country and return as legal workers if their employers vouched for them.",
      "Trump said at the meeting with reporters present that \u201cwe have to take care of our farmers, the hotels and, you know, the various places where they tend to, where they tend to need people.\u201d",
      "\"So a farmer will come in with a letter concerning certain people, saying they\u2019re great, they\u2019re working hard. We\u2019re going to slow it down a little bit for them, and then we\u2019re going to ultimately bring them back. They\u2019ll go out. They\u2019re going to come back as legal workers.\"",
      "It was unclear what he meant by \u201cslow it down a little bit for them.\u201d The administration has been pouring resources into arresting, detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants to fulfill Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to conduct a history-making mass deportation of immigrants from the United States.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to work with them right from the beginning on, trying to get them back in legally. So it gives you real incentive. Otherwise they never come back. They\u2019ll never be allowed once a certain period of time goes by, which is probably going to be 60 days,\u201d he said.",
      "In response to an NBC News request for more details, White House spokesman Kush Desai said the Trump administration \"is committed to delivering on the mandate that the American people gave to President Trump with a whole-of-government approach to secure our borders, enforce our immigration laws, mass deport criminal illegal migrants, and put America First.\u201d",
      "The United States has programs that allow immigrants to come to the country and work, although employers often complain about the difficulties of using them. Farmworker and immigrant advocates have often pushed for better regulation of the programs to ensure workers are not exploited or abused or thrust into substandard living or work conditions.",
      "A White House official told NBC News that Trump wants to improve the H-2A program, through which employers in the agricultural industry can hire temporary and seasonal workers, and the H-2B program, for hiring immigrant workers for temporary, seasonal jobs in other industry sectors, such as hospitality and entertainment, and in the tourism industry. Trump has used the H-2B program.",
      "Trump spoke after Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem made statements about self-deportation and a Trump administration policy that requires people here illegally to register with the Department of Homeland Security using an app it has dubbed \"CBP Home\" or face criminal charges and fines. A federal judge on Thursday allowed the registration requirement to go forward.",
      "About 40% of U.S. crop farmworkers are undocumented, according to the Agriculture Department. About 1.1 million undocumented people worked in the hospitality industry \u2014 hotels and restaurants \u2014 about 7.6% of the workforce, in 2023, according to an analysis by the American Immigration Council, a legal group that advocates for immigration.",
      "The administration is estimated to have deported nearly 300 people last month, most of them originally from Venezuela, to a megaprison in El Salvador. Trump has declared the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua an \"alien enemy,\" and he invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1789, a wartime law, to deport people immigration officials designated as members of the gang, allegations relatives of some of the deported have contested.",
      "Immigration officers also have been arresting people at homes, schools and universities when they arrive for immigration check-ins or if they are stopped for traffic violations. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, along with Texas officials, made several arrests in a Texas community where many homeowners are Latino in February, stopping some people as they headed to work. ICE said at the time that several of them had criminal backgrounds.",
      "Trump has been under some pressure from industries whose workforces include undocumented workers. The pandemic showed that many essential workers were Latino and that in some industries, many were undocumented or were not citizens.",
      "American farmers also have been raising alarms about the effect Trump's tariff policies and funding cuts to federally subsidized school lunch, food banks and other such programs will have on their livelihoods.",
      "In March, business owners and leaders rallied in Washington and met with members of Congress as part of the American Business Immigration Coalition's \"Secure the Workforce\" campaign, aimed at continuing the flow of immigrant workers to the United States. The group is pushing for legislation that includes, among other things, work permits for immigrant workers.",
      "\"What we are seeing is President Trump beginning the negotiations of what a Trump-based immigration plan would look like,\" said Artemio Muniz, an attorney who employs workers through his manufacturing business and joined the coalition rally and meetings. He was not speaking on behalf of the American Business Immigration Coalition.",
      "He said that he and others supporting the coalition's campaign believe Trump has secured the border and that \"we now want to secure the undocumented workers because we don't want to lose them, because if we do, we see an increase in costs. I respect the fact that Trump is willing to initiate the discussion.\""

He shared the plans with President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0during a televised\u00a0Cabinet meeting.",
      "Trump\u00a0suggested that vaccines\u00a0could be to blame for autism rates, although decades of research have concluded there is no link between the two.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s got to be something artificial out there that\u2019s doing this,\u201d Trump told Kennedy. \u201cIf you can come up with that answer, where you stop taking something, eating something, or maybe it\u2019s a shot. But something\u2019s causing it.\u201d",
      "Autism is\u00a0a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain. It presents with a wide range of symptoms that can include delays in language, learning, and social or emotional skills.",
      "There\u2019s scientific consensus that childhood vaccines don\u2019t cause autism. Leading autism advocacy groups, including\u00a0Autism Speaks, agree.",
      "Research, including studies of twins, shows genes play a large role. No single environmental factor has been deemed a culprit. The National Institutes of Health, which already spends more than $300 million yearly researching autism, lists some possible risk factors such as prenatal exposure to pesticides or air pollution, extreme prematurity or low birth weight, certain maternal health problems or parents conceiving at an older age.",
      "Kennedy has offered no details on how his study will be different or what researchers will be involved. Leading autism organizations, such as the Autism Society of America, have not been included in discussions about the research, said ASA spokeswoman Kristyn Roth.",
      "Roth said many agree that more research is needed to determine what causes autism, but Kennedy\u2019s approach has raised alarms.",
      "\u201cThere is a deep concern that we are going backward and evaluating debunked theories,\u201d Roth said.",
      "Trump and Kennedy have both expressed concerns about\u00a0rising autism diagnoses rates.",
      "Some of that increase is due to increased awareness and a change in how the disability is diagnosed. For decades, the diagnosis was given only to kids with severe problems communicating or socializing and those with unusual, repetitive behaviors. But around 30 years ago, the term became shorthand for a group of milder, related conditions known as \u2033autism spectrum disorders.\u201d Milder autism cases are far more common than severe ones.",
      "With improved screening and autism services, diagnosis is increasingly happening at younger ages, too. And there\u2019s been more awareness and advocacy for Black and Hispanic families, leading to an increase in autism diagnosed among those groups.",
      "Still, anti-vaccine advocates, including Kennedy, have claimed that vaccines are to blame. The theory largely stems from a 1998 paper that was later retracted.",
      "Scientists have since ruled out a link between vaccines and autism, finding no evidence of increased rates of autism among those who are vaccinated compared to those who are not.",
      "Kennedy has hired David Geier, a man who has repeatedly claimed a link between vaccines and autism, to lead the autism research effort. The hiring of Geier, who the state of Maryland found was practicing medicine on a child without a doctor\u2019s license, was\u00a0first reported by The Washington Post.",
      "HHS did not immediately response to a request for comment."

      "In a ruling Thursday, Judge Trevor Neil McFadden sided with the administration, which had argued that they were simply enforcing an already existing requirement for everyone in the country who wasn\u2019t an American citizen to register with the government.",
      "The requirement goes into effect Friday.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security announced Feb. 25 that it was mandating that all people in the United States illegally register with the federal government, and said those who didn\u2019t self-report could face fines or prosecution. Failure to register is considered a crime, and people will be required to carry registration documents with them or risk prison time and fines.",
      "Registration will be mandatory for everyone 14 and older without legal status. People registering have to provide their fingerprints and address, and parents and guardians of anyone under age 14 must ensure they registered.",
      "The registration process also applies to Canadians who are in the U.S. for more than 30 days, such as so-called snowbirds who spend winter months in places like Florida.",
      "Federal immigration law has long required that people who aren\u2019t American citizens and live in the U.S., including those here illegally, register with the government. Those laws can be traced back to the Alien Registration Act of 1940, which came amid growing fears of immigrants and political subversives in the early days of World War II. The current requirements stem from the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.",
      "But the requirement that people illegally in the U.S. register has been enforced only in rare circumstances. In fact, advocates opposing the government say it hasn\u2019t been universally used since it was first introduced in the mid-1940s.",
      "It was used in a limited way after Sept. 11, 2001, when the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System required that all noncitizen males 16 and older from 25 countries \u2014 all but one of them majority Arab or Muslim \u2014 register with the U.S. government. The program led to no terrorism convictions but pulled more than 13,000 people into deportation proceedings. It was suspended in 2011 and dissolved in 2016.",
      "The Trump administration has argued that the registration requirement has always existed and that officials are simply enforcing it for everyone.",
      "The groups that sued say this registration process is expressly to facilitate President Donald Trump\u2019s aim of carrying out mass deportations of people in the country illegally.",
      "The plaintiffs also say the government should have gone through the more lengthy public notification process before bringing about the change.",
      "They argue that the registry puts people who work, contribute to the economy and have deep family ties in America into a deep bind: Do they come forward, register and essentially give up their location to a government intent on carrying out mass deportations, or do they stay in the shadows and risk being charged with the crime of not registering?",
      "The government has already asked people subject to the registration requirement to create an account on the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website."

In it, Rourke is heard making comments about Siwa in the backyard, including suggesting he could change the 21-year-old performer's sexuality.",

      "\u201cThat\u2019s homophobic, if that was your reasoning,\u201d Siwa said as she sat nearby.",

      "Moments later, Rourke shouted, \u201cI need a f\u2014!\u201d before gesturing toward Siwa and adding, \u201cI\u2019m not talking to you.\u201d",
      "Once again, Hughes stepped in, repeating, \u201cMickey, you can\u2019t say that.\u201d",
      "After Rourke left the backyard, Siwa told Hughes, \"It's crazy to me that that still exists.\" She then became visibly upset by the exchange and began to cry. Hughes comforted her. Inside, Rourke was summoned to the diary room.",
      "There, the voice of \"Big Brother\" addressed Rourke's behavior, according to ITV\u2019s summary of the episode.",
      "\u201cMickey, before you entered the Big Brother house, the rules regarding unacceptable language and behavior were explained to you,\u201d a voice told him. His remarks were read back, and he was asked, \u201cDo you understand how this language could be offensive to your housemates or the viewing public?\u201d",
      "Rourke replied, \u201cYes, I do. It\u2019s some serious stuff.\u201d",
      "The actor was then given a formal warning. \u201cFurther language or behavior of this nature could lead to you being removed from the Big Brother house. Mickey, do you understand?\u201d",
      "\u201cYes,\u201d Rourke responded. \u201cI apologize. I don\u2019t have dishonorable intentions \u2014 I\u2019m just talking smack, you know. I wasn\u2019t taking it all so serious. I didn\u2019t mean any bad intentions, and if I did, sorry.\u201d",
      "Later, Rourke addressed the group and offered an apology directly to Siwa.",
      "\u201cI want to apologize. I\u2019ve got a habit of having a short fuse, and I don\u2019t mean nothing by it,\u201d he said.",
      "During a later conversation involving Rourke, Siwa and castmate Danny Beard, the winner of season four of \"RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK,\" Rourke asked whether the term \u201cdrag\u201d was still appropriate to use.",
      "Siwa responded saying, \u201cAnything is OK to say in context and intention\u2026 and if you say something wrong but you didn\u2019t know and you\u2019re open to hearing, it\u2019s all good.\u201d",
      "Despite the apology, Siwa later cited Rourke\u2019s behavior as the reason behind her \u201ckiller nomination,\u201d the ability given to one contestant to nominate a person to be evicted after a public vote.",
      "\u201cHe said some pretty hurtful things,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think one thing you really have to do in the Big Brother house is care about others. Him saying that flat out today, honestly, made the killer nomination choice pretty easy.\u201d",
      "Siwa continued, \u201cI feel like a lot of the public isn\u2019t going to be too happy with Mickey after seeing how this day went. So I do think it\u2019s possible that he could be evicted from the house.\u201d"

    "summary": "\"Good American Family\" star Imogen Faith Reid and the creator Katie Robbins detail the turning point in Natalia Grace's life in the show's fifth and sixth episodes.",
    "story": [
      "\u201cGood American Family\u201d viewers saw a shift in perspective in the Hulu drama\u2019s fifth episode.",
      "Titled \u201cToo Hurty Without It,\u201d Episode 5 puts the spotlight on Natalia Grace \u2014 portrayed by 27-year-old British actor Imogen Faith Reed \u2014 after her adoptive parents, Michael and Kristine Barnett, move and leave her on her own in a small apartment.",
      "The episode, creator and co-showrunner Katie Robbins tells TODAY.com, was meant to make viewers question \u201ceverything they\u2019ve seen before and their assumptions that they\u2019ve made\u201d surrounding Natalia and her circumstances.",
      "\u201cGood American Family\u201d is a fictionalization of Grace\u2019s true story. Born in Ukraine with a rare form of dwarfism, Grace was adopted by a New Hampshire couple in 2008, before they put her up for re-adoption in 2010, according to a 2021 document from the Court of Appeals in Indiana obtained by TODAY.com.",
      "Grace was then adopted by Michael and Christine Barnett, who began to suspect that she was not a little girl, but a grown adult who was trying to kill them. According to the Court of Appeals document, Grace's Ukrainian adoption paperwork stated she was born in 2003.",
      "The couple had Grace medically and psychologically tested, before they successfully had a court order to change her birth year from 2003 to 1989, \u201cbased on age estimates provided by a primary care physician and social worker,\u201d per the document from the Indiana Court of Appeals.",
      "Grace has maintained that she was a child at the time of her adoption, and that Kristine Barnett told her to say she was older. \u201cI was terrified of her. I was terrified, so when Kristine told me to tell people that I was 22, I listened because I didn\u2019t know what she would have me do. I didn\u2019t know what she would do to me,\u201d Grace says in the documentary \"The Curious Case of Natalia Grace.\"",
      "\u201cShe threatened me into telling people lies. At first I said, \u2018No, I\u2019m a kid,\u2019 and I guess she just got so mad,\" she continued.",
      "According to a 2019 affidavit filed in the Tippecanoe Court in Indiana obtained by\u00a0TODAY.com, a doctor at Peyton Manning Children\u2019s Hospital examined Grace and determined her age was about 8. A skeletal examination of Grace found she was 11 years old in 2012, per the affidavit.",
      "The document from the Indiana Court of Appeals also states that in 2013, the Barnetts did in fact move Grace into two apartments in Indiana and helped her get federal disability benefits and supportive services to help her \u201cas an adult.\u201d The couple then relocated to Canada with their three biological children.",
      "This is where Episode 5 starts. Prior to that, \u201cGood American Family\u201d was told from Kristine Barnett (Ellen Pompeo) and Michael Barnett\u2019s (Mark Duplass) perspective, depicting Natalia as a sinister adult pretending to be a child.",
      "The latest episode details Natalia living on her own without her walker. She struggles with everyday tasks like turning on the shower and getting into the bathtub, which makes her unable to bathe herself. Because of her small stature, she isn't able to reach the top cabinets in the kitchen and finds it difficult to make herself a meal. She is seen spending her days in front of the television, eating junk food as the apartment becomes a mess.",
      "All alone, at one point, she accidentally cuts her hand trying to open a can of food.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Natalia says, as her hand is covered in blood. \u201cMommy, please mommy. I don\u2019t know how to take care of this.\u201d",
      "She seeks help from a neighbor, who confuses her for a child, but Natalia tells her she's an adult who looks young.",
      "\u201cI remember reading the script and thinking, \u2018OK, this is going to be a big episode for me,\u201d Reid tells TODAY.com. \u201cIt was a little daunting because it\u2019s just me and long hours on set.\u201d",
      "The episode, Robbins tells TODAY.com, is the first time Natalia is seen on screen by herself.",
      "\u201cOne might not realize it watching the first four episodes, but in those first four episodes, you\u2019re never in a scene only with\u00a0Natalia. She can only be in a scene if she\u2019s in a scene with Kristine or Michael, because those episodes are from their perspective,\u201d Robbins says. \u201cSo by the time you get to (Episode) 5 and you\u2019re on the other side of that door, it\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve been in a room alone with her.\u201d",
      "As the episode continues, viewers see Natalia getting into trouble after she and the neighbor\u2019s grandson take the bus and get lost while attempting to go to the Barnetts\u2019 home.",
      "She is treated poorly by adoptive parents, who after the incident have to move her to a new apartment, which happens to be on the second floor and even smaller. The hardships continue for Natalia, who feels abandoned, yet attempts to \u201cstraighten up\u201d to earn her family\u2019s love.",
      "\u201cAll of a sudden you have to say, \u2018Oh my gosh, all these things that have come to believe about her, were they true, or were they not true?'\u201d",
      "Katie Robbins",
      "'\u201cAll of a sudden you have to say, \u2018Oh my gosh, all these things that have come to believe about her, were they true, or were they not true?'\u201d Robbins says. \u201cAnd that episode was incredibly emotional to write, and it was incredibly emotional to film.\u201d",
      "Robbins says that watching Reid film her solo scenes was incredibly emotional for everyone on set.",
      "\u201cWatching (Imogen) play those scenes, people on our crew, people who have been doing this job for decades and who have seen it all, seasoned pros, were crying watching her because of the vulnerability that she brings and because of the themes that it deals with,\u201d Robbins adds.",
      "Reid tells TODAY.com that the fifth episode does \u201csuch an amazing job\u201d of showing her character\u2019s point of view.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s just been abandoned, and she's not only 8 years old, but she has a disability, and it\u2019s just so heartbreaking to see her go through all of that,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd for her, to just get worse and worse as we go on, because (she) can\u2019t look after herself, Episode 5 is something that I\u2019m genuinely so proud of.\u201d",
      "Viewers will continue to see life from Natalia\u2019s perspective when Episode 6 of \u201cGood American Family\u201d premieres Wednesday, April 16."

    "story": [
      "If you\u2019re upset that there\u2019s no royal jam in Montecito, you had better compote yourself.",
      "On April 2, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, released the first eight products from her lifestyle brand As Ever. From Herbal Hibiscus Tea to Flower Sprinkles (which showed up on her Netflix show, \u201cWith Love, Meghan\u201d), everything flew off the virtual shelves within an hour.",
      "Given Meghan\u2019s air of luxuriousness, folks have been wondering how the brand would do as fears of a recession loom large, but in an April 8 interview with Fortune, Meghan said she wasn\u2019t worried.",
      "\u201cAt the moment, all of our products are currently made in the U.S., so we don\u2019t anticipate tariffs affecting us directly,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as we look at the larger context of how this is going to affect the consumer day to day, I\u2019m very grateful that in part of the conception of this brand, I wanted to create products that look more prestige, but are more accessible and affordable. I think during any time of recession, people still want to find creature comforts, items that can bring them joy.\u201d",
      "I was one of the lucky souls to be able to secure a jar of her Raspberry Spread\u00a0 \u2014 which retails for $9, or $15 with a keepsake box \u2014 which the brand says is \u201cwhere it all began.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s also the spread that everyone seems to be talking about online, from Instagram to TikTok, so I was eager to try it.",
      "First thing\u2019s first: This isn\u2019t jam.",
      "Months ago, every celebrity from\u00a0Chrissy Teigen\u00a0to \u201cReal Housewives of Beverly Hills\u201d star Garcelle Beauvais gabbed about the royal\u2019s \u201cjam,\u201d but Meghan actually\u00a0sent 50 jars of strawberry\u00a0spread\u00a0labeled with brand\u2019s old name \u2014\u00a0American Riviera Orchard\u00a0\u2014 and nothing about its contents. We\u2019ve been jam-boozled by the glitterati.",
      "With all that in mind, I was assuming a thick texture when I opened the jar and almost spilled it all over myself. The confusion is widespread \u2014 and valid! \u2014 as fruit cooked with sugar goes by a bevy of names: jam, jelly, chutney, marmalade and more.",
      "This raspberry spread has pectin in it, like jam typically does, but it isn\u2019t like the jam you find on store shelves.",
      "To compare, Bonne Maman\u2019s Raspberry Preserves \u2014\u00a0also not jam \u2014 has similar ingredients, including pectin, but is much thicker. I would call this a syrup, compote or coulis. Meghan is calling it \u201cspread,\u201d though \u2014 so spread it is!",
      "Tastewise, I found it fresh and bright. The raspberry sweetness gives way to a lemony tartness I found really refreshing paired with whipped cream cheese on an English muffin. The consistency, though surprising at first, gives it a homemade feel, as does the ratio of raspberry to lemon. It tasted like a sunny day, even though it\u2019s overcast as I stare out my window.",
      "I don\u2019t think the spread would work on a closed sandwich, though: It would likely sploosh out of a peanut butter and jelly \u2014 er, spread \u2014 leaving your hands a sticky mess. On the other hand, I suspect this spread would go fabulously in a crepe \u2014 which is probably a reason the brand sells mix for that, too \u2014 or poured over pancakes.",
      "I was pleasantly surprised by how different this product and the others I\u2019ve tried are from that of competitors in the market. Last night, I tried the Herbal Peppermint Tea and it was so minty, I felt like I was drinking a pack of liquid Altoids \u2014 an unexpected feeling, but not a bad one.",
      "I\u2019m excited to try more products from Meghan\u2019s brand as it expands \u2014 but only if I can get my hands on them fast enough."

      "Noah Wyle says he's \"profoundly sad and disappointed\" about a legal action alleging the Max hit \"The Pitt\" is an unsanctioned revival of \"ER,\" 16 years after the legendary NBC drama ended its run.",
      "Wyle, a cast member of both shows and an executive producer on \"The Pitt,\" spoke to Variety about his reaction to the lawsuit filed by the estate of late author and executive producer Michael Crichton, who wrote the screenplay for what became the pilot episode of \"ER.\"",
      "\u201cThe only thing that I can legally speak to is how I feel emotionally, which is just profoundly sad and disappointed,\" Wyle said. \"This taints the legacy, and it shouldn\u2019t have. At one point, this could have been a partnership. And when it wasn\u2019t a partnership, it didn\u2019t need to turn acrimonious. But on the 30th anniversary of \u2018ER,\u2019 I\u2019ve never felt less celebratory of that achievement than I do this year.\u201d",
      "Crichton's estate, which includes his widow, Sherri Crichton, filed a lawsuit in August 2024 accusing the creators of \"The Pitt\" of breach of contract and two other counts. Wyle, former \"ER\" producer R. Scott Gemmill and executive producer John Wells were among the named defendants. Gemmill created \"The Pitt,\" and Wells is an executive producer on the show along with Wyle.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Sherri Crichton's attorney for comment and has not yet heard back.",
      "Wyle, 53, played Dr. John Carter, a young hotshot doctor, on \u201cER,\u201d and portrays Dr. Michael \u201cRobby\u201d Robinavitch, a grizzled veteran of the emergency room at a Pittsburgh hospital, in \u201cThe Pitt.\"",
      "\u201cNoah Wyle\u2019s character is Dr. John Carter from \u2018ER\u2019 in all but name, only 30 years later, and imbued with the experience and lessons learned during the 15-year run of the original series,\u201d the lawsuit alleges.",
      "The defendants started work on an \"ER\" reboot in 2020 with plans for it to air on HBO Max, according to the complaint. The lawsuit alleges the defendants did this \"without any notice\" to Sherri Crichton and with \"brazen disregard\" of contractual rights of Michael Crichton's estate, according to the complaint.",
      "The creators of \u201cThe Pitt\u201d argued that making the show was a \u201cconstitutionally protected act of free speech,\u201d according to a\u00a0ruling by the Superior Court of California in February.",
      "Wyle told Variety that he and \u201cThe Pitt\u201d creators purposefully set out to do a different show after the negotiations with Crichton's estate over an \u201cER\u201d revival fell apart.",
      "\u201cWe pivoted as far in the opposite direction as we could in order to tell the story we wanted to tell \u2014\u202fand not for litigious reasons, but because we didn\u2019t want to retread our own creative work,\u201d Wyle said.",
      "\u201cWe really wanted to find something new for ourselves,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd in some ways, that\u2019s what was so disheartening about the whole thing. We really felt like we\u2019d done it.\u201d",
      "Wyle told Variety that an \"ER\" reboot \"got pretty close to being a reality,\" but Warner Bros. Television could not come to an agreement with Sherri Crichton, who oversees her late husband's estate.",

He was like, \u2018Wait, there\u2019s a way out of this?\u2019 fine. I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to keep the person I love alive. I think he made the right choice. He didn\u2019t know,\u201d she says.",
      "But the limits of Rivermind become apparent. First, the prices go up. So does the area where the streaming works. If they want to leave their county, they have to pay more.",
      "Then, Amanda\u2019s brain becomes a transmitter for commercials. While speaking to people, Amanda (unbeknownst to her) randomly spouts out an ad poorly tailored to the conversation topic. This puts her job in jeopardy.",
      "The couple finds themselves in bind after bind. They can barely afford Rivermind Common but they need Rivermind Plus so Amanda can keep her job. To make money, Mike secretly joins a dark web site called Dum Dummies \u2014 where you participate in gross, cruel and unhealthy challenges to get money.",
      "Unable to keep upgrading, Amanda\u2019s quality of life completely deteriorates. She has to sleep 12 hours a day and more to \u201cgive back to the grid.\u201d Even after that, she\u2019s never truly rested.",
      "For their anniversary, Mike saves up to gift Amanda 12 hours of Rivermind Lux, which comes with an app where she can dial up or down settings like relaxation, pleasure and even change her skills if she wants to borrow certain attributes from another Rivermind user (like tennis or parkour, for example). But soon, she\u2019s plunged back to her old, terrible existence.",
      "Things keep getting worse \u2014 they lose their income. Mike is fired after after a coworker finds him on Dum Dummies and exposes him to the whole workplace, and Mike initiates a fight.",
      "With no other options, they try to plead their case to Gaynor at Rivermind, saying they are loyal customers. But Gaynor tells them there is nothing she can do. Mike mentions there\u2019s still a little bit of their baby money they could use. Gaynor\u2019s only response to this is that pregnancy costs $90 more a month as pregnancy is a lot for one\u2019s brain to process \u2014 shutting out their long dream of having a child.",
      "What happens in the end of 'Common People'?",
      "Another year goes by and Amanda and Mike are physically different. Both look weaker and more tired. Amanda, constantly sleeping, has lost hair and struggles to move without Mike\u2019s help. Mike is missing a tooth (implying he pulled it out for Dum Dummies) and looks thinner.",
      "They\u2019ve lost all hope in life, which is apparent when Mike sells their crib to a young couple (who want to set it on fire for a music video, not actually use it).",
      "Fast forward to their anniversary once again. While in full health, the couple would always take a romantic getaway to the Juniper Lodge. But they can no longer afford that. Instead, Mike asks Amanda if she would sit in the backyard with him. There, he presents her with the best gift he can: a 30-minute booster pack to Rivermind Lux.",
      "Amanda asks Mike how he could afford it, revealing that she now knows about Dum Dummies and seemingly doesn\u2019t approve. Mike reassures her that it wasn\u2019t another tooth thing, instead a \u201cprivate buyer\u201d had a \u201cspecialist thing\u201d (which is also sinister).",
      "Using the Rivermind Lux booster pack, Mike slides her \u201cserenity\u201d up to the maximum setting. Amanda, although still physically sick, looks much more at peace.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s time,\u201d Amanda says. Mike begins to protest, saying they\u2019ll be \u201cOK for a little while.\u201d",
      "But Amanda calmly insists that \u201cit\u2019s time.\u201d Mike tells her \u201conly if you\u2019re sure.\u201d She is. He kisses her hand, causing her to breathe a sigh of relief.",
      "\u201cDo it when I\u2019m not here,\u201d she asks, which he nods to before collapsing onto her shoulder in a fit of sobs.",
      "The second Rivermind Lux ends, Amanda begins yet another ad (this time for antidepressants), revealing one of two things: Rivermind Plus now has ads too or, as the title suggests, they are \u201ccommon people\u201d and needed to downgrade to Rivermind Common.",
      "As she continues her ad, Mike fulfills her final wish by suffocating her with a pillow. He whispers to her that it's OK as she continues her ad underneath the pillow until she dies.",
      "Mike leaves his wife\u2019s dead body to enter a room where Dum Dummies is livestreaming. All he brings is a box cutter knife, closing the door behind him.",
      "This ending implies that a depressed Mike has decided to take his own life on livestream.",
      "What Jones and Ross make of the ending",
      "Jones says the ending is meant to show how desperate things become for Mike and Amanda, and why they felt this was their only option.",
      "\u201cThe episode intentionally covers a really long passage of time. I think that\u2019s on purpose. This is not a six month frivolous decision. Oh, this is uncomfortable. I don\u2019t want to live like this. It\u2019s years and years of strain financially, physically and emotionally on the two of them,\u201d she says.",
      "Jones approves of what Mike did on an ethical level. \"I do believe that everybody should have some say in the way they die. She clearly wanted that for him and wanted that for herself. She made that really clear,\" she says.",
      "Ultimately, she feels Amanda had \u201cno choice.\u201d Ross agrees, saying there was \u201cno way out\" for Amanda.",
      "\u201cIt got tighter and tighter and smaller and smaller. To the point that the choice that is made feels like the loving choice,\u201d she says.",
      "She feels Gaynor was similarly trapped. \u201cI think she\u2019s doing her job and she also was sadly perpetuating a cycle that she was also a part of. She\u2019s a Riverminder \u2014 and not just because she works there. Maybe this is how she has to pay off her bills. Maybe this is what she did to sign up \u2014 her husband signed her up to be a part of selling so that she could stay alive,\" she says.",
      "Part of what the episode left her with, Ross says, is that technology is the \u201cfast choice\u201d \u2014 but we don\u2019t always think about \u201cwhat the experience will be on the long end.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what this episode and so many \u2018Black Mirror\u2019 episodes beg to ask of the audience. To ask those questions before you\u2019re in the position where you don\u2019t have a chance to ponder and to dialogue.\u201d",
      "But, Jones says, the impetus is on the people who develop technology to be asking these questions.",
      "\u201cI wish there was an ethical board,\u201d Ross says.",
      "\u201cWhatever the Hippocratic oath \u2014 there should be an Einstein oath. All people in tech agree on this one thing,\u201d Jones says."

      "Bowen Yang is revisiting a \"painful\" part of his adolescent years.",
      "In a preview clip for the April 13 episode of \"Sunday Sitdown with Willie Geist,\" Yang, who is one of a few openly LGBTQ+ cast members in the 50-year history of \"Saturday Night Live,\" recalled what it was like to go to gay conversion therapy as a teenager.",
      "When Geist asked him how he worked through that \"difficult\" time in his life, Yang replied, \"I didn\u2019t really get to work through it.\"",
      "\"I think I probably wasn\u2019t brave enough back then to express that or to package it in a way that they could understand,\" he said, referring to his parents. \"Because it felt completely foreign to them and it was completely foreign to them. I 'came out,' quote, unquote, in the sense that my parents just sort of stumbled upon something.\"",
      "In an interview with The New York Times, Yang explained that he \"came out\" to his parents when he was 17 and his parents discovered him having \"lewd conversations\" with someone on AOL Instant Messenger.",
      "Due to the way his parents learned about his sexuality, Yang told Geist they had a hard time dealing with the news.",
      "\"They were like, 'Oh, we didn\u2019t realize this is what we were dealing with. Where we come from, this doesn\u2019t happen.' That was sort of their concept of it. And so I give them a lot of grace for that because they just have no context for it. And so we went to conversion therapy,\" he said.",
      "Yang explained that his parents gave him an ultimatum. Either he does the conversion therapy and could attend school with his sister at New York University or he stays at home in Denver and attends a local college there.",
      "Though the latter didn't seem that bad, Yang explained that the only choice for him was to go to the Big Apple.",
      "\"I just knew I had to live there,\" he said. \"And so I kind of played along and I kind of just humored them and myself into seeing what it was. And not knowing that it was ultimately very painful and detrimental and there was a lot of healing that happened after that.\"",
      "Part of that healing included Yang's journey to find himself.",
      "\"Identity is this really fickle thing. It\u2019s not something that you arrive at until much later in life I think,\" the 34-year-old shared. \"Like, I think I didn\u2019t really get a grasp on who I was until two years ago.\"",
      "According to Human Rights Campaign, conversion therapy\u00a0is \"a range of dangerous and discredited practices that falsely claim to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity or expression.\"",
      "The site states that this type of therapy can \"lead to depression, anxiety, drug use, homelessness, and suicide.\"",
      "The practice has since been banned for minors in 19 states,\u00a0including Colorado, where Yang was subjected to the treatment.",
      "Though Yang endured a lot in his childhood, he told People in 2021 that he is now in a \u201chealthy place\u201d with his parents.",

    "story": [
      "(Warning: This article contains spoilers for \"Severance\" Season Two.)",
      "Season Two of \"Severance\" wrapped with a gripping finale that's left fans buzzing over Mark S.'s decision.",
      "In a stunning twist, Adam Scott's character chooses to remain on Lumon's severed floor with Helly R. (Britt Lower), instead of escaping with his beloved wife, Gemma (Dichen Lachman).",
      "What it all means is anyone's guess. Unfortunately, what becomes of the trio \u2014 and answers to the show's many other lingering questions \u2014 will have to wait until Season Three, which has been confirmed, but has yet to receive a release date.",
      "In the meantime, Lachman, who plays the tortured Gemma (or Ms. Casey, if you will), sat down with TODAY.com to talk about innies, the reality of working with Ben Stiller and if she got to interact with the show's real breakout stars: the goats.",
      "Not knowing the 'Severance' plot",
      "According to Lachman, many of the show's pivotal plot points, including the fact that Gemma's innie husband, Mark S., was spending his work days tweaking her consciousness, were as much of a surprise to her as they were to fans.",
      "\"I didn't actually know that that was what Mark was doing on the computer until very, very late. I think even after Season One had ended. It had been months and months and months until I had that information,\" Lachman tells TODAY.com of the major \"Severance\" revelation.",
      "Was it a challenge not to know?",
      "\"Sometimes it's challenging, but on this show, I really feel like they've always been very open telling me what I needed to know in order to do my job,\" Lachman explains, saying that even though parts of the \"Severance\" plot were kept under wraps, she trusted that it was all part of the process.",
      "\"I feel like I'm a big believer in just trusting the universe to some degree,\" she adds. \"If this is the group of people, this is the way they work, that creates this beautiful magic, then just surrender to it and go with the flow.\"",
      "On why she thinks 'Severance' is 'relatable'",
      "While the \"Severance\" concept of living a completely separate work and home life is pure fiction, the idea of having different versions of ourselves isn't far-fetched at all.",
      "\"I think that so many people relate to having duality and having different parts of themselves that they want to live,\" says Lachman.",
      "\"It's that desire when you are in a job that you feel isn't fulfilling you, or you're in a relationship that isn't fulfilling you, parts of yourself start dividing and you want to explore other things, or other things draw your attention. That's why it's so relatable,\" she explains.",
      "People can have many different facets and interests, including Lachman.",
      "\"I definitely have lots of different innies,\" she says. \"I have the gardener innie, the cook innie, the mom innie, the work innie. I feel like I compartmentalize myself into so many different versions of myself and so many different things give me joy, and I put my 100% focus into that.\"",
      "Before working with Ben Stiller, she was a fan",
      "Ben Stiller, star of comedies like \"Zoolander\" and \"Meet the Parents,\" serves as executive producer and primary director of \"Severance,\" and Lachman says working with the Hollywood veteran has been nothing short of \"thrilling.\"",
      "\"There's this excitement that Ben has when he's directing,\" she says.",
      "She calls Stiller's passion and dedication to \"Severance\" inspiring and because of that, \"it elevates everyone's work around him\" \u2014\u00a0including hers.",
      "\"His energy makes me want to be better. It makes me want to be the best I can be, the most committed I can be, and just give it everything I\u2019ve got. And I found it one of the highlights of my careers to work with him,\" she says.",
      "Even before she worked with Stiller in \"Severance,\" Lachman says she was a fan.",
      "\"'Reality Bites' was my favorite movie growing up. I grew up, not in America, and I was just dying to get a Big Gulp from a 7-Eleven. It was like one of those things that I just felt like would make me so cool,\u201d she says of the 1994 movie.",
      "\"(Stiller is) legendary, and it is a little bit of a transition to just get over that entertainment deity-like person and then realize you\u2019re actually working together to achieve the same goal,\" Lachman explains.",
      "Beyond that? \"He's wonderful at just making you feel comfortable. And as an actor, directing an actor, there\u2019s a level of empathy there that I haven\u2019t experienced before. So I feel just so grateful that I had that opportunity.\"",
      "On getting 'headbutted' by a goat",
      "Of all the plot twists and head trips on \"Severance,\" it's the goats  that have arguably sparked the most conversation, making them the show's biggest breakout celebrities.",
      "When asked if she got the chance to interact with Emile or any of the other \u201cMammalians Nurturable,\" Lachman says despite wanting to pet them, she didn't have much interaction.",
      "\"The others had an opportunity to work with the goats. I, sadly, only got to sort of wave to them from afar, but they're so cute,\" she says.",
      "Perhaps it was for the best because according to the \"Severance\" actor, her past experience with the animals hasn't always been great.",
      "\"I did once, in a very old movie, get headbutted by a goat. That wasn't on film, but I have worked with goats before and they can be quite diva-ish.\""

      "He continued, \u201cIf you\u2019re not sleeping well or not able to do your job, that can bring on sadnesses. I\u2019m not necessarily prone to depression, but I can see how those things can be triggers.\"",

      "\u201cI sing the warm-up before the show actually comes on, and that\u2019s kind of my major gauge, whether or not I can talk normally afterwards. And that\u2019s when I know if I\u2019m in my better health zone or not,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere were some cold opens where I was very raspy and hoarse and voice crackly because I had just finished singing and my throat hadn\u2019t had a chance to calm down yet, but we had to go right into the show.\u201d",

I ended up being diagnosed with GERD,\" Thompson said on April 7.",
      "\"I was given a prescription that worked for me, and, you know, (I'm) trying to spread the message, basically, because it is a very uncomfortable situation. I just want people to get the help that they need if they need it.\"",
      "The Mayo Clinic reports that most people can manage GERD symptoms with lifestyle adjustments and medication. In some rare cases, however, surgery is required.",
      "During his interview with Entertainment Weekly, Thompson, who has been on \u201cSNL\u201d for 22 seasons, answered the question that's been on fans' minds since he broke the\u00a0record for the longest-tenured cast\u00a0member: Has he considered leaving the show?",

Thompson has also appeared in several films and television shows, including starring in \u201cKenan,\u201d his own sitcom on NBC.",

Just never leave the show,\u201d he said. \u201cThirty (seasons) is like, okay, that\u2019s just another number kind of thing. Twenty was just such a thing that nobody had ever done. People had gotten into their teens before, but nobody had gotten all the way up to 20. And then I was close to doing it.\"",

      "Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner are finally telling Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian how they feel.",
      "After seeing Kardashian\u2019s reunion with Lamar Odom on the first episode of Season 6 of \u201cThe Kardashians,\u201d Kendall Jenner told Kylie Jenner that she felt like her older sister was \u201ccold\u201d towards Odom.",
      "Kardashian and Odom were married for four years until she filed for divorce from the former Lakers star in 2013. Odom was later found unresponsive in a brothel in 2015 after an overdose and was hospitalized on life support. Kardashian remained by his side during his recovery.",
      "In 2016, the duo ended their marriage for good when they officially got divorced. On the show, Kardashian said that she hadn\u2019t seen Odom in nine years, but she wanted to reunite with him so that she could return some of his belongings.",
      "Their face-to-face meeting, which played out over the first two episodes of Season 6, was tense. Kardashian lost her cool when Odom called her \u201cbabe.\u201d Her sisters thought she could have been kinder during the meeting.",
      "\u201cI could tell you were shut off,\u201d Kendall Jenner told Kardashian. \u201cLike, it wasn\u2019t that you were blatantly being mean or rude. It was just like \u2014 are you thinking people are going to judge the way you handle it? Or is it that you\u2019re more guarded? I don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "Kendall Jenner elaborated in a confessional, saying, \u201cI think she\u2019s still holding on to a lot, I see such a hostility, still and almost like, there\u2019s definitely a wall, definitely a coldness. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s anger. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s so many reasons as to why.\u201d",
      "Kardashian responded to her sister and told her that she didn\u2019t notice she was \u201cgetting really anxious\u201d during her reunion with Odom. She explained that some \u201ctriggers\u201d happened during the event, like him showing up late and sweating.",
      "\u201cI could tell in the moment I\u2019m so guarded,\u201d Kardashian said in a confessional. \u201cI knew this man so well, and I was a secret keeper, a lover, a best friend. I was so many things, and then you\u2019re just nothing, and then to see someone \u2026 it\u2019s almost like this flood of emotions. It\u2019s so many things to process. But in that moment, I could tell I was really uncomfortable.\u201d",
      "While talking with her sisters, Kardashian explained that she might\u2019ve acted like a \u201cb---h\u201d during her reunion with Odom because she\u2019s so used to people \u201cnitpicking\u201d her small gestures and she didn\u2019t want anyone to \u201cread into this too much because it\u2019s not like that.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut also, I think a lot of it is a defense mechanism that I am just like, be a b----,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cWould you call him again if you feel that way, and just be like, \u2018Hey, I handled that, maybe not how I would have liked?\u201d Kylie Jenner asked.",
      "Kardashian told her youngest sister that she wouldn\u2019t have a problem with calling Odom up and telling him that she might\u2019ve been a little rude during their encounter.",
      "Kendall Jenner, who had sympathy for Kardashian, said, \u201cAt this point for yourself, I would almost say you have to find it within you to forgive. You don\u2019t have to forget.\u201d",
      "The interaction made Kardashian realize how much her younger sisters don\u2019t understand the situation between her and Odom.",
      "\u201cI think what is so frustrating about all of this is that they don\u2019t really understand. I think anyone that knows my situation or that has been in that situation would be a different version of themselves this many years later. It would be foolish not to be,\u201d she said in a confessional. \u201cYou have to protect yourself and grow from that scenario. I\u2019m a different person than I was, and that\u2019s not bad or good, it just is what it is.\u201d",
      "Kardashian explained she put up her walls for a reason.",
      "\u201cOf course, my family can see that there\u2019s walls and there is but I had to put up these walls to protect myself, to protect my feelings, my heart,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it would be foolish of me to not have walls. You never go back into that same situation.\u201d",
      "Kardashian then tried to explain this to Kendall and Kylie Jenner and said that even though she roots for her exes, she does \u201cget offended, whether it be Tristan or Lamar,\u201d when do \u201coutrageous things\u201d and pretend they never happened.",
      "\u201cSo what does it say on my forehead? F--king doormat?\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it probably does to these people, because I have been in so many different ways, but then that gets taken advantage of.\u201d",
      "Kardashian added that seeing Odom was an \u201cout of body experience, for sure.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t disagree with Kendall. I think I definitely could have been nicer, or my tone could have been softer,\u201d she said. \u201cBut also, there\u2019s so much going on I can\u2019t even explain the emotions, the thoughts. The very last time I saw this person was very contentious and negative. It wasn\u2019t good. So is this my best moment in life? No.\u201d",
      "Kardashian used the meeting to be more honest about her marriage to Odom.",
      "\u201cWhen you guys met was he open about his drug struggle?\u201d Kendall Jenner asked.",
      "\u201cNo, I never knew he did drugs until probably a year and a half into our marriage,\u201d Kardashian responded.",
      "Kendall Jenner noted that her sister\u2019s response made her realize how much she and Kylie Jenner didn\u2019t know Odom because Kardashian kept \u201cso much\u201d information away from them \u201cin a good way.\u201d"

    "summary": "How does the Black Mirror episode Bete Noir episode end? Read on for a recap.",
    "story": [
      "The best way to sum up the second episode of \"Black Mirror\" Season 7, \u201cB\u00eate Noire,\" is to simply look up the definition of the episode title.",
      "Merriam-Webster defines \"b\u00eate noire\" as \"a person or thing strongly detested or avoided.\" As for who the b\u00eate noire truly is? That remains in question. It would depend on which of the main characters \u2014 Maria (Siena Kelly) and Verity (Rosy McEwen) \u2014 you ask.",
      "Here's what to know about how the episode of \"Black Mirror\" ends.",
      "What is the premise of 'B\u00eate Noire'?",
      "Maria is head of flavor at Ditta, a food company that eagle-eyed fans will have noticed was one of the ads Amanda (Rashida Jones) unwillingly spewed in Episode 1.",
      "Maria excels at her job \u2014 until Verity Greene applies for a research assistant position in her department and, much to Maria's dismay, gets it.",
      "The pair went to high school together and, according to Maria, Verity was \"the school freak.\"",
      "\u201cShe was clever \u2014 like brainbox clever \u2014 to the point where she was sort of \u2018off.\u2019 Zero social skills,\u201d Maria says. \u201cShe had this mad hair. She was always scribbling like these weird little diagrams of like computers that she wanted to build.\u201d",
      "She then explains that a classmate named Natalie started a rumor that Verity was hooking up one of the school's teachers, Mr. Kendrick. Natalie created the nickname \"milkmaid\" for Verity based on the rumor and it stuck.",
      "After Verity gets the job, Maria starts to lose her grip on reality. It seems the truth keeps warping.",
      "First, it's small things, like Verity insisting that a chicken shop chain is spelled differently than how Maria remembers. When Maria Googles the place, though, the name really has changed to align with Verity's spelling.",
      "Maria is spiraling, certain that Verity is somehow behind everything that keeps going wrong. She texts Natalie for the first time in four years but doesn't get a response.",
      "The bending of reality grows more sinister. For example, Maria types out an email to Verity listing ingredients to use in a sample recipe. When there's a mishap with the recipe and Maria's original email is checked, a key ingredient is missing, making Maria look like the bad guy.",
      "Maria's colleagues turn on her and Verity seems to ascend in popularity. Is Maria paranoid or is Verity somehow sowing chaos?",
      "A call from Natalie's husband helps her find the answer. Maria learns from Natalie's husband that Natalie committed suicide a few days ago after spiraling in paranoia.",
      "Maria loses her job after a spectacular showdown with Verity involving... almond milk. Verity chugs a colleague's almond milk then blames in on Maria. When Maria says she has a nut allergy, Verity seems to somehow erase the concept of a nut allergy from the internet and people's minds.",
      "Maria is fired but she does figure something out: Verity's pendant seems to be altering reality.",
      "What does Verity's pendant do?",
      "Maria, now more than slightly unhinged, follows Verity to her home, which turns out to be a giant mansion. Maria breaks in while Verity is showering and discovers the pendant. She clicks it, but it flashes red and makes a small sound. Hearing Verity exiting the shower, Maria ducks underneath her bed, pendant in hand.",
      "Maria tries to use the pendant again, but it makes the same sound showing it won\u2019t work \u2014 but this time Verity hears it.",
      "\u201cCome out,\u201d Verity says. \u201cI will call the police.\u201d",
      "Verity then explains to Maria that the pendant is just a remote and she has plenty of them. The remote connects to a \"quantum compiler,\" which allows Verity to change reality by moving along infinite timelines.",
      "By clicking the pendant \u2014 which uses touch ID that only works for Verity \u2014 she can say whatever wish she wants to be true. Then, she is immediately transported into whatever parallel reality where whatever she's said has always been true.",
      "\"There's infinite timelines so I just pick the one where you're the only one who knows what's going on so you feel really special,\" Verity explains, adding that she built the system herself.",
      "This revelation explains why Maria has been spiraling and how the cameras and her email wording inexplicably changed.",
      "It also gives new meaning to Verity's name, which means \"the quality or state of being true or real,\" according to Merriam-Webster.",
      "\"I don't care if you understand it,\" Verity says to a baffled Maria. \"I'm doing it to hurt you. That's the main thing.\"",
      "What is Verity\u2019s problem with Maria?",
      "By now it\u2019s very, very clear Verity is targeting Maria. She finally explains why \u2014 and it all goes back to that rumor.",
      "The accused teacher had looked out for her and was kind, Verity says. But in the aftermath of the rumor he was transferred, leaving her with nothing.",
      "Maria claims she doesn't know why Verity would want to hurt her. Verity doubts this. Verity reveals that Natalie told her it was Maria who started the rumor.",
      "Maria finally admits she did start the rumor, but that Natalie amplified it. Clearly hurt, Verity says she was \"stuck there\" with everyone calling her mad, unable to fight back.",
      "What happens in the end?",
      "Now, Verity is determined to make Maria take her own life like she did Natalie. Maria fights back and Verity matches her intensity. Verity gets hold of the pendant and uses it to have armed cops immediately arrive to arrest Maria for breaking in with a knife (which materializes into Maria\u2019s hand).",
      "A second later, cops with guns arrive, directing Maria to drop her knife. She does, but as one police officer approaches her to put the handcuffs on her, Maria grabs his gun and shoots Verity in the head, killing her.",
      "She then has a shoot-out with the police, but in the chaos is able to grab the pendant, placing Verity\u2019s dead finger on it.",
      "\u201cThe pendant works for me. The pendant works for me!\u201d Maria desperately yells. Then she starts to bend reality, saying, \u201cShe shot herself. It wasn\u2019t me. You saw the whole thing.\u201d",
      "The police immediately agree that that\u2019s the truth of what happened, lowering their weapons. The police then ask Maria to come down to the station to answer some questions, but Maria \u2014 pressing the pendant again \u2014 tells them they won\u2019t need to do that.",
      "\u201cYou work for me,\u201d she says. \u201cBoth of you.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou worship me,\u201d she adds. \u201cBecause I am \u2014 I am the Empress of the Universe.\u201d",
      "The shot then transitions into both cops on their knees, saying \u201cHail Maria,\u201d as Maria stands in front of a cheering crowd of thousands of people chanting the same thing.",
      "The final shot is her smiling at the new life and power she has all for herself.",
      "Will she let the power corrupt her as it seemed to do for Verity? You'll have to use your imagination."

      "With chemistry as electrifying as Mariska Hargitay and Christopher Meloni\u2019s, one would think they would cross over to each other\u2019s respective shows frequently. So, why haven\u2019t their beloved \u201cLaw & Order\u201d characters, Capt. Olivia Benson and Detective Elliot Stabler, physically been in a scene together in nearly two years?",
      "Benson and Stabler started out together on \u201cLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit\u201d as detectives who were paired up to solve some of New York City\u2019s most heinous sex crimes when the NBC prime-time drama debuted in 1999. Stabler had a wife and multiple kids, and Benson stayed (mostly) single, but the two cultivated a large and very loyal fan base who hoped their partnership would take a romantic turn.",
      "Meloni left the series following Season 12 in 2011 after failed contract negotiations. The show picked up the next season with Benson unable to get in touch with Stabler, who didn\u2019t return to work after shooting and killing a young girl wielding a gun in the precinct. The unit\u2019s captain at the time, Donald Cragen (Dann Florek), informed Benson that her partner \u201cput his papers in\u201d and wouldn\u2019t be returning.",
      "Fans had all but given up on Meloni ever reprising Stabler until news broke in 2020 that he would bring the character back for a new NBC series called \u201cLaw & Order: Organized Crime.\u201d His return was part of a crossover event between a Season 22 episode of \u201cSVU\u201d and the series premiere of \u201cOrganized Crime\u201d on April 1, 2021. Stabler crashed back into Benson\u2019s life on \u201cSVU\u201d when he called her for help after his wife, Kathy Stabler (Isabel Gillies), was injured in a car bombing. Kathy died at the end of the episode, which spurred Stabler\u2019s mission to continue on \u201cOC\u201d to get justice for his wife and find her killer.",
      "Kathy\u2019s death also seemed to finally open the door for the possibility of a romance between Benson and Stabler. A lot has happened between them since Stabler\u2019s return, including an \u201cI love you\u201d confession, a twisted love(?) letter, some hand-holding, feelings confessions from them both and a near-kiss that was \u201cchanged at the last minute,\u201d according to Hargitay.",

The answer to that one is a definite yes given Hargitay\u2019s upcoming appearance on \u201cOC\u201d and the recent Meloni spotting on the \u201cSVU\u201d set with Hargitay.",

    "summary": "Former MI6 chief Sir Richard Dearlove says that if President Donald Trump wants a Nobel Peace Prize he should hold off negotiating a Russia-Ukraine ceasefire.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 If President Donald Trump wants a Nobel Peace Prize, he should hold off negotiating a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia, Britain\u2019s former top spy told NBC News on Thursday.",
      "Richard Dearlove, the ex-head of British intelligence agency MI6, said that rushing a truce \u2014 and giving too many concessions to the Kremlin \u2014 could encourage President Vladimir Putin to launch other hostile forays into Europe.",
      "The Russians badly need a ceasefire, said Dearlove, citing waning Kremlin cash reserves and the falling price of crude oil, which Moscow exports to fund its war machine.",
      "\u201cUkraine is pretty close to a tipping point,\u201d he said in a wide-ranging interview. \u201cBut the worry at the moment is that Trump will do a premature deal with the Russians\u201d and make too many concessions.",
      "The \u201chighly undesirable\u201d consequences would be to \u201cembolden the Russians, over time, to be more aggressive and assertive in Europe,\u201d said Dearlove over a coffee at one of London\u2019s historic private members clubs.",
      "His remarks come as Ukraine\u2019s military chief said Russia had launched a new offensive in the Eastern European country.",
      "While often less critical of Trump\u2019s unorthodox approach than many other foreign policy experts, Dearlove said he finds Trump\u2019s general \u201clack of grace\u201d and \u201clack of decent behavior\u201d to be \u201cvery disconcerting\u201d \u2014 specifically his Oval Office bust-up with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February.",
      "\u201cMy general view of Americans is they\u2019re gracious and they behave very respectfully,\u201d said a gently amused Dearlove, 80, an Olympic rower\u2019s son who spent a year at Connecticut\u2019s preparatory Kent School before gaining his degree back in Britain at the University of Cambridge. \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary the way that Trump has blown up all of that.\u201d",
      "The jovial, outspoken grandee of the British foreign policy establishment joined MI6 in 1966 and served as its chief \u2014 code-named \u201cC\u201d \u2014 between 1999 and 2004. He now co-hosts the \u201cOne Decision\u201d podcast, covering global news, alongside former U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta.",
      "He says he \u201cstrongly supports\u201d the American president\u2019s campaign to pressure European allies to spend more on defense, decrying the imbalance of Europe enjoying a relatively generous health care and benefits system while letting the U.S. foot the bill for Western defense.",
      "\u201cWhy should American taxpayers pay for indulgent social security programs in countries like Germany, France and Italy?\u201d he said.",
      "He dismisses \u201cSignalgate\u201d \u2014 in which Trump\u2019s team discussed bombing Yemen on the messaging app Signal \u2014 as a \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201csilly mistake\u201d that showed \u201ca degree of amateurism.\u201d And he said it wouldn\u2019t have a long-term impact on Western intelligence sharing.",
      "Reached for comment on Dearlove\u2019s remarks, White House principal deputy press secretary Harrison Fields said, \u201cPresident Trump is a master negotiator who has done more to bring about world peace during his tenure than any president in modern history.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe President\u2019s Peace Through Strength agenda has delivered historic achievements across the globe and restored American dominance on the world stage,\u201d Fields added. \u201cThe \u2018experts\u2019 have been wrong for decades, and doing the same thing while expecting a different result is the definition of insanity.\u201d",
      "The ex-MI6 head says his biggest short-term worry revolves around Trump\u2019s approach to Ukraine, which has involved parallel talks with both Kyiv and Moscow and has been lambasted by Trump\u2019s critics in the West as being too favorable to the latter.",
      "\u201cIf you want to get the Nobel Peace Prize, don\u2019t do a premature deal with Ukraine \u2014 wait,\u201d Dearlove said. (According to former aides, the president still covets the landmark award won by four of his predecessors, and for which Trump has been nominated at least twice before.)",
      "Dearlove believes the Russians are on the back foot and will only come under more pressure to accept terms. \u201cThe Russians themselves badly need a ceasefire, but Putin is incapable of seeking one because he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a reverse gear,\u201d Dearlove said.",
      "On Iran, responding to Trump\u2019s announcement that the U.S. will hold direct talks with Tehran over its nuclear program, Dearlove says he believes the administration will \u201cdemand a very high price\u201d \u2014 namely that Iran give up its entire nuclear program, both for energy and weapons.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a bottom line for Trump and Israel that Iran must not have nuclear capability,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty clear that if Iran were to try to weaponize or if the intelligence suggests that they are weaponized, then there would be a joint Israeli-American attack.\u201d",
      "Trump didn\u2019t rule out military action if the talks don\u2019t succeed, saying Tehran would have a \u201cvery bad day\u201d if diplomacy failed.",
      "Dearlove agreed: \u201cIf the Iranians don\u2019t negotiate, or if they mislead, which they\u2019re quite capable of doing, they\u2019re ones heading for a crisis.\u201d",
      "Dearlove was head of MI6 when the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, and was later criticized by a public inquiry for his handling of intelligence alleging that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, a key argument steering Britain into the war alongside Washington. At the inquiry in 2017, he described claims he was too close to the British government as \u201ccomplete rubbish.\u201d And, according to a BBC interview in 2023, he is among a minority of people who believe that Iraq did have some kind of weapons program, but that its components may have been moved into neighboring Syria.",
      "Looking ahead, Dearlove believes by far the biggest issue is how the West deals with China.",
      "\u201cPax Americana\u201d \u2014 the \u201cAmerican peace\u201d that has largely held since 1945 and is a byword for Washington\u2019s postwar global dominance \u2014 has \u201cdefinitively disintegrated,\u201d he said. In its stead, there has to be \u201csome sort of understanding between the United States and China,\u201d whose President Xi Jinping \u201cwants to create a world by 2050 which is aligned with China\u2019s value system,\u201d he added.",
      "\u201cChina and the West are intimately intertwined: You can\u2019t take them apart, you can\u2019t disentangle them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, it\u2019s totally opposed to the Western value system.\u201d",
      "He characterizes Xi\u2019s Chinese Communist Party as \u201ctalking about global domination\u201d \u2014 something vehemently rejected by Beijing.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going to have to be some sort of international agreement which accommodates what I would describe as the two spheres of influence,\u201d he said. Otherwise, China is \u201cgoing to end up in a confrontation with the United States at some point in the 21st century.\u201d"

    "summary": "Former MI6 chief Sir Richard Dearlove says that if President Donald Trump wants a Nobel Peace Prize he should hold off negotiating a Russia-Ukraine ceasefire.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 If President Donald Trump wants a Nobel Peace Prize, he should hold off negotiating a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia, Britain\u2019s former top spy told NBC News on Thursday.",
      "Richard Dearlove, the ex-head of British intelligence agency MI6, said that rushing a truce \u2014 and giving too many concessions to the Kremlin \u2014 could encourage President Vladimir Putin to launch other hostile forays into Europe.",
      "The Russians badly need a ceasefire, said Dearlove, citing waning Kremlin cash reserves and the falling price of crude oil, which Moscow exports to fund its war machine.",
      "\u201cUkraine is pretty close to a tipping point,\u201d he said in a wide-ranging interview. \u201cBut the worry at the moment is that Trump will do a premature deal with the Russians\u201d and make too many concessions.",
      "The \u201chighly undesirable\u201d consequences would be to \u201cembolden the Russians, over time, to be more aggressive and assertive in Europe,\u201d said Dearlove over a coffee at one of London\u2019s historic private members clubs.",
      "His remarks come as Ukraine\u2019s military chief said Russia had launched a new offensive in the Eastern European country.",
      "While often less critical of Trump\u2019s unorthodox approach than many other foreign policy experts, Dearlove said he finds Trump\u2019s general \u201clack of grace\u201d and \u201clack of decent behavior\u201d to be \u201cvery disconcerting\u201d \u2014 specifically his Oval Office bust-up with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February.",
      "\u201cMy general view of Americans is they\u2019re gracious and they behave very respectfully,\u201d said a gently amused Dearlove, 80, an Olympic rower\u2019s son who spent a year at Connecticut\u2019s preparatory Kent School before gaining his degree back in Britain at the University of Cambridge. \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary the way that Trump has blown up all of that.\u201d",
      "The jovial, outspoken grandee of the British foreign policy establishment joined MI6 in 1966 and served as its chief \u2014 code-named \u201cC\u201d \u2014 between 1999 and 2004. He now co-hosts the \u201cOne Decision\u201d podcast, covering global news, alongside former U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta.",
      "He says he \u201cstrongly supports\u201d the American president\u2019s campaign to pressure European allies to spend more on defense, decrying the imbalance of Europe enjoying a relatively generous health care and benefits system while letting the U.S. foot the bill for Western defense.",
      "\u201cWhy should American taxpayers pay for indulgent social security programs in countries like Germany, France and Italy?\u201d he said.",
      "He dismisses \u201cSignalgate\u201d \u2014 in which Trump\u2019s team discussed bombing Yemen on the messaging app Signal \u2014 as a \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201csilly mistake\u201d that showed \u201ca degree of amateurism.\u201d And he said it wouldn\u2019t have a long-term impact on Western intelligence sharing.",
      "Reached for comment on Dearlove\u2019s remarks, White House principal deputy press secretary Harrison Fields said, \u201cPresident Trump is a master negotiator who has done more to bring about world peace during his tenure than any president in modern history.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe President\u2019s Peace Through Strength agenda has delivered historic achievements across the globe and restored American dominance on the world stage,\u201d Fields added. \u201cThe \u2018experts\u2019 have been wrong for decades, and doing the same thing while expecting a different result is the definition of insanity.\u201d",
      "The ex-MI6 head says his biggest short-term worry revolves around Trump\u2019s approach to Ukraine, which has involved parallel talks with both Kyiv and Moscow and has been lambasted by Trump\u2019s critics in the West as being too favorable to the latter.",
      "\u201cIf you want to get the Nobel Peace Prize, don\u2019t do a premature deal with Ukraine \u2014 wait,\u201d Dearlove said. (According to former aides, the president still covets the landmark award won by four of his predecessors, and for which Trump has been nominated at least twice before.)",
      "Dearlove believes the Russians are on the back foot and will only come under more pressure to accept terms. \u201cThe Russians themselves badly need a ceasefire, but Putin is incapable of seeking one because he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a reverse gear,\u201d Dearlove said.",
      "On Iran, responding to Trump\u2019s announcement that the U.S. will hold direct talks with Tehran over its nuclear program, Dearlove says he believes the administration will \u201cdemand a very high price\u201d \u2014 namely that Iran give up its entire nuclear program, both for energy and weapons.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a bottom line for Trump and Israel that Iran must not have nuclear capability,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty clear that if Iran were to try to weaponize or if the intelligence suggests that they are weaponized, then there would be a joint Israeli-American attack.\u201d",
      "Trump didn\u2019t rule out military action if the talks don\u2019t succeed, saying Tehran would have a \u201cvery bad day\u201d if diplomacy failed.",
      "Dearlove agreed: \u201cIf the Iranians don\u2019t negotiate, or if they mislead, which they\u2019re quite capable of doing, they\u2019re ones heading for a crisis.\u201d",
      "Dearlove was head of MI6 when the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, and was later criticized by a public inquiry for his handling of intelligence alleging that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, a key argument steering Britain into the war alongside Washington. At the inquiry in 2017, he described claims he was too close to the British government as \u201ccomplete rubbish.\u201d And, according to a BBC interview in 2023, he is among a minority of people who believe that Iraq did have some kind of weapons program, but that its components may have been moved into neighboring Syria.",
      "Looking ahead, Dearlove believes by far the biggest issue is how the West deals with China.",
      "\u201cPax Americana\u201d \u2014 the \u201cAmerican peace\u201d that has largely held since 1945 and is a byword for Washington\u2019s postwar global dominance \u2014 has \u201cdefinitively disintegrated,\u201d he said. In its stead, there has to be \u201csome sort of understanding between the United States and China,\u201d whose President Xi Jinping \u201cwants to create a world by 2050 which is aligned with China\u2019s value system,\u201d he added.",
      "\u201cChina and the West are intimately intertwined: You can\u2019t take them apart, you can\u2019t disentangle them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, it\u2019s totally opposed to the Western value system.\u201d",
      "He characterizes Xi\u2019s Chinese Communist Party as \u201ctalking about global domination\u201d \u2014 something vehemently rejected by Beijing.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going to have to be some sort of international agreement which accommodates what I would describe as the two spheres of influence,\u201d he said. Otherwise, China is \u201cgoing to end up in a confrontation with the United States at some point in the 21st century.\u201d"

    "summary": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has dispatched his close friend Kirill Dmitriev to Washington, while conscripting 160,000 new troops and bombing Kharkiv.",
    "story": [
      "To the casual observer, Russia seems to be marching in two opposite directions.",
      "President Vladimir Putin sent one of his close allies, Kirill Dmitriev, to Washington this week for diplomatic talks, the most senior Kremlin official to visit since Russia invaded Ukraine.",
      "At the same time, Putin ordered the mobilization of 160,000 troops, his largest in 14 years, as his drones continue their nightly bombardment of Ukrainian civilians and he plans a spring offensive \u2014 if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is to be believed.",
      "But these twin approaches perfectly illustrate Russia\u2019s strategy, according to some Western foreign policy specialists. They say that Putin is slow-walking talks with President Donald Trump so he can press his battlefield advance in Ukraine, while gambling on achieving normalized relations with a friendly White House.",
      "Putin \u201cthinks that time is on his side, and by dragging things out he\u2019ll put himself in an even better position to negotiate,\u201d said Sergey Radchenko, a Soviet-born Cold War historian and professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.",
      "Mixed messages",
      "Having once promised to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine in 24 hours, Trump has found the reality to be far thornier.",
      "His team has tried to broker a ceasefire, but so far even a partial or temporary truce has been blocked by the Russians. Putin and his envoys have said they will only accept a truce if Ukraine agrees to extreme conditions tantamount to surrender and subjugation.",
      "Many Western officials and experts say Russia knows these cannot be accepted.",
      "\u201cPutin continues to obfuscate, continues to drag his feet,\u201d British Foreign Secretary David Lammy told reporters Friday at the headquarters of NATO in Brussels. \u201cWe see you, Vladimir Putin. We know what you are doing.\u201d",
      "That frustration has been felt in the White House, which under Trump has taken a far friendlier approach toward the Kremlin than previous administrations.",
      "Trump told NBC News on Sunday he was \u201cpissed off\u201d when Putin reiterated his view that Zelenskyy should be ousted. Trump\u2019s inner circle is advising him not to hold a call with Putin until he commits to a ceasefire, two administration officials told NBC News on Thursday.",
      "Familiar envoy",
      "This growing dissatisfaction explains why Moscow dispatched Dmitriev, according to Oleg Ignatov, a senior analyst on Russia at the International Crisis Group in Brussels.",
      "\u201cDmitriev has direct access to Putin; in the Russian system, this is the most important thing a negotiator can have,\u201d Ignatov said. He also \u201chas his own connections in the United States.\u201d",
      "Dmitriev, 49, was born in Kyiv when it was part of the Soviet Union and heads the Russian sovereign wealth fund responsible for investing and growing the country's cash pile. He has a close relationship with Putin, who in February appointed him special envoy on international economic investment.",
      "Dmitriev studied at Stanford and got his MBA at Harvard before working for Goldman Sachs and McKinsey & Co.",
      "After meeting with Trump\u2019s officials, he did a round of broadcast interviews in which he talked up normalizing relations with Washington, Arctic cooperation and a minerals deal. He even said the Kremlin could be involved in Elon Musk\u2019s plan to put humans on Mars. Ukraine was mentioned in passing, but he did not mention it in his social-media summary of the trip.",
      "\u201cWithout doubt, we note a positive dynamic in our relations,\u201d he told journalists in Washington. \u201cA series of meetings will still be needed for us to resolve all our differences. But the main thing we see is a positive, constructive attitude.\u201d",
      "The significance of Dmitriev\u2019s visit may lie in the fact he is not a career diplomat.",
      "\u201cHis apparent closeness to Putin makes him more than just a messenger,\u201d said Pavel Baev, a research professor at the Peace Research Institute Oslo, a think tank. \u201cHe appears to be a person who can really engage in bargaining and compromise.\u201d",
      "Asked about Dmitriev\u2019s\u00a0trip, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that Moscow was \u201ccautiously optimistic.\u201d",
      "Pressing ahead",
      "But, to be clear, Dmitriev's main task is clearly to re-establish links with Washington \u2014 rather than signal any drawdown in Ukraine ambitions, according to experts such as Robert Hamilton, a retired U.S. Army colonel and now head of research at the Foreign Policy Research Institute.",
      "Dmitriev's mission \u201csignals that the Kremlin is interested in broadening the discussions with the U.S. and steering them away from Ukraine,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cWhat the Kremlin actually seeks is to sideline the Ukraine issue and pursue a broader reset with the U.S. that leaves Ukraine and Europe out of the process and frees Russia to continue its war.\u201d",
      "Some saw evidence of that this week in Putin\u2019s announcement that the annual spring conscription draft would take on 160,000 recruits, the largest in 14 years.",
      "\u201cA clear signal it wants peace (not!)\u201d Tymofiy Mylovanov, Ukraine\u2019s former economics minister, wrote on X.",
      "Some experts point out the draft is only slightly higher than in previous years, and by law the recruits are barred from participating in what Russia calls its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine. But it is nonetheless a symptom of Russia's growing militarization, a shift that has seen the entire economy retooled toward its war effort.",
      "In the short term, there are few signs Russia is slowing its war.",
      "One drone attack on Ukraine\u2019s second city of Kharkiv late Thursday killed five people and injured more than 30 others, officials said. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy told the French newspaper La Figaro last week he believes Putin is preparing a spring offensive.",
      "Russia\u2019s \u201cceasefire intentions are, as far as I can discern, nonexistent,\u201d Baev added. \u201cDmitriev is most probably sent in order to wriggle out of a tight corner.\u201d"

      "The not-for-profit, which surveyed 1,000 LGBTQ professionals between June and November of last year in its first such report, said 85% of respondents encountered career obstacles due to their identity.",

      "More than 150 Chinese citizens are fighting in Ukraine alongside the Russian army, which is massing on the border of Ukraine ahead of a huge spring offensive, according to Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Zelenskyy made the claim that a significant number of Chinese citizens are involved in Russian President Vladimir Putin's war on his country late Wednesday in his nightly address.",
      "The Ukrainian leader described the potential involvement of Chinese citizens as a major escalation and called on the United States and other allies for support, adding \u201cthis must be met with a firm and principled response.\u201d",
      "If the Chinese government had knowledge of the troops' deployment, it would make China the second country after North Korea to send military personnel to aid the Kremlin in its three-year-long attempt to annex Ukraine.",
      "Zelenskyy\u2019s claims came as his military chief said that a new Russian offensive had begun in eastern Ukraine.",
      "Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi said that Russian forces have intensified assaults in \u201call main directions,\u201d including in the country\u2019s eastern Sumy and Kharkiv regions.",
      "\u201cThis offensive has already begun,\u201d he said according to Ukrainian media.",
      "Such an offensive would raise questions about the seriousness with which the Kremlin is taking the Trump administration's efforts to broker peace between Moscow and Kyiv and serve to undermine the sincerity of sending Putin-ally\u00a0Kirill Dmitriev\u00a0to Washington this month for diplomatic talks. Dmitriev is the most senior Kremlin official to visit since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "Zelenskyy's fresh allegations come after he said Tuesday that the Ukrainian military had captured two Chinese citizens fighting with the Russian army.",
      "Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian later said that China was asking citizens to stay away from and not involve themselves in armed conflict.",
      "Lin, in a statement Thursday, urged relevant parties to refrain from making \u201cirresponsible\u201d remarks and adding that Beijing was not a party to the war and that it supported and had \u201cactively promoted the peaceful settlement of the crisis.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said earlier this week that the two Chinese nationals his forces had captured were found in the country\u2019s Donetsk region with personal documents, including bank cards, and that Russian units had \u201csignificantly more\u201d than two Chinese citizens. On Wednesday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said the accusation had \u201cno basis in facts.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy told reporters on Wednesday that he was ready to exchange the two captured Chinese nationals \u201conly for Ukrainian soldiers\u201d in Russian captivity.",
      "\u201cThey are more talkative than the prisoners from North Korea, as far as we can see,\u201d he said, referring to two North Korean soldiers Ukraine captured in January.",
      "Russia is trying to attract Chinese soldiers through social media platforms, he said, adding that the 155 recruits Ukraine had identified arrived in Moscow after enlistment and spent four days undergoing medical examinations followed by two months in training centers. Zelenskyy did not specify when they had arrived.",
      "NBC News has not independently verified the Ukrainian figures.\u00a0A spokesperson for the Kremlin declined to comment Wednesday when asked about the Chinese soldiers.",
      "The Kremlin\u2019s silence came as the U.K.'s National Crime Agency said that a former Russia-appointed governor of the annexed Crimean city of Sevastopol, Dmitrii Ovsiannikov, had been found guilty by British prosecutors of breaching U.K. government sanctions on Russia \u2014 making him the first person convicted of doing so.",
      "South Korea estimates that 11,000 North Korean soldiers have already been deployed to fight alongside the Russians, but the difference between North Korea, an impoverished and secretive nation, and China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, being involved in a war against an ally of the U.S. and Europe would be geopolitically seismic.",
      "The Ukrainian air force said Thursday that Russia had launched 145 Iran-made Shahed drones over its territory overnight, with four civilians killed in the past 24 hours. Three civilians were injured in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, Ukrainian officials said, and the Sumy region was shelled nearly 300 times over the prior 24 hours.",

      "China, the world\u2019s second-biggest economy and one of the U.S.\u2019 biggest trading partners, has matched President Donald Trump tariff for tariff in recent days. Its latest levies on U.S. goods took effect Thursday, totaling 84%.",
      "As other countries scramble to offer Trump concessions in exchange for tariff reductions, China\u2019s more combative approach has drawn the president\u2019s ire. On Wednesday, citing China\u2019s \u201clack of respect\u201d for global markets, Trump raised U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to 125%, even as he announced a 90-day pause on higher targeted tariffs on all other U.S. trading partners.",
      "China responded Thursday that while it does not want to fight a trade war, it also won\u2019t shy away from one.",
      "\u201cWe are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don\u2019t back down,\u201d Mao Ning, spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry, said Thursday in a post on X.",

      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry did not say whether it would further raise tariffs on U.S. goods in response to Trump\u2019s latest increase. The door to talks \u201cis always open,\u201d a spokesperson said Thursday, \u201cbut any dialogue must be based on mutual respect and conducted on equal footing.\u201d",
      "Underlying such comments is China\u2019s history of exploitation by Western nations, memories of which remain searing even as China has leveraged globalization to become the world\u2019s largest trading nation in goods.",
      "Even though U.S. and Chinese tariffs are already at \u201ctrade-prohibitive\u201d levels, Trump\u2019s public calls to negotiate are unlikely to work with China, said Rick Waters, a former State Department diplomat who is now the Singapore-based director of Carnegie China.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese are proud. They have a history of humiliation at the hands of foreign powers,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think those types of tactics play into their defensive instincts.\u201d",
      "The Foreign Ministry\u2019s office in Hong Kong, a former British colony whose 1997 return to Chinese rule marked the end of what is referred to in China as a \u201ccentury of humiliation,\u201d said Trump\u2019s actions \u201cwon\u2019t make America great again \u2014 they\u2019ll only turn the U.S. into a 21st-century barbarian.\u201d",
      "\u201cThose who try to strong-arm the world with tariffs and expect countries to call and admit defeat should never count on getting a call from China,\u201d it said.",
      "Waters said that while he thinks Trump is \u201csincere in a desire to explore some kind of a deal with the Chinese,\u201d such a deal may be a long way off.",
      "\u201cI think until the two sides feel they have to come to the table, they\u2019re going to let the other stew in their juices,\u201d he said."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 The increasingly vicious trade war between Washington and Beijing took another turn Wednesday when China imposed an additional 50% tariff on imports from the U.S., hiking its levies on American imports to 84%.",
      "The tit-for-tat escalation came hours after President Donald Trump\u2019s 104% tariffs on Chinese imports went into effect, including 50% Trump added Monday. Later Wednesday, Trump increased the overall U.S. tariff on Chinese goods to 125%, even as he paused higher targeted tariffs on other countries for 90 days while keeping a 10% baseline tariff in place for all countries.",
      "Trump\u2019s 50% tariff is a \u201cmistake upon another mistake,\u201d China\u2019s Customs Tariff Commission said in a statement earlier Wednesday, adding that the world\u2019s two biggest economies should \u201cresolve differences through equal dialogue based on mutual respect.\u201d",
      "The effect of China\u2019s 84% tariff may be somewhat limited because China imports only about $160 billion a year in U.S. goods compared with the more than $400 billion in goods it exports to the U.S.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think they can match in the economic realm, because the relationship is so unbalanced,\u201d said Rick Waters, the Singapore-based director of the Carnegie China think tank. \u201cSo what they tend to do is move into adjacent realms to exact a price.\u201d",
      "Here's a look at some of the other measures China might take.",
      "U.S. agricultural products and poultry",
      "China could greatly increase tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, or even stop importing them completely.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a very\u00a0high chance that China will stop agricultural\u00a0imports from the U.S. altogether,\u201d said Tianchen Xu, a Beijing-based economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, a financial forecasting service.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a weapon targeting Trump\u2019s supporter\u00a0base,\u201d he added.",
      "Soybeans, which are crushed to make protein-rich animal feed ingredients and vegetable oils, have been at the heart of the U.S.-China trade dispute for some time.",
      "U.S. exports of soybeans to China fell 75% after China imposed a retaliatory 25% tariff on them in 2018, during Trump\u2019s first-term trade war with Beijing.",
      "The Trump administration announced $12 billion in subsidies for farmers to offset the impact, and it has again promised to step in if the latest round of tariffs hurts the industry further.",
      "China could also put further restrictions on American poultry products, having announced an import ban on two U.S. companies last week.",
      "Hollywood movies",
      "China, which frequently trades places with North America as the world\u2019s largest box office, is a crucial market for Hollywood films. Though China has an annual quota for the number of foreign movies that can appear in its theaters, it could ban Hollywood films altogether.",
      "American movies have already been declining in popularity in recent years as U.S.-China trade tensions have escalated. There were no Hollywood films among China\u2019s 10 highest-grossing movies in 2023, in stark contrast to 2012, when seven of the top 10 highest-grossing movies were U.S.-made, according to Maoyan, a Chinese movie-ticketing and data platform.",
      "U.S. services sector and intellectual property",
      "The U.S. has a large trade deficit with China in goods, but it comes out ahead when it comes to services such as finance, consulting and law.",
      "U.S. data lists China as its fifth-largest export market for services, according to a report by China\u2019s State Council released Wednesday.",
      "China could target the U.S. services sector, for example, by excluding American companies from government procurement processes or restricting their cooperation with Chinese firms.",
      "The U.S. has long accused China of stealing its intellectual property. But Beijing also has its own growing intellectual property interests, and it could investigate U.S. companies in China in an effort to protect them.",
      "Fentanyl cooperation",
      "China and the U.S. have made progress on stemming the international flow of precursor ingredients for fentanyl, some of which originate in China and are then processed into the deadly opioid in countries such as Mexico before being smuggled into the U.S.",
      "But China could bring that cooperation to a halt in response to Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "\u201cOut of humanitarian considerations, China has provided various forms of assistance to the U.S.,\u201d Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said last month. \u201cThe U.S. should not repay goodwill with hostility.\u201d",
      "Waters said it would be \u201ccounterproductive\u201d for China to suspend cooperation on fentanyl.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just going to cement narratives in the U.S. that they\u2019re weaponizing drugs against us,\u201d he said."

      "President Donald Trump wants to bring back American manufacturing in ways that would reshape the United States economy to look more like China\u2019s. The campaign, which has led to a rapidly escalating trade war with China, has given ample social media fodder to Chinese and American observers alike.",
      "Announcing a series of sweeping tariffs in a move dubbed \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d Trump said last week that it will lead factories to move production back to American shores, boosting the U.S. economy after \u201cforeign leaders have stolen our jobs, foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories, and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once beautiful American dream.\u201d",
      "In a Truth Social post Wednesday, Trump announced that he is raising tariffs on goods imported from China to 125%, up from the 104% that took effect the same day, due to \u201cthe lack of respect that China has shown to the World\u2019s Markets.\u201d\u00a0Higher targeted tariffs on other countries have been paused for 90 days, although the 10% baseline tariff will remain in place for all countries.",
      "Meme-makers and Chinese government officials have in recent days begun pointing out the irony of Trump\u2019s tariff-driven manufacturing pivot through AI-generated satire and political cartoons that have percolated online, with many American users boosting the jokes.",
      "One video poking fun at the Trump administration\u2019s attempted pivot to American manufacturing has accumulated millions of views on X since a user posted it on TikTok earlier this week. The clip, seemingly generated with artificial intelligence, showed workers sewing garments and assembling mobile devices in a factory, followed by a screen touting: \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d",
      "Official Chinese accounts have also gotten in on the fun. Last weekend, Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, posted a meme appearing to mock Trump for imposing tariffs on several largely barren Antarctic islands inhabited by penguins rather than people.",
      "Some have been subtler with their critiques. On Monday, the Chinese Embassy reposted a clip of a 1987 speech by President Ronald Reagan, whose economic agenda hugely influenced mainstream Republican economics today. In it, Reagan staunchly defends free trade.",
      "\u201cWhen someone says, \u2018Let\u2019s impose tariffs on foreign imports,\u2019 it looks like they\u2019re doing a patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs. And sometimes, for a short while, it works. But only for a short time,\u201d Reagan says in the clip, before launching into a list of consequences.",
      "Talk of tariffs dominated the trending searches on Weibo, one of the most popular social media platforms in China, on Wednesday. For hours, the top hashtag on the platform translated to: \u201cThe United States begs for eggs while fighting a trade war.\u201d",
      "While the online memes depict American factory workers toiling away at menial tasks, the Trump administration says that such jobs would be automated in revived U.S. factories and that employees would be doing higher-level work.",
      "\u201cOur high school-educated Americans \u2014 the core to our work force \u2014 is going to have the greatest resurgence of jobs in the history of America to work on these high-tech factories, which are all coming to America,\u201d Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday on the CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s calls to revive domestic manufacturing come as China has pushed to make its economy look more like that of the United States.",
      "China, which is trying to reduce its economic reliance on exports, has been struggling to encourage domestic consumption, expanding subsidies for microwaves, rice cookers, smartphones and other goods.",
      "At least in the short term, both the U.S. and the Chinese goals are \u201cpipe dreams,\u201d said Ian Johnson, formerly a senior fellow for China studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\u201cChina has been trying for decades to promote consumption or to get people to consume more, but for a variety of reasons Chinese people aren\u2019t willing to do that,\u201d Johnson said in a phone interview Tuesday, citing the lack of social safety net that drives high levels of personal savings.",
      "\u201cThe government hasn\u2019t changed structural issues that hold back consumption,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cSo until they do that, that\u2019s not going to work.\u201d",
      "On the U.S. side, Johnson said, \u201cit\u2019s difficult because the government is trying to turn back the clock and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fully possible, no matter how high the tariffs are.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re never going to bring back, for example, shoe manufacturing or things like that or textile manufacturing to the United States, because it\u2019s still going to be too expensive, even if you put 100% tariffs,\u201d he said."

      "Trump wrote on social media just before 1:30 p.m. that he came to the decision because more than 75 trading partners didn\u2019t retaliate and have reached out to the United States to \u201cdiscuss\u201d some of the issues he had raised.",
      "The pause didn\u2019t apply to China, which has retaliated \u2014 with 84% hikes. Trump instead raised duties for it to\u00a0125%, effective immediately.",
      "\u201cBased on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World\u2019s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAt some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable.\u201d",
      "But the trade war isn\u2019t exactly over, and the pause didn\u2019t return the world to the time before Trump touched off the global instability; a 10% across-the-board duty will remain. For Canada and Mexico, goods covered by the U.S., Canada and Mexico trade agreement will continue to have no tariffs, while products that aren't exempt under the trade deal will have a 25% tariff. Canadian energy and fertilizer products will have a 10% tariff.",
      "It wasn\u2019t immediately clear which countries the pause would cover; the White House wouldn\u2019t say. Earlier Wednesday, the European Union voted to impose fresh retaliatory duties, but they aren\u2019t set to take effect until next week.",
      "And separate tariffs on imported autos, steel and aluminum will remain, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said later \u2014 while planned tariffs on items like lumber and pharmaceuticals are still on.",
      "It\u2019s not clear what prompted Trump to change his mind \u2014 he appeared to dig in just hours earlier, telling Americans \u201cBE COOL\u201d in a Truth Social post, and he suggested not that long ago that the tariffs could be permanent.",
      "\u201cI did a 90-day pause for the people that didn\u2019t retaliate, because I told them, \u2018If you retaliate, we\u2019re going to double it,\u2019\u201d Trump said Wednesday. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I did with China, because they did retaliate. So we\u2019ll see how it all works out. I think it\u2019s going to work out amazing.\u201d",
      "But markets have been in stunning turmoil \u2014 major stock indexes shed trillions of dollars in value, while alarming signals from the bond market set Wall Street on edge.",
      "When a false-at-the-time headline suggesting Trump would take a 90-day pause shot around the internet Monday, markets briefly surged. And a growing chorus of business leaders and Trump\u2019s allies have come out publicly against the tariffs, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk.",
      "Markets soared on the surprising news Wednesday, with the S&P 500 climbing more than 9%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closing up more than 12% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending nearly 3,000 points higher. Among the big gainers: Tesla stock was up 22%. Despite the gains, all three indexes were down from where they were a month ago and at the start of the year, and some investors questioned what the recent volatility could mean for the U.S. stock market longer-term.",
      "\"My portfolio of defensive stocks is green so I don\u2019t begrudge today\u2019s market. But I ask you, would you want to own highly volatile US stocks whose price depends on whether POTUS had a good night\u2019s sleep and woke up the next morning to reverse yesterday\u2019s policies?\" billionaire investor Bill Gross said on X.",
      "Goldman Sachs lowered its odds of a recession but said it is still forecasting minimal economic growth and a 45% probability of a recession given the remaining tariffs.",
      "Borrowing costs \u2014 which had surged early Wednesday as the tariffs took effect \u2014 also eased slightly, though not substantially, as some investors may fear a lingering fallout.",
      "Trump has been talking about tariffs as the solution for\u00a0U.S. economic problems since before he became president; he branded April 2 \u2014 when he unveiled the plan \u2014 \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d saying it would end decades of the country\u2019s being \u201clooted, pillaged, raped and plundered\u201d by other countries.",
      "The global markets recoiled, and last week $6.6 trillion alone was wiped out. Yet Trump and his allies had doubled down until Wednesday, arguing tariffs were necessary to return manufacturing to the United States and fill the nation\u2019s coffers with trillions of dollars in revenue that could be used to pay down debt or offset tax cuts.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how the White House expects the policies to fuel big gains now. With the lower 10% tariff rate left in place, there will be less incentive for companies to relocate production to the United States and less revenue being generated.",
      "After the news, Bessent sought to make the about-face into a negotiating tactic, insisting it was a way to scare countries to come to the negotiating table by demonstrating how high the United States was going to go.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump created maximum negotiating leverage for himself,\u201d he said.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how successful the United States will be at negotiating new trade agreements with other countries given Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again threats over the past several months. Previously, he had threatened sweeping tariffs on all imports from Mexico and Canada before he walked most of them back.",
      "And while markets surged higher Wednesday following Trump\u2019s\u00a0pause, economic uncertainty remains over what will come next in the U.S. trade war with China, which exports more than $400 billion worth of goods to the United States each year.",
      "Under Trump\u2019s new tariffs, the cost for U.S. companies importing goods from China has more than doubled. Those products include everything from toys and sneakers to televisions and iPhones.",
      "U.S. companies exporting their products to China are also caught up in the fray after China increased its tariffs on American goods like agriculture products and machinery. But the White House is downplaying that risk.",
      "\u201cWhat I am certain of is that what China is doing will affect their economy much more than ours because they have an export-driven, flood-the-world-with-cheap-exports model,\u201d Bessent said.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on X that he sat with Trump as he posted the initial message, adding: \u201cThe world is ready to work with President Trump to fix global trade, and China has chosen the opposite direction.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration will now face the daunting task of trying to negotiate dozens of potentially complex and intricate trade deals in a three-month period.",
      "\"That is a huge task to negotiate simultaneously with that many trading partners over that many issues,\u201d said Greta Peisch, who was general counsel for the U.S. trade representative\u2019s office during the Biden administration. \u201cWe have tariffs, non-tariff barriers, other non-trade related matters, all of those issues can get quite complicated quite quickly. Even with just a handful of trading partners, that would be a large undertaking.\""

      "The legislation, fast-tracked through parliament in March, prohibits events depicting homosexuality to those under the age of 18 and has drawn comparisons to Russia\u2019s anti-LGBTQ policies. It comes as Orb\u00e1n\u2019s administration is increasingly accused of democratic backsliding ahead of national elections next year.",
      "The weekly protests in Budapest have persisted, and on Tuesday, demonstrators filled the Erzs\u00e9bet Bridge over the Danube, demanding the withdrawal of the law. Some planned to remain on the bridge throughout the night and said there were plans to shut down all five central Danube bridges.",
      "No violence was immediately reported.",
      "The law makes it an offense to hold or attend events such as Pride, which some legal experts and human rights groups say is Orb\u00e1n\u2019s latest crackdown on Hungary\u2019s LGBTQ community and an arbitrary restriction on the right to assembly.",
      "Vikt\u00f3ria Vajda, one of the protesters, said the time for trying to find common ground with Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government \u201chas passed.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t stand up for the rights of minorities and for our own fundamental rights, then who will when they come for us?\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached the point where we have to stand up and say, \u2018No more\u2019.\u201d",
      "The protests have defied police orders to disperse from bridges and main thoroughfares in Budapest. And in a rare instance of a street protest outside the Hungarian capital, several hundred demonstrators in the eastern city of Miskolc also protested on Tuesday against the law.",
      "Orb\u00e1n, who critics say has eroded Hungary\u2019s democracy and overseen widespread corruption, has in recent years taken aim at the country\u2019s LGBTQ community, prohibiting same-sex adoption and \u2014 in a 2021 \u201cchild protection\u201d law \u2014 banning any LGBTQ content including in television, films, advertisements and literature that is available to those under 18.",
      "As part of the new law, authorities may use facial recognition tools to identify those who attend prohibited events \u2014 such as the popular Budapest Pride, which draws tens of thousands each year \u2014 and can issue fines for violators of up to 200,000 Hungarian forints ($545).",
      "Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party is pushing for a constitutional amendment next week that will codify the ban on public LGBTQ events. The Hungarian leader has also pledged to introduce new legislation that will ban demonstrators from blocking traffic on bridges and busy roads, arguing the right of assembly and expression cannot override the rights of commuters.",
      "J\u00e1nos Stummer, a member of the opposition Momentum party who was at the protest, said that while the ban on Pride was harmful to members of the LGBTQ community, the law is also about \u201cOrb\u00e1n unilaterally, arbitrarily deciding which events can be held in this country and which cannot.\u201d",
      "Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government argues that it\u2019s protecting children from \u201csexual propaganda.\u201d",
      "But with Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party lagging in polls, critics views the legislation as part of a broader effort to scapegoat sexual minorities and mobilize his conservative base."

      "LONDON \u2014 President Donald Trump has upended the global economy by slapping tariffs on the world, including its two largest exporters \u2014 China and the European Union. One has snapped back while the other appears to be taking a breath.",
      "While Beijing has vowed to \u201cfight to the end\u201d of an increasingly ferocious trade war, the European Union has adopted a seemingly more methodical approach, only voting Wednesday for a response to the \u201cunjustified and damaging\u201d import taxes on steel and aluminum Trump announced in February.",
      "While critics decry the E.U.\u2019s lack of agility as the glacial response of a lumbering bureaucracy \u2014 and perhaps even a downside of democracy itself \u2014 supporters defend it as nuanced and long-termist.",
      "The unspecified \u201ccountermeasures\u201d announced Wednesday come into force April 15. But the bloc's 27 member states are still deliberating how to react to the White House\u2019s worldwide tariffs that have collapsed share prices over the past week, saying they favor negotiation over retribution.",
      "China\u2019s policies, meanwhile, are largely dictated by one man \u2014 President Xi Jinping \u2014 who has aggressively countered. Earlier Wednesday, Beijing ramped up retaliatory tariffs on all American goods to 84%, vowing to \u201cfight to the end\u201d in this mutually painful conflict.",
      "\u201cThere isn\u2019t one \u2018right\u2019 response to Trump\u2019s tariffs,\u201d said Pranesh Narayanan, a research fellow at the Institute for Public Policy Research, a London think tank. \u201cBoth China and the E.U. have a different set of goals, different geopolitical relationships with the U.S. and different decision-making processes.\u201d",
      "Trump describes both Beijing and Brussels as competitors \u2014 a departure from previous presidents who regarded the Europeans as trading partners, cultural and military allies, and friends. He has repeatedly and falsely exaggerated the trade deficits of both, warning retaliation will be met with even more extreme measures.",
      "Some of Trump\u2019s team are adamant this is policy, rather than a negotiating tactic; the president himself has suggested the opposite.",
      "\u201cThese countries are calling us up, kissing my ass,\u201d Trump said Tuesday at a dinner in Washington.",
      "He has called on China to follow suit, writing in a Truth Social post Tuesday that \u201cwe are waiting for their call. It will happen!\u201d",
      "But there is little evidence that China plans to blink first.",
      "Last week, it matched Trump\u2019s new 34% tariff \u2014 and then went toe-to-toe Wednesday with the 50% hike the president said he would impose if China did not withdraw its first retaliation.",
      "The Chinese Finance Ministry said Trump\u2019s \u201cescalation\u201d was a \u201cserious violation of China\u2019s legitimate rights and interests, a serious damage to the rules-based multilateral trading system, and a serious impact on the stability of the global economic order.\u201d",
      "China is \u201chunkering down for a long period of trade tensions in the hopes they can outlast the U.S. side,\u201d said Rick Waters, a former State Department diplomat who is now the Singapore-based director of Carnegie China.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese are proud. They have a history of humiliation at the hands of foreign powers,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think those types of tactics play into their defensive instincts.\u201d",
      "In contrast to Xi\u2019s rule, the E.U.\u2019s 27 member states must agree on trade policy through a two-thirds majority.",
      "That\u2019s not easy now that Europe is laced with hard-right populists who have developed ties with Trump\u2019s White House.",
      "One of them is Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who now has to balance her admiration for Trump with the pain his tariffs threaten for her country. She has advocated de-escalation to \u201cprevent a trade war\u201d ahead of her visit to Washington next week.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to cajole a consensus,\u201d said Paola Subacchi, an economics professor at the University of Bologna. \u201cBut all of these opinions are under the same umbrella of self-interest \u2014 each country wants to get the best for themselves.\u201d",
      "Subacchi is among those who believe that the E.U.\u2019s consensus-based approach may actually be a strength. With most eyes on Beijing, whose tariffs are far higher than Europe\u2019s, it has time to calibrate its reply.",
      "Waiting a beat means \u201cinflation will start to impact U.S. consumers, and the reality of Trump\u2019s policies will start to materialize,\u201d said Elvire Fabry, a senior researcher at the Jacques Delors Institute, a think tank partly funded by the E.U. and French government. \u201cI think Europe could be in a better position to leverage and retaliate.\u201d",
      "For all their differences, the E.U. and China are now working together against Trump\u2019s tariffs. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke Tuesday with Xi\u2019s second-in-command, Premier Li Qiang. Some experts say this should alarm Trump.",
      "\u201cThe fact that the administration came out against nearly 70 countries at once makes me worried that it may have actually improved China\u2019s position,\u201d Waters said. \u201cBecause now you have Europe and China talking to each other.\u201d",
      "Europe has in its arsenal the \u201cbazooka\u201d \u2014 officially the Anti-Coercion Instrument \u2014 which is a framework allowing it to impose a range of punishments in response to \u201ceconomic coercion.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe game the U.S. is playing, based on spurious analysis, data and economic understanding, is a very dangerous one,\u201d Subacchi said.",
      "\u201cWhatever Trump and his advisers think, the United States receives a huge amount of capital inflows because foreign investors trust the dollar and trust U.S. treasuries,\u201d she added. \u201cAs a result of this \u2018Liberation Day,\u2019 all of this confidence and trust is just melting.\u201d"

      "Global drugmakers\u2019 stocks dropped across the board after U.S. President Donald Trump reiterated plans for a \u201cmajor\u201d\u00a0tariff on\u00a0pharmaceutical imports, threatening an interwoven global supply chain, and as his country-specific reciprocal tariffs took effect, leading to\u00a0more pain in global markets.",
      "Pharmaceutical imports were initially exempt from Trump\u2019s first set of reciprocal tariffs last week \u2014 but his administration has since indicated that levies on the sector, which in the past has been excluded from such actions, are coming.",
      "The U.S. president has said the tariffs will incentivize drug companies to move operations to the United States. However, analysts and\u00a0companies\u00a0have\u00a0raised concerns\u00a0about the difficulty in setting up manufacturing in the country.",
      "Shares of major U.S. drugmakers Amgen, AbbVie, Pfizer, Merck\u00a0and Eli Lilly\u00a0fell between 3% and 6% in premarket trading.",

      "Trump had also\u00a0threatened\u00a0the duties on Friday after his first set of \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs exempted\u00a0pharma\u00a0products. Trump has not said when and by how much he plans to raise levies on\u00a0pharma\u00a0imports.",
      "\u201cWhile the details are scant, we are strongly opposed to tariffs on any\u00a0pharmaceuticals \u2014 these will likely do little to shift manufacturing back to the U.S.,\u201d said BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman.",
      "\u201cGiven the complexity of the\u00a0pharma\u00a0supply chain, we do not expect the industry to make any major changes. These current tariffs are being pursued under emergency powers, which at worse will last until the end of the current administration and could end sooner with an act of Congress.\u201d",
      "Seigerman also pointed to concerns over\u00a0recent layoffs at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, saying the worries were now compounded by the \u201creal talk\u201d of\u00a0pharma\u00a0tariffs.",
      "Europe and the U.S. have interconnected supply chains for medicines. The United States depends on medicines partly produced in Europe that bring in hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue.",
      "Bernstein analyst Courtney Breen wrote in a note that her worst-case scenario assumes tariffs could be steep, leading to about $53 billion in additional costs paid for\u00a0pharmaceutical imports.",
      "If companies did choose to bring new manufacturing to the United States, Breen expects additional spend of $2 billion for each new \u201cgreen field\u201d site and a five-year runway to production.",
