    "story": [
      "Robert Redford, who died Tuesday at 89, transformed the film industry with the Sundance Institute and Film Festival",
      "Robert Redford was disillusioned with the Hollywood mainstream. The Sundance Kid, who died Tuesday at age 89, knew that there were more stories out there, ones that weren\u2019t getting made into films because of the rigidity of the business. So he made something different, founding Sundance Institute and the Sundance Film Festival as an alternative avenue for emerging filmmakers, where independence was a virtue, not a liability.",
      "Over the past four decades, the institute and the festival have given an early platform to countless young filmmakers, including Steven Soderbergh, Paul Thomas Anderson, Quentin Tarantino, Ryan Coogler, Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, Nicole Holofcener, Nia DaCosta, Taika Waititi, Ava DuVernay, Rian Johnson, Gina Prince-Bythewood, Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert and many more.",
      "\u201cFor me, the word to be underscored is \u2018independence.\u2019 I\u2019ve always believed in that word. That\u2019s what led to me eventually wanting to create a category that supported independent artists who weren\u2019t given a chance to be heard,\u201d Redford told The Associated Press in 2018. \u201cThe industry was pretty well controlled by the mainstream, which I was a part of. But I saw other stories out there that weren\u2019t having a chance to be told and I thought, \u2018Well, maybe I can commit my energies to giving those people a chance.\u2019 As I look back on it, I feel very good about that.\u201d",
      "In 2019, Redford said he intended to step back from his public facing role at the festival, though he remained the organization's president and founder until his death.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re at a point where I can move on to a different place, because the thing I\u2019ve missed over the years is being able to spend time with the films and with the filmmakers and to see their work and be part of their community,\u201d he said at the 2019 kickoff. \u201cI don\u2019t think the festival needs a whole lot of introduction now: It runs on its own course, and I\u2019m happy for that.\u201d",
      "Redford\u2019s love affair with Utah began much earlier, on a cross-country motorcycle road trip in 1961 when he bought 2 acres of land. By 1969, with more money in his pocket from his film successes, he\u2019d purchased 5,000 acres, some of which was a mountain resort but most of the land was for wilderness preserves. He named it Sundance, after his character in \u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\u201d",
      "In 1981, the year he won best picture and director for \u201cOrdinary People,\u201d he established the Sundance Institute, a nonprofit organization and held the first filmmakers lab at the Sundance Mountain Resort, about 13 miles northeast of Provo. A few years later, in 1985, the institute took over what was then known as the U.S. Film Festival, which would later be renamed the Sundance Film Festival. The festival in the mid-80s hosted the Coen brothers \u201cBlood Simple\u201d and Jim Jarmusch\u2019s \u201cStranger Than Paradise.\u201d",
      "The festival was really put on the map when Soderbergh premiered \u201csex, lies and videotape\u201d in Park City in 1989. A true indie, the film went on to win the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes and get an Oscar nomination, but it was its box office success that ignited a veritable indie film boom. And Sundance was where all the discoveries were happening. In 1991, the festival premiered \u201cDaughters of the Dust,\u201d \u201cParis is Burning\u201d and \u201cSlacker,\u201d in 1992, Tarantino\u2019s \u201cReservoir Dogs,\u201d in 1993, Wes Anderson brought \u201cBottle Rocket,\u201d and in 1994 \u201cHoop Dreams\u201d and \u201cClerks.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Robert Redford, independent art houses might not have succeeded,\u201d said Gary Meyer, cofounder of Landmark Theatre, and a former festival director at Telluride who also worked with Redford. \u201cHaving the \u2018Sundance Kid\u2019 give his stamp of approval to independent features and documentaries brought audiences to our theaters, while helping launch the careers of dozens of filmmakers \u2026 He made it \u2018cool\u2019 to see adventurous movies when they came to commercial neighborhood theaters.\u201d",
      "In 1994, the Sundance Institute also made a commitment to Indigenous filmmakers by launching a festival program to showcase Native and Indigenous films that continues to this day.",
      "The festival might get the most headlines, but it\u2019s the year-round work of the Institute that has really left a mark on independent cinema. The screenwriting and directing labs have been just as, if not more, influential in helping to launch the first films of many of Hollywood\u2019s top filmmakers over the past 40 years, under the leadership of Michelle Satter, who has helped shepherd projects from \u201cHard Eight\u201d to \u201cFruitvale Station\u201d and \u201cLove & Basketball.\u201d",
      "\u201cSundance changed the trajectory of my career,\u201d filmmaker and labs adviser Gina Prince-Bythewood told the AP in 2023. \u201cHow many of these special projects would have never seen the light of day without Michelle, without Robert Redford\u2019s vision, without this incredible place? It\u2019s actually really scary to think about.\u201d",
      "Native filmmaker Sterlin Harjo (\u201cRez Ball\u201d) said that his career as a young man was defined by Redford\u2019s support for independent cinema and supporting Native storytelling.",

      "\u201cI went to the Sundance Filmmakers lab at 23 years old,\u201d Harjo wrote on Instagram on Tuesday. \u201cThe support from Sundance made me feel like I belonged in an industry that most times felt so unreachable. He personally taught me things about story, shooting, and editing that I take with me today.\u201d",
      "The list of notable films that have played at Sundance grows every year. Some enduring favorites include: \u201cGet Out,\u201d \u201cWhiplash,\u201d \u201cLittle Miss Sunshine,\u201d \u201cMemento,\u201d \u201cBefore Sunrise,\u201d \u201cBoyhood,\u201d \u201cY tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n,\u201d \u201cBrick,\u201d \u201cThe Squid and the Whale,\u201d \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d \u201cCall Me By Your Name\u201d and \u201cA Real Pain.\u201d",
      "The festival got its first best picture winner with \u201cCODA,\u201d which played at the festival in 2021. Questlove\u2019s \u201cSummer of Soul,\u201d which also debuted in 2021, won the academy\u2019s documentary award that year as well.",

      "Redford had worried for years that the festival had outgrown Park City, Utah. In 1996, an estimated 15,504 attended the festival. In 2015, the number had ballooned to 46,100. It peaked in 2018 with 124,900 festivalgoers. The festival estimated that the 2025 edition had 85,472 in-person attendees, a 17% increase from 2024.",
      "Earlier this year, the decision was made to relocate to Boulder, Colorado, starting in 2027. That means there will be one last festival in Park City in January.",
      "\u201cBob\u2019s vision launched a movement that, over four decades later, has inspired generations of artists and redefined cinema in the U.S. and around the world,\u201d Sundance leaders said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThe vibrant storytelling landscape we cherish today, both as artists and audiences, is unimaginable without his passionate drive and principled leadership.\u201d",
      "There were already plans in the works to celebrate the vision of Redford. In the wake of his death, that tribute will be even more deeply felt.",
      "Former Sundance director John Cooper, a close friend of Redford\u2019s who led the festival from 2009 to 2020, told The Associated Press in an interview earlier this year that he felt like his role was \u201cto be a keeper of the flame for Robert Redford and his legacy.\u201d Now, Cooper, the artistic director of Sonoma's True West Film Center who is still a regular presence at Sundance said, that mission is more important than ever. It\u2019s \u201ca lot to process, going from a legacy that was alive in him to one we have to carry on,\u201d Cooper told the AP. That legacy, he said, centers on spreading the power of storytelling.",

      "Playwright David Bar Katz is helping artists facing financial stress through The Relentless Award, the largest annual cash prize in American theater",
      "NEW YORK -- Many times in his life, playwright David Bar Katz didn't know how he was going to pay the bills. These days, he's helping the next generation of artists facing that same dilemma.",
      "Katz oversees The Relentless Award, the largest annual cash prize in American theater to a playwright in recognition of a new play. It's celebrating its 10th anniversary this year and, as always, seeking submissions that \u201cexhibit fearlessness.\u201d The award also honors musical theater.",
      "\u201cBeing able to create under financial stress is so difficult, and so anything we can do to give artists a little breathing room is what we want,\u201d says Katz.",
      "The award was inspired by Katz's friend and collaborator Philip Seymour Hoffman, the late actor who was described as relentless in his pursuit of truth in his art. A musical theater honor was added after the 2020 death of another of Katz's friends, Fountains of Wayne co-founder Adam Schlesinger.",
      "\u201cTo me, a big aspect of the award \u2014 the musical and the straight play \u2014 is not merely honoring Phil and Adam, but the idea of expanding their artistic legacies,\u201d says Katz.",
      "Some of the plays that have been recognized have gone on to great success, like Aleshea Harris\u2019 2016 winner \u201cIs God Is,\u201d which has been made into a movie starring Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Vivica A. Fox, Sterling K. Brown and Kara Young.",
      "\u201cAlicia typifies the whole point of the award,\u201d says Katz. \u201cI think at a moment in her life where she, like so many of us other artists, had kind of had it, she won the award and that was incredibly meaningful in her career.\u201d",
      "Other successes include Sarah DeLappe\u2019s \u201cThe Wolves\u201d and Clare Barron\u2019s \u201cDance Nation\u201d \u2014 joint winners in 2015 \u2014 who have gone on to become Pulitzer Prize finalists. \u201cThe impact, especially of those three plays, has been profound in theater,\u201d Katz says.",

      "Cohen will receive $65,000 and his musical \u2014 as well as the works of the finalists \u2014 will be honored at a ceremony and performance on Oct. 12 at Building for the Arts\u2019 multi-theater complex, Theatre Row. Chris Collingwood, of Fountains of Wayne, will be performing as well.",

      "The play \u201cArt\u201d returns to Broadway with a fresh revival and a starry cast",
      "For evidence of how high inflation has gotten, look no further than Broadway. The fancy painting at the heart of the play \u201cArt\u201d cost the equivalent of $40,000 in 1998. In a crackling new revival, it's a hefty $300,000.",
      "The painting in question is a 4-by-5-foot white-on-white work with white lines. Playwright Yasmina Reza puts it at the center of an escalating fight between three male, middle-aged friends that exposes their fault lines, leading to a night in which each are ripped apart by the others and putting a 25-year friendship in jeopardy.",
      "If $300,000 sounds like a ridiculous price for a monothematic canvas, you'll side with Marc, played with pitch-perfect exasperation by Bobby Cannavale. If the painting speaks to you, you'll be with Serge, a flinty, slightly full-of-himself Neil Patrick Harris. If you just want to hang out and not talk about the painting any more, you'll identify with James Corden's hapless Yvan.",
      "Under Scott Ellis' tight and enthralling direction and with three perfectly cast actors who seem to be having a ball at the Music Box Theatre, \u201cArt\u201d frequently erupts in laughter but still has plenty to say about friendship, power dynamics and how we get on each others' nerves. The 90-minute play opened Tuesday night.",
      "This is the first time \u201cArt,\u201d translated from the original French by Christopher Hampton and which won the Tony Award for best play in 1998 starring Alan Alda, Victor Garber and Alfred Molina, has returned to Broadway, and it feels nothing like an antique. Designer David Rockwell puts the latest three lads in an elegant gray, spare living room that reeks of chilly luxury but also has little personality.",
      "Marc believes that Serge \u2014 by buying the Modernist painting against the express aesthetic rules followed by Marc \u2014 is indicating that he has stepped out of Marc\u2019s shadow. It is for him nothing less than a betrayal. Serge finds a new intolerance and inflexibility in his friend and a hostility to things new. They both lobby Yvan to be on their side, and when he vacillates, he is declared a spineless amoeba.",

      "Cannavale's Marc is prone to outbursts and patting his friend's shoulders, less out of affection than an expression of dominance. Harris' Serge goes from needy to flinty to icy, and Corden fills his Yvan with the comedian's gift for physical comedy, literally plunging into a sofa to search for something or looking sheepish as he buttons a jacket.",
      "A highlight is a hysterical scene in which the three men, still festering their grievances, silently eat olives and drop the pits in a bowl with a loud ting. And Corden triggers a mid-show ovation after nailing a 900-word monster of a monologue that smacks of Mark Rylance doing something similar in the same theater in \u201cLa B\u00eate.\u201d",

The white painting is merely the playwright's way to get at microaggressions and competition among friends, and how seemingly small things \u2014 like the way one waves away cigarette smoke or the tone of a suggestion \u2014 can fester in the other.",

      "Robert Redford, who died Tuesday at 89, was known for his deep commitment to activism, especially for Native American rights and the environment",
      "NEW YORK -- Lorie Lee Sekayumptewa, a former administrator with the Navajo Nation Film Office, remembers seeing Robert Redford at traditional cultural dances at the Hopi village of Hotevilla in New Mexico. It was more than 30 years ago and he was serving as executive producer of the 1991 release \u201cThe Dark Wind,\" a drama about Navajo life.",
      "Redford stood out for his Hollywood looks and for his un-Hollywood behavior, from his earnest desire to learn more about the tribe\u2019s spiritual knowledge to his visits to the Navajo Nation, where Sekayumptewa\u2019s father served as the dean of students at the tribal college and would show Redford\u2019s movies at the student union building.",
      "\u201cEven at home, he would bring that camera and film home to us, put up a sheet and we would invite our neighbors and the kids and we would all be there in our living room, watching these movies,\u201d the 54-year-old Sekayumptewa, who is Navajo, Hopi and Sac and Fox Nation, said of Redford.",
      "\u201cWe were all fans.\u201d",
      "Redford, who died Tuesday at age 89, was hardly the only liberal activist to emerge out of Hollywood, but few matched his knowledge and focus, his humility and dedication. Fellow actors and leaders of the causes he fought for spoke of his unusually deep legacy, his fight for Native Americans and the environment that began at the height of his stardom.",
      "In the mid-1970s, around the same time he was appearing in such blockbusters as \u201cThe Sting\u201d and \u201cThe Way We Were,\" he immersed himself in the emerging environmental movement. He successfully opposed a power plant being built in his adopted state, Utah, and lobbied for the landmark bills the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. He also joined the board of the non-profit Natural Resources Defense Council, where he remained a guiding force up to his death.",
      "\u201cHis legacy was extraordinary,\u201d says NRDC CEO and President Manish Bapna. \u201cOne of the things that was most extraordinary about him was that he understood the power of storytelling. He could talk about climate change and the toll it was inflicting on people and communities \u2014 the fisherman coping with rising seas, a family fleeing for their lives from a raging wildfire. He would record messages, give talks or speak in front of Congress.\"",
      "Bapna last saw Redford a few months ago, when they dined in New York City.",
      "\u201cHe chose his words carefully, and every word he said was profound. He said we must continue to find ways to tell stories that reach people,\u201d Bapna said.",
      "Redford had a longtime affinity for the environment. After growing up in Southern California in the 1930s and '40s, he was disheartened to see Los Angeles transform after World War II into a mecca of pollution and traffic jams. In the early 1960s, when he came upon Provo Canyon, Utah, during a cross-country motorcycle trip, he was so awed and invigorated by the landscape that he eventually settled in the area.",
      "Entertainers over time have come to identify and, be identified with, a given cause: Harry Belafonte and civil rights, Paul Newman and nuclear disarmament, Jane Fonda and the Vietnam War. Redford, as much as anyone, helped make the environment an issue for the Hollywood elite, whether for Fonda or Julia Louis-Dreyfus or Leonardo DiCaprio, a fellow NRDC board member who called Redford's death \u201ca huge loss to our community\u201d and cited his legacy an actor and activist.",

Bill Richardson to create the Foundation to Protect New Mexico Wildlife to fight efforts by a Roswell, New Mexico, company and others to slaughter horses. The following year, the foundation reached an agreement with the Navajo Nation to manage thousands of wild horses on the reservation and keep the animals from being sent to slaughter houses.",
      "For Redford, the wild horse was representative of the American West. His advocacy also was channeled through the nonprofit group Return to Freedom, Wild Horse Conservation. The group posted on social media Tuesday that they were heartbroken.",
      "\u201cWe have all lost an irreplaceable artist, activist and environmentalist,\u201d said Neda DeMayo, founder of RTF. \u201cRobert Redford was and is an iconic and inspiring human being forever interwoven with the beauty and majesty of the West. I feel very grateful to have known him and to have had his support.\u201d",
      "Redford's activism extended to some of his film projects, whether the probes of the political system in \u201cAll the President's Men\u201d and \u201cThe Candidate\u201d or the drama \u201cThe Milagro Beanfield War,\u201d in which a local resident fights a real estate mogul for control of his land.

      "Born during the Great Depression with sun-kissed California looks, Robert Redford never failed to epitomize something quintessential and hopeful about the American character",
      "NEW YORK -- Born during the Great Depression with sun-kissed California looks, Robert Redford never failed to epitomize something quintessential and hopeful about the American character.",
      "Redford, who died Tuesday at the age of 89, left a movie trail etched into land. He seemed to reside as much across the American landscape as he did on movie screens. He was in the Rocky Mountains of \u201cJeremiah Johnson,\u201d the Wyoming grasslands of \u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\u201d the Washington, D.C., alleyways of \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men\u201d and the Montana streams of \u201cA River Runs Through It.\u201d",
      "\u201cFrom the time I was just a kid, I was always trying to break free of the bounds that I was stuck with, and always wanted to go outside,\u201d Redford told The Associated Press in 2018.",
      "Redford, a movie-star paragon, was surely savvy with how he played with and used his all-American image. No one who starred in the baseball drama \u201cThe Natural\u201d (1984) and gave Bernard Malamud\u2019s novel a storybook ending couldn't have some sense of self-mythology. But it was one of Redford\u2019s greatest feats that, despite his fame, he remained innately connected to some aspirational American ideal. Redford, an open-air actor of easy, rugged charm, evoked the kind of regular guy decency that stars like Jimmy Stewart did before him \u2014 only Redford did it through an era of distrust and disillusionment.",
      "\u201cHe was to me a throwback to the actors that I was nuts about when I was growing up and going to movies: real, classical, traditional, old-fashioned movie stars who were very, very redolent of some kind of American essence,\u201d said Sydney Pollack, who directed Redford in \u201cJeremiah Johnson,\u201d \u201cThe Way We Were\u201d and \u201cThree Days of the Condor,\u201d in 1993. \u201cThey were very much a part of the American landscape and they were heroic in a kind of understated way.\u201d",
      "That was most true, perhaps, in Utah. Wanting to escape paved-over Los Angeles, Redford first began buying land there early in his career. In Utah, he would fight to protect both untrampled wilderness and a spirit of moviemaking that had grown increasingly difficult in Hollywood. As a longtime trustee of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit environmental advocacy group, Redford was an outspoken environmentalist. In the 1970s, he successfully opposed a pair of rural Utah proposals: a six-lane highway and coal-fired power plant.",
      "In the Utah mountains, Redford also launched the Sundance Institute. Beyond Sundance's annual festival for independent film, the institute has been a lifeblood young filmmakers. Its year-round laboratory \u2014 the part of Sundance that Redford was most proud of \u2014 has helped nurture some of the most vital voices in American cinema for decades.",
      "\u201cFor me, the word to be underscored is \u2018independence,\u2019\u201d Redford once said of his legacy. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed in that word. That\u2019s what led to me eventually wanting to create a category that supported independent artists who weren\u2019t given a chance to be heard. The industry was pretty well controlled by the mainstream, which I was a part of. But I saw other stories out there that weren\u2019t having a chance to be told.\u201d",
      "That spirit of independence often infused his films, too. When Redford wanted to make \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d the seminal 1976 film directed by Alan Pakula about Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein\u2019s Watergate investigation, few in the film industry thought there was much drama to be found in a story that was then several years old.",
      "\u201cNixon had already resigned, and the held opinion (in Hollywood) was \u2018No one cares. No one wants to hear about this,\u2019\u201d Redford, who also co-produced the film, said in 2006. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018No, it\u2019s not about Nixon. It\u2019s about something else. It\u2019s about investigative journalism and hard work.\u2019\u201d",
      "If \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d one of the greatest newspaper movies, detailed the hard-earned revelations of Watergate, \u201cThree Days of the Condor\u201d \u2014 one of the greatest political thrillers \u2014 captured the paranoia and disillusionment that followed. If anyone was completely unfamiliar with why Redford was so good, \u201cThree Days of the Condor\u201d would be a good place to start.",

No one has ever been better at playing the regular guy trying to think fast on his feet, and make sense of an ever-darker world.",
      "Though some called for him to, Redford never entered politics, himself. He remained outspoken \u2014 he's in some way the model for the modern Hollywood activist \u2014 on a wide range of issues, including Indigenous and LGBTQ+ rights. The closest he came to running for office was Michael Ritchie's 1972 satire \u201cThe Candidate,\u201d in which Redford played an idealistic lawyer enlisted to challenge a highly favored incumbent Republican senator. Redford\u2019s candidate ultimately wins, but not without sacrificing his principles and seeing much of what he stands for diluted.",
      "Redford\u2019s place, instead, was outside politics. The perfect bookend to his \u201970s movies is \u201cSneakers,\u201d Phil Alden Robinson\u2019s absurdly underrated 1992 caper starring Redford as a former \u201960s radical now living under a false moniker and leading a band of security specialists. They stumble into possession of a computer device that brings the attention of the NSA, CIA, FBI and many others, forcing Redford to, yet again, try to figure out what\u2019s moral in a dangerous (and now newly digital) America.",
      "The world that Redford\u2019s films often presciently depicted seemed to push him further into the wilderness, on screen and off. He largely retreated into retirement over the last decade. When Redford died, he was at his home in the Utah mountains, outside Provo. One of his last films was 2015's \u201cA Walk in the Woods,\u201d playing Bill Bryson ambling along the Appalachian Trail.",
      "The most fitting and elegiac swan song, though was J.C. Chandor\u2019s \u201cAll Is Lost,\u201d a near-wordless 2013 drama about an old man at sea. Redford plays a solo mariner whose sailboat collides with a shipping container. Though terse, the movie reverberates with economic and ecological metaphor. A visibly older and weathered Redford \u2014 no longer the golden, freckled face of his youth \u2014 suffers through increasingly rough and stormy seas, improvising his survival.",
      "For an actor who had covered so much ground, \u201cAll Is Lost\u201d was one last frontier. Redford's unnamed character was credited only as \u201cOur Man.\u201d",

      "Major League Baseball has canceled plans to play games in London next season due to scheduling conflicts with West Ham's Olympic Stadium and TV commitments",
      "NEW YORK -- Major League Baseball has abandoned plans to play two games in London next season because of scheduling issues with West Ham's Olympic Stadium and the sport's television partner.",
      "MLB had hoped to have the New York Yankees and Toronto Blue Jays meet in London on June 13 and 14, but West Ham is home for its Premier League finale against Leeds on May 24. That left too little time to convert the field to baseball, and MLB was unable to schedule games there for later in June because Fox lacked available broadcast slots due to World Cup commitments.",
      "Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said Tuesday after his question-and-answer session at Front Office Sports' \u201cTuned In\u201d event that the London games were definitely off.",
      "MLB played in London for the first time in 2019 when the New York Yankees swept two games from the Boston Red Sox. A planned two-game series between the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs in 2020 was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic, and series were split there by the Cardinals and Cubs in 2023 and the New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies in 2024.",
      "MLB's labor contract included games in Paris for 2025 but they were called off because MLB and the players' association couldn't find a promoter.",
      "\u201cWe remain interested in Europe. We think London is an important jumping off point for us,\u201d Manfred said during his Q&A session. \u201cWe have a facility that has come a long way since the first Yankee-Red Sox game. It\u2019s a much better ballpark now than it was due to their willingness to make investments in that. We continue to believe that there\u2019s an opportunity there and that we can get at the developed economies in Europe through that London entree.\u201d",
      "Manfred said MLB is working on grassroots initiatives in India because of that nation's affinity for cricket.",
      "\u201cWe're really starting from the bottom up,\u201d he said.",
      "Mexico also is a priority. MLB played regular-season games at Monterrey in 1996, 1999, 2018 and 2019, and at Mexico City in 2023 and 2024. Arizona and San Diego are likely to play at Mexico City next April 25 and 26.",
      "\u201cWe have worked very hard to develop better relationships with the Mexican professional leagues,\" Manfred said. \"We think we can ultimately build those relationships in a way that they look like Japan and Korea: The domestic professional league thrives, but we have enough players coming to the U.S. to play that it drives our business here in the U.S.\u201d",
      "MLB has gained in the Asian market, especially in recent years because of Shohei Ohtani's following. MLB opened the season at Tokyo in 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2019 and this year, and at Seoul, South Korea, in 2024.",
      "\u201cOur approach to international has always been country by country, largely because we find the places we\u2019re interested in to be in different stages of development,\u201d Manfred said. \"With respect to Japan and Korea, we made investments there. We monetarily, and players, in terms of the sweat equity involved, of making the trip to Tokyo to open the season, making the trip to Seoul to open the season, that we have started to see return on those investments.",
      "\u201cI think that the opportunity to monetize the great fan base that we have in Japan and Korea will show up in terms of purely international revenue, but it will also show up in our national media. My prediction is there will be some of the more media companies \u2014 the streamers will be really interested in the ability to get access to well-developed economies where they don\u2019t have as much penetration as they do in countries like the United States and Canada. So it\u2019s going to show up in different places out of those developed economies.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe have, kind of have agreements in principle. We still have issues that need to be resolved. They are the agreements that have been reported publicly and we hope to push them across the finish line,\u201d Manfred said.",
      "ESPN had opted out of its deal for the Sunday night and Home Run Derby rights for 2026-28. A deal with Apple is to remain in place.",
      "\u201cIf those are the agreements that get all the way through and finish,\" Manfred said, \"we feel like we made real progress. We feel like Sunday night baseball on broadcast television is important. We worked really hard to keep ESPN in as a partner, and we think starting with Netflix is a really exciting opportunity.\u201d",
      "Manfred said talks with ESPN president James Pitaro resumed in July at the Allen & Co. Sun Valley Conference.",

      "\u201cThere will be more games available in national packages is my bet, but I could be wrong about that. We have three years to go,\u201d He said. \u201cLocal is not going away when you have 2,430 games. We\u2019re going to need a local solution for those games that are not available in national packages.\u201d",
      "He said MLB wants each team's games on fewer channels and added clubs \u201cunderstand that in order to maximize your revenue in today\u2019s media environment, you have to be more national.\"",
      "\u201cGetting more national and getting more games out there on a national basis has to be your No. 1 priority,\u201d Manfred said. \"Everybody seems to buy into that. I think there\u2019s a little more trepidation on what\u2019s going to happen with games that are not included in those national packages.\u201d",

      "Robert Redford's career spans generations, making every film notable",
      "When you\u2019re a larger-than-life, generation-spanning star like Robert Redford, the hard truth is that every movie is notable in some way. He was iconic in his own time, whether in front of the camera, or behind it. And in his lifetime, so many of his films transcended their original reviews to find passionate fanbases: Just ask older millennials about the 1992 hacker movie \u201cSneakers\u201d or the \u201cSex and the City\u201d generation about \u201cThe Way We Were.\u201d",
      "Redford died Tuesday at 89, leaving behind an arsenal of great roles that he owned, whether he was playing a quiet CIA agent, a con man, a baseball player, a grizzled mariner, an ambitious journalist, or a charming WASP in love. You could make a feast out of his Sydney Pollack collaborations alone, staring with \u201cJeremiah Johnson\u201d (streaming on Tubi ), a classic that also took on a surprising afterlife as a meme that became so popular, younger generations didn\u2019t even realize it was Redford behind that beard. His very last role came this year, a cameo in \u201cDark Winds,\u201d the AMC show about Navajo police officers he produced.",
      "This is a list of some of Redford's most memorable performances, but don\u2019t forget about the films he directed, too: among them are the all-timers \u201cOrdinary People\u201d ( streaming on MGM+ ), which won him the best director Oscar, and \u201cQuiz Show\u201d (rent on Apple TV+ ), which got him another nod.",
      "Redford and Jane Fonda play a passionate but mismatched newlywed couple whose relationship is tested by their walk-up New York apartment in this Neil Simon comedy. Reprising the role he'd played on Broadway, Redford is the uptight, conservative foil to her more free-spirited character and they\u2019re both stunningly beautiful and fun to watch. Fonda told The Guardian in 2015 that she was \u201calways in love with Robert Redford.\u201d He later responded that he wasn\u2019t aware. The two also appeared together in \u201cThe Chase\u201d (1966), \u201cThe Electric Horseman\u201d (1979) and \u201cOur Souls at Night\u201d (2017).",
      "WHERE TO WATCH: Stream on Kanopy; rent on several services, including Prime Video",
      "Redford met Paul Newman on \u201cButch Cassidy,\u201d George Roy Hill and William Goldman\u2019s Western buddy film about outlaws on the run. It was the start of a lifelong friendship, but it almost didn\u2019t happen, since the studio wanted a star like Steve McQueen or Marlon Brando instead of Redford.",
      "\u201cI was not a name equal to Paul\u2019s. I was just sort of moving up at that time,\u201d he told the AP in 2015. \u201cThere was a big argument that went on for months and months. They said it had to be a star. (Newman) said, \u2018Well, I want to work with an actor,\u2019 because Paul respected acting. Had it not been for Paul, I would not have gotten that break.\u201d",
      "WHERE TO WATCH: Rent on several services, including Prime Video",
      "A film that\u2019s as stylish as it is compelling, Redford plays an ambitious and smug downhill skier out for Olympic gold in this Michael Ritchie film. Roger Ebert, in his review, wrote that it is \u201ca portrait of a man that is so complete, and so tragic, that \u2018Downhill Racer\u2019 becomes the best movie ever made about sports \u2014 without really being about sports at all.\u201d",
      "This was one of Redford\u2019s passion projects, his first independent feature that taught him some hard lessons about Hollywood. \u201cThat was when I learned about how the film industry really works,\u201d Redford told the Harvard Business Review in 2002. \u201cThe studio simply tossed \u2018Downhill Racer\u2019 away without a second thought. I broke my heart trying to get that film promoted and distributed.\u201d",
      "WHERE TO WATCH: Stream on Kanopy or FuboTV; rent on Prime Video",
      "After the success of \u201cButch Cassidy,\u201d \u201cThe Sting,\u201d another Hill film, fell into place more easily. Redford and Newman play grifters in 1936 Chicago who fleece Robert Shaw\u2019s rich mobster in this memorable caper that went on to win best picture.",
      "\u201cWhat was interesting was the switcheroo,\u201d Redford told the AP. \u201cPaul had played these iconic, quiet, still characters in the past, and that\u2019s not what Paul is. He was a chatty, nervous guy who was always biting his fingernails. \u2026 He loved to have fun and play games.\u201d",
      "WHERE TO WATCH: Stream on Spectrum; rent on several services, including Apple TV+",
      "Ah Hubbell, that beautiful, carefree WASP who falls in love with Barbra Streisand\u2019s fiercely opinionated Katie. The making of the Pollack film, from a script standpoint, was fraught and the original writer Arthur Laurents was never quite happy with how it turned out. But this romantic drama with that memorable song has endured over the generations (it was even a reference in a pivotal \u201cSex and the City\u201d episode).",

      "To Redford, the history of this film was more interesting than the project itself. He started obsessing over the Watergate saga during a whistle-stop tour for \u201cThe Candidate,\u201d also a great and prophetic Redford film, when he overheard some journalists gossiping about the break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters and became fascinated by the journalists covering the story, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein.",
      "\u201cI wanted to know who these guys were, who created all this disturbance,\u201d Redford told the AP. \u201cI thought, \u2018Wow, one guy was a Jew, one guy was a WASP. One guy was a Republican, the other guy was a liberal. One guy was a good writer, the other wasn\u2019t very good. They didn\u2019t like each other, but they had to work together. Now that\u2019s an interesting dynamic I\u2019d love to know about.\u2019\u201d",
      "WHERE TO WATCH: Rent on several services, including Prime Video",
      "This is one of those films that might not be many critics' favorite, but its cultural impact almost negates that. Redford played baseball player Roy Hobbs in Barry Levinson\u2019s adaptation of Bernard Malamud\u2019s novel about an up-and-coming talent whose career is derailed after getting shot, but who gets another chance at greatness 16 years later.",
      "WHERE TO WATCH: Rent on several services, including Prime Video",
      "This breathtakingly beautiful historical romance (also directed by Pollack) finds Meryl Streep, as the Danish expat Karen Blixen, unable to resist the charms of Redford\u2019s big game hunter Denys Finch Hatton, an English man with no accent (Pollack thought it would be distracting for audiences). The film didn\u2019t get the best reviews, but it did go on to win the best picture Oscar.",
      "WHERE TO WATCH: Rent on several services, including Prime Video",
      "J.C. Chandor directed Redford in this harrowing survival story, in which a veteran sailor on a solo voyage in the Indian Ocean tries to survive after his yacht is stuck by a floating cargo container. Made for only $9 million, it\u2019s stripped-down and thrilling. \u201cIt\u2019s a pure cinematic experience,\u201d Redford told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cAnd that was very appealing to me at this point in my life \u2014 to be able to go back to my roots as an actor, to be interesting enough to have the audience ride along with you and almost be a part of what you are feeling and thinking.\u201d It\u2019s likely a quirk of modern film review aggregation, but it is also his highest Rotten Tomatoes score.",
      "WHERE TO WATCH: Stream on Tubi, The Roku Channel, Kanopy",
      "This indie gem from filmmaker David Lowery, about a 70-year-old San Quentin escapee who embarks on a series of bank heists, was a bit of a swan song for Redford, who was 82 when it was released. His character, Forrest Tucker, is the kind of thief who left his victims disarmed, with one bank teller explaining to the police, \u201cHe was a gentleman.\u201d It\u2019s one of those films that\u2019s almost comforting to watch, a reassuring testament to his enduring appeal. Charisma doesn\u2019t need to dwindle with age, and Redford was proof.",

      "The show brought blockbuster buzz for its first season from the start and the Emmys ate it up, whether because of Hollywood's love for stories about itself (with A-list guest stars) or the television industry's love for stories that mock the self-importance of movie people.",
      "Backstage, Rogen clumsily tried to hold up all four Emmys at once. Asked whether the night will be fodder for season two, he said no.",
      "\u201cThis is, like, far too good a thing to have happen on our show,\u201d he said. \u201cOur show is generally based on stress and disappointment and right now, we\u2019re all very happy.\u201d",
      "Smart's castmate and constant scene partner Hannah Einbinder, who had also been nominated for all four seasons of \u201cHacks\u201d but unlike Smart had never won, took best supporting actress in a comedy.",
      "She said she had become committed to a long-term bit where \u201cit was cooler to lose.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut this is cool too!\u201d she shouted, then ended her speech by cursing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and saying \u201cFree Palestine!\u201d Political sentiments from the stage were otherwise rare.",
      "In perhaps the night's biggest upset, Jeff Hiller won best supporting actor in a comedy for \u201cSomebody Somewhere,\u201d over Ike Barinholtz of \u201cThe Studio\u201d and others.",
      "Colbert may have been the night's most popular winner, taking best talk series for \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert\u201d for the first time. He got huge ovations both when he took the stage to present the first award and when he won.",
      "The win may have been the result of a protest vote and a desire to pay tribute to its host, weeks after its cancellation by CBS. Jimmy Kimmel, who was among his competitors, campaigned for Colbert to win.",
      "\u201cSometimes you only truly know how much you love something when you get a sense that you might be losing it,\u201d Colbert said in his acceptance.",
      "Many perceived the end of the show as punishment of Colbert and placation of President Donald Trump after Colbert was harshly critical of a legal settlement between the president and Paramount, which needed administration approval for a sale to Skydance Media. Executives called the decision strictly financial.",
      "Colbert showed no bitterness to CBS, thanking the network, which telecast the Emmys and aired a commercial celebrating his win, for letting him be part of the late-night tradition.",
      "Bargatze delivered his opening monologue only after the first award was handed out.",
      "The show opened with a sketch where \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d stars Mikey Day, Bowen Yang and James Austin Johnson joined Bargatze, who played television inventor Philo T. Farnsworth opining on what the future of TV will be like.",
      "Bargatze-as-Farnsworth mentions that there will one day be a Black Entertainment Television. When asked if there will be a network for white people, he replied, \u201cWhy, CBS of course.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Ed Sheeran has long sought to bring people together with his music, whether it be his emotionally resonant acoustic ballads or unproblematic, danceable pop hits",
      "NEW YORK -- Ed Sheeran has long sought to bring people together with his music, whether it be his emotionally resonant acoustic ballads or unproblematic, danceable pop hits. \u201cPlay,\u201d his eighth studio album out Friday, stays in that familiar lane for the most part.",
      "In his quest, Sheeran has maintained an everyman quality by carefully evolving with the status quo (while, largely, removing himself from public discourse, save his copyright court win and more recent promotional pop-ups in everyman places, like a New York City ice cream shop just this week). The aesthetic of Ed Sheeran, global star, still matches that of Ed Sheeran, up-and-coming troubadour. Most of the time, it's still just Sheeran, his guitar and his loop pedal against the world.",
      "Of course, Sheeran, like most pop stars, knows that as his stardom has risen and his audience widened, the meaning of that relatability has shifted. His listeners, over a decade in, know that too. So \u201cPlay,\u201d the first project in a new series from Sheeran named for symbols (he's said \u201cRewind\u201d will be next), uses Sheeran's global acclaim to his advantage \u2014 without straying too far from his singer-songwriter roots.",
      "Recorded throughout his \u201cMathematics World Tour\u201d and finished in Goa, India, the project feels split. There are moments that herald the return of Sheeran the hitmaker, an exciting development after his last two albums \u2014 the final chapter of his mathematics series, \u201cSubtract,\u201d and the folk-pop \u201cAutumn Variations\u201d \u2014 were well received but failed to produce the kind of chart-toppers that created Sheeran, the megastar. Most tracks, however, fall more in line with those albums, deviating little from the narrative songwriting toolkit that raised Sheeran, the artist.",
      "Sheeran turned to new collaborators for a couple songs that are already established hits. The addictive \u201cSapphire\u201d features Indian singer Arijit Singh, who ranks among Spotify's most popular artists globally. A Farsi version of the single \u201cAzizam,\u201d written and produced with Ilya Salmanzadeh, Savan Kotecha and Johnny McDaid, was released in April featuring Iranian singer Googoosh. Sheeran isn't just eyeing the U.S. and U.K. charts here \u2014 he's playing for cross-cultural domination, and having fun while doing it.",
      "The rest of the tracks, those that feel more classically Sheeran, see old themes recycled: \u201cOld Phone\u201d provides him the space to remember old friends and reminisce about his changing personal life, just as the landscape in 2017's \u201cCastle on the Hill\u201d provided a tangible marker of memory. The conceit of the sappily sweet \u201cCamera\u201d \u2014 \u201cI don't need a camera to capture this moment\u201d \u2014 comes in conflict with that of Sheeran's own beloved \u201cPhotograph\u201d from 2014's \u201cMultiply.\u201d",
      "There are still moments that feel like they'll stick: Sheeran's ode to his daughters, \u201cFor Always,\u201d with cooing backing vocals from co-writer Amy Allen, is sure to be a favorite father-daughter dance track, right behind the groovy \u201cThe Vow\u201d on wedding playlists.",
      "Sheeran flexes his pen on \u201cOpening,\u201d the album's first track. Bounded by glittery verses about boundaries, he raps about his family, his mental health, that court case, fame and what comes next. \u201cBeen a long time up top but I ain\u2019t complacent/If I look down I can see replacements,\u201d he raps at one point. \u201cGotta make dreams and chase them.\u201d",
      "Sheeran wants to be for everyone. And to do that, he'll still be an everyman.",

      "The exact questions to be voted on Thursday and Friday in Atlanta are unclear. Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to questions seeking details to a newly posted agenda, although the department announced five additional appointments to the committee Monday.",
      "Some public health experts are worried that the votes will \u2014 at a minimum \u2014 raise unwarranted new questions about vaccines in the minds of parents.",
      "Perhaps even more consequential would be a vote that restricts a government program from paying for vaccines for low-income families.",
      "\u201cI'm tightening my seat belt,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University vaccines expert.",
      "The panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, makes recommendations to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how already-approved vaccines should be used. CDC directors have almost always accepted those recommendations, which are widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs.",

      "Before Kennedy was health secretary, ACIP would typically vote in June to reaffirm recommendations for shots against respiratory viruses that sicken millions of Americans each fall and winter.",
      "This past June, Kennedy's ACIP voted to recommend flu shots for Americans but was silent on COVID-19 shots.",
      "Before that meeting, Kennedy announced he was removing COVID-19 shots from the CDC's recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women. The move was heavily criticized by doctors' groups and public health organizations, and prompted a lawsuit by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other groups.",
      "Days after Kennedy's announcement, CDC officials said families could still get the 2024-2025 version of COVID-19 shots for their kids in consultation with their doctors. That clarification meant shots would still be covered by the federal government's Vaccines For Children program, which pays for shots for families who lack money or adequate health insurance coverage. It's now responsible for roughly half of childhood vaccinations in the U.S. each year.",
      "As with flu shots, however, there are new COVID-19 formulations each fall, to account for changes in which strains are circulating. The committee has not yet voted on whether to recommend this season's COVID-19 shots or whether those shots should be covered by the VFC program.",
      "Further complicating the picture: When the FDA last month licensed this fall's COVID-19 shots, the agency took the unusual step of narrowing their use for healthy younger adults and children.",
      "If the ACIP simply follows that, and if there is no additional clarifying language from the CDC, then \u201cthat would take away access for roughly half of America\u2019s kids,\u201d said Dr. Sean O'Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "The pediatricians group urges that vaccinations continue for all children ages 6 months to 2 years.",
      "Hepatitis B can cause serious liver infections. In adults, the virus is spread through sex or through sharing needles during use injection-drug use.",
      "But the virus also can be passed to a baby from an infected mother, and as many as 90% of infected infants go on to have chronic infections.",
      "A hepatitis B vaccine was first licensed in the U.S. in 1981. In 2005, the ACIP recommended a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds (2 kilograms).",
      "Infant vaccinations are stressed for women who have hepatitis B or, crucially, who have not been tested for it. The infant shots are 85% to 95% effective in preventing chronic hepatitis B infections, studies have shown.",
      "Newborn hepatitis B vaccinations are considered a success, and no recent peer-reviewed research shows any safety problem with giving kids the shots on their first day of life, Schaffner said.",

      "Youth in Lahaina, Hawaii, have been struggling since wildfires destroyed their hometown two years ago",
      "LAHAINA, Hawaii -- Mia Palacio felt like she lost a piece of herself when wildfires destroyed her hometown of Lahaina.",
      "She isolated from loved ones after the 2023 disaster while struggling to process the grief, often angry that her family didn't have a permanent place to stay and that so many others were unable to evacuate.",
      "Moving between high schools, she never felt welcome, Palacio said, and the pain only intensified as the months wore on. Finally, near the first anniversary of the fires, Palacio reached out for help.",
      "Hundreds of students like Palacio have struggled mentally since the fires \u2013 and not all have received the help they need.",
      "The Hawaii Department of Education estimates more than a third of Maui students lost a family member, sustained a serious injury or had a parent lose a job after the fires, which killed 102 people and damaged more than 3,300 properties in Lahaina.",
      "____",
      "AP is collaborating with Honolulu Civil Beat, CalMatters, Blue Ridge Public Radio, and Centro de Periodismo Investigativo in Puerto Rico to examine how school communities are recovering from the disruption of natural disasters.",
      "____",
      "Two years later, many in Lahaina are ready to return to normal. But therapists say students\u2019 mental health challenges continue to mount.",
      "That\u2019s common after a disaster, especially at the two-year mark, when adrenaline wears off and stress remains high, said Christopher Knightsbridge, one of several researchers at the University of Hawaii who has studied the well-being of Lahaina fire survivors. While kids may feel numb immediately following a disaster, after two years, they\u2019re facing the toll of constant uncertainty and change, he said.",
      "It\u2019s a phenomenon seen wherever schooling has been disrupted by natural disasters, reporting by Honolulu Civil Beat, The Associated Press and several other news outlets shows. But a couple years after the disaster, schools are not always prepared with extra mental health supports.",
      "On Maui, the island is dealing with an ongoing shortage of specialists. In the past few years, the number of psychiatrists serving youth has dropped from four to two, even as demand has grown.",
      "\u201cThe crisis isn\u2019t over,\u201d Knightsbridge said.",
      "Palacio made progress with the help of a school counselor and then a local organization that supports teens\u2019 mental health through outdoor activities and adventures.",
      "The senior at Lahainaluna High School said she\u2019s now more comfortable confiding in others and controlling her emotions. She takes pride in mentoring younger students who also have struggled since the fires.",
      "Two years in, many kids still wrestle with depression and anxiety.",
      "DayJahiah Valdivia, a senior at K\u012bhei Charter School, said her stress levels spike when there are strong winds or small brush fires. Valdivia lives in Upcountry Maui, which also faced wildfires that burned over a thousand acres of land on the same day as the 2023 Lahaina fires. Her home was spared, but it took months for her family to return because their property was covered in soot and needed professional cleaning.",
      "She feels less anxious now that her family members have discussed their escape plan for future disasters. But a summer fire near a friend\u2019s home in Central Maui renewed her fears about her loved ones\u2019 safety.",
      "\u201cThe anxiety never really wore off,\u201d she said. On windy days, it was especially difficult to concentrate in class or feel safe.",
      "In a University of Hawaii study of fire survivors conducted in 2024, just over half of children reported symptoms of depression, and 30% were likely facing an anxiety disorder. Nearly half of kids in the study, ages 10 to 17, were experiencing PTSD.",
      "Children in disaster-torn towns across the U.S. can relate.",
      "In Paradise, California, where the 2018 Camp Fire took 85 lives, a protracted period of disillusionment followed what some called the \u201chero phase,\u201d when the community pulled together and vowed to resurrect their town. Both Lahaina and Paradise had housing shortages after their fires, so families had to move away or live with friends to go to school or work in the area. In general, students who don\u2019t have a permanent living arrangement tend to struggle more academically and have more behavioral challenges, research shows.",
      "Many Paradise students still struggle with anxiety and grief, seven years later, making it difficult to fully engage in school. A year after the Camp Fire, 17% of students were homeless, and the suspension rate was 7.4%, compared to 2.5% statewide. The suspension rate remained nearly triple the state average last year, and more than 26% were chronically absent.",
      "Aryah Berkowitz, who lost her home, two dogs and her family\u2019s business in the Paradise blaze, dealt with lingering behavioral challenges following the disaster. For nearly a year afterward, her family of seven, plus a pair of surviving pit bull-Labrador mixes, lived with a friend in nearby Chico, sharing two bedrooms and a bathroom. Berkowitz, then in sixth grade, slept on the couch.",
      "\u201cI was having to help my family a lot and wasn\u2019t able to handle it,\u201d said Berkowitz , once a high-achieving student who was suspended twice after the fire. \u201cI was holding it inside and took it out on other people. Some days I\u2019d just walk out of class.\u201d",
      "Back on Maui, many students similarly disengaged from school.",

      "In a state survey of Maui students in the first year after the fires, roughly half of kids said they were having trouble focusing in class or felt upset when they were reminded of the wildfires.",
      "Some have struggled to retain class material or simply stopped attending in-person classes as they moved between hotel rooms and temporary housing, Lahainaluna High teacher Jarrett Chapin said. A few moved to online learning as their families faced continued instability.",
      "\u201cThey just sort of vanished,\u201d Chapin said.",
      "Maui has long dealt with medical workforce challenges. Even before the fires, it faced a shortage of mental health professionals because they struggled with the state\u2019s high cost of living and housing shortage.",
      "The fires brought burnout and greater economic obstacles, only exacerbating the issue. Since then, Hawaii\u2019s education department has tried to bulk up Maui\u2019s mental health staff by bringing in providers from neighbor islands and the mainland and, more recently, using a $2 million federal grant to support students.",
      "But hiring mental health staff has been so difficult that even the federal money hasn\u2019t made much of a dent. In the first nine months of the grant, the state education department primarily used the money to bus displaced students from other parts of the island to Lahaina schools.",
      "The state has used the money to hire five part-time mental health providers working with students and staff, including one specialist who works in the evenings with students living as boarders on Lahainaluna\u2019s campus, said Kimberly Lessard, a Department of Education district specialist.",
      "Two of the six behavioral health specialist positions in Lahaina schools remained unfilled this summer, as they have been for years due to Maui\u2019s housing shortage and high cost of living, Lessard said.",
      "Valdivia, who still struggles with anxiety from the Upcountry Maui fires, has seen the impacts of the provider shortage firsthand. She\u2019s on a two- to three-month waiting list to see a psychiatrist on Maui, and she\u2019s seeing an O\u02bbahu-based therapist via telehealth because there aren\u2019t enough providers who can meet with her in person.",
      "\u201cEven just to get evaluated (by a psychiatrist), it\u2019s literally months,\u201d she said. \u201cI just think that\u2019s crazy.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s common for disaster-torn communities to struggle with shortages of psychological staff, often because of burnout and a lack of resources.",
      "In Puerto Rico, which has suffered from a series of disasters since Hurricane Maria struck in 2017, students have experienced high rates of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "Yet despite legislation in 2000 to create more school psychologist positions, it wasn\u2019t until the pandemic that the commonwealth\u2019s Education Department dedicated money to hire them. Today, there are 58 vacancies across the archipelago\u2019s 870 schools.",
      "The school psychologists \u201ccan\u2019t keep up,\u201d said Nellie Zambrana, a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Puerto Rico at R\u00edo Piedras. Those who are working are overstretched, according to a study by the university\u2019s Psychological Research Institute. One psychologist, the study said, was assigned to more than 100 students at three schools.",
      "Loren Lapow wasn\u2019t deterred by the storm clouds gathering one June afternoon over D.T. Fleming Beach on Maui. The social worker helped teens carry an inflatable paddleboard to the water\u2019s edge, cheering them on as they swam.",
      "Amid the fun, Lapow directed the teens to reflect on their fears and losses. He asked them how they feel when they smell smoke or think about Lahaina\u2019s famed Front Street, most of which was destroyed in the blaze.",
      "\u201cPlaces are like a friend to us,\u201d Lapow said. \u201cWhen you lose places, it hurts.\u201d",
      "Lapow founded the Maui Hero Project, which his website describes as \u201cadventure-based counseling services.\u201d The eight-week program Lapow started 25 years ago teaches teens basic disaster preparedness skills and immerses them in outdoor activities. It's also a form of mental health support, which Lapow has leaned into since the wildfires.",
      "Lapow\u2019s approach has become a common strategy for nonprofits and therapists trying to reach kids who have balked at discussing their mental health since the fires. But those efforts don't always reach the kids who need the most help.",
      "There\u2019s a strong stigma around seeking mental health services, particularly in Filipino and Latino communities that make up a large portion of Lahaina\u2019s population, said Ruben Juarez, a professor at University of Hawaii who led the research study on fire survivors. Families may see counseling as a sign of weakness, and children may be reluctant to open up to therapists out of fear of being judged or scrutinized, he added.",
      "Yet in the study, Latino teens reported the highest rates of severe depressive and PTSD symptoms. Filipino teens reported some of the highest rates of anxiety.",
      "The state is hoping struggling students will open up to their peers. A new program called YouthLine will train Hawaii teens to respond to crisis calls, said Keli Acquaro, who oversees youth mental health for the state.",
      "Keakealani Cashman, who graduated from Kamehameha Schools Maui in 2024, is hoping to be part of the state\u2019s solution to provide more mental health support to the next generation of children.",
      "After losing her home to the fires, Cashman spent her senior year talking to Native Hawaiian practitioners and researching how cultural values, such as connections to the land and her ancestors, could help her community heal from the trauma of the fires. The project helped her own mental health improve, said Cashman, who regularly met with her school\u2019s behavioral health specialist.",
      "Now, Cashman is entering her second year at Brigham Young University Hawaii and hopes to work as a behavioral health specialist in Hawaiian language immersion schools",
      "\u201cThis horrible, horrible thing happened to me and my family, but I don\u2019t have to let it kill the rest of my life,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cI can really help my family, my community in school, and just make an impact in what I know how to do.\u201d",

      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer is willing to risk a government shutdown at the end of the month if Republicans don\u2019t accept Democratic demands on health care",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer weathered backlash from Democrats earlier this year when he voted with Republicans to keep the government open. But he\u2019s now willing to risk a shutdown at the end of the month if Republicans don\u2019t accede to Democratic demands.",
      "Schumer says he and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries are united in opposing any legislation that doesn\u2019t include key health care provisions and a commitment not to roll them back. He argues that the country is in a different place than it was in March, when he vigorously argued against a shutdown, and he says he believes Republicans and President Donald Trump will be held responsible if they don\u2019t negotiate a bipartisan deal.",
      "\u201cThings have changed\u201d since the March vote, Schumer said in an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday. He said Republicans have since passed Trump\u2019s massive tax breaks and spending cuts legislation, which trimmed Medicaid and other government programs, and Democrats are now unified \u2014 unlike in March, when he voted with Republicans and Jeffries voted against legislation to fund the government.",
      "A shutdown, Schumer said, wouldn\u2019t necessarily worsen an environment in which Trump is already challenging the authority of Congress. \u201cIt will get worse with or without it, because Trump is lawless,\u201d Schumer said.",
      "Schumer\u2019s threat comes as Republicans are considering a short-term stopgap spending measure to avoid a Sept. 30 shutdown and as Democrats face what most see as two tough choices if the parties can\u2019t negotiate a deal \u2014 vote with Republicans to keep the government open or let it close indefinitely with no clear exit plan.",
      "It also comes amid worsening partisan tensions in the Senate, where negotiations between the two parties over the confirmation process broke down for a second time Thursday and Republicans are changing Senate rules to get around Democratic objections. Democrats are also fuming over the Trump administration\u2019s decision to unilaterally claw back $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid just as negotiations over the spending deadline were getting underway in late August.",
      "Republicans have said that Democrats clearly will be to blame if they don\u2019t vote to keep the government open, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has repeatedly said that Schumer needs to come to them with a specific proposal on health care, including an extension of expanded government tax credits for many Americans who get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. Some Republicans are open to extending those credits before they expire at the end of the year.",

      "Schumer\u2019s move to support the spending legislation in March put him in the rare position of bucking his party\u2019s base. He said then that of two bad options, a partial government shutdown was worse because it would give Trump even more control to shut down agencies and there would be \u201cno off-ramp\u201d to get out of it. \u201cI think people realize it\u2019s a tough choice,\u201d he said.",
      "He faced massive backlash from within the party after the vote, with some activists calling on him to resign. Jeffries temporarily distanced himself from his New York colleague, saying in a statement immediately after Schumer\u2019s vote that House Democrats \u201cwill not be complicit.\u201d The majority of Senate Democrats also voted against the plan.",
      "This time, though, Schumer is in lockstep with Jeffries and in messaging within his caucus. In Democrats\u2019 closed-door lunch Wednesday, he shared polling that he said suggested most Americans would blame Trump, not Democrats, for a shutdown.",

      "The widow of Alexei Navalny said Wednesday that two independent labs have found that her husband was poisoned shortly before his death in a Russian prison.",
      "Navalny, who crusaded against official corruption and staged massive anti-Kremlin protests as President Vladimir Putin\u2019s fiercest foe, died in the Arctic penal colony in February 2024. He was serving a 19-year sentence that he believed to be politically motivated.",
      "Authorities said that the politician became ill after a walk but have otherwise given few details on his death. He was 47.",
      "In a video released Wednesday, Yulia Navalnaya said that biological samples from Navalny\u2019s body had been taken out of Russia and tested at two laboratories abroad.",
      "She said that both laboratories concluded that Navalny had been poisoned, but had not released their findings due to \u201cpolitical considerations.\" She did not provide proof or elaborate on what the alleged poison was.",
      "\u201cThese labs in two different countries reached the same conclusion: Alexei was killed. More specifically, he was poisoned,\u201d Navalnaya said in the video, which was posted on social media. In the clip, she questioned the lack of video footage from the prison and showed images purported to be of Navalny's cell on the day of his death showing vomit on the floor. She did not provide direct proof that Navalny had been poisoned or that it had been carried out by prison authorities.",
      "\u201cI demand that the laboratories that conducted the research publish their results,\" she said. \"Stop appeasing Putin for some higher \u2018considerations.\u2019 You cannot placate him. While you stay silent, he does not stop,\u201d Navalnaya said.",

      "Britain's King Charles III has greeted Donald Trump in Windsor, kicking off the president\u2019s second state visit to the United Kingdom",
      "WINDSOR, England -- WINDSOR, England (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump was greeted by royalty, military honor guards and mounted troops in red and gold as he arrived at Windsor Castle on Wednesday to begin a two-day state visit to Britain as the guest of King Charles III.",
      "Prince William and his wife Catherine met the president\u2019s Marine One helicopter as it landed in the private Walled Garden on the vast castle estate, walking the president and first lady Melania Trump over to be greeted by the king and Queen Camilla.",
      "The guests traveled to the castle in a procession of horse-drawn carriages, past ranks of soldiers, sailors and aviators, as military bands played the U.S. and British national anthems. The king and president chatted in the Irish State Coach during the short journey to the castle quadrangle, where Trump, accompanied by Charles, inspected an honor guard of soldiers in red tunics and bearskin hats.",
      "The day of royal pageantry is the highlight of the president\u2019s unprecedented second state visit to Britain. And it's on a scale designed to impress the grandeur-loving president, involving some 120 horses and 1,300 troops, including the largest guard of honor in living memory.",
      "It\u2019s a spectacle with a purpose: to bolster ties with a world leader known for a love of bling at a time when his America First policies are putting pressure on trade and security arrangements globally.",
      "Trump arrived in London late Tuesday and said he loved being back in the United Kingdom, calling it a \u201cvery special place.\u201d Asked if he had a message for Charles, he said the king was a longtime friend of his and well-respected.",
      "The backdrop for day one is Windsor Castle, an almost 1,000-year-old royal residence with gilded interiors, crenelated towers and priceless artworks. A gigantic royal standard, the flag used for official celebration days, flew from the castle\u2019s Royal Tower as the king and queen prepared for the Trumps to arrive by helicopter from London, where they spent Tuesday night at the U.S. ambassador\u2019s residence.",
      "The prospect of a visit to the castle has seemed to enchant Trump, who ditched his trademark bluster and described the invitation as \u201ca great, great honor.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think that also is why he seems so visibly excited about the second meeting, because it isn\u2019t an invitation given to (just) anyone,\u201d said George Gross, an expert on the British monarchy at King\u2019s College London.",
      "While Britain\u2019s royals long ago gave up political power, their history, tradition and celebrity give them a cachet that means presidents and prime ministers covet an invitation to join them. That makes the invitations, handed out at the request of the elected government, a powerful tool to reward friends and wring concessions out of reluctant allies.",
      "No U.S. president, or any other world leader, has ever had the honor of a second U.K. state visit. That won\u2019t be lost on a president who often describes his actions with superlatives and has made no secret of his fondness for Britain\u2019s royals.",
      "After a day of royal pomp, Trump will hold talks Thursday with Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who will tout a new U.K.-U.S. technology deal. The British government hopes the deal, and billions in investment from U.S. tech firms, will help show that the trans-Atlantic bond remains strong despite differences over Ukraine, the Middle East and the future of NATO.",
      "Starmer also hopes to avoid awkward questions about Jeffrey Epstein. Days before the state visit, Starmer fired Britain\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., Peter Mandelson, over the envoy\u2019s past friendship with the convicted sex offender.",

      "A central plank of the deal, which is expected to be signed in Washington in a few weeks, is the withdrawal of Rwanda\u2019s support for the group. The deal is also expected to stipulate the concession of territories back to the Congolese authorities.",
      "A Qatar-led mediation between the warring sides led to both sides committing to ending the conflict, but pockets of skirmishes have recently been reported between the M23 and government-aligned groups. Both sides have consistently accused each other of violating the ceasefire agreement.",
      "On Sunday, the rebels paraded more than 7,000 new recruits in Goma, the regional center.",
      "The M23 said the recruits included Congolese soldiers who surrendered when fighting escalated this year and the local militia members who fought with them. Rights groups have raised concerns about soldiers and young residents being pressured to join the rebels.",
      "\u2033(The parade) constitutes a form of materialization of an occupation that is taking root and increasingly taking the tacit form of a state within a state,\u201d said Christian Moleka, a Congo-based political analyst.",
      "The military show of force also sapped hope among residents in rebel-held cities who were looking forward to peace agreements to bring an end to the conflict.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve just seen thousands of new M23 fighters again. We are losing hope,\u201d Adeline Munene, 34, told The Associated Press. \u201cWe thought the Washington and Doha agreements would bring peace. Now I\u2019m disappointed.\u201d",

He also noted that in addition to Poland, \u201cdrones violate our airspace in Romania, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.\u201d",
      "When Russia first used the Oreshnik against Ukraine in November 2024, Putin warned the West it could use it next against allies of Kyiv that allowed it to strike inside Russia with their longer-range missiles.",
      "Putin has bragged that Oreshnik\u2019s multiple warheads plunge at speeds of up to Mach 10 and can't be intercepted, and that several of them used in a conventional strike could be as devastating as a nuclear attack.

      "Deploying tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus would allow Russian aircraft and missiles to reach potential targets in Ukraine more easily and quickly if Moscow decides to use them. It also extends Russia\u2019s capability to target several NATO allies in eastern and central Europe.",

      "The swap attracted about 150 people, and grew from there. Now, the twice-yearly event, which organizers call The Biggest Swap in the Northwest, draws between 500 and 850 participants to share clothes and accessories in a partylike atmosphere.",
      "\u201cWe have a DJ and two full bars, so there\u2019s some singing and dancing. But no one\u2019s getting drunk at 1 p.m. on a Sunday afternoon,\u201d said Ridgway\u2019s co-founder, Elizabeth Mollo.",
      "The swap is part of a larger movement across the country to share resources with neighbors \u2014 one shirt, meal or book at time.",
      "The Portland event asks for a $10 entry fee to cover costs, but the clothes are free and there\u2019s no limit to how much participants can take. People bring their gently used clothing, shoes and accessories to a sorting station, where volunteers sort it into bins and onto tables.",
      "Ridgway, who worked in the apparel industry, sees the process as an answer to throwaway \u201cfast fashion.\u201d She describes \u201cthe \u2018peak pile\u2019 moment, when our sorters are summiting a mountain, a literal tonnage of apparel, sorting as quickly as they can. In this moment, we see the true ramifications of consumer culture and waste.\u201d",
      "Leftover clothing is donated to another free neighborhood swapping event.",
      "Ridgway recalls a single mom telling her she was able to outfit her teenager with Nike shoes and other major brands typically outside her price range. \u201cThese conversations, and so many others, have truly kept me coming back to this event,\u201d she says.",
      "There are no dressing rooms, so participants are encouraged to come in tight-fitting clothes and try things on where they are.",
      "\u201cIt does get a little chaotic,\u201d Mollo says, but many people return year after year.",

A friend suggested she put the extras into a community refrigerator, like ones they knew of in places like New York City. But Scott found there was nothing of the sort in Richmond.",
      "\u201cI decided that was what I was going to do for my birthday,\u201d she says.",
      "Scott hopped on Instagram to see if her friends wanted to help, and quickly received an offer of a fridge and a promise to paint it. Several months and planning calls later, she opened her first community fridge outside a cafe, in January 2021.",

      "The Federal Reserve is expected to cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time in nine months",
      "NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve is expected to cut its benchmark interest rate Wednesday for the first time in nine months. Since the last cut, progress on inflation has slowed while the labor market has cooled. That means Americans are dealing with both high prices and a challenging job market.",
      "The federal funds rate, set by the Federal Reserve, is the rate at which banks borrow and lend to one another. While the rates that consumers pay to borrow money aren\u2019t directly linked to this rate, shifts in Fed policy affect what people pay for credit cards, auto loans, mortgages, and other financial products.",
      "The Fed has two goals when it sets the rate: one, to manage prices for goods and services, and two, to encourage full employment. This is known as the \u201cdual mandate.\u201d Typically, the Fed might increase the rate to try to bring down inflation and decrease it to encourage faster economic growth and more hiring. The challenge now is that inflation is higher than the Fed's 2% target but the job market is weak, putting the Fed in a difficult position.",
      "\u201cThe dual mandate is always a balancing act,\" said Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at personal finance site NerdWallet.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "For prospective homebuyers, the market has already priced in the rate cut, which means it's \u201cunlikely to make a noticeable difference for most consumers at the time of the announcement,\u201d according to Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates.",
      "\u201cMuch of the impact on mortgage rates has already occurred through anticipation alone,\u201d he said. \"(Mortgage) rates have been falling since January and dropped further as weaker-than-expected economic data pointed to a cooling economy.\u201d",
      "Still, Kates said a declining interest rate environment will provide some relief for borrowers over time.",
      "\u201cWhether it\u2019s a homeowner with a 7% mortgage or a recent graduate hoping to refinance student loans and credit card debt, lower rates can ease the burden on many indebted households by opening opportunities to refinance or consolidate,\u201d he said.",
      "For savers, falling interest rates will slowly erode attractive yields currently on offer with certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts.",
      "Right now, the best rates on offer for each have been hovering at or above 4% for CDs and at 4.6% for high-yield savings accounts, according to DepositAccounts.com.",
      "Those are still better than the trends of recent years, and a good option for consumers who want to earn a return on money they may want to access in the near-term. A high-yield savings account generally has a much higher annual percentage yield than a traditional savings account. The national average for traditional savings accounts is currently 0.38%.",

      "Mayor Eric Adams, in joining supporters of a ban, cited safety concerns in the increasingly crowded green space, including incidents in recent years of horses collapsing and dying on the job or breaking free from their drivers and running loose in the park.",
      "\u201cWhile horse-drawn carriages have long been an iconic fixture of Central Park, they are increasingly incompatible with the conditions of a modern, heavily-used urban green space,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIt has become abundantly clear that these horse-drawn carriages no longer work for our city.\u201d",
      "The Democrat, who faces a steep climb in his bid for reelection as an independent, said he sent the City Council a \u201cletter of necessity\u201d giving lawmakers the authority to expedite passage of a bill phasing out horse-drawn carriages.",
      "Adams also issued an executive order that, among other things, orders police to \u201cprioritize enforcement\u201d against horse-drawn carriages operating outside their legally designated areas to illegally solicit fares or impede traffic.",
      "In addition, the mayor\u2019s order directs city agencies to identify new employment opportunities for industry workers and to create a process for the voluntary return of carriage licenses.",
      "\u201cThis is not about eliminating this tradition \u2014 it\u2019s about honoring our traditions in a way that aligns with who we are today,\u201d Adams said. \u201cNew Yorkers care deeply about animals, about fairness, and about doing what\u2019s right.\u201d",
      "John Samuelsen, president of the Transport Workers Union of America, which represents horse carriage workers, dismissed the announcement as a \u201cdesperation act\u201d by a mayor badly lagging his campaign rivals, including Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, former Gov.

      "Animal rights groups, which have long called for ending the industry over concerns about the health and welfare of the horses, applauded the announcement.",
      "\u201cThis is a life-saving step for both people and horses, and it makes clear what we and so many New Yorkers have long said: horse-drawn carriages have no place in our city any longer,\u201d said Edita Birnkrant, executive director of New Yorkers for Clean, Livable, and Safe Streets, or NYCLASS.",

      "Most economists and Wall Street analysts are expecting the Fed to announce a quarter-point rate cut Wednesday, which would be its first of the year. The U.S. central bank has been holding off on cutting rates because inflation has remained above its 2% target, fearing that lower interest rates could give it more fuel.",
      "Recent data has shown that the U.S. job market has not been as strong as previously thought and traders now believe Fed officials view that as the bigger danger for the economy than the threat of higher inflation because of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "With a 25 basis point cut expected by most to be a virtual certainty, much of the focus Wednesday will be on the Fed's quarterly economic projections that will be released after the meeting. Many economists forecast they will show that officials expect three total reductions this year and at least two more next year, which would give a slowing but still steady economy a boost.",

      "LITTLETON, Colo. -- When Lena Astilli first bought her home outside of Denver, she had no interest in matching the wall-to-wall green lawns that dominated her block. She wanted native plants \u2014 the kind she remembered and loved as a child in New Mexico, that require far less water and have far more to offer insects and birds that are in decline.",
      "\u201cA monoculture of Kentucky bluegrass is not helping anybody,\u201d Astilli said. After checking several nurseries before finding one that had what she wanted, she has slowly been reintroducing those native plants to her yard.",
      "Though Astilli was replacing grass just last month, it remains ubiquitous in American yards. It's a tradition that began more than two centuries ago with the landed gentry copying the landscaping of Europe's wealthy, and grass now dominates as the familiar planting outside everything from single-family homes to apartment complexes to office parks and retail malls.",
      "\u201cIn the absence of simple directions and guidance about what to do with their landscape, they default to lawn because it\u2019s easy,\u201d said Mark Richardson, executive director of the Ecological Landscape Alliance, a nonprofit that promotes sustainable landscaping.",
      "Yet that grass is problematic in deserts and any place with limited water, such as the American West, where it won't do well without irrigation. As climate change makes the world hotter and triggers more extreme weather, including drought, thirsty expanses of groomed emerald are taxing freshwater supplies that are already under stress.",
      "Enter xeriscaping \u2014 landscaping aimed at vastly reducing the need for irrigation, including by using native or drought-tolerant plants. (A utility here, Denver Water, says it coined the term in 1981 by combining \u201clandscape\u201d with the Greek word \u201cxeros,\u201d which means dry, to encourage reduced water use.)",
      "The average U.S. family uses 320 gallons (1,211 liters) of water every day, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Nearly a third of that is devoted to outdoor water use. It's even more for people with thirsty plants in dry places.",
      "\u201cPotable water is going to become harder and harder to come by,\u201d said Richardson. \u201cLawn reduction is a fantastic way to limit the use of water in the landscape.\u201d",
      "His group isn't keen on grass even in areas like the Northeast or Midwest, where drought and water use aren't as problematic as in the West. Less lawn means fewer pesticides and fertilizers washing into rivers. More native plants mean more rest stops and nesting grounds for pollinators like birds, butterflies and bees, which have faced serious population declines in recent decades.",
      "\u201cWe can bring nature back into our urban and suburban areas,\u201d said Haven Kiers, associate professor of landscape architecture at University of California-Davis. \u201cImproving biodiversity, creating habitat is going to be a huge thing for the environment.\u201d",
      "It's also better for the people using the yard, Kiers said.",
      "\"So many studies show that spending time in nature and gardening, all of this is really good for you,\u201d Kiers said. \u201cWhen they\u2019re doing that, they\u2019re not talking about mowing the lawn.\u201d",
      "Kiers says the only thing more intimidating than an expanse of lawn is an expanse of unplanted dirt. Her top recommendation: take it slowly. It also mitigates the cost, because she said paying someone to do it all at once can cost tens of thousands of dollars.",

      "Republican leaders in the House and Senate are rejecting Democratic demands for health care subsidies in a bill to avoid a government shutdown",
      "WASHINGTON -- Republican leaders in the House and Senate said Wednesday that they will reject Democratic demands for an immediate extension of health care subsidies, challenging Democrats to vote against a stopgap spending bill that doesn't include them but will keep the government open at the end of the month.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Democrats \u201chave a choice to make\u201d as the Sept. 30 deadline approaches. They can work with Republicans, Thune said, or \u201cthey can shut down the government with all that will mean for the American people.\u201d",
      "Democratic leaders have so far shown no signs of backing off their demands, arguing that it\u2019s Republicans\u2019 responsibility to negotiate with them as they will need at least seven Democratic senators to move the stopgap spending bill forward. It\u2019s a high-stakes game of brinksmanship for the Democrats, in particular, as the party\u2019s base urges them to fight harder and many wager that a shutdown would force Republicans to negotiate with them on health care and other issues.",
      "\u201cDemocrats don\u2019t want a shutdown, but Republicans cannot shut Democrats out of the process and pretend like the last nine months have been business as usual,\u201d Schumer said.",
      "It\u2019s a risky strategy. If the government does shut down on Oct. 1, most federal agencies will close and millions of federal employees deemed non-essential, including many in the military, won\u2019t receive paychecks. And there\u2019s no guarantee that the two parties could find agreement on how to end the standoff.",
      "Democrats on both sides of the Capitol are watching Schumer closely after his last-minute decision in March to vote with Republicans to keep the government open. Schumer argued then that a shutdown would be damaging and would give President Donald Trump and his White House freedom to make more government cuts. Many on the left revolted, with some advocates calling for his resignation.",
      "The vote in the spring caused a temporary schism with House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who opposed the GOP spending bill and said he would not be \u201ccomplicit\u201d with Schumer\u2019s vote.",
      "The two Democratic leaders now say they are united, and Schumer says that things have changed since March. The public is more wary of Trump and Republicans, Schumer says, after the passage this summer of Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d that cut Medicaid and other government programs.",
      "Democrats\u2019 top demand is that Republicans agree to extend health care tax credits that have made health insurance more affordable for millions of people since the COVID-19 pandemic. Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson have indicated that they are open to extending the subsidies, which expire at the end of the year. The subsidies are available to low- and middle-income individuals who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. But many Republicans would like to see changes that most Democrats are likely to oppose.",
      "Unbowed by the Democratic threats, House Republicans are moving forward with the stopgap measure to keep federal agencies funded through Nov. 21, buying lawmakers more time to work out their differences on spending levels. Republicans argue they are providing exactly what Democrats have insisted upon in past government shutdown battles \u2014 a clean funding bill free of partisan policy riders.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re trying to insert unrelated matters into the middle of a clean government extension. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to work,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson said on CNBC Wednesday morning.",

      "\u201cFor more than 20 years under their ownership, Ben & Jerry's stood up and spoke out in support of peace, justice and human rights, not as abstract concepts, but in relation to real events happening in our world,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat independence existed in no small part because of the unique merger agreement Ben and I negotiated with Unilever, one that enshrined our social mission and values in the company's governance structure in perpetuity. It's profoundly disappointing to come to the conclusion that that independence, the very basis of our sale to Unilever, is gone.\u201d",

      "\u201cStanding up for the values of justice, equity, and our shared humanity has never been more important, and yet Ben & Jerry's has been silenced, sidelined for fear of upsetting those in power,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's easy to stand up and speak out when there's nothing at risk. The real test of values is when times are challenging and you have something to lose.\u201d",
      "Greenfield noted that Ben & Jerry's, famous for its colorful ice cream containers with names such as Cherry Garcia and Phish Food, \u201cwas always about more than just ice cream; it was a way to spread love and invite others into the fight for equity, justice and a better world.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Wall Street rose to more records on Monday at the start of a week that could show whether the U.S. stock market\u2019s big recent rally has been overdone or prescient.",
      "The S&P 500 climbed 0.5% and topped its prior all-time high, which was set last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 49 points, or 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.9% to its own record.",
      "Tesla helped lead the way and rose 3.6% after Elon Musk bought stock worth roughly $1 billion  through a trust. The electric vehicle company\u2019s stock price came into the day with a slight loss for the year so far, and the purchase could be a signal of Musk\u2019s faith in it.",
      "Alphabet was the single strongest force lifting the S&P 500 after gaining 4.5%, which brought the total value for Google\u2019s parent company above $3 trillion. Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple are the only other companies on Wall Street worth that much.",
      "The market\u2019s main event for the week will arrive on Wednesday. That\u2019s when the Federal Reserve will announce its latest decision  on interest rates, and the unanimous expectation is for the first cut of the year. Such a move could give a kickstart to the job market, which has been slowing.",
      "Stocks have already run to records on the assumption that a cut is coming on Wednesday, though. Expectations are also high that the Fed will keep lowering rates through the end of this year and into 2026. That creates the possibility for disappointment in the market, which would mean drops for stock prices, if the Fed doesn\u2019t end up slashing rates as aggressively as traders expect.",
      "That\u2019s why more attention will be on what Fed Chair Jerome Powell says in his press conference following the decision than on the decision itself. Fed officials will also release their latest projections for where they see interest rates and the economy heading in upcoming years, which could provide another potential flashpoint.",
      "What\u2019s keeping the Fed on guard is a possible jump in inflation because of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs. That\u2019s because lower interest rates can give inflation more fuel and send it even higher. And inflation has already proven difficult  to get under the Fed\u2019s 2% target.",
      "Another threat for Wall Street is if the job market slows too much. In that case, a recession could create a downturn in corporate profits that\u2019s steep enough to swamp the benefits that lower interest rates bring in the near term.",
      "Trump, meanwhile, has pushed angrily for cuts to interest rates. He\u2019s often attacked Powell personally, nicknaming him \u201cToo Late,\u201d and is trying to remove one of the Fed\u2019s governors  from its board.",
      "\u201c\u2018Too Late\u2019 must cut interest rates now, and bigger than he had in mind,\u201d Trump wrote on his social media network Monday, using his trademark all-caps style.",

      "\u201cWhile a small group of powerful actors pillage and loot the country\u2019s wealth and resources, enriching themselves, the state has effectively abdicated its sovereign responsibilities to its population, outsourcing critical services \u2014 such as the provision of food, health care, and education to international donors,\u201d the report states. \u201cCorruption is killing South Sudanese.\"",

On Thursday, opposition leader Riek Machar was suspended from his post as first vice president after being indicted on charges including murder, terrorism and crimes against humanity, after a local militia that the government says he has links to overran a military garrison near the Ethiopian border. He has been under house arrest since March.",

      "The Getting to Zero Coalition, an alliance of companies, governments and intergovernmental organizations, is asking member states of the International Maritime Organization to support adopting regulations to transition to green shipping, including the fee, when they meet in London next month. The statement was shared exclusively with The Associated Press in advance.",

The forum manages the Getting to Zero Coalition.",
      "The Trump administration unequivocally rejects the proposal before the IMO and has threatened to retaliate if nations support it, setting the stage for a fight over the major climate deal. The U.S. considers the proposed regulatory framework \u201ceffectively a global carbon tax on Americans levied by an unaccountable U.N. organization,\u201d the U.S. Secretaries of State, Commerce, Energy and Transportation said in a joint statement last month.",
      "U.S.-based shipping companies, however, have endorsed it. The Chamber of Shipping of America wants one global system, not multiple regional systems that could double charge vessels for their emissions depending on the route, said Kathy Metcalf, the chamber's president emeritus.",
      "Shipping emissions have grown over the last decade to about 3% of the global total as vessels have gotten bigger, delivering more cargo per trip and using immense amounts of fossil fuels. The IMO, which regulates international shipping, set a target for the sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by about 2050, and has committed to ensuring that fuels with zero or near-zero emissions are used more widely.",
      "In April, IMO member states agreed on the contents of a regulatory framework to impose a minimum fee for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above certain thresholds and set a marine fuel standard to phase in cleaner fuels. The IMO aims for consensus in decision-making but, in this case, had to vote. The United States was notably absent.",
      "Now nations have to decide if the regulations will enter into force in 2027. If agreed upon, the regulations will become mandatory for large oceangoing ships over 5,000 gross tonnage, which emit 85% of the total carbon emissions from international shipping, according to the IMO.",
      "If nations don't agree, shipping\u2019s decarbonization will be further delayed and \u201cthe chance of the sector playing a proper and fair part in the fight to keep global heating below dangerous levels will almost certainly be lost,\u201d said Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition and Ocean Conservancy shipping program director.",

Abbasov said the deal reached in April was not ambitious enough, but this is an opportunity to launch the sector\u2019s decarbonization and it can be strengthened.",
      "Shipping companies want the regulations because it gives them the certainty needed to confidently make investments in cleaner technologies, such as fuels that are alternatives to fossil fuels and the ships that run on them. In addition to the Getting to Zero Coalition, the International Chamber of Shipping, which represents over 80% of the world\u2019s merchant fleet, is advocating for adoption when nations meet at IMO Headquarters in London from Oct. 14 to 17.",

      "Brandon Marsh had a two-run homer and Max Kepler added a solo shot in a six-run sixth for Philadelphia. Ohtani's 50th homer leading off the eighth helped the Dodgers tie the game 6-6.",
      "The Phillies erased a 4-0 deficit against Justin Wrobleski in another stunning collapse by the Dodgers bullpen. Philadelphia rallied for four runs in the seventh and eighth innings and another in the 10th on Monday to clinch its second straight NL East title with a wild 6-5 victory.",
      "After Ohtani's homer, the Dodgers loaded the bases on a double, a walk and a single before Alex Call's sacrifice fly scored Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez with the tying run.",
      "Ohtani struck out five and walked one, throwing 42 of 68 pitches for strikes in his 13th mound start of the season and 99th of his major league career. He retired his final 13 batters.",
      "The Dodger Stadium crowd of 44,063 groaned at the sight of Wrobleski coming out of the bullpen, knowing Ohtani was done. The team has carefully managed Ohtani's workload on the mound in his first season pitching for them after two elbow surgeries.",
      "The groans turned to boos when the left-hander loaded the bases with three consecutive one-out singles before Bryce Harper doubled to center on the first pitch, scoring two runs. Marsh followed with a three-run homer to right and the boos intensified as manager Dave Roberts came to take the ball from Wrobleski with the Phillies leading 5-4. Wrobleski's ERA ballooned to 4.52.",
      "Edgardo Henriquez promptly gave up a solo shot to Kepler for a 6-4 lead.",
      "The bottom half of the Dodgers order jumped on Cristopher S\u00e1nchez in the second, taking a 3-0 lead. With one out, Alex Call hit a 408-foot solo shot, then Andy Pages singled and scored on Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s two-strike, 415-foot homer. Those were just the 11th and 12th homers allowed by S\u00e1nchez in 30 starts.",

Yet the 23-year-old's final start at PNC Park this season was a rare misstep at a place where he has dominated.",
      "The towering right-hander gave up three runs on seven hits with three walks and six strikeouts and was pulled after 3 2/3 innings, the shortest start of his career outside of a brief two-inning stint at Yankee Stadium last fall in an appearance that was mostly ceremonial at the end of his breakout rookie season.",

      "Charlie Kirk's mastery of social media was key to his rise as an influence in conservative politics. So the extent to which his death and its aftermath have played out on those forums shouldn't come as a surprise.",
      "In a microcosm of life today, social media is where Americans have gone to process last week's killing in Utah and is the chief tool his supporters are using to police those they feel aren't offering proper respect. Investigators are probing the time the man accused of killing Kirk, Tyler Robinson, spent in the \u201cdark corners of the internet\u201d \u2014 anti-social media, if you will \u2014 leading up to when he allegedly pulled the trigger.",
      "On the other side of the world, as the Kirk story preoccupied Americans, Nepal reeled from a spasm of violence that erupted when the government tried to ban social media platforms.",
      "All of this is forcing a closer look at the technologies that have changed our lives, how they control what we see and understand through algorithms, and the way all the time we spend on them affects our view of the world.",
      "Utah's governor, Republican Spencer Cox, believes \u201ccancer\u201d isn\u2019t a strong enough word to describe social media. \u201cThe most powerful companies in the history of the world have figured out how to hack our brains, get us addicted to outrage \u2026 and get us to hate each other,\u201d Cox said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, urged Americans via social media to \u201cpull yourself together, read a book, get some exercise, have a whiskey, walk the dog or make some pasta or go fishing or just do anything other than let this algo pickle your brain and ruin your soul.\u201d",
      "Chilling videos of Kirk's Sept. 10 assassination immediately overwhelmed sites like X, TikTok and YouTube, and companies are still working to contain their spread. Confrontational material and conspiracy theories are pushed into social media feeds because they do precisely what they're designed to do \u2014 keep people on the platforms for longer periods of time.",
      "\u201cI do think we\u2019re in a moment here,\u201d said Laura Edelson, a Northeastern University professor and expert on social media algorithms. \u201cOur country is being digitally mediated. Where we interact with other people, how we interact with broader society, that is more and more happening over feed algorithms. This is the most recent in a long line of ways that society has been changed by media technology.\u201d",
      "Divisive content and the proliferation of the video of Kirk's death may not have been the goal but are the direct result of decisions made to maximize profits and cut back on content moderation, Edelson said.",
      "\u201cI don't think there are people twirling their mustaches saying how great it is that we've divided society, except the Russian troll farms and, more and more, the Chinese troll farms,\u201d she said.",
      "X owner Elon Musk posted on his site this past week that while discourse can become negative, \u201cit's still good there is a discussion going.\u201d President Donald Trump, who created his own social platform, was asked about Cox's comments Tuesday before leaving for a trip to the United Kingdom. He said that while social media can create \u201cdeep, dark holes that are cancerous,\u201d it wasn't all bad.",
      "\u201cWell, it\u2019s not a cancer in all respects,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIn some respects, it is great.\u201d",
      "Conservative media star Ben Shapiro, who considered Kirk a friend, admired how Kirk was willing to go to different places and talk to people who disagreed with him, a practice all too rare in the social media era.",
      "\u201cHow social media works is a disaster area, fully a disaster area,\u201d Shapiro said in an interview with Bari Weiss on a Free Press podcast. \u201cThere's no question it's making the world a worse place \u2014 and that's not a call for censorship.\u201d",

That's been the case when many people discuss Kirk's death, although the shooter's motives haven't become clear and there's no evidence his actions are anything other than his own.",
      "The liberal MeidasTouch media company has collected inflammatory social posts by conservatives, particularly those who suggest they're at \u201cwar.\u201d Meanwhile, several conservatives have combed social media for posts they consider negative toward Kirk, in some cases seeking to get people fired. The Libs of TikTok site urged that a Washington state school district be defunded because it refused to lower flags to half staff.",
      "GOP Rep. Randy Fine of Florida asked people to point out negative Kirk posts from anyone who works in government, at a place that receives public funding or is licensed by the government \u2014 a teacher or lawyer, for instance. \u201cThese monsters want a fight?\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cCongratulations, they got one.\u201d",
      "A Washington Post columnist, Karen Attiah, wrote Monday that she was fired for a series of Bluesky posts that expressed little sympathy for Kirk. But she wrote on Substack that \u201cnot performing over-the-top grief for white men who espouse violence was not the same as endorsing violence against them.\u201d A Post spokeswoman declined to comment.",
      "So much of what people use to talk about politics \u2014 algorithmically driven social media sites and cable television \u2014 is designed to pull Americans apart, said James Talarico, a Democratic state lawmaker in Texas who recently announced a bid for the U.S. Senate. \u201cWe've got to find our way back to each other because that's the only way we can continue this American experiment,\u201d he said on MSNBC.",
      "Among the most persistent examples of those divisions are the lies and misinformation about elections that have spread for years through online social channels. They have undermined faith in one of the country's bedrock institutions and contributed to the rage that led Trump supporters to violently storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Whether meaningful change is possible remains an open question. Nepal's unrest illustrated the dangers of government involvement: Social media sites were shut down and users protested, suggesting it had been a way to stop criticism of the government. Police opened fire at one demonstration, killing 19 people.",
      "Persuading social media sites to change their algorithms is also an uphill battle. They live off attention and people spending as much time as possible on them. Unless advertisers flee for fear of being associated with violent posts, there's little incentive for them to change, said Jasmine Enberg, a social media analyst at Emarketer.",

      "Authorities say that social media platforms should not require age verification for all users when a ban on children under 16 having accounts goes into effect in December in Australia",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australian authorities said Tuesday that social media platforms should not demand age verification for all account holders starting from December, when a ban on children under 16 having accounts goes into effect in the country.",
      "The government released guidelines on how platforms such as TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram should apply the world's first ban on children using social media from Dec. 10. It says verifying the ages of all account holders would be unreasonable.",
      "\u201cWe think it would be unreasonable if platforms reverified everyone\u2019s age,\u201d said Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant, who drafted the guidelines. Her use of the word \u201creverified\" suggested the platforms usually already had sufficient data to verify a user was older than 16.",
      "She said the platforms have \u201ctargeting technology\u201d to focus on those under 16.",
      "\"They can target us with deadly precision when it comes to advertising. Certainly they can do this around the age of a child,\u201d she added.",
      "Australia\u2019s Parliament enacted the ban last year, giving the platforms a year to work out its implementation. The platforms face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent children younger than 16 from holding accounts.",
      "Critics of the legislation fear that banning young children from social media will impact the privacy of all users who must establish they are older than 16.",
      "Inman Grant said claims the ban would see every Australian account holder subjected to age verification as a \u201cscare tactic.\u201d",
      "Communications Minister Anika Wells said the government seeks to keep platform users\u2019 data as private as possible.",

      "Wells and Inman Grant will travel to the United States next week to discuss the guidelines with the platforms\u2019 owners.",
      "Inman Grant said the platforms would need to demonstrate to her agency that they were taking \u201creasonable steps\u201d to exclude children younger than 16.",

      "Melbourne\u2019s RMIT University expert on information sciences Lisa Given told Australian Broadcasting Corp. that the government\u2019s approach acknowledges that age verification technologies make errors.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be up to each of the platforms to determine how they\u2019re going to comply and it will be interesting to see if they test the limits of the definition of \u2018reasonable steps,\u2019\u201d Given said.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists in Colombia\u2019s Amazon are capturing and testing endangered pink river dolphins to monitor mercury contamination from illegal gold mining and deforestation",
      "PUERTO NARINO, Colombia -- A flash of pink breaks the muddy surface of the Amazon River as scientists and veterinarians, waist-deep in the warm current, patiently work a mesh net around a pod of river dolphins. They draw it tighter with each pass, and a spray of silver fish glistens under the harsh sun as they leap to escape the net.",
      "When the team hauls a dolphin into a boat, it thrashes as water streams from its pink-speckled sides and the crew quickly ferries it to the sandy riverbank where adrenaline-charged researchers lift it onto a mat. They have 15 minutes \u2014 the limit for how long a dolphin can safely be out of the water \u2014 to complete their work.",
      "Fernando Trujillo, a marine biologist leading the effort, kneels beside the animal\u2019s head, shielding its eye with a small cloth so it can\u2019t see what\u2019s happening. He rests his hand gently on the animal and speaks in low tones.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve never felt the palm of a hand. We try to calm them,\u201d said Trujillo, sporting a pink dolphin bandana. \u201cTaking a dolphin out of the water, it\u2019s a kind of abduction.\u201d",
      "One person counts the dolphin's breaths. Another wets its skin with a sponge while the others conduct multiple medical tests that will help show how much mercury is coursing through the Amazon\u2019s most graceful predators.",
      "Trujillo directs the Omacha Foundation, a conservation group focused on aquatic wildlife and river ecosystems, and leads health evaluations of river dolphins. It's a painstaking operation involving experienced fishermen, veterinarians and locals that takes months of planning and happens a couple of times a year.",
      "\u201cWe take blood and tissue samples to assess mercury,\u00a8 Trujillo told The Associated Press from the Colombian riverside town of Puerto Narino. \u201cBasically, we\u2019re using dolphins as sentinels for the river\u2019s health.\u201d",
      "Mercury contamination comes mainly from illegal gold mining \u2014 a growing industry across the Amazon Basin \u2014 and forest clearing that washes mercury that naturally occurs in soil into waterways.",
      "The miners use mercury to separate gold from sediment, then dump the sludge back into rivers, where it enters fish eaten by people and dolphins. Rising global gold prices have fueled a mining boom, and mercury pollution in remote waterways has increased.",
      "Mercury can damage the brain, kidneys, lungs and immune system and cause mood swings, memory loss and muscle weakness in people, according to the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Pregnant women and young children are most at risk, with prenatal exposure linked to developmental delays and reduced cognitive function.",
      "\u201cThe maximum any living being should have is 1 milligram per kilogram,\u201d Trujillo said. \u201cHere, we\u2019re seeing 20 to 30 times that amount.\u201d",
      "In previous years, his team found 16 to 18 milligrams per kilogram of mercury in dolphins, which can suffer the same neurological damage, organ damage and other problems as humans. In Colombia\u2019s Orinoco River, levels in some dolphins have reached as high as 42, levels scientists say are among the most extreme ever recorded in the species.",
      "Trujillo said it's difficult to prove the toxin is directly killing dolphins. Further studies are underway, he added, noting that \u201cany mammal with a huge amount of mercury will die.\u201d",
      "When Trujillo and his team tested their own blood three years ago, his results showed more than 36 times the safe limit \u2014 36.4 milligrams per kilogram \u2014 a level he attributes to decades working in mercury-affected areas and a diet heavy in fish. With medical assistance, his levels have dropped to about 7 milligrams.",
      "\u201cMercury is an invisible enemy until it builds up to a sufficient amount, then it starts to affect the central nervous system,\u201d Trujillo told AP after his team managed to capture and test four pink dolphins. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing evidence of it in Indigenous communities.\u201d",
      "A series of scientific studies and reports \u2014 including work by the International Pollutants Elimination Network and academic researchers \u2014 have found high mercury exposure among Indigenous peoples across the Amazon, including in Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Suriname and Bolivia. Hair samples showed averages well above WHO's safe threshold of 1 part per million, with one Colombian community registering more than 22 milligrams per kilogram.",

The International Union for Conservation of Nature listed the pink dolphin as endangered in 2018. Trujillo said exact numbers for the Amazon are unknown, but his organization estimates 30,000 to 45,000 across the basin.",
      "Pink river dolphins also face threats from overfishing, accidental entanglement in nets, boat traffic, habitat loss and prolonged drought.",

It banned mercury use in mining in 2018, ratified the Minamata Convention aimed at reducing mercury in the environment and submitted an action plan in 2024. Authorities cite joint operations with Brazil and recent enforcement sweeps, but watchdogs say efforts remain uneven and illegal mining persists across much of the country.",
      "Other Amazon nations say they\u2019re stepping up. Brazil has launched raids and moved to restrict satellite internet used by illegal gold-mining camps that use mercury, aiming to disrupt logistics and supply lines. Peru recently seized a record 4 tons of smuggled mercury. Ecuador, Suriname and Guyana have filed action plans to cut mercury use in small-scale gold mining.",
      "The dolphin testing operation relies on Jos\u00e9 \u201cMariano\u201d Rangel, a charismatic former fisherman from Venezuela. He leads the charge when it\u2019s time to haul the animals \u2014 which can weigh as much as 160 kilograms (about 353 pounds) \u2014 into the small boats. It's a moment that can end with a stinging blow to the jaw as the dolphins thrash to break free.",
      "\u201cThe most difficult part of the captures is enclosing the dolphins,\u201d Rangel said.",
      "A portable ultrasound machine scans lungs, heart and other vital organs for disease. The team checks for respiratory problems, internal injuries and signs of reproduction, photograph the animals' skin and scars, swab blowholes and genital openings for bacterial cultures, and collect tissue for mercury testing. Microchips are implanted so researchers can identify each animal and avoid duplicating tests.",
      "Omacha has recorded antimicrobial resistance \u2014 bacteria that can\u2019t be killed by common medicines \u2014 and respiratory problems. They have also identified possible emerging diseases, such as papilloma virus, that could pose risks to both dolphins and humans.",
      "After a long morning hauling and testing dolphins, the scientists return to a laboratory in Puerto Narino that's covered with posters of dolphins and manatees and the bones and skulls of dolphins and other animals. They test some samples, prepare others to send to larger facilities and end their day repairing nets and refilling kits to do it all again at dawn.",
      "For Trujillo, each capture, scan and blood test is part of a larger fight.",
      "\u201cWe are one step away from being critically endangered and then extinct,\u201d Trujillo said.",

After the Supreme Court ruled the ban constitutional, President Donald Trump suspended it on his first day in office to give the China-based company ByteDance time to find a new buyer.",

He has repeatedly extended the deadline for ByteDance to find a buyer and hinted occasionally that there was a deal in place, but without offering details. The White House started its own TikTok account last month.",
      "Becerra's new approach is part of an effort by Democrats to counter the rightward swing that was seen last year both in red states such as Texas and Florida and blue states such as California, New Jersey and New York, where Trump improved his numbers among Latinos.",
      "The idea is to lock in a key user base by pushing out content early on a platform politicians are still largely experimenting with. The effort comes when the Trump administration is phasing out multilingual services as part of the president's push to make English the official language of the United States.",
      "Candidates running in the 2025 elections in New Jersey and Virginia are already adapting their campaigns to appeal to Hispanics, who may have stayed away from the polls or voted for Trump based on his economic promises. But strategists say that it\u2019s still very much up for debate whether the trend will hold.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s critical to communicate in the language and on the platforms where voters spend their time and get their information,\u201d Becerra said in a statement.",
      "A 2024 Pew Research Center survey concluded that while TikTok has seen significant user growth in a short time, the demographics were different depending on race and ethnicity. Nearly half of Hispanic adults reported using it compared with 39% of Black adults and 28% of white adults.",
      "Becerra\u2019s campaign says it will push out a mix of videos with him speaking directly to the camera, policy explainers and behind-the-scenes clips from the campaign trail. It also plans to collaborate with influencers and publish videos created by supporters. All in Spanish.",

      "Some small-scale farmers in the southern African country of Malawi are using an AI chatbot for advice to help them improve their methods and become more resilient to climate change",
      "MULANJE, Malawi -- Alex Maere survived the destruction of Cyclone Freddy when it tore through southern Malawi in 2023. His farm didn't.",
      "The 59-year-old saw decades of work disappear with the precious soil that the floods stripped from his small-scale farm in the foothills of Mount Mulanje.",
      "He was used to producing a healthy 850 kilograms (1,870 pounds) of corn each season to support his three daughters and two sons. He salvaged just 8 kilograms (17 pounds) from the wreckage of Freddy.",
      "\u201cThis is not a joke,\u201d he said, remembering how his farm in the village of Sazola became a wasteland of sand and rocks.",
      "Freddy jolted Maere into action. He decided he needed to change his age-old tactics if he was to survive.",
      "He is now one of thousands of small-scale farmers in the southern African country using a generative AI chatbot designed by the non-profit Opportunity International for farming advice.",
      "The Malawi government is backing the project, having seen the agriculture-dependent nation hit recently by a series of cyclones and an El Ni\u00f1o-induced drought. Malawi\u2019s food crisis, which is largely down to the struggles of small-scale farmers, is a central issue for its national elections next week.",
      "More than 80% of Malawi's population of 21 million rely on agriculture for their livelihoods and the country has one of the highest poverty rates in the world, according to the World Bank.",
      "The AI chatbot suggested Maere grow potatoes last year alongside his staple corn and cassava to adjust to his changed soil. He followed the instructions to the letter, he said, and cultivated half a soccer field's worth of potatoes and made more than $800 in sales, turning around his and his children's fortunes.",
      "\u201cI managed to pay for their school fees without worries,\u201d he beamed.",
      "Artificial intelligence has the potential to uplift agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa, where an estimated 33-50 million smallholder farms like Maere's produce up to 70-80% of the food supply, according to the U.N.'s International Fund for Agricultural Development. Yet productivity in Africa \u2014 with the world's fast-growing population to feed \u2014 is lagging behind despite vast tracts of arable land.",
      "As AI's use surges across the globe, so it is helping African farmers access new information to identify crop diseases, forecast drought, design fertilizers to boost yields, and even locate an affordable tractor. Private investment in agriculture-related tech in sub-Saharan Africa went from $10 million in 2014 to $600 million in 2022, according to the World Bank.",
      "But not without challenges.",
      "Africa has hundreds of languages for AI tools to learn. Even then, few farmers have smartphones and many can't read. Electricity and internet service are patchy at best in rural areas, and often non-existent.",
      "\u201cOne of the biggest challenges to sustainable AI use in African agriculture is accessibility,\u201d said Daniel Mvalo, a Malawian technology specialist. \u201cMany tools fail to account for language diversity, low literacy and poor digital infrastructure.\u201d",
      "The AI tool in Malawi tries to do that. The app is called Ulangizi, which means advisor in the country's Chichewa language. It is WhatsApp-based and works in Chichewa and English. You can type or speak your question, and it replies with an audio or text response, said Richard Chongo, Opportunity International's country director for Malawi.",

      "\u201cI used to struggle to provide answers to some farming challenges, now I use the app,\" said Napanja.",
      "Farmer support agents like Napanja generally have around 150-200 farmers to help and try to visit them in village groups once a week.

    "story": [
      "As Big Tech\u2019s data centers continue to grow threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are considering bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- With the explosive growth of Big Tech's data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.",
      "Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.",
      "Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.",
      "Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.",
      "That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.",
      "Texas was first, but it won't be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,\u201d said Michael Weber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. \u201cData center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.\u201d",
      "That's because grids can't keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.",
      "Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.",
      "A proposal similar to Texas' has emerged from the nation's biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.",
      "The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs \u2014 likely for the biggest power users \u2014 to meet growing demand.",
      "The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast \u2014 twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data \u2014 and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.",
      "Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.",
      "\u201cData center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,\u201d said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.",
      "Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there's a power outage.",
      "Data center operators, however, say they hadn't anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.",
      "The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.",

      "The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.",
      "PJM's just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.",
      "That's caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.",
      "Many questioned PJM's legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.",
      "\u201cThis is particularly concerning given that states within PJM\u2019s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,\u201d the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.",
      "The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it's too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.",
      "Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won't lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a \u201cbring your own generation\u201d requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.",
      "In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.",
      "Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.",
      "However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.",
      "To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.",
      "It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.",
      "Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.",
      "But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.",
      "\u201cAnd the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?\" Silverman said. \"Or is there a better way to do it?\u201d",

      "Residents of Annob\u00f3n island in Equatorial Guinea have faced severe internet outages since complaining about dynamite explosions by a Moroccan construction company",
      "LAGOS, Nigeria -- When residents of Equatorial Guinea's Annob\u00f3n island wrote to the government in Malabo in July last year complaining about the dynamite explosions by a Moroccan construction company, they didn't expect the swift end to their internet access.",
      "Dozens of the signatories and residents were imprisoned for nearly a year, while internet access to the small island has been cut off since then, according to several residents and rights groups.",
      "Local residents interviewed by The Associated Press left the island in the past months, citing fear for their lives and the difficulty of life without internet.",
      "Banking services have shut down, hospital services for emergencies have been brought to a halt and residents say they rack up phone bills they can't afford because cellphone calls are the only way to communicate.",
      "When governments shut down the internet, they often instruct telecom providers to cut connections to designated locations or access to designated websites, although it's unclear exactly how the shutdown works in Annob\u00f3n.",
      "The internet shutdown remains in effect, residents confirmed alongside activists, at a moment when the Trump administration has considered loosening corruption sanctions on the country\u2019s vice president.",
      "The Moroccan company Somagec, which activists allege is linked to the president, confirmed the outage but denied having a hand in it. The AP could not confirm a link.",
      "\u201cThe current situation is extremely serious and worrying,\u201d one of the signatories who spent 11 months in prison said, speaking anonymously for fear of being targeted by the government.",
      "In addition to the internet shutdown, \"phone calls are heavily monitored, and speaking freely can pose a risk,\u201d said Macus Menejolea Taxijad, a resident who recently began living in exile.",
      "It is only the latest of repressive measures that the country has deployed to crush criticisms, including mass surveillance, according to a 2024 Amnesty International report.",
      "Equatorial Guinea, a former Spanish colony, is run by Africa\u2019s longest-serving president, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, who, at 83, has served as president for more than half his life. His son serves as the vice president and is accused of spending state funds on a lavish lifestyle. He was convicted of money laundering and embezzlement in France and sanctioned by the U.K.",
      "On Friday, the U.N.'s top court declined Equatorial Guinea's request for France to return a Paris-based mansion confiscated as part of a corruption probe, ruling that the African nation has not shown it has a \u201cplausible right to the return of the building.\u201d",
      "Despite the country\u2019s oil and gas wealth, at least 57% of its nearly 2 million people live in poverty, according to the World Bank. Officials, their families and their inner circle, meanwhile, live a life of luxury.",
      "The Equatorial Guinea government did not respond to the AP\u2019s inquiry about the island, its condition and internet access.",
      "Located in the Atlantic Ocean about 315 miles (507 kilometers) from Equatorial Guinea\u2019s coast, Annob\u00f3n is one of the country\u2019s poorest islands and one often at conflict with the central government. With a population of around 5,000 people, the island has been seeking independence from the country for years as it accuses the government of disregarding its residents.",
      "The internet shutdown is the latest in a long history of Malabo\u2019s repressive responses to the island\u2019s political and economic demands, activists say, citing regular arrests and the absence of adequate social amenities like schools and hospitals.",

      "High school and college educators say that student use of artificial intelligence has become so widespread that they need to rethink how to assign and assess students",
      "The book report is now a thing of the past. Take-home tests and essays are becoming obsolete.",
      "High school and college educators around the country say student use of artificial intelligence has become so prevalent that to assign writing outside of the classroom is like asking students to cheat.",
      "\u201cThe cheating is off the charts. It\u2019s the worst I\u2019ve seen in my entire career,\u201d says Casey Cuny, who has taught English for 23 years. Educators are no longer wondering if students will outsource schoolwork to AI chatbots. \u201cAnything you send home, you have to assume is being AI\u2019ed.\u201d",
      "The question now is how schools can adapt, because many of the teaching and assessment tools that have been used for generations are no longer effective. As AI technology rapidly improves and becomes more entwined with daily life, it is transforming how students learn and study, how teachers teach, and it\u2019s creating new confusion over what constitutes academic dishonesty.",
      "\u201cWe have to ask ourselves, what is cheating?\u201d says Cuny, a 2024 recipient of California\u2019s Teacher of the Year award. \u201cBecause I think the lines are getting blurred.\u201d",
      "Cuny\u2019s students at Valencia High School in southern California now do most writing in class. He monitors student laptop screens from his desktop, using software that lets him \u201clock down\u201d their screens or block access to certain sites. He\u2019s also integrating AI into his lessons and teaching students how to use AI as a study aid \u201cto get kids learning with AI instead of cheating with AI.\u201d",
      "In rural Oregon, high school teacher Kelly Gibson has made a similar shift to in-class writing. She is also incorporating more verbal assessments to have students talk through their understanding of assigned reading.",
      "\u201cI used to give a writing prompt and say, \u2018In two weeks I want a five-paragraph essay,\u2019\u201d says Gibson. \u201cThese days, I can\u2019t do that. That\u2019s almost begging teenagers to cheat.\u201d",
      "Take, for example, a once typical high school English assignment: Write an essay that explains the relevance of social class in \u201cThe Great Gatsby.\u201d Many students say their first instinct is now to ask ChatGPT for help \u201cbrainstorming.\u201d Within seconds, ChatGPT yields a list of essay ideas, plus examples and quotes to back them up. The chatbot ends by asking if it can do more: \u201cWould you like help writing any part of the essay? I can help you draft an introduction or outline a paragraph!\u201d",
      "Students say they often turn to AI with good intentions for things like research, editing or help reading difficult texts. But AI offers unprecedented temptation and it\u2019s sometimes hard to know where to draw the line.",
      "College sophomore Lily Brown, a psychology major at an East Coast liberal arts school, relies on ChatGPT to help outline essays because she struggles putting the pieces together herself. ChatGPT also helped her through a freshman philosophy class, where assigned reading \u201cfelt like a different language\u201d until she read AI summaries of the texts.",
      "\u201cSometimes I feel bad using ChatGPT to summarize reading, because I wonder is this cheating? Is helping me form outlines cheating? If I write an essay in my own words and ask how to improve it, or when it starts to edit my essay, is that cheating?\u201d",
      "Her class syllabi say things like: \u201cDon\u2019t use AI to write essays and to form thoughts,\u201d she says, but that leaves a lot of grey area. Students say they often shy away from asking teachers for clarity because admitting to any AI use could flag them as a cheater.",
      "Schools tend to leave AI policies to teachers, which often means that rules vary widely within the same school. Some educators, for example, welcome the use of Grammarly.com, an AI-powered writing assistant, to check grammar. Others forbid it, noting the tool also offers to rewrite sentences.",
      "\u201cWhether you can use AI or not, depends on each classroom. That can get confusing,\u201d says Valencia 11th grader Jolie Lahey, who credits Cuny with teaching her sophomore English class a variety of AI skills like how to upload study guides to ChatGPT and have the chatbot quiz them and then explain problems they got wrong.",
      "But this year, her teachers have strict \u201cNo AI\u201d policies. \u201cIt\u2019s such a helpful tool. And if we\u2019re not allowed to use it that just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Lahey says. \u201cIt feels outdated.\u201d",

The term \u201cAI literacy\u201d has become a buzzword of the back-to-school season, with a focus on how to balance the strengths of AI with its risks and challenges.",

      "The University of California, Berkeley emailed all faculty new AI guidance that instructs them to \u201cinclude a clear statement on their syllabus about course expectations\u201d around AI use. The guidance offered language for three sample syllabus statements \u2014 for courses that require AI, ban AI in and out of class, or allow some AI use.",

      "At Carnegie Mellon University there has been a huge uptick in academic responsibility violations due to AI but often students aren\u2019t aware they\u2019ve done anything wrong, says Rebekah Fitzsimmons, chair of the AI faculty advising committee at the university\u2019s Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy.",
      "For example, one English language learner wrote an assignment in his native language and used DeepL, an AI-powered translation tool, to translate his work to English but didn\u2019t realize the platform also altered his language, which was flagged by an AI detector.",
      "Enforcing academic integrity policies has been complicated by AI, which is hard to detect and even harder to prove, said Fitzsimmons. Faculty are allowed flexibility when they believe a student has unintentionally crossed a line but are now more hesitant to point out violations because they don't want to accuse students unfairly, and students are worried that if they are falsely accused there is no way to prove their innocence.",
      "Over the summer, Fitzsimmons helped draft detailed new guidelines for students and faculty that strive to create more clarity. Faculty have been told that a blanket ban on AI \u201cis not a viable policy\u201d unless instructors make changes to the way they teach and assess students. A lot of faculty are doing away with take-home exams. Some have returned to pen and paper tests in class, she said, and others have moved to \u201cflipped classrooms,\u201d where homework is done in class.",
      "Emily DeJeu, who teaches communication courses at Carnegie Mellon\u2019s business school, has eliminated writing assignments as homework and replaced them with in-class quizzes done on laptops in \u201ca lockdown browser\u201d that blocks students from leaving the quiz screen.",

      "Residents of Santiago de Compostela are struggling with overtourism",
      "SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA, Spain -- While some Barcelona residents sought to repel a tsunami of tourists with plastic water pistols, a neighborhood association in Santiago de Compostela opted for a friendlier approach: a guide to good manners for visitors to their town, the endpoint of the Catholic world's most famous pilgrimage.",
      "Translated into several languages, the group posted it throughout the northwestern Spanish city and distributed it at its ever-growing number of hostels. It reminded tourists to keep noise down, respect traffic rules and use plastic protectors on hiking poles to avoid damaging the narrow cobblestone streets, among other things.",
      "To little avail, it would seem. Large groups still take over the streets singing hymns, bikes ride in the wrong direction and metal pole tips clatter against the ground. Santiago's social media is awash with photos denouncing a lack of decorum.",
      "Tourists' greater offense, though, stems from their sheer numbers; the old town and squares surrounding the cathedral holding the reputed tomb of Saint James the Apostle \u2014 and that was the center of town life for a millennium \u2014 today are almost exclusively the domain of outsiders, whose influx has served to expel residents. This dynamic has left Santiago emerging as the latest global destination where longtime residents have grown embittered by the overtourism transforming their community.",
      "\u201cWe do not have tourism-phobia. We have always lived in harmony with tourism, but when it gets out of hand, when the pressure goes beyond what is reasonable, that is when rejection arises,\u201d said Roberto Almu\u00ed\u00f1a, president of the neighborhood association in the old town that's a UNESCO World Heritage site.",
      "The \u201cCamino de Santiago,\u201d known in English as the Way of St. James, dates back to the 9th century, with pilgrims following its converging trails for up to hundreds of kilometers on paths originating in Portugal and France. The modern popularity it gained with the 2010 film \u201cThe Way\u201d starring Martin Sheen was turbocharged more recently by social media and experience-driven travel after the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Last year, a record half-million people signed up to trek one of the approved routes to the cathedral \u2014 equal to five times the city\u2019s resident population, and marking a 725-fold increase over the last four decades. Added to those masses are ordinary tourists not arriving by trail.",
      "The proliferation of short-term rentals drove annual rent prices up 44% from 2018 to 2023, according to a study commissioned by the city council to the Fundaci\u00f3n Universidade da Coru\u00f1a. That led municipal authorities in May to request the regional government classify the area as a high-pressure zone, like Barcelona or San Sebastian, which would help to limit rent increases.",
      "Already, last November, Santiago's city council enacted a ban on Airbnb-style tourist accommodations in the historic center, arguing at the time in a statement that it was \u201ca necessity arising from its significant growth, which has clear effects on the number of housing units available for residents and on their price.\u201d",
      "Sihara P\u00e9rez, a researcher at the University of Santiago, described finding anywhere to rent in the city as \u201cmission impossible,\u201d while Antonio Jerem\u00edas, 27, told The Associated Press that he's considering moving back in with his mother, because his salary working full-time at a warehouse isn\u2019t enough to make ends meet.",
      "Andrea Dopazo, 32, tried to move out of her parents\u2019 house in a neighborhood located fully 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the city center. But her desire to continue living in the place where she grew up and community ties are strong proved futile, and she had to take something in a town outside Santiago.",
      "\u201cThe only people who have been able to stay in the neighborhoods are those who have been lucky \u2014 or unlucky \u2014 enough to inherit an apartment from their grandparents, uncles or parents,\u201d said Dopazo, who works in human resources.",

      "In the old town, tourists can stay in small hotels in former homes or huge hostels converted from former seminaries, which aren\u2019t subject to the ban. But in the hustle to cash in, some short-term rentals are apparently flouting the restriction, evidenced by tenants collecting keys from lockboxes hung outside buildings.",
      "\u201cSome follow the rules and others don\u2019t, but this is the model that is really limiting residential housing,\u201d said Montse Vilar, from another neighborhood group, Xuntanza.",
      "Santiago\u2019s City Hall told The Associated Press in a statement that it is \u201cdoing everything in its power to enforce the regulations\u201d and that it takes action whenever it detects a case of an illegal apartment housing tourists.",
      "Between 2000 and 2020, the historic center lost about half its permanent population, now reduced to just 3,000 residents who \u201cresist like the Gauls\u201d behind buildings' thick stone facades, Almu\u00ed\u00f1a said. There are no hardware stores or newsstands left, and just one bakery. A couple grocery stores coexist with cafes, ice cream parlors and souvenir shops.",
      "\u201cThe city has emptied out. You only have to take a walk to see that all we've got are closed, abandoned buildings that are falling apart,\u201d Almu\u00ed\u00f1a added.",
      "This year, the number of pilgrims reaching Santiago is on track to set another record. The surge is further souring Santiago's residents on their city's tourism-centric economic model; already half of them rejected it as of 2023, up from just over one-quarter a decade earlier, according to a study conducted by Rede Galabra, a research group focused on cultural studies at the University of Santiago.",
      "Even some of the pilgrims are noting a shift, like Spaniards \u00c1lvaro Casta\u00f1o and Ale Osteso who met on the route four years ago and have returned every year since.",
      "\u201cThe Camino is becoming more and more known, many more people are coming,\u201d Osteso said one recent morning at the end of their trek, among tour groups of pilgrims in bright, color-coordinated outfits and families snapping pictures. \u201cSpirituality seems to have been a little lost at times.\u201d",

      "The police department released a state-mandated report Monday on use of force against protesters that included numbers on bean bags, rubber and foam rounds, and tear gas deployed during days of protests in Los Angeles.",
      "On June 6, police fired 34 rounds at about 100 people. On June 8, police fired 1,040 projectiles at about 6,000 people, including 20 rounds of CS gas, a type of tear gas. Six injuries were reported as a result of those projectiles.",
      "There were 584 police officers responding that day, the department said. Protesters had blocked off a major freeway and set self-driving cars on fire.",
      "The report was concerning to Josh Parker, deputy director of policy at the New York University School of Law Policing Project.",
      "\u201cThe sense that I got from that data is that if that\u2019s how you police a protest, then you\u2019re policing it wrong,\u201d Parker said.",
      "The protests have put the use of these types of munitions by law enforcement under scrutiny. After journalists were shot, a federal judge granted a temporary restraining order that blocked LA police from using rubber projectiles and other munitions against reporters.",
      "A protester who was hit and lost a finger filed a civil rights lawsuit against the city of LA and county sheriff\u2019s department.",
      "California in 2021 restricted the use of less lethal munitions until alternatives to force have been tried to control a crowd. Police cannot aim \u201cindiscriminately\u201d into a crowd or at the head, neck or any other vital organs. They also cannot fire solely for a curfew violation, verbal threats toward officers, or not complying with directions given by law enforcement, such as when they order an unlawful assembly to disperse.",
      "\u201cTo see such a high number of projectiles discharged in a relatively short time period gives me grave concern that the law and those best practices were violated,\u201d Parker said.",
      "A spokesperson for the Los Angeles Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. LAPD was planning a \u201ccomprehensive evaluation of each use-of-force incident,\" said Chief Jim McDonnell in a statement reported June 23 by the Los Angeles Times.",
      "The days of protests in \u201cdangerous, fluid and ultimately violent conditions\" left 52 officers with injuries that required medical treatment, McDonnell said. Officers were justified in their actions to prevent further harm, he said.",

      "Tyler Robinson fired a single fatal shot from the rooftop of a building overlooking the outdoor venue where Kirk was speaking to about 3,000 people on Sept. 10, investigators say. Afterward, prosecutors say he texted with the partner, who he lived with near St. George, Utah, about 240 miles (387 kilometers) southwest of the campus.",

      "Prosecutors allege Robinson used a bolt-action rifle to shoot Kirk in the neck on the campus in Orem, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) south of Salt Lake City. DNA on the trigger of the rifle matched Robinson, according to Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray. The rifle had been Robinson's grandfather's.",

      "Waltz's nomination was sent back to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week after Democrats blocked more than two dozen of Trump's executive branch nominees. His bid will face another committee vote Wednesday before heading to the Senate floor, but it is all but impossible that he would be confirmed by the full chamber before the high-level General Assembly meeting starts on Monday.",
      "\u201cSenate Democrats\u2019 extension of their blockade on President Trump\u2019s nominations is a deterrent to bipartisan committee work and has hurt America\u2019s standing on the world stage,\" Sen. Jim Risch, GOP chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement. \"Republicans are getting the Senate back to work, and I\u2019m confident Mr. Waltz will be in place in the coming weeks.\u201d",

He has denied being removed from the post, instead claiming he was tapped for the U.N. role and stating that the chat met the administration\u2019s cybersecurity standards. The Pentagon inspector general is investigating.",
      "By the time the White House sent the Florida Republican\u2019s paperwork to the Senate for the confirmation process to begin, the U.N. position had been vacant for nearly six months. It is the last one to be filled in Trump\u2019s Cabinet following months of delay, including the withdrawal of the previous nominee, Rep. Elise Stefanik, over concerns about the Republicans' House majority.",
      "It is unclear why Waltz wasn't advanced before Democrats employed the procedural move, given that his nomination moved out of committee last month with bipartisan support.",
      "A Democratic congressional aide said the White House had shown \u201cno urgency\u201d in getting Waltz confirmed before next week's major U.N. gathering. He would have been representing the United States alongside Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who now also serves as national security adviser.",

      "NEW YORK -- For the Boy Scouts of America \u2014 recently renamed Scouting America \u2014 the past 12 years have been arduous. Opening its programs to gay people and later to girls sparked dismay in some quarters. Its 2020 bankruptcy declaration led to prolonged wrangling over compensation for thousands of men claiming they were sexually abused as scouts.",
      "Yet the 115-year-old organization \u2014 though serving far fewer youths than at its peak decades ago \u2014 seems to be stabilizing, with a slight uptick in membership last year. A key factor is the abiding loyalty of major religious denominations that still view scouting\u2019s mission as uniquely in tune with their own.",
      "\u201cI tell parents this is the best time to be involved with Scouting America, and the best time to be involved through a Catholic unit,\u201d said Bill Guglielmi, who chairs the National Catholic Committee on Scouting. \u201cThere is a hunger out there now for finding a values-based organization.\u201d",
      "Guglielmi and others who are engaged in faith-based scouting praise the manner in which time-honored scouting programs \u2014 such as camping and expeditions \u2014 have been blended with newfangled activities such as indoor skydiving and an artificial-intelligence merit badge. But foremost, they value the organization\u2019s continued commitment to communal prayer.",

      "According to Scouting America's latest data, faith-based organizations account for 42% of the nearly 40,000 units operated by chartered organizations. The Catholic Church and its affiliates are No. 1 \u2014 overseeing 3,514 units serving more than 87,100 of the roughly 1 million boys and girls now active in scouting.",

      "One step the organization will not take, Krone said, is abandoning the religious credo at the core of its mission. The famed Scout Oath begins, \u201cOn my honor I will do my best to do my duty to God,\u201d while the Scout Law\u2019s concluding message is: \u201cBe reverent toward God. Be faithful in your religious duties. Respect the belief of others.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are some places today where you\u2019re not encouraged to talk about spiritual growth and what may be going on outside your little bubble,\u201d Krone said. \u201cIn our organization, it\u2019s been core to our principles for years and years and will continue to be core.\u201d",
      "Krone acknowledges that some nonreligious families, while admiring aspects of scouting, might be uncomfortable with the \u201cDuty to God\u201d pledge. He encourages them to try scouting nonetheless.",
      "\u201cYou are all welcome in our organization,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I want people to know when you come to scouting, there\u2019s this concept of reverence and spiritual growth and saying prayers and being thoughtful.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe parent can come and be a volunteer and go through a couple meetings and a couple of campouts and watch what we do, see what effect the way we deal with duty to God and reverence has on the youth of your child\u2019s age, and then make a decision,\u201d Krone said. \u201cDon\u2019t dismiss us out of hand.\u201d",

Leading faith-based sponsors of scout units, including Catholic dioceses and Methodist churches, contributed to a $2.4 billion reorganization plan that took effect in 2023, allowing the Boy Scouts to keep operating while compensating abuse survivors.",
      "The Rev. Mark Carr, a Jesuit priest who serves as national chaplain for Catholic scouting, said concerns about liability and insurance were key factors in dissuading some dioceses from continuing with scouting.",
      "Steven Scheid, director of the United Methodists\u2019 Center for Scouting Ministries, sees some upsides for scouting after its previous difficulties. He cited rigorous child-protection policies that he views as effective in curtailing sex abuse.",
      "\u201cThe lessons we can gain out of the mistakes of the past can make a better, stronger community, a safer one,\u201d he said.",
      "Back in 2013, the United Methodists accounted for almost 350,000 youth members in the Boy Scouts. The figure now is 52,600.",
      "But Scheid, an assistant scoutmaster of a troop founded in 1916 in Springfield, Tennessee, says adults still loyal to scouting \u201care deeply committed. \u2026 They see this as a calling.\u201d",
      "While Christian churches account for the vast majority of Scouting America\u2019s faith-based units, there are more than 3,500 scouts in Muslim-sponsored units and about 1,560 in Jewish-affiliated units.",
      "\u201cMuslims in America are searching for their identity, and there\u2019s nothing more American than scouting,\u201d said Rashid Abdullah, executive director of the executive director of the National Association of Muslim Americans on Scouting. \u201cIt\u2019s aligning perfectly with the values of our faith.\u201d",
      "Abdullah is also a lead organizer of scout units chartered to the Islamic Center of Northern Virginia Trust and the father of three sons who \u2014 like himself \u2014 made Eagle Scout.",
      "Another Eagle Scout of long standing is Ricky Mason, a bankruptcy attorney who helped negotiate the reorganization plan and who next year will become the second Jewish chair of the Scouts\u2019 National Executive Committee. His mother foresightedly told Mason when he was 7 that he would become an Eagle Scout through their synagogue-sponsored troop in Richmond, Virginia.",
      "Amid concerns that antisemitism is increasing, Mason depicts scouting as a way for the U.S. Jewish community to remain connected with American society.",
      "\u201cIn addition to the having fun part, scouting is really about character and leadership development,\u201d Mason said. \u201cThis organization is needed now more than ever.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s call to redraw U.S. House districts before the 2026 elections has led to a wave of political maneuvering among state-level Republicans and Democrats",
      "First came Texas, then California, then Missouri. President Donald Trump\u2019s call to redraw U.S. House districts ahead of the 2026 elections has led to a wave of political maneuvering among state-level Republicans and Democrats that continues to unfold across the country.",
      "Politicians are reshaping congressional voting districts \u2014 a task typically done just once a decade, after each census \u2014 in an effort to give their parties' candidates an edge in next year's elections. The stakes are high because Democrats need to gain just three seats to wrest control of the House from Republicans, who are trying to buck a historical pattern of the president's party losing seats in midterm elections.",
      "The redistricting efforts have triggered protests, petition drives, ad campaigns and lawsuits.",
      "Here's what to know about the redistricting battle.",
      "Missouri became the latest state to take action when the Republican-led Legislature last week brushed aside Democratic objections and passed new U.S. House districts aimed at helping Republicans win seven of the state's eight districts, one more than they currently hold. Republicans are targeting Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver by shifting portions of his Kansas City district into neighboring ones and stretching the remainder into rural Republican areas.",
      "Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe has said he will sign the measure into law soon. Opponents already have begun gathering petition signatures seeking to force a statewide referendum on the new map. They have until Dec. 11 to submit around 110,000 valid signatures, which would put the map on hold until a public vote.",
      "A referendum normally would occur in November 2026 \u2014 too late to use the districts in that same election. But state lawmakers could set an earlier referendum, potentially coinciding with April 7 municipal elections.",
      "The new map already faces several lawsuits. One brought by the NAACP contends no \u201cextraordinary occasion\u201d existed for Kehoe to call lawmakers into session for redistricting. Two others brought by voters contend mid-decade redistricting isn't allowed under the Missouri Constitution.",
      "Californians are seeing a steady stream of TV and mail ads aimed at undecided voters in advance of a Nov. 4 referendum on new U.S. House districts. The proposal, backed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and Democratic state lawmakers, is intended to help Democrats win five additional seats in California to offset Trump\u2019s moves in Texas to try to gain five Republican districts.",
      "In one TV ad from Newsom, a narrator intones: \u201cSave democracy.\u201d Newsom has largely presented the election as a referendum on Trump \u2014 who is widely unpopular in the state outside of his loyal conservative base \u2014 while avoiding technical discussions about reshaping districts. Teachers, nurses and other labor groups have been among the largest donors to Newsom\u2019s committee.",
      "Opponents of the proposal, known as Proposition 50, warn in a rival ad that it represents \u201ca direct attack on democracy\u201d that would undercut the work of an independent commission previously approved by voters. The opposition campaign has received more than $30 million from Republican donor Charles Munger Jr., who also had spent tens of millions to support the original ballot initiative giving redistricting power to the independent commission. Former Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has spoken out against the revised districts.",
      "Staging the statewide election is projected to cost taxpayers roughly $280 million.",

      "Although Democrats and Republicans each benefited from the way districts were drawn in particular states, those advantages essentially canceled each other out. When adding results from all states, the AP\u2019s analysis showed that Democrats nationwide won just a fraction of a seat more than expected last year. Because congressional seats aren\u2019t allotted by fractions, the net result was that each party\u2019s share of House seats corresponded with their share of the votes.",

      "There are two counts of this. One alleges that Robinson removed a rifle he used to shoot Kirk from the scene and hid it. The second alleges that he removed and hid the clothes he wore when he shot Kirk.",
      "There are also two charges on this count. One alleges that Robinson told his roommate to delete text messages they exchanged after the shooting. The other alleges that he told his roommate to stay silent and request a lawyer if police asked questions.",
      "Prosecutors allege that Robinson knew children under age 14 were present at the time of the shooting and may have heard or seen it. This count, too, carries the potential for enhanced penalties because he allegedly targeted Kirk for his political beliefs.",

      "MORENO VALLEY, Calif. -- A wild burro dubbed Cupid is recovering from surgery after being shot with an arrow in what officials say is the latest in a series of a half-dozen attacks since June on donkeys that roam semirural areas of inland Southern California.",
      "The 2-year-old female burro was spotted last Wednesday with a blue arrow protruding from her right shoulder as she wandered with a herd in the foothills of Moreno Valley, about 65 miles (104 km) east of Los Angeles.",
      "Animal services and the Riverside County Sheriff's Department responded and helped bring the wounded animal in for an emergency procedure to remove the arrowhead. The projectile had punctured the burro's right lung, said Chad Cheatham, vice president of DonkeyLand, a nonprofit rescue organization.",
      "\u201cRight now she\u2019s stable and is standing, which is a huge improvement,\" Cheatham said Monday. When Cupid is fully recovered, she will join a group of rescued burros who meander DonkeyLand's 2,000-acre (800-hectare) sanctuary and wildlife preserve.",
      "The rescue group is offering a $24,000 reward, raised from donations, for information leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in at least six bow attacks on burros over the past several months.",
      "The Riverside County Department of Animal Services said Tuesday that the investigation is ongoing, and asked for the public's help in identifying a suspect or suspects.",
      "Wild burros are protected under federal law. They are an iconic symbol of the American Southwest, dating to their days as pack animals for people flocking to California during the Gold Rush.",
      "Cheatham said burros have become an \u201cunofficial mascot\u201d of Moreno Valley, where hundreds of them have rambled freely for at least 75 years. They even help with wildfire abatement by munching on tinder- dry grass in remote and ready-to-burn canyons across Riverside and San Bernardino counties, he said.",
      "\u201cSo they really do provide a benefit to the community. The firefighters love them because, they say, \u2018Man, these guys can go places we can\u2019t go,\u2019 \u201d Cheatham said.",

      "The animals are docile but sometimes they can be a nuisance if they chomp on residents' flowers or block roads when motorists stop to feed them from their cars, he said.",
      "Last year, neighboring San Bernardino County, where wild burros are estimated to number in the thousands, contracted with the nonprofit Peaceful Valley Donkey Rescue to humanely capture the animals and relocate them to sanctuaries.",
      "\u201cWhile the wild burros delight many residents and visitors, they also commonly encounter vehicle traffic and freight trains, resulting in tragedy for burros and humans,\u201d the county said in a statement. \u201cThe burros also seriously injure themselves leading to infection and death when they become entangled in fencing or when their hooves get caught in cemetery flower vases.\u201d",
      "The arrows used in the Moreno Valley attacks were broadheads, a style traditionally used for hunting, said Cheatham. According to DonkeyLand, the first attack occurred the weekend of June 14, when a young burro was found grazing with an arrow in her side not far from where Cupid was discovered. A few days later, a second burro was found shot with a similar style of arrow in the same area.",
      "Since then, at least three other donkeys were shot in the vicinity, including a pair estimated to be two to four months old, the rescue group said.",
      "Healthy donkeys typically live 40 years or more and vary in size from waist-high \u201cminis\u201d that may weigh 300 pounds (135 kilograms) to bulky \u201cmammoths.\u201d",
      "Last year, two men pleaded guilty to federal charges for using high-powered rifles to kill three wild burros in Southern California\u2019s Mojave Desert, about 90 miles (145 km) north of Moreno Valley.",

    "summary": "One of Hollywood's leading actors, Robert Redford starred in such movies as \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" and \"The Way We Were.\"",
    "story": [
      "Academy Award-winning actor and director Robert Redford, one of the biggest movie stars to ever grace the screen and whose startlingly magnetic charisma in such films as \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\" \"The Way We Were\" and \"The Sting\" made him an icon, has died. He was 89.",
      "Cindi Berger, CEO of the publicity firm Rogers & Cowan PMK, confirmed Redford's death to CBS News in a statement. Berger said he died Tuesday at his home in the mountains of Utah surrounded by those he loved. She didn't provide details about the circumstances surrounding his death.",
      "Barbra Streisand, who starred alongside Redford in the 1973 romantic drama \"The Way We Were,\" said the Hollywood legend was \"one of the finest actors ever\" in a tribute on social media.",
      "\"Every day on the set of The Way We Were was exciting, intense and pure joy,\" Streisand said. \"We were such opposites: he was from the world of horses; I was allergic to them! Yet, we kept trying to find out more about each other, just like the characters in the movie.\"",
      "Actor Robin Wright, who worked with Redford on his 2010 film \"The Conspirator,\" praised the actor and director during an interview on \"CBS Mornings Plus\" after news of his death was announced.",
      "\"He was amazing,\" Wright said. \"I mean, what an icon, and his body of work will live on forever. And to be able to be directed by an actor, that was fantastic, and that's such a rarity. And he's an icon that's going to be greatly missed.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters outside the White House before traveling to the U.K., President Trump said, \"I'll tell you, Robert Redford was great. He had a series of years that he was \u2014 there was nobody better.\"",
      "Redford burst into the Hollywood stratosphere in the late 1960s, when he was paired with Paul Newman in the Western \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\" Their charm playing lovable outlaws was undeniable, but it would be Redford's nonchalance about his striking good looks that helped sell his characters \u2014 in comedies, dramas and adventures \u2014 making him one of the leading box office draws of the 1970s and '80s.",
      "Then, as founder of the Sundance Institute, he used his celebrity to help nurture independent films while promoting generations of young filmmakers, as well as environmental and social justice issues. Since 1985, the institute has hosted the internationally famous Sundance Film Festival, which has been the launching pad for innumerable talents, from Quentin Tarantino, John Sayles and Christopher Nolan to the Coen brothers. In 1989, the New York Times called Redford \"a godfather to the American independent film movement.\"",
      "In a joint statement with other Sundance Institute leadership, acting CEO Amanda Kelso said, \"Today is a sad day for the Sundance Institute community. Bob's vision launched a movement that, over four decades later, has inspired generations of artists and redefined cinema in the U.S. and around the world.\"",
      "\"The vibrant storytelling landscape we cherish today, both as artists and audiences, is unimaginable without his passionate drive and principled leadership. Beyond Bob's enormous contributions to culture at large, we will miss his generosity, clarity of purpose, curiosity, rebellious spirit, and his love for the creative process,\" the statement said, in part.",
      "According to Redford, his fame was hardly predictable.",
      "\"I was so much the last choice\" for the role of the Sundance Kid, he told CBS' \"Sunday Morning\" in 2006. \"They tried everything to keep me out of the picture because I wasn't known, compared to Paul [Newman].\"",
      "His performance changed all that. The comedy-drama, directed by George Roy Hill, topped the box office chart for 1969.",
      "Four years later, Redford and Newman teamed up again in Hill's caper \"The Sting,\" which won seven Academy Awards, including best picture. Redford was also nominated for best actor for his performance as a small-time con artist out for revenge against a big-city gambler (played by Robert Shaw).",
      "Redford would star in 16 features between 1969 and 1980, many of them hits that traded on his remarkable screen presence: \"Downhill Racer,\" \"The Hot Rock,\" \"Jeremiah Johnson,\" \"The Candidate,\" \"The Great Gatsby\" with Mia Farrow, \"The Great Waldo Pepper,\" \"Three Days of the Condor\" with Faye Dunaway, \"The Electric Horseman\" with Jane Fonda and \"Brubaker.\" So bright was his star power that he reportedly earned a $2 million paycheck for what was barely a walk-on in the World War II epic \"A Bridge Too Far.\"",
      "But his most surprising film was one which he produced and fought for: the acclaimed 1976 drama \"All the President's Men,\" the story of Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, who uncovered the Watergate scandal.",
      "\"It took four years, and the studio, they said, 'Politics? I don't think so,'\" Redford said in 2006. \"You know, 'Watergate is a dead issue.' And I said, 'It's not. It's a detective story about investigative journalism and about the American trait of hard work, and hard work led to something that spared us the loss of our First Amendment. That, to me, is worth making.'\"",
      "The film was nominated for eight Oscars and won four, including for its screenplay by William Goldman, and for Jason Robards' performance as Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee.",
      "Redford starred in hit after hit, but he told \"Sunday Morning \" in 2018 many of those films he's never watched. Really? \"I don't know. I haven't ever counted 'em, but a lot,\" Redford said. \"'Cause I thought if I look at myself too much, I'm gonna be too aware of myself and that means when I go to do something new, I won't be able to do it without being slightly aware of what I'm doing rather than just being free.\"",
      "He moved on to a job where he wouldn't have to look at himself \u2014 behind the camera, as director of \"Ordinary People.\" Based on the novel by Judith Guest, it tells of an affluent family whose veneer of stability is shattered after one son dies in a boating accident and another attempts suicide. It starred Donald Sutherland, Mary Tyler Moore in a rare dramatic role, Judd Hirsch and Timothy Hutton, who won a best supporting actor Academy Award for his feature film debut. The film also won best picture, and for Redford a best director Oscar.",
      "In the decade following \"Ordinary People,\" he appeared on screen only a few times \u2014 in the baseball tale \"The Natural,\" the Oscar-winning \"Out of Africa\" opposite Meryl Streep, and the romantic comedy \"Legal Eagles.\"",
      "He would also return to the director's chair eight times, with an eclectic mix of stories and genres: \"The Milagro Beanfield War,\" about a land war pitting a Hispanic farmer against real estate interests; \"A River Runs Though It,\" a period drama of family and fly-fishing, with Brad Pitt; \"Quiz Show,\" about TV's quiz show scandal in the 1950s; \"The Horse Whisperer,\" about a horse trainer with a remarkable gift; \"The Legend of Bagger Vance,\" a golf fable with Will Smith and Matt Damon; \"Lions for Lambs,\" a political drama of wartime co-starring Tom Cruise and Streep; \"The Conspirator,\" about the Confederate plot surrounding Lincoln's assassination; and the political thriller \"The Company You Keep.\"",
      "\"One of the lions has passed,\" Streep said in a statement Tuesday. \"Rest in peace my lovely friend.\"",
      "Scarlett Johansson, who said Redford cast her in \"The Horse Whisperer\" when she was just 11 years old, remembered him as someone who was \"patient and warm and kind.\"",
      "\"Every day before each scene, he would take the time to sit with me and walk me through all of the beats that led my character up until that particular point in the story. No matter the reality of the days rush, I always felt he had all the time in the world for our work,\" Johansson said. \"Bob taught me what acting could be, and it was from his generosity and patience that I was inspired to pursue the possibilities of the craft.\"",
      "Redford made perhaps his biggest contribution to movies by founding the Sundance Institute, which developed and fostered the work of young and diverse independent filmmakers outside of mainstream Hollywood. Begun in 1981, Sundance encompassed workshops with writers, directors and actors, and later hosted the internationally recognized film festival.",
      "Asked by Collider in 2019 his reasons for founding the institute, Redford said, \"The goal for me was very simple: to celebrate people who don't get celebrated, who are ignored or undiscovered and who deserve to be discovered.\"",
      "The road to stardom",
      "Charles Robert Redford Jr. was born on Aug. 18, 1936, in Santa Monica, California. Raised in Van Nuys, Redford described his neighborhood as \"lower working class.\" Though he lived in the shadow of Hollywood, he had no interest in a career in the movies.",
      "\"I grew up in kind of a rough neighborhood,\" he said. \"We'd go to matinees, any time there was a love scene on the screen, we'd go, 'Oh boo, you tell 'em lover,' you know, and make fun of the scene. The idea that I would be that guy is just too much for me to take!\"",
      "He attended the University of Colorado in Boulder, where he had an athletic scholarship, but was kicked out after his freshman year for drinking, shortly after the death of his mother, Martha, in 1955.",
      "He ventured to Europe, studying art in France, Italy and Spain, before settling in New York City, where he took art classes at the Pratt Institute while also studying acting at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He described being self-conscious in his early experiences onstage, but soon recognized \"something unfamiliar was clicking inside.\" He performed in school productions of \"The Seagull\" and \"Antigone,\" attracting an agent, and was soon on Broadway in \"Tall Story\" and \"The Highest Tree,\" before starring with Julie Harris in \"Little Moon of Alban,\" in 1960.",
      "He also made guest appearances on TV shows such as \"Maverick,\" \"Playhouse 90,\" \"Perry Mason,\" \"Naked City,\" \"Route 66\" and \"The Twilight Zone.\" He co-starred with Jason Robards in a 1960 TV version of Eugene O'Neill's \"The Iceman Cometh,\" directed by Sidney Lumet.",
      "In 1961 he starred on Broadway in \"Sunday in New York,\" and two years later in the Neil Simon comedy \"Barefoot in the Park,\" directed by Mike Nichols. It was a role he repeated in the 1967 film, opposite Jane Fonda.",
      "\"I held some fantasy out in my head that I would return to art, and I carried that maybe five years into my acting career,\" Redford said, \"and then finally one day just looked at myself in the mirror, and I said, 'Who are we kidding? This is what you do. This is what you do well and like it. Give up the idea that you're going to maintain this career in art.'\"",
      "His film appearances grew following a big screen debut in the 1962 World War II drama \"War Hunt\" (co-starring future director Sydney Pollack).",
      "But Redford wasn't considered a big enough name to co-star with Paul Newman in \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" \u2014 the studio wanted anyone but him, even after the film's director and screenwriter went to bat for him. It wasn't until Newman, 11 years his senior and already a big name, met with Redford and told the studio he wanted Redford to co-star, that he got the part.",
      "It was a generosity that Redford returned some years later, when he went to bat for Newman to co-star in \"The Sting.\"",
      "\"Follow the money\"",
      "While on a press tour for \"The Candidate,\" his 1972 satire about a California lawyer's run for Senate against a popular incumbent, Redford sought out Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward after reading some of the reports he and Carl Bernstein had written on the 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters. The movie star was rebuffed. [Bernstein feared Republican backlash to their reporting if it was found out they were talking with Hollywood.] They finally met up in 1973, along with screenwriter William Goldman, and in 1974 Redford bought the film rights to the pair's yet-to-be-published book, \"All the President's Men,\" for $450,000.",
      "Starring Redford as Woodward and Dustin Hoffman as Bernstein, and directed by Alan J. Pakula, the film captured the intensity of the reporters' hunt for answers as they sought to \"follow the money\" and unravel the Watergate scandal.",
      "Never mind that audiences knew how the story ended (Nixon resigned); the film was a critical and commercial hit, and became an inspiration for generations of young journalists.",
      "Once Redford had gotten the taste of directing with \"Ordinary People,\" his appearances in front of the camera grew fewer: \"Havana,\" \"Sneakers,\" \"Indecent Proposal,\" \"Up Close & Personal,\" \"The Last Castle,\" \"Spy Game,\" and \"An Unfinished Life\" filled out his acting resume for the years between 1990 and 2005. He also narrated the 1992 documentary \"Incident at Oglala,\" about Indigenous activist Leonard Peltier. Redford's companies, Wildwood Enterprises and Sundance Productions, produced at least two dozen feature films.",
      "Meanwhile, much of his energy was devoted to the success of the Sundance Institute and its film festival, held in the mountains of Utah each January.",
      "Welcome to Sundance",
      "In 1978 the Utah Film Commission established the United States Film Festival as a means to draw visitors to the Wasatch Mountains for something other than skiing. The festival was co-created by Sterling Van Wagenen, who was a cousin of Redford's then-wife, Lola Van Wagenen. Advocating to include independent features in the program, Redford agreed to show up at the festival and participate in a panel. Afterwards, he formed the Sundance Institute, to aid filmmakers wishing to make stories that could not find a home among Hollywood studios that were chasing hugely commercial pictures.",
      "In 1985 the U.S. Film & Video Festival was struggling financially, and so Sundance took it over, eventually replacing the name with its own. Moved to Park City, the festival drew ever-increasing numbers of filmmakers, buyers, agents, publicists, journalists and fans to the tiny town. Beyond the festival, industry professionals would mentor young filmmakers in workshops and screenwriting labs. Wes Anderson's \"Bottle Rocket,\" Kimberly Peirce's \"Boys Don't Cry,\" Paul Thomas Anderson's \"Hard Eight,\" and Miranda July's \"Me and You and Everyone We Know\" were all developed in the Sundance Labs.",
      "In 1989 the festival blew up with the success of Stephen Soderbergh's \"sex, lies, and videotape,\" which won the Audience Award and was picked up by Miramax. Its subsequent theatrical release earned the low-budget dramedy a cool $25 million and an Oscar nomination.",
      "Since then, films and filmmakers who have broken out at the festival have included Quentin Tarantino (\"Reservoir Dogs\"), Robert Rodriguez (\"El Mariachi\"), Kevin Smith (\"Clerks\"), Christopher Nolan (\"Memento\"), Todd Solandz (\"Welcome to the Dollhouse\"), Ryan Coogler (\"Fruitvale Station\"), Damien Chazelle (\"Whiplash\"), Jordan Peele (\"Get Out\"), and the audience favorites \"Little Miss Sunshine,\" \"Beasts of the Southern Wild\" and \"The Blair Witch Project.\"",
      "Sundance also started a program to develop theatrical works, which has resulted in such productions as \"The Laramie Project,\" \"Light in the Piazza,\" and \"Angels in America.\"",
      "Not quite retiring",
      "In 2012 Redford was executive producer and narrator of the documentary \"Watershed,\" about the politics surrounding the Colorado River \u2014 the environmental and cultural damage from misuse of a vital natural resource. Asked by ThinkProgress whether his films can make a difference, Redford said, \"I've given up the idea that I can really change anything, and I just do the best I can. It's either that or do nothing, and we know that nothing doesn't work.\"",
      "The following year Redford starred in \"All Is Lost,\" playing a solo sailor facing disaster at sea when his small craft is crippled in an accident. He did much of the stunt work himself, in a \"storm-tossed\" water tank (the spray from fire hoses cost him partial hearing in one ear). He was hailed for his remarkable performance in which he uttered virtually no dialogue.",
      "\"All in all, it was worth it,\" he told the Salt Lake Tribune. \"I'm proud of the work. I felt it was a chance to do something at this point that was different and bold.\"",
      "Redford also added his name to the roster of Hollywood stars recruited for the Marvel Universe, appearing in \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" and \"Avengers: Endgame\" as (spoiler alert) the leader of a plot against S.H.I.E.L.D. He also starred opposite Nick Nolte in \"A Walk in the Woods,\" played Dan Rather in \"Truth,\" and appeared opposite an animated creature in the Disney film \"Pete's Dragon.\" He also reteamed with Jane Fonda in the romance \"Our Souls at Night,\" their fourth film together.",
      "In 2018 he starred in \"The Old Man & the Gun,\" as an aging bank robber on the run. Redford told \"Sunday Morning\" that he connected very easily with the protagonist as an outlaw: \"I think probably I must've been born with an outlaw sensibility, in terms of my nature, yeah. Because from the time I was just a little kid, I was always wanting to go away from the rules. I wanted to \u2014 I didn't want to break any, I just didn't want to be held by them. In kindergarten, I ran away three times!\"",
      "With the film's release he announced he would be retiring from acting \u2014 but he remained active with voice work and producing documentaries.",
      "In addition to his Oscar win for \"Ordinary People,\" Redford was nominated for directing and producing \"Quiz Show,\" and in 2002 he received an honorary Academy Award for his impact on the industry. Three years later he was named a Kennedy Center honoree. At the Washington ceremony, Paul Newman ribbed Redford, referring to his reputation for lateness: \"Backstage they think the only reason he's even in the vicinity was because they told him this whole thing was yesterday.\"",
      "In 2016 Redford received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The citation read: \"His art and activism continue to shape our nation's cultural heritage, inspiring millions to laugh, cry, think, and change.\" At the presentation ceremony, President Barack Obama remarked, \"As an actor, director, producer, and as an advocate, he has not stopped \u2014 and apparently drives so fast that he had breakfast in Napa and dinner in Salt Lake.\"",
      "Redford was married to Lola Van Wagenen in 1958; they divorced in 1995. They had four children: Scott, who died at age 2 months from sudden infant death syndrome; Shauna, an artist; James (Jamie), a filmmaker and environmental activist, who died of cancer in 2020; and Amy, a director.",
      "In 2009, Redford married artist and environmental activist Sibylle Szaggars.",
      "In 2018, the private Redford reflected to \"Sunday Morning\" on a favorite saying by T.S. Eliot: \"'There's only the trying. The rest is not our business.' It's one of my favorite phrases. Because you can't guarantee where the trying is going to get you. So, you can't guarantee the result. The only thing there is in its place is the trying. That's where the action is.\"",

Some of North America's most popular comedians, along with comics from Europe and elsewhere, are featured on the bill, including Dave Chapelle, Kevin Hart and Bill Burr.",
      "The festival will be the latest in a series of sports and cultural events hosted by Saudi Arabia's government that critics say amount to an effort to obscure the country's reputation for rampant human rights abuses.",
      "\"The Saudi government has invested billions into high profile entertainment events like these in a deliberate effort to whitewash the country's human rights record and deflect from the egregious abuses that continue to happen inside of the country,\" Human Rights Watch researcher Joey Shea told CBS News. \"These investments are a part of the broader strategy to... have people thinking about a comedy event, for example, rather than the soaring number of executions that are happening inside of the country.\"",
      "HRW noted specifically the state execution of journalist Turki Al-Jasser, who was killed in June following seven years of detention after reportedly being identified as the author of several anonymous tweets criticizing the Saudi royal family.",
      "Al-Jasser had been convicted of terrorism and high treason on the basis of posts he was accused of authoring, according to UNESCO.",
      "UNESCO's director general Audrey Azoulay condemned his execution, saying: \"A death sentence imposed on journalists constitutes a serious attack on freedom of expression and freedom of the press. Journalists must be able to report without fear for their lives or safety.\"",
      "Reporters Without Borders, an organization that works to protect journalists, branded the charges against Al-Jasser as \"false.\"",
      "\"This execution of a journalist went forward to very little international criticism and this is clearly a result of these billions that had been invested in the country's whitewashing strategy,\" Shea told CBS News.",
      "When asked whether they believed the comedians would be able to freely tell jokes at the festival, the HRW researcher predicted there would be clear red lines drawn by organizers to prevent any criticism of Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman, who has already taken over as ruler of the highly conservative Islamic kingdom, as well as his policies and the broader royal family.",
      "Shea called on the high-profile entertainers attending the event \u2014 funding for which comes from the Saudi government's General Entertainment Authority \u2014   to mitigate the positive effect that their presence might have on the country's reputation for human rights abuses, including by \"speaking out about the abuses.\"",

    "summary": "Now showing at Chicago's Art Institute, an exhibition of works by Gustave Caillebotte offers a fresh perspective on a French painter ripe for rediscovery.",
    "story": [
      "Monet \u2026 Degas \u2026 Renoir. When we think of French Impressionism, it's the usual suspects who spring to mind. But one lesser-known artist is ripe for rediscovery.",
      "\"Gustave Caillebotte is probably the least-known of the Impressionist painters,\" said Gloria Groom, co-curator of a new exhibition of the works of Caillebotte, now on display at the Art Institute of Chicago. \"I think he's still not completely integrated into that story. He's still kind of the outsider.\"",
      "The museum has long been home to the artist's most recognizable painting, \"Paris Street - Rainy Day.\"",
      "\"People, they may not know Gustave Caillebotte's name, but if you say the painting with the umbrellas, they all know it,\" said Groom. \"And so you start thinking, okay, it's all about this bourgeois couple walking down the street. But it's not, because there's a painter with a ladder, the charwoman who's opening her umbrella, all these different types of people.\"",
      "\"Paris Street - Rainy Day\" played a supporting role in the beloved movie \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\". While it was out on loan, museum-goers were bereft. \"We got letters,\" said Groom. \"But you can't be part of an exhibition to be a partner if you don't lend the major work for the exhibition. So, we made that sacrifice. And now we're celebrating its return.\"",
      "The exhibition looks at Caillebotte's work from a new perspective. While his peers were painting ballerinas and landscapes, Caillebotte's canvases focused on men to a degree unusual for the time.",
      "Groom said, \"He's looking at the men in his life, he's looking at the relationships. But he's not just doing, you know, macho masculinity. He's doing men in interiors, men on sofas, men looking out a window, kind of turning the tables in many ways.\"",
      "Some of the paintings scandalized the French art establishment. \"The Floor Scrapers\" was rejected from a prestigious art exhibition.",
      "And, at another exhibition, a painting featuring a nude man was relegated to a small, inaccessible room. \"It's a male nude, but not an Adonis,\" said Groom. \"It's shocking even today. It's a beautiful, beautiful painting, and it's sensuous. Let's face it, it's sensuous!\"",
      "When this exhibition opened in Paris last year with the title \"Painting Men,\" some critics condemned what they considered the show's insinuation of Caillebotte's homosexuality. The artist never married, but shared the last decade or so of his life with a female companion.",
      "But the show moved on to Chicago with a new title \u2013 \"Painting His World\" \u2013 which has others saying the changed title minimizes the artist's focus on the same sex.",
      "Gloria Groom says, quite simply, the paintings speak for themselves: \"The paintings are the paintings, and that's what we're interested in. We try to open it up to all kinds of interpretations, and people will see what they want to see.\"",
      "Gustave Caillebotte died in 1894. He was just 45. All these decades later, people are still seeing what they want to in his beguiling artistry.",

    "summary": "The Federal Reserve is cutting its benchmark interest rate as the U.S. economy faces headwinds, including a faltering labor market.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points \u2014 its first cut since December \u2014 as the U.S. grapples with a stalling labor market and slower economic growth.",
      "The Fed cut reduces the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to between 4% and 4.25%, down from its prior range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The last time the central bank eased borrowing costs was in December 2024, when it also trimmed rates by a quarter of a percentage point.",
      "Federal Reserve officials are also penciling in two more rate cuts in 2025, but only one in 2026, according to the central bank's summary of economic projections. That may disappoint Wall Street, with investors before the meeting projecting a total of five cuts over the rest of the year and 2026.",
      "According to those median\u00a0projections, Fed officials expect the nation's unemployment rate, currently 4.3%, to reach 4.5% by year-end before ticking down to 4.4% in 2026 and 4.3% the following year.",
      "Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) \u2014 the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation \u2014 is forecast to level off at 3% this year, well above the central bank's 2% annual target, before receding to 2.6% next year and 2.1% in 2027. The median projections for core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, forecast PCE of 3.1% this year.",
      "The move comes as the Fed contends with a two-fold economic challenge: curbing inflation, which has flared in recent months, while supporting job growth, which has slumped. The Fed typically seeks to tame inflation by nudging up interest rates to slow economic growth, while cutting rates in periods when the economy is faltering to encourage consumer spending and business investment.",
      "\"In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen,\" Powell said in a press conference following the Fed's two-day meeting.",
      "He added that recent labor data shows that what he termed \"people at the margins,\" which he said include recent college grads, are now having a harder time finding employment.",
      "\"The overall job-finding rate is very, very low, but the layoff rate is also very low,\" Powell noted. \"The concern is that if you start to see layoffs, the people who are laid off, there won't be a lot of hiring going on.\"",
      "In acting to lower interest rates, the Fed is signaling that it views the slowing labor market as a more pressing concern than rising prices, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell underlined at his\u00a0Jackson Hole address\u00a0last month in Wyoming.",
      "\"Concerns for the labor market's health are rising,\" said Cory Stahle, economist in the Indeed Hiring Lab, in a statement after the Fed's decision. \"Unemployment and layoffs are relatively stable at historically low levels, which is encouraging, but they are unlikely to stay that way if labor market conditions deteriorate further.\"",
      "At the same time, Powell said the Fed now views the pass-through of the Trump administration's tariff as being \"smaller and slower\" than central bank officials had expected earlier this year. \"We continue to expect [inflation] to move up, maybe not as much as we would have a few months ago,\" he said.",
      "The rate cut comes amid intense political pressure on the Fed, with President Trump repeatedly accusing Powell of moving too slowly to ease borrowing costs and shore up economic activity.",
      "Mr. Trump is also seeking to put his imprint on the Fed. To that end, he has\u00a0sought to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook from her seat on the central bank's board, alleging that she engaged in mortgage fraud. She has denied committing fraud and challenged Mr. Trump's authority to fire her, with an appeals court ruling Monday that Cook can keep her job.",
      "One vote for a jumbo cut",
      "An economic adviser to Mr. Trump, Stephen Miran, was\u00a0confirmed by the Senate\u00a0on Monday to take an open spot on the Fed's Board of Governors. He will also sit on the 12-member Federal Open Markets Committee, or FOMC, which sets interest rates for the Fed.",
      "\"Stephen Miran was a last-minute addition to the FOMC, but his vote won't drastically alter the outcome. He joined too late to submit an economic projection and path for monetary policy,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a report this week ahead of the Fed's rate cut.",
      "All of the voting FOMC members except one \u2014 Miran \u2014 voted in favor of the quarter-point cut, according to the central bank's statement. Miran voted for a larger cut of 0.50 percentage points, the Fed noted.",
      "A key question for consumers and businesses is whether the Fed trimming borrowing costs for the first time in nearly a year augurs additional cuts in 2025 and heading into 2026. Fed officials have two more meetings this year, set for October and December.",
      "Although the FOMC members were largely united on the size of today's cut, their projections of future cuts show a difference of opinion about the path of monetary policy moving forward. Many of the group's members don't expect the panel to make any more cuts this year, according to the summary of economic projections.",
      "\"That median hides the deep split on the FOMC \u2013\u2013 nine of 19 members don't anticipate further cuts this year,\" Michael Pearce, deputy chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a report.",
      "Powell noted that a quarter-point cut isn't likely to make a huge difference to the economy, but added, \"You have to look at the path\" of future cuts expected later this year and in 2026. \"It starts with a 25 basis point cut \u2014 it's not just one action,\" he said.",

      "Average homeowners insurance costs have risen nearly 70% over the past five years, according\u00a0to data from ICE Mortgage Technology. On average, single-family homeowners with a mortgage now pay $2,370 a year for their property policy. In 2025, homeowners insurance costs rose have risen most sharply in California, where premiums in Los Angeles were up 19.5% compared to a year ago, according to the loan analytics firm.",
      "Soaring homeowners insurance rates are leading some Americans to switch insurers, or do without coverage altogether \u2014 a risky step that can prove financially ruinous and that experts strongly discourage.",
      "\"All things being equal, if you raise prices customers aren't happy,\" J.D. Power managing director Craig Martin told CBS MoneyWatch. \"As premiums increase, it starts to impact how people perceive insurance, and they start to wonder if their insurer cares about them or their profits.\"",
      "Property insurance premiums vary by geography, and are typically higher in places where residents are more vulnerable to disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires that scientists link to climate change, according to insurance experts.",
      "\"The price of insurance is increasing as the level of risk increases,\" said Sean Kevelighan, CEO of the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group that provides information to consumers. \"We are beginning to see some trends of Americans making tougher decisions about their insurance.\"",
      "According to a recent Realtor.com survey of homeowners, nearly 60% of respondents said they might forgo purchasing property coverage if it becomes too expensive.",
      "\"Households are feeling squeezed, and more are considering going without home insurance altogether,\" Realtor.com economic data analyst Hannah Jones told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "What's behind rising premiums?",
      "Several factors have led to the surge in property insurance costs:\u00a0higher home values, mounting climate-related risks, and the higher cost of lumber, steel and other building materials, insurance experts said. In June, the median home sale price in the U.S. hit a record high of nearly $400,000, according to online real estate firm Redfin.",
      "\"We've seen costs related to construction materials rise, and the price of insurance is a reflection of risk, plus the cost to pay a claim,\" Kevelighan said.",
      "\"It's a double whammy,\" Jones added. \"If your home is worth more, it costs more to insure, and also your home is more at risk, so you stand to lose more if you go without insurance.\"",
      "\"We don't recommend going without insurance because it leaves you extremely exposed in case you do suffer property damage, or a complete loss of property,\" she said.",
      "However, homeowners do have alternatives when it comes to choosing an insurer, while there are steps they can take to try to minimize their coverage costs.",
      "\"A few of these things are under people's control,\" NerdWallet homeowners insurance expert Holden Lewis told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you are in a place where there are a lot of wildfires, you can change your landscaping so you don't have flammable materials, for example.\"",
      "A home that's perceived as less vulnerable is less costly to insure, he explained.",
      "\"In storm-vulnerable areas, having storm shutters and tie-downs to keep your roof from blowing off can reduce your premiums,\" he added.",

    "summary": "The IRS adjusts its tax provisions for inflation every year, which can help taxpayers avoid so-called \"bracket creep.\"",
    "story": [
      "Americans could get some financial relief next year when the IRS adjusts its federal income tax brackets for inflation, a change that could help lower taxes for millions of households.",
      "Each fall \u2014 typically in October or November \u2014 the IRS announces inflation adjustments that affects everything from the tax brackets people are subject to based on their income to the size of the standard deduction. Some experts are already projecting those changes by analyzing the same inflation data the tax agency uses as part its annual reset.",
      "Based on that analysis, the IRS is likely to apply an inflation rate of 2.7% in adjusting its brackets and other items, according to Bloomberg Tax. It based its projection on chained Consumer Price Index data for the past 12 months.",
      "Separately, the bottom two tax brackets will see a bigger adjustment next year because of the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law, which applies a more generous inflation bump for those bands. Those brackets will see a roughly 4% increase in their income thresholds next year, Bloomberg Tax calculated.",
      "The IRS tweaks those thresholds to avoid so-called \"bracket creep,\" which can occur if the bands fail to keep up with inflation. Without those annual adjustments, workers who get a cost-of-living pay increase could be pushed into a higher tax bracket even though their standard of living hasn't changed.",
      "\"If they didn't do it year after year, for example with the standard deduction, it would become less and less meaningful each year for taxpayers,\" Amber Gorski, an analyst at Bloomberg Tax and Accounting, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In other words, you'll have to earn more income next year to reach each higher band of taxation. For instance, a single taxpayer who earns $50,000 in 2025 would have a top tax rate of 22%, but in 2026 their highest marginal rate would be 12%, according to Bloomberg's projections.",
      "How the adjustments could impact you",
      "Some Americans could see a tax break due to the higher thresholds for each bracket.",
      "\"Going into 2026, they could use that information to estimate what their tax return potentially is going to be, and what they might owe in taxes,\" Gorski said.",
      "On top of the higher income thresholds for 2026, some seniors and workers could also benefit from changes implemented under the \"big, beautiful\" bill. Those include an extra $6,000 senior deduction and the elimination of some taxes on tipped income and overtime pay for qualifying workers.",
      "The passage of the tax and spending bill in July ensures that next year's tax bracket rates will remain the same. That means the individual tax rates will remain at 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37%, although the thresholds for each band will edge higher because of the inflation adjustments.",
      "Without the new tax law, enacted \u00a0by President Trump in July, the bracket rates would have reverted to their levels before the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Prior to that law, for instance, the highest individual income bracket stood at 39.6%.",
      "The IRS has based its annual inflation adjustments on the so-called\u00a0\"chained Consumer Price Index,\"\u00a0as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Bloomberg notes that some of its projections could vary slightly from the IRS' official announcement, which typically arrives in October.",
      "\"The IRS will issue authoritative guidance, as it usually does, sometime between mid-October and early November,\" an IRS spokesman told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "How tax brackets work",
      "There's a common misconception that your top tax rate is what you pay on the entire amount of your annual income, but that's incorrect. Each bracket represents the percentage you'll pay in taxes on each slice of income within that band.",
      "Take the example of the worker who earns $50,000 per year. In 2026, that taxpayer would pay 10% on the first $12,400 of earned income, and then 12% on any income above $12,401 and up to $50,400.",

    "published": "Wed, 17 Sep 2025 07:53:51 -0400",
    "summary": "With the U.S. economy facing headwinds, the Federal Reserve faces pressure to trim interest rates this week for the first time since December 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve's rate decision today is shaping up to be its most consequential of the year, with most economists predicting the first cut of 2025. The real suspense is over how deep the reduction could be \u2014 and whether the Fed might signal a broader pivot that could set the course for the rest of the year.",
      "So far, the Fed has resisted calls from President Trump to cut its benchmark interest rate, which helps determine borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. Mr. Trump has pointed to the fact that inflation has remained\u00a0relatively muted, so far this year, as evidence the central bank has been too late in lowering borrowing costs.",
      "Apart from Mr. Trump's push for a cut, the Federal Reserve is facing growing economic uncertainty ahead of its Sept. 17 meeting, raising the stakes for a rate decision.",
      "On the one hand, the labor market is showing signs of distress, with hiring slowing to a standstill, which would argue for a cut. But inflation is also creeping higher under the weight of the Trump administration's tariffs, an issue that the Fed has pointed to as its reason for keeping the benchmark rate unchanged so far this year.",
      "Adding to the complications is Mr. Trump's pressure on the Fed to reduce rates. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has responded by stressing the independence of the Federal Reserve, pointing out that the Federal Open Market Committee, its 12-member rate-setting group, relies on economic data to make its policy decisions, rather than political pressure.",
      "\"The committee tries to get a complete picture of the biggest downside risks for the economy, and then at the end of the meeting, there needs to be some sort of weighting \u2014 it's an art as much as science,\" noted Erasmus Kersting, an economics professor at Villanova University.",
      "When will the Fed announce its rate decision?",
      "The Fed will announce its next rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on Sept. 17.",
      "The probability of a 0.25 percentage point cut stands at 96%, according to CME FedWatch, which relies on 30-day Fed Funds futures prices to determine the likelihood. There's only a 4% probability of a jumbo cut of 0.5 percentage points, the tracker says.",
      "Economists will also be listening for whether the Fed provides guidance on whether it expects additional rate cuts at its next two meetings in 2025, set for Oct. 29 and Dec. 10.",
      "What data will determine the Fed's decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve has a so-called dual mandate to keep inflation low while also ensuring full employment.",
      "But those two goals can be in conflict with each other because rising inflation requires the Fed to boost interest rates, which tamps down spending by making it more expensive for businesses and consumers to borrow. The Fed's best weapon for fighting high unemployment, however, is to cut rates, as that makes it cheaper for businesses to expand and hire more workers.",
      "Fed officials will be closely scrutinizing inflation and jobs data as they determine which side of the dual mandate needs more attention.",
      "While the inflation rate has receded from its 2022 peak, it's still far above the Fed's goal for a 2% annual rate, and has inched up in recent months as the Trump administration's tariffs ripple through the economy, pushing some prices higher.",
      "Meanwhile, the labor market is showing signs of distress, with many sectors \u2014 including manufacturing, which Mr. Trump has vowed to revive \u2014 shedding jobs in August. The result is a marked slowdown in hiring, with employers adding an average of 29,000 each month from June through August, versus about 106,000 workers each month in 2024.",
      "\"It's going to be very difficult, but it will be weighing these two conflicting objectives,\" Kersting noted.",
      "How does the Fed compare with other central banks?",
      "Mr. Trump's has criticized the Fed's decision to hold off on cutting this year by pointing to decisions by other central banks, such as the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, to reduce their borrowing costs.",
      "\"Europe has had 10 cuts, we have had ZERO. No inflation, great economy \u2014 We should be at least two to three points lower,\" Mr. Trump wrote on social media in June.",
      "Yet the U.S. is facing an issue that isn't as pressing for other nations: Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "Because the tariffs are import taxes paid by U.S. businesses directly to the federal government, the cost is largely borne by American companies and consumers \u2014 not other nations. The White House has said exporters abroad bear the brunt of tariffs, while Trump administration officials make the case that more balanced trade with U.S. economic partners over the longer term will create jobs, energize the manufacturing sector and generate federal revenue.",
      "Fed Chair Powell has pointed to the tariffs as a reason the Fed has wanted to keep its powder dry, given that many economists believe the import duties will reignite inflation in the U.S.",
      "The Consumer Price Index (CPI), a closed watched inflation gauge, rose at annual rate of 2.9% in August, the sharpest pickup since January. Heavily imported goods, such as coffee, audio equipment and household furniture, saw some of the steepest price hikes last month, CPI data shows.",
      "How are American consumers holding up?",
      "Many Americans are souring on the economy, feeling pressured by higher costs for everything from housing to groceries.",
      "A recent\u00a0CBS News poll\u00a0found that two-thirds of Americans said prices in the past few weeks have continued to rise, and about the same share said they expect that to continue. More than half of consumers said the U.S. economy is getting worse, while only about one-quarter said they believe it's improving.",
      "The CPI has steadily risen since April, when it fell to an annual rate of 2.3%, or just above the Fed's 2% target.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has pointed to mortgage rates that were close to 7% for much of 2025 as a reason for a faltering housing market.",
      "\"Could somebody please inform Jerome 'Too Late' Powell that he is hurting the Housing Industry, very badly? People can't get a Mortgage because of him. There is no Inflation, and every sign is pointing to a major Rate Cut,\" the president wrote\u00a0in an Aug.19 post on social media.",
      "But mortgage rates are determined by several factors beyond the Fed's benchmark rate, including the strength of the U.S. economy and the 10-year Treasury note. Already, rates have declined in recent weeks, dipping to 6.35% for the week of Sept. 11, in anticipation of the Fed's cut and weaker economic data.",
      "Even so, a rate cut could help some consumers by lowering their borrowing costs, experts say.",
      "\"A declining interest rate environment will provide some relief for borrowers,\" Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates said in an email. \"Whether it's a homeowner with a 7% mortgage or a recent graduate hoping to refinance student loans and credit card debt, lower rates can ease the burden on many indebted households by opening opportunities to refinance or consolidate.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 16 Sep 2025 17:19:51 -0400",
    "summary": "Discount retailers like Walmart and Dollar Tree are seeing an influx of more upscale consumers, market research data shows.",
    "story": [
      "Not only low-income shoppers are hunting for deals these days. Better off consumers are also flocking to discount stores to save a few bucks.",
      "Since 2021, budget retailers have seen a large influx of more affluent shoppers, according to data from GlobalData Retail. This year, nearly 28% of high-income people have shopped at discount chains Aldi, Dollar General, Dollar Tree, Five Below, Family Dollar, Lidl, Ollie's, PopShelf or Walmart, up from around 20% four years ago, the research and consulting firm found.",
      "A key catalyst for the shift is one that has plagued Americans up and down the income ladder in recent years, experts told CBS MoneyWatch: inflation.",
      "Emerging from the pandemic, many middle- and even upper-income consumers had extra savings after receiving federal stimulus checks and because they chopped their spending on categories like travel and dining out, said Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData.",
      "But since then, the financial cushion wealthier consumers once enjoyed has shrunk while the cost of living has risen, leading many to seek out more affordable stores.",
      "\"They don't like the fact that more and more of their money is absorbed by essentials and the basics of life,\" Saunders told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So what has happened is they have sought out better value for money, and they've especially done that in grocery and household essentials.\"",
      "GlobalData defines middle-income as households with annual income of $56,501 to $169,750, while high-income households are those earning more $169,751. The market research firm taps a range of data sources \u2014 including consumer surveys, credit card spending and retailer data \u2014 to build a national picture of the retail landscape.",
      "The migration of higher income consumers to discount retailers has \"accelerated since the pandemic, and especially since the bout of inflation that started in 2021,\" added Saunders, noting that a similar trend followed the 2008 financial crisis.",
      "One of the biggest winners of this trend has been Walmart, according to Saunders. More than 17% of Americans earning six figures today shop at the Arkansas-based company, the world's biggest retailer, up from less than 15% in 2021, GlobalData found.",
      "To be sure, wealthier consumers don't face the same financial constraints as low-income people. But high- and middle-income Americans are also looking for ways to beat inflation and stretch their dollar, experts said.",
      "Inflation is well below its 2022 peak, but remains sticky for food and other essentials. Will Auchincloss, an Americas retail sector partner at EY Parthenon, told CBS MoneyWatch that elevated prices for many goods and services are forcing consumers across the income spectrum to \"muscle through.\"",
      "Inflation isn't the only thing driving more people to discount retailers. Better brand selection and a more diverse assortment of products has made budget chains more appealing to a wider audience, Saunders said, noting that retailers like Walmart and Aldi are actively courting more upscale shoppers.",
      "\"One of the things Walmart has been doing is refurbishing a lot of its stores, putting a bit more effort into presentation, because it knows that higher-income consumers expect a nicer experience,\" he said. \"If you provide that, the lower-income consumers like it, too.\"",
      "Walmart remodels around 650 stores nationwide on an annual basis, according to a company spokesperson. The\u00a0upgrades\u00a0typically include updated layouts, newly painted exteriors and interiors, interactive displays, new signage and checkouts, and interactive displays \u2014 reminiscent what you might see in an IKEA store \u2014 that allow customers to touch and feel merchandise.",
      "The company has also expanded its brand selections to include manufacturers like Apple and Dell, as well as fashion brands like Scoop and Free Assembly, a Walmart spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Aldi, which did not respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment, has also tried make its stores more appealing.",
      "\"A lot of their new stores are very bright, they're very clean, they're very shoppable,\" Saunders said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 For a fourth time, President Trump has pushed back enforcing a bipartisan law that would effectively ban\u00a0TikTok over the video-sharing app's failure to cut ties with ByteDance, its China-based parent company.",
      "The president signed an executive order Tuesday extending the pause on enforcing the law until at least Dec. 16.",
      "The move comes on the heels of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's announcement Monday that U.S. and Chinese negotiators had agreed to \"a framework\" to resolve a dispute over TikTok's ownership. Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are planning to speak Friday \"to firm everything up,\" as Mr. Trump put it Tuesday morning.",
      "The law, which was upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration in January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued new orders every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failure to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "Under the law, ByteDance must divest from TikTok or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services.",
      "Members of Congress and national security officials have for years warned that TikTok could serve as a vehicle for China to spy on Americans, collect vast amounts of their data or serve them propaganda. During his first term, Mr. Trump tried unsuccessfully to ban the app, citing the potential security risks.",
      "In his second term, Mr. Trump has praised TikTok for helping him win the support of young voters and dismissed concerns about the app as \"highly overrated.\" The White House recently launched its own TikTok account.",
      "Mr. Trump has said for months that a deal to sell TikTok is on the verge, but the details of an official agreement, which would be subject to approval from the Chinese government, have yet to be made public.",
      "\"We have American buyers,\" Mr. Trump told reporters last month, adding that he had yet to speak with Xi about a sale.",
      "Mr. Trump also teased a deal in late June, telling Fox News in an interview that a group of wealthy individuals had agreed to buy TikTok and he would be sharing more in the coming weeks. Mr. Trump said he thought Xi \"will probably do it.\"",
      "Discussions with China about a potential sale were happening \"at the highest level,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on June 30.",
      "In late July, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview on CNBC that the \"deal is over to them right now,\" referring to China, and warned that TikTok \"is going to go dark\" if it's not approved.",
      "\"We made the decision. We can't have Chinese control and have something on 100 million American phones,\" he said.",
      "Lutnick said China or ByteDance \"can have a little piece\" but \"Americans will have control\" of the algorithm and \"own the technology.\"",
      "TikTok was a topic of conversation during Bessent's trade talks on Monday with Chinese officials in Spain. When asked by reporters later in the day whether China would have a stake in the company, Mr. Trump said, \"We haven't decided that.\"",
      "An apparent deal in April fell through after Mr. Trump announced new tariffs on China. The deal would have spun TikTok's operations in the U.S. into a new company that was owned and operated by a majority of American investors, a source familiar with the plans said at the time.",
      "Sources with knowledge of the negotiations told CBS News this week that the latest deal includes technology company Oracle and private equity firm Silver Lake. (David Ellison, the son of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "The Chinese Embassy in Washington responded on Tuesday morning that China will \"firmly defend its national interests, the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies, and will carry out technology export approvals according to relevant laws and regulations.\"",
      "The statement added that the Chinese government \"also fully respects the will of enterprises and supports them in conducting business negotiations on an equal footing in accordance with market principles.\"",
      "Lawmakers have said that any deal that does not divest TikTok from ByteDance runs afoul of the law, including any arrangement that allows TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. while using ByteDance's algorithm.",
      "During arguments before the Supreme Court, TikTok's lawyer said the app \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" if it was forced to completely cut ties with ByteDance because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. In legal filings, TikTok said the inability to share any data with ByteDance would mean that the app's 170 million American users would not be able to access global content and vice versa.",
      "Trump claims authority to not enforce law",
      "Alan Rozenshtein, a University of Minnesota law professor, said it's not unusual for laws to go unenforced, but it's typically because there are resource constraints or the law is ambiguous. The TikTok law is \"completely unambiguous,\" he said.",
      "\"There's no room to argue that the law doesn't say what it says and there's also no resource constraint,\" he said. \"I don't think that there is a sort of similar instance of this sort of flagrant attempt to let a company violate the law.\"",
      "In letters to tech companies earlier this year, Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote that Mr. Trump \"determined that an abrupt shutdown of the TikTok platform would interfere with the execution of the president's constitutional duties to take care of the national security and foreign affairs of the United States.\"",
      "Bondi said the Justice Department is \"irrevocably relinquishing\" any legal claims against the companies, informing them that they can continue to make TikTok available in their app stores \"without violating the act, and without incurring any legal liability.\"",
      "The letters were made public in early July as part of Freedom of Information Act lawsuits.",
      "\"Whatever your view of prosecutorial discretion, it does not give the president the power to say that something prohibited by statute is actually lawful,\" said Zachary Price, a professor at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco. \"It would at most let you suspend enforcement. In other words, you might be able to never seek penalties under the law, but \u2026 you can't tell them that they're acting lawfully when they're violating the statute.\"",
      "Anupam Chander, a law professor at Georgetown University, called the claims in Bondi's letters an \"excessive assertion of presidential power.\"",
      "But Chander said that by not enforcing the law instead of shutting it down, Mr. Trump may have a better chance at accomplishing what Congress insisted was the law's intent: to force a sale.",
      "\"It's a lot harder to sell a dead horse than a live horse,\" Chander said. \"If you force it to shut down and then hope in six months that you might engineer a sale \u2014 at that point, the value might have diminished so much that there's very little reason, very little economic incentive for ByteDance to sell at all.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's non-enforcement of the law has prompted some pushback from lawmakers, though the intensity has been relatively muted compared to the alarms Congress sounded over the app's potential national security risks.",
      "\"The courts have been really clear on this,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, told reporters in early June. \"I think we ought to enforce the law.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Senate on Monday confirmed economist and Trump adviser Stephen Miran to the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, giving President Trump more influence over the Fed just one day before central bank officials will meet to decide whether to cut interest rates.",
      "Miran was confirmed 48-47 for a term that runs until January, filling a vacancy created last month when Biden appointee Adriana Kugler stepped down before the end of her term. Miran currently chairs the White House's Council of Economic Advisers. In an unusual move, he's said he will take an unpaid leave of absence from that job while serving on the Fed board instead of resigning altogether, citing \"the short duration of the appointment.\"",
      "Miran is arriving at the central bank in time for a crucial Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, during which 12 top Fed officials \u2014 including Miran \u2014 will discuss monetary policy and decide whether to change the Fed's target interest rate. The committee is widely expected to vote for a rate cut, after leaving rates stable so far this year.",
      "Mr. Trump has criticized Fed officials for not cutting interest rates sooner, nicknaming Fed Chair Jerome Powell \"Mr. Too Late\" \u2014 pressuring a central bank that typically operates independently. The president favors a rate cut because it could boost economic growth and slash borrowing costs for American consumers, but the move could risk causing inflation to heat up.",
      "The Senate Banking Committee advanced Miran's nomination in a party-line vote last week, after lawmakers grilled him on whether he would preserve the Fed's independence.",
      "Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the committee's top Democrat, alleged last week Miran's nomination was part of a gambit by Mr. Trump to \"seize personal control of the Fed,\" citing his decision not to fully resign from his White House role.",
      "\"He will have zero credibility with markets, zero credibility with businesses, and zero credibility with the public if he is confirmed to the Board under these circumstances,\" Warren said.",
      "But Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who chairs the committee, lauded Miran, saying he \"brings deep experience, proven leadership and a clear commitment to ensuring that the American economy remains strong and competitive.\"",
      "Miran said in a hearing earlier this month he believes the \"independence of monetary policy is a critical element for [the Fed's] success,\" and \"I intend to preserve that independence.\"",
      "Miran also said he would \"absolutely resign\" from the Council of Economic Advisers if he is confirmed to a longer term on the Fed board after his four-month appointment runs out.",
      "In a written questionnaire for senators, Miran didn't rule out attending meetings for the White House's Council of Economic Advisers and consulting with CEA staff, but \"only in my capacity as a member of the Fed and to the extent appropriate for a member of the Fed in the normal course of business.\" He also said he will not have access to his CEA email while at the Fed.",
      "The Miran nomination is just one move by Mr. Trump that could reshape the central bank.",
      "The president moved to fire Fed board member Lisa Cook last month, accusing her of making false statements on mortgage documents. Cook argued the firing was unlawful, and a judge ruled last week that Cook can remain on the board while a lawsuit plays out. The Trump administration asked an appeals court to halt that ruling before this week's interest rate meeting.",
      "Mr. Trump will also have an opportunity to pick a new Fed chair when Powell's four-year term in the role ends in May. The president has floated firing Powell before then, but the idea is legally untested. Powell's 14-year term on the Fed board does not end until 2028, so he could remain on the board until then while giving up his role as chair. Some prior Fed chiefs have stepped down after their time as chair runs out, but it's unclear if Powell will follow suit.",
      "Two other Fed board members \u2014 Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman \u2014 were confirmed during Mr. Trump's first term. If the president succeeds in firing Cook, and if Powell resigns next year, five of the Fed Board of Governors' seven members would be Trump nominees.",

In several cases, parents describe situations in which they were unable to access children inside the car.",
      "The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) received nine reports on \"inoperable door handles,\" with the most commonly reported issues involving parents' inability to reenter the car after placing their child in the back seat before going on a drive, or to remove their child from the back seat at the end of a drive.",

    "summary": "CBS News looked at the cost of producing coal, gas, nuclear, wind and solar energy to determine which is the cheapest.",
    "story": [
      "The emergence of renewable energy like wind and solar as a viable alternative to oil, gas and other fossil fuels has raised critical questions about which form of power offers the best value today \u2014 a debate made all the more urgent by the ravages of climate change.",
      "In the U.S., where energy policy has been shaped by politics for more than a century, the battle continues to play out at the highest levels of government. Former President Biden delivered one of the biggest endorsements of renewable energy in the form of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which offered tax credits and rebates to businesses, organizations and households that invest in solar, wind and geothermal technologies.",
      "By contrast, President Trump has been a staunch supporter of the oil and gas industry. During his inauguration speech in January, he reaffirmed his commitment to fossil fuel production, saying, \"We will be a rich nation again, and it is that liquid gold under our feet. That will help to do it.\"",
      "Within six months of taking office, Mr. Trump signed the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" into law, which phases out clean energy tax incentives while simultaneously expanding tax breaks for the oil and gas industries. Separately, his administration has pared back offshore wind leasing and made it more difficult for clean energy projects to qualify for federal dollars.",
      "On the global trade front, Mr. Trump has issued a flurry of tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners, which experts say will translate into higher costs for energy projects that rely on imports. The White House is pushing these policies amid concerns over rising U.S. energy prices, with average electricity costs up 5.5% from a year ago, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "To get to the bottom of which form of energy is the cheapest, CBS News analyzed the cost to produce coal, gas, nuclear, wind and solar energy, including the impact of tax incentives, tariffs and other factors.",
      "Determining the cheapest form of energy",
      "Multiple criteria come into play in trying to assess the cheapest form of energy. These include consumers' monthly costs; the cost to produce energy; and the potential social cost energy production can have on a community's health and the environment. External factors like tax incentives and fluctuations in the economy also can affect the price it costs to heat and cool our homes.",
      "CBS News set out to answer the question using what's called the Levelized Cost of Energy, or LCOE, a commonly cited benchmark for wholesale energy costs. LCOE is the price that a power-generating facility must receive for its electricity to cover all its expenses \u2014 including capital, equipment, maintenance and other financing costs \u2014 over the lifespan of a project.",
      "A 2025 LCOE report from investment bank Lazard shows the cost to produce energy without any government subsidies and how that changes when you layer in other factors, such as tax subsidies provided under the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "Yet while LCOE calculations are widely used, they don't offer a full picture when it comes to evaluating the cost and value of energy, experts told CBS News. Other factors, such as interest rates and federal regulations, can also have a major impact on the cost of building and operating energy infrastructure.",
      "LCOE also doesn't account for the value a given form of energy delivers. For example, because solar and wind are affected by the weather, they tend to be less consistent than oil and gas, meaning a backup source of energy may be necessary.",
      "\"You have to talk about, what is the additional cost of balancing that production from a resource that doesn't produce all the time?\" Severin Borenstein, faculty director of the Energy Institute at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business, told CBS News.",
      "How tax subsidies factor in",
      "The U.S. government has a long history of using tax subsidies to encourage energy production. Oil and gas companies have benefited from such support for more than a century. One example is a tax deduction known as Intangible Drilling Costs, or IDCs, which allows companies to deduct certain expenses associated with finding and preparing an oil or gas well.",
      "By comparison, only in recent decades have renewable energy projects drawn a larger share of federal dollars. The push for renewables accelerated in the 1970s, when the U.S. was facing an energy crisis defined by fuel shortages and high prices,\u00a0according\u00a0to Congress.gov.",
      "Lazard's report shows how the LCOE for renewable energy fluctuates when you account for certain provisions of the IRA aimed at lowering the cost of developing clean energy projects. Those include the investment tax credit (ITC), production tax credit (PTC) and energy community bonus, which increases the value of the ITC and PTC by 10% for projects in certain areas.",
      "Lazard's calculations assume these credits will be in place for 10 years. Notably, however, the Republican-backed \"big, beautiful bill\" signed into law by Mr. Trump this summer is slated to phase out those credits over the next two years.",
      "Although Lazard examines how the IRA affects renewable energy prices, it doesn't factor in any government subsidies flowing to the oil and gas industry, which vary widely and can be difficult to assess.",
      "The Environmental and Energy Study Institute, a bipartisan nonprofit research group,\u00a0estimates that direct U.S. subsidies to the fossil fuel industry amount to at least $20 billion per year. However, the FracTracker Alliance, a nonprofit focused on the impact of fossil fuels,\u00a0says the industry receives an estimated $760 billion annually in government subsidies and tax breaks.",
      "More benefits will go to the oil and gas industries under the \"big, beautiful bill.\" A June report from the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the legislation will funnel nearly $18 billion in tax incentives to the oil and gas industry over the next 10 years.",
      "Oil and gas companies have lauded the new law as a win for the industry. Sunil Mathew, chief financial officer of Occidental Petroleum, said during a recent company earnings call that the measure \"will provide significant cash tax benefits to Oxy.\" He expects the law will save Occidental $700 million to $800 million in \"cash taxes\" by the end of next year.",
      "How do tariffs factor into energy production costs?",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs are also projected to alter the cost it takes to fund energy projects in the U.S. To gauge the impact of tariffs on energy costs, CBS News turned to a model created by global data and analytics company Wood Mackenzie.",
      "In the following chart, dark green indicates a scenario in which the U.S. hasn't applied any country-level tariffs, but still maintains levies on copper, steel and aluminum imports; the medium shade of green represents current baseline tariffs imposed by the U.S. since Mr. Trump resumed office in January through August 7; and the light green indicates if trade relations with a U.S. economic partner is likely to worsen or deteriorate.",
      "As depicted, U.S. tariffs are projected to hit battery storage production the hardest. Chris Seiple, vice chairman of the power and renewables group at Wood Mackenzie, noted that while some energy equipment is produced domestically, other tech, such as battery cells, mostly comes from abroad, making them more susceptible to tariffs.",
      "\"The vast majority of our battery cells come from China,\" he said. \"And so the cost of a battery project is going to go up by a certain percentage.\"",
      "This could lead to what Seiple described as a \"whack-a-mole\" effect, in which over time companies move their manufacturing to non-tariffed countries to avoid an additional financial burden.",
      "What is the cheapest form of energy?",
      "Given these multiple and interconnected factors, what ends up being the cheapest form of energy to produce?",
      "According to Lazard, renewables remain the most cost-competitive form of generating and distributing energy. Onshore wind, which runs from $37 to $86 per megawatt-hour ($/MWh), is the most affordable on a baseline level and when tax subsidies are included.",
      "Utility scale solar \u2014 what most people think of when they hear about solar energy \u2014 is the next most cost-effective approach, with costs ranging from $38 to $78 per megawatt-hour.",
      "Fossil fuel and nuclear energy sources are more expensive to generate. Coal costs $71 to $173 per megawatt-hour; gas costs $48 to $109; and U.S. nuclear costs $141 to $220, Lazard found.",
      "The main reasons for these differences in cost? Experts told CBS News that while the capital cost for renewable projects is steep, the expense of operating and maintaining such facilities tends to be lower than that associated with fossil fuel production.",
      "\"Wind and solar you basically do all the investment up front, and then it operates \u2014 not quite for free \u2014 but at extremely low operating costs per kilowatt hour,\" Borenstein said.",
      "With fossil fuels, the cost of oil, gas and coal \u2014 which can be volatile \u2014 is another key factor.",
      "\"For a natural gas-fired power plant, you have to buy the natural gas,\" he explained. \"And likewise, a coal-fired power plant, you have to buy the coal. And so the price\u2026 is going to fluctuate.\"",
      "Experts who spoke with CBS News agreed that renewable energy ends up being the most competitive when it comes to costs. Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a Washington, D.C. consulting firm, concurred that solar and wind are the cheapest to run. Natural gas is the most affordable source of backup energy, which is necessary to make sure power is available around the clock, he said.",
      "Seiple said if you need a small amount of inexpensive electricity, solar is the way to go. It's \"low cost to build, it can be deployed quickly and modularly, the fuel is free and not volatile in price, and the ongoing maintenance costs are minimal,\" he said. \"And if the U.S. didn't penalize it with tariffs, it would be even lower cost.\"",
      "Despite such advantages for renewable energy, experts say the U.S. shouldn't put all of its eggs in one basket. Multiple sources told CBS News that what's needed is a diversity of energy options that can meet the country's\u00a0rising demand for electricity. Taking certain forms of energy out of the mix would compromise the system as a whole, they note.",
      "\"There is no one cheapest form that you can run the whole system on, and in fact, it depends on combining them in ways to [get] the cheapest possible cost,\" Borenstein said.",

      "Technology company Oracle is among a consortium of firms that would enable TikTok to continue operations in the U.S. if a framework deal between the United States and China to take over the social media company is finalized, sources with knowledge of the negotiations tell CBS News.",
      "The precise structure of the final deal was unclear Monday night, but will include multiple companies, the sources said. It's not clear what level of involvement Chinese firms \u2014 including TikTok's current parent company ByteDance \u2014 will have in the deal, and who will control TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm. Presidents Trump and Xi are expected to talk on Friday.",
      "The deal includes a blend of new investors, including Silver Lake, a private equity firm based in California, and existing investors, the sources said.",
      "Mr. Trump on Tuesday morning declined to say which companies are purchasing TikTok, but said they will be announcing that soon.",
      "\"We have a group of very big companies that want to buy it,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And, you know, the kids wanted it so badly. I had parents calling me up. They don't want it for themselves. They want it for their kids. They say, if I don't get it done, they're in big trouble with their kids.\"",
      "Oracle declined to comment. A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment. A spokesperson for Silver Lake didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Chinese Embassy in Washington responded on Tuesday morning that China will \"firmly defend its national interests, the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies, and will carry out technology export approvals according to relevant laws and regulations.\"",
      "The statement continued that the Chinese government \"also fully respects the will of enterprises and supports them in conducting business negotiations on an equal footing in accordance with market principles.\"",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday in Madrid after meetings with Chinese officials on a range of issues, including TikTok, that the commercial terms had been agreed upon.",
      "Oracle \u2014 the tech company co-founded by billionaire Larry Ellison \u2014 has long been seen as a possible buyer if the U.S. government forced a TikTok sale. Mr. Trump has described Ellison as a friend. (Larry Ellison's son, David Ellison, is the chairman & CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison Family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "In 2020, Mr. Trump endorsed a deal that would see Oracle and Walmart taking a 20% stake in a U.S.-based entity called TikTok Global. And in recent years, as TikTok has sought to regain trust with American users and regulators, it has partnered with Oracle to route U.S. TikTok users' activity through the Texas-based company's servers.",
      "Mr. Trump was circumspect about a deal with reporters in the Oval Office on Monday. \"We may let it die, or we may, I don't know, it depends. Up to China. It doesn't matter too much. I'd like to do it for the kids. They like it.\"",
      "Last year, Congress passed and then-President Joe Biden signed a bill that essentially gave TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, an ultimatum: either divest from TikTok or face a ban in the U.S. The Supreme Court upheld the law in a unanimous 9-0 decision. But Mr. Trump has issued a series of orders unilaterally delaying its enforcement. The latest came in June, when he pushed back the deadline for enforcing the measure until this Wednesday.",
      "The president's orders have directed the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against tech companies such asApple and Google for failing to comply with the law by offering the TikTok app on their platforms.",
      "The TikTok divestiture law was passed in 2024 after years of bipartisan concern over possible national security risks posed by the ultra-popular video app. Those include worries that the Chinese government could force ByteDance to divulge information on U.S.-based users or manipulate the platform's algorithm to control what Americans see. TikTok has long denied that the Chinese authorities exert any influence on the platform.",
      "The concerns stretch back to Mr. Trump's first term. The president signed an executive order to ban TikTok in the U.S. in 2020 on national security and data privacy grounds, but the move was blocked by a judge. Four years later, Mr. Trump\u00a0 changed his view and expressed support for the app, which he has credited for his improved performance among younger voters in last year's election.",

    "published": "Mon, 15 Sep 2025 16:10:43 -0400",
    "summary": "Experts say Americans shouldn't expect a further decline in mortgage rates immediately after the Fed's September meeting.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower its benchmark interest rate this week for the first time since December of 2024. A rate cut would give Americans a sliver of relief on a wide range of loans, but would it bring down mortgage rates?",
      "Average rates for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.35%\u00a0this week, its lowest level in nearly a year, as financial markets have preemptively priced in a Fed cut when policymakers meet Sept. 16-17.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages \u2014 popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans \u2014 also fell. The average rate slipped to 5.5% from 5.6% last week. A year ago, it was 5.27%.",
      "With that in mind, experts say homeowners should not expect an immediate drop in mortgage costs should the central bank officially cut its rate on Thursday.",
      "Here's what to know about how monetary policy affects mortgage rates.",
      "What influence does the Fed have on mortgage rates?",
      "The Federal Reserve does not directly impact mortgage rates. Instead, it sets what is known as the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for overnight loans.",
      "\"The Fed is setting short-term interest rates,\" Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Things like the mortgage rates are longer-term interest rates.\"",
      "While Fed rate cuts directly affect short-term interest rates, such as on certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts, they also impact the broader lending environment, experts note.",
      "Adjustable-rate mortgages, for instance, are more sensitive to changes in the federal funds rate because they are tied to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), a short-term market index.",
      "Fixed-rate mortgages, meanwhile, tend to move in the same direction as the bond market, particularly the 10-year Treasury note, because they are both long-term instruments with relatively stable risk,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Brookings Institute, a nonprofit public policy organization.",
      "\"They're maybe not pressed up against one another, but they're sort of moving in the same direction,\" said Krimmel.",
      "The upshot is that conventional mortgage loans have terms of 15 to 30 years (adjustable-rate loans have shorter terms), so investors are more focused on the longer-term economic conditions reflected in Treasury rates than in the Fed's short-term lending horizon.",
      "Yields on the 10-year Treasury note bounced around this year due to concerns over tariffs and what the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would mean for the economy, Stephen Kates, an analyst at personal finance website Bankrate, told CBS MoneyWatch. Lenders use the yield on 10-year Treasurys as a guide to pricing home loans. The yield was at 4% Thursday afternoon.",
      "\"Investor sentiments, how bonds are being bought and sold, expectations of inflation are all going to impact those longer-term rates,\" Kates said.",
      "What impact could a Fed cut have on mortgage rates?",
      "Experts say lenders have already been lowering their rates ahead of a likely rate cut by the Fed. The average rate on both 30-year mortgages and 15-year mortgages have inched down at the same time that several fed governors and Fed Chair Jerome Powell have signaled support for slashing interest rates, Krimmel pointed out.",
      "Kates agreed. \"A lot of the decrease that we've seen in the last four to six weeks has been in anticipation by some of this cut,\" he said.",
      "Banks and other enders often lower their rates in anticipation of a Fed cut. In September 2024, for example, mortgage rates declined to a two-year low ahead of what turned out to be an unusually large 0.50 percentage point reduction by Fed officials. This is why the rate offers you see now, at the start of the month, may not look much different from those you see later in September, once the cut is official.",
      "Fed interest rate policy is just one of the factors that can affect the cost of home loans, note experts. A range of other factors can also play a role, including the rate of inflation, job growth, consumer spending and housing demand, as well as global events and other government policies.",
      "Because financial markets are forward-looking, any statements made by Powell on the direction of monetary policy could have more of an impact on the housing market than a rate cut itself, according to Krimmel.",
      "\"That might be where there is actually some action with the bond markets or with mortgage rates, because he might give some hints about where the Fed is headed in the future,\" he said.",

      "Tesla said in a regulatory filing that it will hand Musk shares worth as much as 12% of the company in a dozen separate packages if the company meets certain performance targets, including massive increases in car production, share price and operating profit. If approved by shareholders, the new pay package could make Musk the world's first trillion dollar executive, and would mark a new level of outsized pay in a country already known for extreme compensation. But the payoff is in shares, not cash, and the goals are extreme as well.",

    "summary": "President Trump says getting rid of a quarterly reporting requirement for public companies would lower costs and help businesses.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump says he wants to ditch a staple of U.S. financial markets: quarterly earnings reports.",
      "If Mr. Trump's push is successful, the change would eliminate a requirement that's been in place for 55 years, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, mandating quarterly reports\u00a0since 1970.",
      "Instead, the president said he wants to replace quarterly reporting with a new SEC rule requiring that companies disclose their financial data every six months. Providing companies with a longer ramp for issuing their reports would \"save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday in his social media post.",
      "\"Did you ever hear the statement that, 'China has a 50 to 100 year view on management of a company, whereas we run our companies on a quarterly basis???' Not good!!!\" he added.",
      "The idea is far from new, with academic and business experts suggesting such a change in years past, for similar reasons as those cited by Mr. Trump. During his first term, Mr. Trump had asked the SEC to examine the three- versus six-month reporting requirement, although no change was made.",
      "But Mr. Trump's renewed push could make such a corporate overhaul more likely today, TD Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg said in a Monday research report.",
      "\"We start with a 60% probability that the SEC switches to semi-annual from quarterly reporting, though the fact that this is an easy win for [SEC Chairman Paul] Atkins to deliver to Trump causes our bias to be that the prospects for action are more likely to rise than to fall,\" Seiberg noted.",
      "Here's what to know about the idea.",
      "Why is Mr. Trump proposing this now?",
      "There are some new pushes from the corporate sector.",
      "The Long Term Stock Exchange \u2014 a national securities exchange \u2014 said last week that it plans to petition the SEC to do away with the quarterly requirement. The San Francisco-based exchange lists companies focused on long-term goals, with its founder Eric Ries criticizing the financial markets for pushing businesses to prioritize short-term wins.",
      "The proposed change also aligns with the Trump administration's goal to ease regulatory burdens on companies, which it has said would help unlock economic growth by reducing businesses' costs.",
      "What's the benefit?",
      "Supporters of the change say quarterly reporting is too costly and time-consuming and discourages companies from wanting to go public. They also say company executives focus too much on hitting quarterly earnings targets and not enough on long-term planning.",
      "Is there a downside?",
      "Those who favor quarterly earnings say the reports provide investors with valuable financial updates and make them aware of any new risks the company is facing. Six-month reviews would deprive investors of those important insights, they argue.",
      "\"This might be great for long-term company builders, but terrible for public market investors who need timely data,\" noted one executive, Sam Kampner, the founder of analysis firm SalesCraft AI, on social media on Monday. \"[H]aving less information means you'd be making less-informed investment decisions.\"",
      "What does the data show?",
      "A 2018 study published in the Harvard Business Review looked at a similar change in the U.K., which stopped requiring quarterly reporting in 2014. The results were \"nuanced and falls somewhere between the two extreme narratives,\" Shivaram Rajgopal, a professor at Columbia Business School, wrote in the Harvard report.",
      "\"Moving away from quarterly reporting did not end corporate short-termism and earnings management, but nor did it destroy all transparency, leaving investors in the dark,\" he added.",
      "What's the timeframe for making a change?",
      "At least half a year, with TD Cowen's Seiberg noting that he believes it will take the SEC six months to create a proposal based on economic data.",

      "The ruling was issued last week, but it first came to light in court papers filed by Khalil's lawyers on Wednesday as part of his lawsuit against the government. A green card holder, Khalil alleges the Trump administration detained him for months and sought to deport him as part of a wider policy of punishing foreign students for protesting Israel's conduct in its war against Hamas. The Trump administration has accused him of \"hateful behavior and rhetoric.\"",
      "On Friday, Louisiana-based immigration Judge Jamee Comans denied Khalil's motion for a waiver preventing his removal from the U.S. because he allegedly misrepresented his background on his green card paperwork. Comans once again ordered him to be deported to either Algeria, where Khalil is a citizen, or Syria, where he was born.",
      "Khalil now has 30 days to appeal Comans' ruling to a Justice Department body called the Board of Immigration Appeals, and if his appeal is rejected, he will lose his green card status and be ordered to leave the country, his lawyers said in a letter Wednesday to U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz.",
      "Lawyers for Khalil told Farbiarz they plan on amending his lawsuit against the administration in light of \"these latest, highly unusual developments.\" In a statement Wednesday, Khalil's legal team argued the immigration judge \"rushed to a decision without providing a hearing on the evidence as due process requires, engaging in multiple procedural irregularities.\"",
      "\"It is no surprise that the Trump administration continues to retaliate against me for my exercise of free speech,\" Khalil said in the statement. \"Their latest attempt, through a kangaroo immigration court, exposes their true colors once again.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment.",
      "The legal fight between Khalil and the federal government stretches back to March, when he was first detained by immigration agents in New York. Khalil is one of several international students who were detained due to their links to pro-Palestinian campus activism, which the Trump administration alleges is riddled with antisemitism \u2014 a charge the protesters deny.",
      "Initially, the Trump administration argued Khalil could be deported under a federal law allowing noncitizens to be removed if the Secretary of State determines that their presence poses \"adverse foreign policy consequences.\"",
      "In June, Farbiarz blocked the government from deporting Khalil on foreign policy grounds, finding his \"career and reputation are being damaged and his speech is being chilled.\" A month later, Khalil was released from immigration detention in Louisiana.",
      "But his immigration case continued under a separate allegation leveled by the Trump administration. In addition to the foreign policy claims, the government had accused Khalil of leaving out details about his past associations on his immigration paperwork, including membership in a United Nations agency that works with Palestinians and his \"continuing employment\" at the British Embassy in Lebanon.",
      "In last week's ruling, Comans found that Khalil was not legally entitled to a waiver of deportation on those allegations. The immigration judge also said that Khalil shouldn't get discretion from the court because of the \"gravity of his conduct.\" She called Khalil an intelligent, ivy-league educated individual\" who should've known disclosure was required.",
      "\"This Court finds that Respondent's lack of candor on his [immigration forms] was not an oversight by an uninformed, uneducated applicant,\" the judge wrote. \"Rather, this Court finds that Respondent willfully misrepresented material fact(s) for the sole purpose of circumventing the immigration process and reducing the likelihood his application would be denied.\"",
      "Khalil has denied making misrepresentations, saying he was not a member of the U.N. agency, but was instead an unpaid intern through Columbia.

    "summary": "The findings of the report \"confirm unequivocally\" greenhouse gas emissions are changing the climate, as EPA administrator tries to stop agency from regulating those emissions.",
    "story": [
      "One of the United States' leading scientific groups published its strongest rebuke of the Trump administration's dismissal of the dangers of climate change, saying the evidence is \"beyond scientific dispute.\"",
      "The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine published a new report Wednesday that says long-term observations \"confirm unequivocally that greenhouse gas emissions are warming Earth's surface and changing Earth's climate.\"",
      "The report stands in opposition to the Trump administration's decision in July to begin the process of revoking a key scientific finding published by the EPA in 2009 that six greenhouse gases are a threat to public health and must be regulated under the Clean Air Act.",
      "Known as the \"endangerment finding,\" it has been used by the EPA to regulate sources of climate change-causing pollution from cars, power plants and other sources of transportation like planes, as well as oil and gas operations.",
      "EPA administrator Lee Zeldin has sought to justify the repeal of the endangerment finding by arguing that it is too costly to regulate greenhouse gases and that the agency may not even have the authority to regulate them. He has also cited a 2025 Energy Department study that found greenhouse gases \"appear to be less damaging economically than commonly believed.\"",
      "But the National Academies concluded that the 2009 finding was accurate and is bolstered by stronger evidence that has since been supported by additional scientific research.",
      "\"Much of the understanding of climate change that was uncertain or tentative in 2009 is now resolved and new threats have been identified. These new threats and the areas of remaining uncertainty are under intensive investigation by the scientific community,\" the National Academies report said. \"The United States faces a future in which climate-induced harm continues to worsen and today's extremes become tomorrow's norms.\"",
      "In addition to the National Academies, which are nonprofit institutions that provide independent analysis to help inform policy decisions related to science, several members of Congress have also criticized the EPA for revoking the 2009 endangerment finding.",
      "Democratic Sen. Edward Markley of Massachusetts, along with every member of the Massachusetts congressional delegation, sent a letter to Zeldin, writing, \"Repealing the Endangerment Finding would go against Supreme Court precedent and congressional intent to regulate greenhouse gas emissions while stripping the EPA of its mandate, giving polluters a free pass to harm American families.\"",
      "The EPA invited public comments on its proposal to revoke the finding, which is why the National Academies assembled its 135-page report. As of Sept. 15, the deadline to submit, there were more than 102,758 comments received. The EPA will now review comments before issuing its final decision on the fate of the finding.",

    "summary": "House Republicans advanced their own plan earlier Wednesday, moving one step closer to funding the government without provisions sought by Democrats.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democrats released a counteroffer Wednesday night to fund the government and avert a possible shutdown next month. But Republicans are forging ahead with their plan, advancing the legislation in a key House vote earlier in the evening.",
      "House GOP leaders on Tuesday announced a plan to keep the government funded until Nov. 21, unveiling legislation that also includes funds for additional security to lawmakers and other officials in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination. But Democrats have pushed back on the plan, arguing that Republicans must come to the negotiating table, while advocating for the extension of health insurance subsidies as necessary for their support.",
      "The Democratic plan, released by Sen. Patty Murray of Washington and Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the top Democrats on the Senate and House appropriations committees, would keep the government funded until Oct. 31.",
      "Absent any action from Congress, a government shutdown will begin on Oct. 1.",
      "The Democrats' plan would\u00a0permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. The subsidies were originally passed in 2021 during the pandemic and extended in 2022 for another three years.",
      "The Democratic counteroffer would also roll back cuts to Medicaid that were part of President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" passed earlier this year, and it includes more than $320 million in funds for security for lawmakers, the executive branch and the Supreme Court. It would also restore funding for public radio and TV stations that was cut earlier this year in a rescissions package.",
      "\"We invite Republican leadership to finally join Democratic leadership at the negotiating table, which they have refused for weeks to do, to prevent a shutdown and begin bipartisan negotiations to keep the government funded,\" Murray and DeLauro said in a statement.",
      "\"We'll sit down and negotiate, if they will sit down and negotiate. We don't have a red line,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, told reporters Wednesday night.",
      "Republican leaders in Congress have rejected the idea of including the health insurance tax credit extension in the continuing resolution to keep the government funded. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, on Tuesday called it \"a December policy issue, not a September funding issue.\"",
      "House Republicans moved one step closer to funding the government on Wednesday. In a key procedural vote, the House voted along party lines on the rule governing debate, teeing up a final vote on the legislation in the coming days.",
      "Still, with a narrow majority in the House, Republicans need near-unanimous approval from the GOP conference. A handful of Republicans have already pledged to oppose the measure, though none voted \"no\" on advancing it Wednesday.",
      "The developments come as Democrats are in a difficult position. While many have made clear they don't want a shutdown, they're facing increased pressure from their base to fight back against the Trump administration's policies. During the last funding fight, Schumer faced intense scrutiny from his own party for his decision to allow Republicans to advance their measure to keep the government funded, reversing course at the eleventh hour.",
      "In the Senate, Republicans won't be able to approve a measure to fund the government on their own. With a 53-seat majority, they'll need the support of at least seven Democrats due to a 60-vote threshold to advance most legislation in the upper chamber. Should the House approve the bill, it could fall short in the Senate, forcing lawmakers back to the drawing board. But with lawmakers scheduled to be on recess next week for Rosh Hashanah, time is running out to agree on a measure to keep the government funded before Oct. 1.",

      "On the same day that Tyler Robinson was formally charged with the murder of Charlie Kirk, a suspect was taken into custody for allegedly making a threat of terrorism against Utah Valley University, where Kirk was killed, according to local authorities.",
      "\"There were clear and specific threats of violence and Utah Valley University was specifically mentioned,\" said Sergeant Skyler Talbot, public information officer for the Summit County Sheriff's Office of the video. The arrest took place on Tuesday in Summit County, northeast of Utah County, where the university is located.",
      "This news comes as UVU students somberly return to campus for classes on Wednesday, a week after Kirk's death. The campus was a scene of collective mourning. Students quietly gathered around the fenced-off courtyard, where Kirk was killed. Nearby was a memorial where students and faculty laid down flowers and spoke of how safe they had felt at the university.",
      "On Tuesday, the FBI alerted the Summit County Sheriff's Office of a 70-second video posted online Monday night in which a person named Blake Francis Rogers allegedly made threats against Utah Valley University, according to a probable cause affidavit.",
      "Rogers, 20, allegedly told investigators it was a \"joke.\"",
      "According to the affidavit, Rogers said in the video: \"I am now beginning my odyssey to Utah Valley University, to fulfill my lifelong duty, of finally killing woke. If you are receiving this video, it means that I did not make it back on this trip, and I was defeated by my mortal enemy, the woke mind virus at Utah Valley University, where Charlie Kirk was assassinated.\"",
      "\"I hope by seeing this video, you all can understand what made me perform such actions, and can view me as the hero that I know I am. I would like to request a gold statue be erected in place of Mario the Dragon, on the crossing of Market and I think 31st Street, in Philadelphia Pennsylvania. Thank you all,\" Rogers continued.",
      "Rogers attends school in Pennsylvania but had recently traveled to Utah, according to Talbot. He was staying with family in Park City.",
      "The affidavit says investigators discovered the residence where Rogers was staying and interviewed him.",
      "When detectives asked Rogers about the video, he allegedly admitted to making it and said it was \"posted as a joke on an unlisted YouTube video and sent to 12-15 people,\" according to the affidavit. It further notes that Rogers \"admitted to leaning to the left but did not claim any particular party,\" and said he used the word \"woke\" as \"a vague idea.\"",
      "Several agencies were under alert for a possible violent attack at the UVU campus, according to the affidavit, which found probable cause to charge Rogers with making a threat of terrorism, causing an emergency agency to act.",
      "\"Blake posted a threat involving bodily injury, death, or substantial property damage and he caused an official or volunteer agency organized to deal with emergencies to take action due to the actor's conduct posing a serious and substantial risk to the general public,\" it said.",
      "A magistrate judge ruled he can post $1,000 bail, according to court papers. Rogers has no prior violent offenses, according to the Public Safety Assessment Report.",
      "\"We do at this time believe that this was an isolated incident. There's no indication that there were any other individuals involved,\" said Talbot.",
      "\"We don't believe any significant steps were taken toward carrying out the threats,\" he added.",
      "Formal charges have not been filed yet. The Summit County Attorney's Office declined to comment."

    "summary": "Hegseth and each service secretary said posts mocking or celebrating the assassination of Charlie Kirk are unacceptable.",
    "story": [
      "The Pentagon has been looking through dozens of social media posts that appear to come from U.S. service members in the wake of conservative political activist Charlie Kirk's assassination, brought to the military's attention through various means. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has publicly warned against any commentary mocking or praising his killing.",
      "In a post on X, he said of anti-Kirk posts, \"We are tracking all these very closely \u2014 and will address, immediately. Completely unacceptable.\"",
      "Already, at least one Marine officer has been pulled from recruiting duties pending an investigation into his post, and five Army officers and an Army reserve officer have been suspended while their social media posts are under review, service officials said.",
      "It's unclear how many service members across the military branches are being investigated over remarks related to Kirk. Some service members have been targeted online for even quoting statements Kirk made in the past.",
      "Current and former service members, some congressional members, including GOP Rep. Derrick Van Orden of Wisconsin, and social media accounts like the far right Libs of TikTok, which has over 4 million followers on X, and Mostly Peaceful Memes, have been publicly flagging posts and tagging the Defense Department for review since last week.",
      "But defense officials said consequences would vary, depending not only on the substance of the comments but also on whether the author is a civilian employee or a uniformed service member. While civilians retain broad free speech protections, service members operate under tighter limits governed by service directives and Uniform Code of Military Justice.",
      "For instance, service members could face disciplinary measures for violating Article 92 of the code, which simply requires them to follow regulations, or Article 134, which prohibits conduct discrediting the armed forces.",
      "\"It's very easy to frame commentary \u2014 even somewhat benign commentary \u2014 about Charlie Kirk as somehow a violation of the UCMJ,\" said Dan Maurer, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and former military prosecutor who now focuses on national security and criminal law at Ohio Northern University's College of Law.",
      "Maurer told CBS News,\"The way that those laws are so broadly written, and given the reaction from the secretary of defense and from the president about people who comment at all about Charlie Kirk, it's entirely foreseeable that it will be at least threatened to be used.\"",
      "But proving a service member violated the UCMJ in a court martial could be challenging. Prosecutors, Maurer said, would have to show the posts are inciting violence or would be prejudicial to good order and discipline.",
      "In a 2008 case involving an Army soldier, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, the highest appellate court in the nation's military justice system, found that a soldier expressing white supremacist views online was not a violation of Article 134, even under the \"less protective First Amendment right afforded to servicemembers, and despite the offensive nature of [the solder's] views and communications.\"",
      "The court found that for speech to be prejudiced against good order and discipline, it had to have a \"direct and palpable effect on the military mission or environment.\" The court said the speech in the 2008 case was different from other cases because it was not directed at military members, his unit, or an expression of military policy and there was no impact on \"good order and discipline,\" and it was not \"service discrediting.\"",
      "There are also non-judicial ways to discipline troops, like letters of reprimand that could affect career advancement, or result in loss of pay or rank.",
      "When asked how many service members are under investigation, the Pentagon on Monday referred CBS News to each of the service branches.",
      "\"We will not tolerate military or civilian personnel who celebrate or mock the assassination of a fellow American,\" chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement.",
      "\"Those in our ranks who rejoice at an act of domestic terrorism are unfit to serve the American people at the Department of War.\"",
      "Army Secretary Dan Driscoll told reporters on Wednesday he didn't have an estimate for how many posts are under review.",
      "\"On a one-by-one basis, the Army is taking those very seriously and the command and the units are looking into each specific instance of that, and they'll take appropriate action,\" Driscoll said.",
      "It echoed his statement on X last week: \"Posts that celebrate or mock the assassination of a fellow American are inconsistent with Army values.\"",
      "The other two service secretaries, Navy Secretary John Phelan and Air Force Secretary Troy E. Meink, similarly posted last week on X about content related to Kirk.",
      "Phelan said in his post that \"any uniformed or civilian employee of the Department of the Navy who acts in a manner that brings discredit upon the Department, the @USNavy or the @USMC will be dealt with swiftly and decisively,\" and Meink in his post said, \"Airmen and Guardians are expected to uphold the highest standards of professionalism and conduct at all times.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 17 Sep 2025 18:31:22 -0400",
    "summary": "A two-day meeting of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, with new members appointed by RFK Jr., could reshape public trust in childhood vaccines and reduce access.",
    "story": [
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will convene Thursday and Friday of this week under an unaccustomed spotlight. The committee, known as ACIP, usually attracts little attention as it deliberates vaccine schedules and eligibility, but suddenly finds itself navigating political scrutiny, public skepticism and internal upheaval.",
      "The stakes extend well beyond the technical details of dosing intervals or eligibility cutoffs. The panel's decisions could reshape public trust in childhood vaccines, restrict access to vaccines through Medicaid and Medicare, and signal whether scientific consensus or political pressure will steer the nation's vaccination strategy.",
      "The precise language of the measures the ACIP will be voting on has not been shared with CDC staff or made public, but here is what CDC experts believe may be on the table:",
      "Congressional scrutiny",
      "At a hearing on Wednesday of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, former CDC Director Susan Monarez and former CDC Chief Medical Officer and Deputy Director for Program and Science Dr. Debra Houry painted a sobering picture of a CDC under political siege.",
      "In her remarks, Monarez recounted her recent firing, saying it came after she refused to pre-approve new vaccine policies and insisted that to be credible, such decisions cannot be divorced from scientific evidence.",
      "Houry, who resigned hours after Monarez was ousted, said, \"Secretary [Robert F.] Kennedy [Jr.]'s actions repeatedly censored CDC science, politicized our processes, and stripped agency leaders of the ability to protect the health of the American people.\" She added, \"I could not in good conscience remain under those conditions.\"",
      "Together, their accounts paint a picture of personal views and political positions increasingly overriding science, thereby eroding the CDC's core mission. The fallout, critics say, is likely to be measured not in headlines, but in children's lives.",
      "The administration is pushing back on this narrative. Andrew Nixon, an HHS spokesperson, charged that Monarez \"was tasked with returning the CDC to its core mission after decades of bureaucratic inertia, politicized science and mission creep corroded its purpose and squandered public trust. Instead, she acted maliciously to undermine the president's agenda and was fired as a result.\"",
      "Inside the agency, Jim O'Neill, the acting CDC director and deputy secretary of HHS, struck a different tone in an email to CDC staff obtained by CBS News. He highlighted the CDC's history of victories \u2014 from malaria eradication to identifying HIV \u2014 and argued that over time the agency had drifted from its core mission. \"Not every health decision is the government's business. \u2026 CDC and other science agencies lost the American public's trust and faith during the later stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, but we are working hard to refocus and earn that trust back,\" he wrote. \"Rigorous science, transparency about data and reasoning, and treating our fellow citizens as adults who can make their own informed decisions will be well received whenever we can offer them.\"",
      "The competing narratives have left CDC staff caught in the middle. One longtime CDC staffer put it bluntly: \"Part of this upcoming [ACIP] meeting is really all about criticizing the data.\" The staffer said the imperative inside the agency has shifted from one of problem-solving to point-scoring: \"It feels less about protecting the public and more about putting science on trial,\" as the staffer put it.",
      "An unusual process and unusual members",
      "What makes this week's ACIP meeting striking is not only the agenda \u2014 votes on the combined measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine, the universal newborn hepatitis B vaccine dose, and COVID vaccine eligibility \u2014 but who will be voting.",
      "In June, Kennedy removed all 17 sitting members of ACIP and replaced them with a smaller group of allies, many of whom have questioned vaccine safety or mandates. Then, just days before this week's meeting, he appointed five more members, bringing the total of his picks now serving on the panel to 12.",
      "Some of the new members include controversial figures: Dr. Robert Malone, who has spread misinformation about COVID vaccines; biostatistician Martin Kulldorff, who opposed vaccination mandates for children; and Catherine Stein, who has downplayed the severity of COVID. Dr. Kirk Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist, has promoted ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine despite studies showing they are not effective treatments for COVID, and warned against vaccinating children despite evidence of benefits. Others, like pharmacist Hillary Blackburn and surgeon Dr. Raymond Pollak, are not vaccine specialists by training.",
      "Critics note that several appointees have served as paid expert witnesses against vaccine makers, posing potential financial, professional, and ideological conflicts of interest. Normally, vetting of ACIP members takes months or years, with careful conflict-of-interest checks. Kennedy's accelerated appointments, combined with Monarez's forced resignation, have triggered alarm among career scientists.",
      "At its June meeting, the ACIP abandoned its long-standing evidence-to-recommendation framework and featured what numerous scientific, medical and public health experts regarded as inaccurate claims by new members, as well as a presentation from a well-known anti-vaccine advocate. This week, the concern many experts have is whether scientific rigor can prevail.",
      "COVID vaccine",
      "CDC staff members emphasize that the precise wording of the measures ACIP members will vote on has not been disclosed. What insiders expect, however, is a narrowing of the list of conditions that classify someone as being at high risk for severe COVID. That shift could mean fewer people would be recommended for vaccination even if they might still benefit.",
      "Dr. Lakshmi Panagiotakopoulos, a prior ACIP working group lead who resigned from the CDC earlier this year, warned that limiting recommendations could send the wrong signal, saying, \"People may interpret a narrower recommendation as meaning the vaccine doesn't work, when in fact it's still highly protective against severe disease.\"",
      "The possible exclusion of healthy pregnant women and healthy infants from the high-risk category is also drawing attention. Pregnancy and early infancy have long been recognized as periods of elevated vulnerability, and experts worry that dropping these groups from the recommendation would not only reduce their protection but would erode public confidence in maternal and pediatric vaccination.",
      "Last month, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended that all infants and toddlers aged 6 to 23 months receive the COVID vaccine. The group cited data showing that children under 2 have the highest COVID hospitalization rates among pediatric age groups, comparable to adults aged 50-64, and that more than half of those hospitalized had no underlying conditions.",
      "The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, the national organization representing high-risk pregnancy experts, has reaffirmed its recommendation that all pregnant and breastfeeding women receive the COVID vaccine.",
      "And the West Coast Health Alliance, which includes Washington, Oregon, California and Hawaii, has recommended that all adults and children who want a COVID vaccine in those states can get one. Those recommendations are informed by the AAP, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Academy of Family Physicians.",
      "Dr. Fiona Havers, who oversaw data on COVID hospitalizations, noted that pregnant women and infants remain uniquely vulnerable, making the question of maternal and early childhood COVID vaccination particularly sensitive. Havers resigned from the CDC earlier this year, saying she no longer had confidence that the data collected by her team would be used objectively or evaluated with appropriate scientific rigor to inform vaccine policies.",
      "Less clear is whether ACIP will also raise the age threshold for routine vaccination from 65+ to 75+. Dr. Helen Chu, an infectious disease physician at the University of Washington, emphasized that while severe outcomes are rarer in the 65-74 group, simultaneous issues such as diabetes and heart disease complicate the picture. \"Age is a blunt instrument,\" she said.",
      "Hepatitis B: The birth-dose debate",
      "Hepatitis B remains a global killer, causing more than a million deaths annually from liver cancer and cirrhosis.",
      "Dr. Samuel So, director of the Asian Liver Center at Stanford University, calls the universal newborn hepatitis B vaccine \"one of the most successful public health initiatives of the past 30 years.\"",
      "The U.S. shifted from targeted to universal infant vaccination in 1991 after data showed\u00a0too many cases of hepatitis B among pregnant women were missed during prenatal care. In 2005, the ACIP recommended a dose for newborns before hospital discharge, and in 2018 tightened the timing to within 24 hours of birth.",
      "The rationale was clear: Even with screening guidelines, about 12% of commercially insured and 16% of Medicaid-enrolled pregnant patients were not tested for hepatitis B. A universal birth dose serves as a safety net, protecting infants whose parent's infection has been missed while also boosting on-time series completion.",
      "Before birth-dose policies took hold, the U.S. saw an estimated 1,000 preventable infections in newborns each year. When infection occurs at birth, about 90% of infants develop chronic hepatitis B and one-quarter later die prematurely from cirrhosis or liver cancer if they're not treated. The risk is set at birth.",
      "Reconsidering the birth-dose alarms experts. \"Undoing decades of progress,\" Dr. So warns, would leave many at risk for a preventable type of cancer. And Dr. Anna Lok, director of clinical hepatology at the University of Michigan, warns that \"even when it [hepatitis B vaccination] is recommended and it should be done in every newborn baby, we know it's not always done. And when it becomes optional, it means that it will be rarely done. And that is going to be the problem.\"",
      "Alex Lee, a 68-year-old retired civil engineer and volunteer with Hep B Free in San Francisco, said the stakes are painfully personal. Lee acquired hepatitis B from his mother. He later developed cirrhosis and then liver cancer before a life-saving transplant in 2013. His mother also required a transplant, and two of his siblings live with the virus.",
      "\"I didn't want my daughters to go through what I went through,\" Lee said. \"That's why I made sure they all got vaccinated. Pulling back now would be a huge mistake.\"",
      "MMRV: Convenience vs. perception of risk",
      "For parents, the MMRV vaccine offers an obvious convenience: one shot instead of two.",
      "But the combination vaccine carries a slightly higher risk of fever-related \"febrile\" seizures when used as the first dose in young toddlers aged 12-23 months. That risk\u00a0reflects the age at which the vaccine is given, not the fact that it is a first dose. Febrile seizures are most common between 14 and 18 months of age, when children are naturally at peak susceptibility. Febrile seizures are rare and almost always resolve without lasting effects, but are frightening for families and can erode trust in vaccines.",
      "\"That's why\u00a0ACIP recommended\u00a0splitting MMR and varicella [vaccines] at 12 to 23 months. There was no reason to change the second dose, where no excess risk has ever been seen,\" explained one CDC expert.",
      "By contrast, studies show no elevated risk when MMRV is given for the second dose at ages 4 to 6 years old, after children have outgrown the highest-risk window. Reconsidering recommendations without new evidence has led experts to wonder why the issue is being reopened and whether it risks sowing doubt.",
      "Trust and precedent",
      "What happens at the ACIP meeting in Atlanta this week is unusual, not just for the agenda, but for what it represents. Reevaluating long-standing vaccine guidance is rare; experts fear that doing so in such a politicized and polarized climate is riskier still.",
      "A KFF/Washington Post poll found that about one in three parents now say they should be able to decline routine school-entry vaccines for their children, even if that creates health risks for others. That's up from 16% in 2019 and a sign of growing unease about routine childhood vaccination. A confusing or seemingly inconsistent decision from the CDC panel could deepen distrust at a fragile moment.",
      "Beyond the votes",
      "Even the process itself may prove consequential. If CDC scientists are marginalized, as insiders suggest, the ACIP risks becoming a stage for ideological performance rather than scientific review. One CDC staffer put it bluntly: \"Part of this upcoming meeting is really all about criticizing the data.\" The staffer went on to say, \"It feels less about protecting the public and more about putting science on trial.\"",
      "What's next?",
      "According to America's Health Insurance Plans, the national trade association representing the health insurance industry in the United States, commercial \"[h]ealth plans will continue to cover all ACIP-recommended immunizations that were recommended as of September 1, 2025\u2026 through the end of 2026.\" This includes updated formulations of the COVID and influenza vaccines. But vaccine coverage under Medicare and Medicaid may change based on new ACIP recommendations.",
      "However, the real test will be the public's reaction. Will most parents still accept that the MMRV vaccine remains safe? Do hospitals continue to administer the hepatitis B vaccine at birth? Do older adults, confused by shifting COVID guidance, skip shots altogether?",
      "\"Process matters because trust matters,\" Houry said in her prepared testimony. \"If people believe outcomes are predetermined, or that recommendations are slanted by ideology rather than scientific data, they are less likely to accept even well-supported recommendations,\" she said.",
      "This week's ACIP meeting will test whether that trust can endure, not only in the science of vaccines but in the institutions charged with safeguarding them.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-fomc-meeting-today-rate-cut-september-2025-powell-impact/",
    "published": "Wed, 17 Sep 2025 16:20:47 -0400",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve is cutting its benchmark interest rate as the U.S. economy faces headwinds, including a faltering labor market.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points \u2014 its first cut since December \u2014 as the U.S. grapples with a stalling labor market and slower economic growth.",
      "The Fed cut reduces the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to between 4% and 4.25%, down from its prior range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The last time the central bank eased borrowing costs was in December 2024, when it also trimmed rates by a quarter of a percentage point.",
      "Federal Reserve officials are also penciling in two more rate cuts in 2025, but only one in 2026, according to the central bank's summary of economic projections. That may disappoint Wall Street, with investors before the meeting projecting a total of five cuts over the rest of the year and 2026.",
      "According to those median\u00a0projections, Fed officials expect the nation's unemployment rate, currently 4.3%, to reach 4.5% by year-end before ticking down to 4.4% in 2026 and 4.3% the following year.",
      "Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) \u2014 the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation \u2014 is forecast to level off at 3% this year, well above the central bank's 2% annual target, before receding to 2.6% next year and 2.1% in 2027. The median projections for core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, forecast PCE of 3.1% this year.",
      "The move comes as the Fed contends with a two-fold economic challenge: curbing inflation, which has flared in recent months, while supporting job growth, which has slumped. The Fed typically seeks to tame inflation by nudging up interest rates to slow economic growth, while cutting rates in periods when the economy is faltering to encourage consumer spending and business investment.",
      "\"In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen,\" Powell said in a press conference following the Fed's two-day meeting.",
      "He added that recent labor data shows that what he termed \"people at the margins,\" which he said include recent college grads, are now having a harder time finding employment.",
      "\"The overall job-finding rate is very, very low, but the layoff rate is also very low,\" Powell noted. \"The concern is that if you start to see layoffs, the people who are laid off, there won't be a lot of hiring going on.\"",
      "In acting to lower interest rates, the Fed is signaling that it views the slowing labor market as a more pressing concern than rising prices, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell underlined at his\u00a0Jackson Hole address\u00a0last month in Wyoming.",
      "\"Concerns for the labor market's health are rising,\" said Cory Stahle, economist in the Indeed Hiring Lab, in a statement after the Fed's decision. \"Unemployment and layoffs are relatively stable at historically low levels, which is encouraging, but they are unlikely to stay that way if labor market conditions deteriorate further.\"",
      "At the same time, Powell said the Fed now views the pass-through of the Trump administration's tariff as being \"smaller and slower\" than central bank officials had expected earlier this year. \"We continue to expect [inflation] to move up, maybe not as much as we would have a few months ago,\" he said.",
      "The rate cut comes amid intense political pressure on the Fed, with President Trump repeatedly accusing Powell of moving too slowly to ease borrowing costs and shore up economic activity.",
      "Mr. Trump is also seeking to put his imprint on the Fed. To that end, he has\u00a0sought to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook from her seat on the central bank's board, alleging that she engaged in mortgage fraud. She has denied committing fraud and challenged Mr. Trump's authority to fire her, with an appeals court ruling Monday that Cook can keep her job.",
      "One vote for a jumbo cut",
      "An economic adviser to Mr. Trump, Stephen Miran, was\u00a0confirmed by the Senate\u00a0on Monday to take an open spot on the Fed's Board of Governors. He will also sit on the 12-member Federal Open Markets Committee, or FOMC, which sets interest rates for the Fed.",
      "\"Stephen Miran was a last-minute addition to the FOMC, but his vote won't drastically alter the outcome. He joined too late to submit an economic projection and path for monetary policy,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a report this week ahead of the Fed's rate cut.",
      "All of the voting FOMC members except one \u2014 Miran \u2014 voted in favor of the quarter-point cut, according to the central bank's statement. Miran voted for a larger cut of 0.50 percentage points, the Fed noted.",
      "A key question for consumers and businesses is whether the Fed trimming borrowing costs for the first time in nearly a year augurs additional cuts in 2025 and heading into 2026. Fed officials have two more meetings this year, set for October and December.",
      "Although the FOMC members were largely united on the size of today's cut, their projections of future cuts show a difference of opinion about the path of monetary policy moving forward. Many of the group's members don't expect the panel to make any more cuts this year, according to the summary of economic projections.",
      "\"That median hides the deep split on the FOMC \u2013\u2013 nine of 19 members don't anticipate further cuts this year,\" Michael Pearce, deputy chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a report.",
      "Powell noted that a quarter-point cut isn't likely to make a huge difference to the economy, but added, \"You have to look at the path\" of future cuts expected later this year and in 2026. \"It starts with a 25 basis point cut \u2014 it's not just one action,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. government is adding more questions to the civics test that applicants need to pass to become American citizens, the latest step by the Trump administration to tighten the legal immigration process.",
      "The move will reinstate a 2020 test from the first Trump administration that had been scrapped by the Biden administration, which argued the additional questions created unnecessary barriers for legal immigrants seeking to become citizens.",
      "Among other requirements, legal immigrants applying to become U.S. citizens must demonstrate they have lived in the U.S. as lawful permanent residents for at least 3 or 5 years, depending on their case; that they can read, write and speak English; and that they have a basic understanding of America's history and political system.",
      "The civics test has long been administered to assess the last requirement. Under the new version of the test, applicants will need to study 128 questions about U.S. history and politics, and answer 12 out of 20 of those questions correctly. Previously, under a test dating back to 2008, citizenship applicants had to study a pool of 100 questions and answer 6 out of 10 questions correctly.",
      "The test is administered orally, and the questions are not multiple choice. Most have several acceptable answers. Those who fail the test get a second chance to pass. If they fail again, their citizenship application is denied. Those 65 or older who have been in the U.S. as permanent residents for 20 or more years only have to study a pool of 20 questions, and can take the citizenship test in their preferred language.",
      "The new test will apply to those who file citizenship applications after mid-October, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the federal agency that adjudicates requests from prospective citizens.",
      "Some of the new questions deal with the 10th Amendment, the Federalist Papers, former President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Founding Fathers Alexander Hamilton and James Madison and examples of American innovation.",
      "In recent weeks, the Trump administration has announced other measures to more heavily scrutinize those applying for U.S. citizenship, including by expanding the factors considered when determining whether applicants have \"good moral character,\" another requirement to become an American citizen.",
      "It has also reinstated a long-dormant practice, known as \"neighborhood checks,\" that entails sending government investigators to interview the neighbors and co-workers of applicants to assess their eligibility for American citizenship.",
      "Matthew Tragesser, a spokesman for USCIS, said the reinstatement of the 2020 civics test would help ensure that those allowed to become citizens \"are fully assimilated and will contribute to America's greatness.\" He said the move was the \"first of many\" changes.",
      "\"American citizenship is the most sacred citizenship in the world and should only be reserved for aliens who will fully embrace our values and principles as a nation,\" Tragesser added.",
      "Pro-immigrant advocates said the changes to the test would make it more cumbersome.",
      "\"All this does is make it harder for long-time residents who contribute to this country every day to finally achieve the permanent protections that only U.S. citizenship can offer,\" said Jennifer Iba\u00f1ez Whitlock, a senior policy counsel at the National Immigration Law Center.",
      "The changes to the citizenship process are part of a larger campaign by Trump administration officials to restrict access to legal U.S. immigration benefits, which also include green cards and work permits.",
      "Since President Trump took office for a second time, USCIS has aggressively expanded vetting procedures, including by placing a higher emphasis on the social media activity of applicants. One memo issued this summer directed USCIS officers to probe \"anti-American\" views and activities of those applying for green cards, work permits and other immigration benefits.",

      "Susan Monarez, the ousted former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, plans to warn a Senate committee Wednesday that if a vaccine panel proceeds with a meeting scheduled for this week, there's a \"real risk\" vaccines for children could be limited, according to testimony obtained by CBS News.",
      "She also plans to tell lawmakers her side of the story about a contentious meeting with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that preceded her removal as director, after Kennedy testified to before a different Senate panel earlier this month that Monarez had said \"no\" when he asked her if she was \"trustworthy.\"",
      "Monarez, who was ousted from her job less than a month after her Senate confirmation, plans to say that she believes she was fired because she would not agree to pre-approve the recommendations from a newly reconstituted vaccine advisory panel known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP. She also plans to say she refused to fire career scientists at the agency.",
      "\"Secretary Kennedy demanded two things of me that were inconsistent with my oath of office and the ethics required of a public official,\" Monarez plans to say. \"He directed me to commit in advance to approving every ACIP recommendation regardless of the scientific evidence. He also directed me to dismiss career officials responsible for vaccine policy, without cause. He said if I was unwilling to do both, I should resign.\"",

      "Monarez will tell the panel, \"Secretary Kennedy told me he could not trust me. I had refused to commit to approving vaccine recommendations without evidence, fire career officials without cause, or resign \u2014 and I had shared my concerns with this committee. I told the secretary that if he believed he could not trust me, he could fire me.\"",

      "\"I would not commit to that, and I believe it is the true reason I was fired,\" Monarez will say.",
      "Monarez and Dr. Debra Houry, who resigned as the CDC's chief medical officer and deputy director for program and science at around the same time that Monarez was fired, are scheduled to appear before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Wednesday at 10 a.m. for a hearing to review the shakeups at the agency.",
      "In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 ACIP members and replaced them with hand-picked officials, some of whom critics say are vaccine skeptics. The newly constituted panel is set to meet on Thursday and Friday and is likely to discuss updated vaccine recommendations for Hepatitis B, RSV and MMRV, or measles, mumps, rubella and varicella.",
      "During Kennedy's testimony, Democrats and a few Republican senators on the committee told Kennedy they were concerned about his and the CDC's vaccine panel's approach to these recommendations.",
      "\"Secretary Kennedy, in your confirmation hearing, you promised to uphold the highest standards for vaccines. Since then, I've grown deeply concerned,\" GOP Sen.

Americans don't know who to rely on.\"",
      "HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement that Monarez's prepared remarks \"have factual inaccuracies.\" He said she \"acted maliciously to undermine\" President Trump's agenda.",
      "He accused her of \"neglecting to implement President Trump's executive orders, making policy decisions without the knowledge or consent of Secretary Kennedy or the White House, limiting badge access for Trump's political appointees, and removing a Secretarial appointee without consulting anyone.\"",
      "\"When she refused to acknowledge her insubordination, President Trump fired her,\" Nixon said.",
      "Houry, according to her prepared remarks, is expected to tell senators the collaboration between the CDC and HHS \"changed drastically\" when Kennedy took over the department. She plans to say she and other agency heads resigned when it became apparent that Monarez and CDC leadership \"were expected to serve as rubber stamps\" for Kennedy's decisions.",
      "According to Houry's testimony, before Monarez was confirmed, when there was no permanent CDC director, senior CDC officials were not invited to brief Kennedy on key diseases like measles, and policy changes were announced \"unilaterally.\"",

      "Obama said that political violence \"is not new\" and \"has happened at certain periods in\" U.S. history, but is \"anathema to what it means to be a democratic country.\"",
      "\"There are no ifs, ands or buts about it, the central premise of our democratic system is that we have to be able to disagree and have sometimes really contentious debates without resorting to violence,\" Obama said during a fireside chat at the Jefferson Educational Society, a nonprofit in Erie, Pennsylvania.",
      "Obama said that recent political violence isn't the only worry he has about the state of the U.S. He warned that there is \"a host of larger trends that we have to be concerned about.\" He criticized leaders who responded to Kirk's death with comments that could sow further division.",
      "\"There's been some confusion, I think, around this lately, and frankly, coming from the White House and some of the other positions of authority that suggest, even before we had determined who the perpetrator of this evil act was, that somehow we're going to identify an enemy,\" Obama said. In a video statement mourning Kirk, President Trump blamed the \"radical left\" for his death.",
      "\"We're going to suggest that somehow that enemy was at fault, and we are then going to use that as a rationale for trying to silence discussion around who we are as a country and what direction we should go,\" Obama continued. \"And that's a mistake as well.\"",

He said that while he believes Kirk's ideas \"were wrong,\" that \"doesn't negate the fact that what happened was a tragedy and that I mourn for him and his family.\"",

      "\"Those are all topics that we have to be able to discuss honestly and forthrightly, while we still insist that in that process of debate, we respect other people's right to say things that we profoundly disagree with,\" Obama said. \"That's how we should approach this.\"",

    "summary": "Early in-person voting in the Virginia governor's race between Republican Winsome Earle-Sears and Democrat Abigail Spanberger starts Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Democrat Abigail Spanberger is heading into the final stretch of her campaign to try and become the next governor of Virginia with vocal support from two former Republican members of Congress.",
      "In a new development first reported by CBS News, Spanberger's campaign is set to tout endorsements from former Reps. Barbara Comstock and Denver Riggleman. The show of support from the two, who both backed Democrat Kamala Harris in last year's presidential race, also includes an advertisement.",
      "\"I saw firsthand that Abigail was one of the most bipartisan members of Congress,\" Riggleman says in the advertisement, while Comstock adds that her \"support for Abigail isn't about party, it's what's best for Virginia.\"",
      "After a victory in 2021, GOP Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin cannot run for a consecutive term this year due to state law. His chosen candidate in this year's contest, Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, is contending with national political tensions from Donald Trump's second term as president while she attempts to become the first GOP candidate since 1997 to succeed a fellow Republican as governor of the commonwealth.",
      "\"This election is a choice between sanity and chaos. We must protect our children from Abigail Spanberger's extremist agenda,\" Earle-Sears said in a social media post earlier this month.",
      "The decision by Spanberger's campaign to highlight support from the two former Republican members of Congress comes ahead of early in-person voting starting on Friday.",
      "Riggleman served one term in the U.S. House, and was defeated by a Republican challenger in 2020 before going on to serve as a senior technical adviser for the House Jan. 6 select committee following the 2021 Capitol riot. After winning two terms, Comstock lost her battleground congressional seat to a Democrat in the 2018 midterms during Mr. Trump's first term. Both are now examples of former Republican-elected officials who have criticized Mr. Trump since leaving office. Riggleman also appeared in an advertisement supporting Spanberger's 2022 reelection run for the U.S. House.",
      "The Virginia governor's race this November will be one of the first statewide races to be held during Mr. Trump's second term in the White House. The statewide off-year contest in Virginia is often viewed as at least being in part a referendum on the current incumbent president.",
      "Virginia has become a more reliably blue state in recent years, but Democrats' vote share in the state did drop during the 2024 presidential election. While then-Vice President Harris carried the state, she earned fewer votes than Joe Biden did during the 2020 contest.",
      "And at a time when Democrats are continuing to search for a path forward on messaging and branding issues, Spanberger's attempt to win back the governor's office from the GOP represents a closely watched contest that may carry national political implications in the coming years.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/aca-costs-trump-administration-catastrophic-health-insurance-plans/",
    "published": "Wed, 17 Sep 2025 05:00:10 -0400",
    "summary": "Tens of millions of people face sticker shock enrolling in Affordable Care Act insurance for 2026. To save money, the Trump administration wants them to consider less generous coverage.",
    "story": [
      "Trump administration officials, looking at the possible impact of large insurance premium increases for millions of next year's Obamacare customers, want more people to consider plans with less generous benefits and high deductibles.",
      "The agency that oversees the ACA announced early this month that it would expand eligibility for \"catastrophic\" plans sold in Affordable Care Act online marketplaces. The plans require people to spend more than $10,000 a year on deductibles before the policies pay most medical costs but carry lower monthly premiums than other Obamacare policies.",
      "The move reflects growing concern among Republicans about political backlash if Congress doesn't extend larger tax credits put in place during the COVID-19 public health emergency to help consumers pay their premiums. The extra subsidies are set to expire at the end of the year, resulting in an average 75% increase in the amount people pay for coverage, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "A small, bipartisan group of House lawmakers introduced legislation to extend the enhanced COVID-era subsidies for one more year, which would keep them in place through midterm congressional elections in the fall.",
      "But the fate of that legislation is uncertain, with many Republicans opposed to extending the extra tax credits, with a permanent change costing at least $335 billion over 10 years. Without an extension, tax credit amounts would revert to pre-pandemic levels.",
      "\"They spent the last 15 years against the ACA, so a lot will be steadfast, but others are worried about the effect of massively spiked premiums on their constituents,\" noted a Democratic Senate staffer who asked not to be identified because they weren't authorized to speak to the media.",
      "Republicans currently control Congress by slim margins, raising the stakes if voters who lose their ACA tax credits blame them at the ballot box.",
      "Catastrophic plans are a little-known type of Obamacare policy that have previously been limited mainly to people under age 30. While they come with lower monthly premiums than other types of ACA plans, the coverage has higher annual deductibles, which are set at the out-of-pocket maximum for the year: $10,600 for individuals in 2026 or $21,200 for families.",
      "A deductible is the amount patients must spend on health care before insurance plans pay for most services. Catastrophic plans do cover three primary care visits a year without having to pay the full deductible and, as with other ACA policies, policyholders pay nothing for preventive services such as some cancer screenings and vaccines.",
      "The catastrophic plans will automatically show up on the federal marketplace, healthcare.gov, for consumers who lose tax credit coverage entirely next year due to their household income. Another category of consumers \u2014 people who continue to qualify for tax credits but not for subsidies that reduce out-of-pocket costs \u2014 may also be eligible but would have to send in paperwork.",
      "\"By expanding access to catastrophic plans, we are making sure hardworking people who face unexpected hardships can get affordable coverage that protects them from devastating medical costs,\" Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz said in a statement.",
      "It isn't clear whether the policy changes will make the plans more attractive to consumers. Catastrophic plans aren't available in all states, and the size of the deductibles can be off-putting.",
      "\"It's a ton of money,\" said Louise Norris, a health insurance analyst and broker who writes regularly about the ACA. \"A full-price catastrophic plan is still more expensive than some people can afford, but they're doing this to offer a slightly more affordable option.\"",
      "Catastrophic plans have had limited appeal, with only about 54,000 out of Obamacare's 24 million enrollees currently opting for the coverage, according to government data, Norris said.",
      "\"Uptake has always been quite low,\" said Katie Keith, director of the O'Neill Institute's Center for Health Policy and the Law at Georgetown University. \"It's not a bad option if it is the only option you have. I question whether consumers are looking for this kind of coverage.\"",
      "CMS plans to grant people a \"hardship\" designation to enroll in catastrophic plans if they lose eligibility for ACA tax credits next year. Most likely to qualify are people earning more than four times the federal poverty rate ($62,600 for an individual this year, or $106,600 for a family of three), who will lose access to all premium subsidies if Congress does not extend the current enhanced tax credits. It's also unclear how much premiums will cost. Insurers, reacting to the new administration guidance, might seek to recalculate their rates based on what they estimate may be an influx of older people into the plans, Norris said.",
      "AHIP, the insurance industry lobbying group, is pushing hard for the larger tax credits to be extended. It did not comment specifically on how the new guidance might affect catastrophic health plan premiums. Still, AHIP spokesperson Chris Bond said that \"while catastrophic plans can provide important coverage for specific needs, they are not a replacement for affordable comprehensive coverage.\"",
      "There are other hurdles. Norris said insurers don't offer plans at all in 10 states: Alaska, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, and Wyoming. And where they are available, options are few. This year, for example, a 25-year-old in Orlando, Florida, had a choice of 61 \"bronze\" plans, the cheapest level of coverage available to all ACA shoppers, but just three catastrophic plans.",
      "Policy experts say the expanded eligibility for catastrophic plans makes it more important than ever for consumers to consider all options when shopping for ACA coverage during the annual open enrollment period, which starts Nov. 1. In addition to the catastrophic and bronze plans, there are also \"silver\" and \"gold\" plans, each with varying premiums and deductibles.",
      "Bronze plans have the lowest premiums but the highest deductibles; the average bronze deductible this year is $7,186, which is still lower than the catastrophic plans, according to KFF.",
      "Catastrophic plan deductibles, while high, are comparable to some bronze plans, Norris noted. People who choose catastrophic plans are not eligible for any ACA tax subsidies to help pay monthly premiums.",
      "A pending court battle may provide lawmakers concerned about voter pushback on Obamacare changes an unintended reprieve.",
      "In late August, a federal judge in Maryland temporarily put on hold some changes the Trump administration had ordered for next year. Those changes, included in a June regulatory filing by the administration, would have added additional verification paperwork requirements for some people enrolling in ACA plans, and were challenged by several cities, which cited government estimates that the changes could cause up to 1.8 million people to lose their insurance in 2026.",
      "The court ruling stayed several provisions of the Trump administration rules, including income verification requirements that would affect people below the poverty level and those without tax return information. The move also paused verification requirements affecting people who apply outside the annual open enrollment period and blocked a $5 monthly charge for people who are automatically enrolled into plans in which subsidies cover the entire premium \u2014 unless they contact the marketplace and confirm their selection.",
      "The Trump administration is appealing the decision, but the case may not be settled until next year, said Keith at Georgetown University.",
      "That makes it likely that the pause of the new requirements will stay in place for this year's open enrollment season.",
      "Keith said the ruling was a \"bigger deal\" than expanding eligibility for catastrophic plans. \"Consumers all across the country won't have to deal with red tape the Trump administration rushed to put into place ahead of the new plan year,\" and the ruling also \"helps people keep their coverage.\"",

      "Hortman brokered that agreement, which ended Democrats' three-week boycott. Under the deal, she agreed to end her six-year tenure as speaker and let Republican Lisa Demuth take the position. Hortman then took the title speaker emerita. Most legislative committees became evenly split between Republican and Democratic members, with co-chairs from each party.",
      "The tie in the House meant some level of bipartisan agreement was required to pass anything in this year's session.",

      "Washington \u2014 House GOP leaders on Tuesday announced a plan to avoid a shutdown and keep the government funded until Nov. 21, unveiling legislation that also includes funds for additional security to lawmakers and other officials in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said the bill is not \"partisan\" but a \"short-term, clean continuing resolution that will keep the government funded and operating at current levels while we continue all this work and doing our jobs and getting the remaining bills done.\"",
      "The speaker said a Friday vote is expected in the House, giving lawmakers the standard 72 hours to review the legislation. But he later said a vote could happen before then \"if there's an appetite to do it sooner.\"",
      "The House Rules Committee quickly advanced the legislation Tuesday to tee it up for a floor vote.",
      "Lawmakers have a Sept. 30 deadline to fund the government. But party leaders appeared far apart even as the legislation was unveiled Tuesday. Adding to the pressure, Congress is scheduled to be in recess next week for Rosh Hashanah.",
      "Democrats have pushed for bipartisan negotiations on the bill, demanding that enhanced tax credits for Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace be extended. The subsidies were originally passed in 2021 during the pandemic and extended in 2022 for another three years.",
      "Johnson has dismissed the inclusion of an extension in the short-term funding bill, saying it's \"a December policy issue, not a September funding issue.\"",
      "With a narrow Republican majority in the House, Republicans could approve a funding measure without support from Democrats, though it would require near-unanimous approval from the GOP conference. And a handful of Republicans have already pledged to oppose the measure.",
      "Getting the bill through the Senate is another story. Though Republicans also have a majority in the upper chamber, with 53 seats, the legislation requires a 60-vote threshold to advance, making the support of at least seven Democrats necessary.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has argued that a \"clean\" extension of government funding would \"ensure there is no reason for Democrats to oppose this bill and delay passage.\" He cited Democrats' demands during previous funding fights that any extension be free of divisive policy measures and current funding levels maintained.",

      "\"By refusing to work with Democrats, Republicans are steering our country straight toward a shutdown,\" Schumer and Jeffries said. \"Instead of governing, Republicans are once again taking orders from Donald Trump, hurting the American people and recklessly marching our nation to the brink of a shutdown.\"",
      "On Monday, President Trump put pressure on Republicans to fall in line on a clean continuing resolution, claiming in a post on Truth Social that Democrats \"want the Government to shut down.\"",
      "\"In times like these, Republicans have to stick TOGETHER to fight back against the Radical Left Democrat demands, and vote 'YES!' on both Votes needed to pass a Clean CR this week out of the House of Representatives,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "In wake of Kirk's assassination last week, lawmakers attached an additional $30 million in funding for their security to the bill, along with $58 million that the White House requested for executive and judicial branches. Johnson outlined Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that he has been speaking with members and \"trying to calm the nerves to assure them that we will make certain that everyone has a level of security that's necessary.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration announced Tuesday it would lift travel restrictions on Hungarian citizens after the country took steps to address security vulnerabilities, in the latest sign of warming ties between Washington and Budapest.",
      "The Biden administration in 2021 imposed restrictions on Hungarian passport holders born outside of Hungary and reduced the timeframe of authorized travel permitted under the Visa Waiver Program, citing a simplified naturalization policy backed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban that extended citizenship to people born abroad who claimed Hungarian ancestry.",
      "Officials said at the time that nearly 1 million people were granted citizenship between 2011 and 2020 without adequate vetting.",
      "Under the Visa Waiver Program, most citizens of participating countries are allowed to visit the United States for 90 days or fewer, if they obtain approval within the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA). Citizens from more than 40 countries are eligible to travel to the U.S. under the Visa Waiver Program, according to the State Department's\u00a0website.",
      "While ESTA approvals typically allow travel over a span of two years, restrictions added by the U.S. in 2023 had reduced that validity period for the Hungarian travelers born outside the country from two years to one, and limited the authorization to only one entry into the U.S.",

    "story": [
      "In the forests of Uganda and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, chimps crowd into fig and plum trees, feasting on fruit that's sweet, soft and just a little boozy. A new study shows those daily snacks quietly add up to the equivalent of nearly two alcoholic beverages for humans.",
      "A team of scientists at University of California Berkeley and other institutions tested the fruit chimps actually snack on: figs in Uganda's canopy and the plum-like fruits on the forest floor in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Collecting the data wasn't easy \u2014 with little electricity beyond solar panels and constant humidity threatening the instruments, researchers spent three seasons hauling equipment and calibrating test kits to measure alcohol in many different tropical fruits.",
      "In the end, they found that on average, the fruit's alcohol content came in at about .3% by weight. This is kombucha-level, but when chimpanzees eat 10 pounds of fruit a day and weigh around 90 pounds, it adds up to about 14 grams of ethanol, equating to about two cocktails for a human.",
      "But don't picture chimps swinging drunkenly from the trees. To actually get drunk, they'd have to binge on fruit until their bellies ballooned, the researchers said. Instead, they're exposed to a steady low dose, a quiet buzz from nature's own fermentation process.",
      "Senior author of the paper and UC Berkeley professor of integrative biology Robert Dudley first floated the \"drunken monkey\" hypothesis in 2000, arguing that our attraction to alcohol could come from ancestral fruit-eating habits. Dudley argued that it makes sense primates would be tuned to alcohol, since their diets have long revolved around ripe fruit.",
      "\"Once you start eating, it acts as an aperitif,\" he said. \"The pleasure of association with drinking alcohol increases feeding rates.\"",

      "\"Open a bottle of beer outside and a fruit fly appears almost instantly,\" Dudley said.",
      "Spider monkeys in Panama, slow lorises in Malaysia and even elephants have been documented consuming naturally fermented fruit or nectar.",
      "What makes this study different is that it provides the first direct chemical measurements of ethanol in the fruits that wild chimps routinely eat, and then connects those numbers to daily intake.",
      "The open question is whether chimps are actually selecting fruit for its alcohol content or just chasing sugar and calories. Either way, Dudley says the story connects to us.",
      "\"We inherited the taste for alcohol,\" Dudley said. \"Even though our diets have diversified \u2026 that bias to consume quickly when this molecule is present could still be a powerful force.\"",

    "story": [
      "The sun has become more and more active over the last 16 years, in a turn that surprised scientists and could affect space weather and technology on Earth, NASA announced\u00a0this week.",
      "A new research, conducted by two NASA scientists and published earlier in September in the peer-reviewed\u00a0Astrophysical Journal Letters, shows that solar activity has ramped up after 2008 \u2014 an unexpected reversal following a decades-long decline that was initially thought to foreshadow a period of historic inaction on the surface of the sun.",
      "\"All signs were pointing to the Sun going into a prolonged phase of low activity,\" Jamie Jasinski, a space plasma physicist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the study's lead author, said in a statement. \"So it was a surprise to see that trend reversed. The Sun is slowly waking up.\"",
      "An uptick in solar activity could influence space weather, potentially leading to more solar storms,\u00a0solar flares\u00a0and coronal mass ejections, the researchers found. Space weather patterns have the potential to directly impact spacecraft operations and the safety of astronauts, but\u00a0they may be felt on Earth, too, as space weather can affect power grids, GPS systems and radio communication, according to NASA.",
      "The downward trend was documented from the 1980s until 2008, when the space agency determined that the sun had reached its weakest point on record. The sun's action, or inaction, tends to fluctuate in 11-year cycles, according to NASA, although some patterns draw on longer.",
      "Earth is currently in\u00a0Solar Cycle 25, which began in 2020. The last cycle maintained an average length of 11 years and was the weakest solar cycle to occur in a century, according to the National Weather Service. Scientists thought the sun would stay in what they dubbed \"deep solar minimum,\" believing that the stretch of quietness from the sun would continue, eventually leading to a new phase of record low activity.",
      "\"But then the trend of declining solar wind ended,\" Jasinski said in NASA's announcement.",
      "His study, co-authored by Marco Velli, a fellow researcher at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, instead tracked increasing bursts of solar plasma and stronger magnetic field measurements throughout the solar system, which are all affected by the sun.",
      "Solar Cycle 26 is expected to begin some time between January 2029 and December 2032, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said, but the agency has not yet produced a prediction for the next cycle.",
      "In order to better track space weather, NASA announced that it will launch the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) and\u00a0Carruthers Geocorona Observatory\u00a0missions, as well as the NOAA's\u00a0SWFO-L1\u00a0mission, from Falcon 9 as early as next week. It comes just a few months after\u00a0SpaceX helped NASA launch TRACERS twin satellites which are studying how the electrically-charged solar wind interacts with Earth's magnetic field.",
      "\"Space weather predictions are critical for supporting the spacecraft and astronauts of NASA's Artemis campaign, as understanding the space environment is a vital part of mitigating astronaut exposure to space radiation,\" NASA said Monday.",
      "In May 2024, NASA officials recorded the\u00a0strongest geomagnetic storm in more than 20 years. Several X-class solar flares \u2014 the largest of B-class, followed by C and M \u2014 sent the\u00a0northern lights\u00a0to far lower latitudes than normal,\u00a0as far south as Mexico.",
      "Geomagnetic storms have the ability to impact how and whether technology functions on a massive scale, electrical engineer David Wallace explained in\u00a0The Conversation\u00a0last year.",

      "Before the FTC probe, OpenAI indicated that it would introduce\u00a0extra safety protections\u00a0for vulnerable users and teens, after the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine of California, who died by suicide in April, sued the company late last month. Raine's family allege that ChatGPT led their teen to commit suicide.",
      "It's unclear how OpenAI plans to indentify users' ages, however, it stated that if ChatGPT is unsure about someone's age, or has incomplete information, it will default to the under-18 version.",
      "OpenAI did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "Other tech companies have taken similar steps to shield teen users from inappropriate content. YouTube, for example, announced a new age-estimation technology that will track the types of videos users watch and how long they've had their account to verify if they are under the age of 18.",
      "According\u00a0to an April Pew Research Center report, parents are generally more worried about the mental health of teenagers than are teens themselves. Among those parents who are at least somewhat concerned about teen mental health, 44% said social media had the biggest negative impact on adolescents.",

      "The parents of teenagers who killed themselves after interactions with artificial intelligence chatbots testified to Congress on Tuesday about the dangers of the technology.",
      "\"What began as a homework helper gradually turned itself into a confidant and then a suicide coach,\" said Matthew Raine, whose 16-year-old son Adam died in April.",
      "\"Within a few months, ChatGPT became Adam's closest companion,\" the father told senators. \"Always available. Always validating and insisting that it knew Adam better than anyone else, including his own brother.\"",
      "Raine's family sued OpenAI\u00a0and its CEO Sam Altman last month alleging that ChatGPT coached the boy in planning to take his own life.",
      "ChatGPT mentioned suicide 1,275 times to Raine, the\u00a0lawsuit alleges, and kept providing specific methods to the teen on how to die by suicide. Instead of directing the 16-year-old to get professional help or speak to trusted loved ones, it continued to validate and encourage Raine's feelings, the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Also testifying Tuesday was Megan Garcia, the mother of 14-year-old Sewell Setzer III of Florida.",
      "Garcia sued another\u00a0AI company, Character Technologies, for wrongful death last year, arguing that before his suicide, Sewell had become increasingly isolated from his real life as he engaged in highly sexualized conversations with the chatbot.",
      "His mother told CBS News last year that her son withdrew socially and stopped wanting to play sports after he started speaking to an AI chatbot. The company said after the teen's death, it made changes that require users to be\u00a013 or older to create an account and that it would launch parental controls in the first quarter of 2025. Those controls were rolled out in March.",
      "Hours before the Senate hearing, OpenAI pledged to roll out new safeguards for teens, including efforts to detect whether ChatGPT users are under 18 and controls that enable parents to set \"blackout hours\" when a teen can't use ChatGPT. The company said it will attempt to contact the users' parents if an under-18 user is having suicidal ideation and, if unable to reach them, will contact the authorities in case of imminent harm.",
      "\"We believe minors need significant protection,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement outlining the proposed changes.",
      "Child advocacy groups criticized the announcement as not enough.",
      "\"This is a fairly common tactic \u2014 it's one that Meta uses all the time \u2014 which is to make a big, splashy announcement right on the eve of a hearing which promises to be damaging to the company,\" said Josh Golin, executive director of Fairplay, a group advocating for children's online safety.",
      "\"What they should be doing is not targeting ChatGPT to minors until they can prove that it's safe for them,\" Golin said. \"We shouldn't allow companies, just because they have tremendous resources, to perform uncontrolled experiments on kids when the implications for their development can be so vast and far-reaching.\"",
      "California State Senator Steve Padilla, who introduced legislation to create safeguards in the state around AI Chatbots, said in a statement to CBS News, \"We need to create common-sense safeguards that rein in the worst impulses of this emerging technology that even the tech industry doesn't fully understand.\"",
      "He added that technology companies can lead the world in innovation, but it shouldn't come at the expense of \"our children's health.\"",

      "Technology company Oracle is among a consortium of firms that would enable TikTok to continue operations in the U.S. if a framework deal between the United States and China to take over the social media company is finalized, sources with knowledge of the negotiations tell CBS News.",
      "The precise structure of the final deal was unclear Monday night, but will include multiple companies, the sources said. It's not clear what level of involvement Chinese firms \u2014 including TikTok's current parent company ByteDance \u2014 will have in the deal, and who will control TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm. Presidents Trump and Xi are expected to talk on Friday.",
      "The deal includes a blend of new investors, including Silver Lake, a private equity firm based in California, and existing investors, the sources said.",
      "Mr. Trump on Tuesday morning declined to say which companies are purchasing TikTok, but said they will be announcing that soon.",
      "\"We have a group of very big companies that want to buy it,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And, you know, the kids wanted it so badly. I had parents calling me up. They don't want it for themselves. They want it for their kids. They say, if I don't get it done, they're in big trouble with their kids.\"",
      "Oracle declined to comment. A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment. A spokesperson for Silver Lake didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Chinese Embassy in Washington responded on Tuesday morning that China will \"firmly defend its national interests, the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies, and will carry out technology export approvals according to relevant laws and regulations.\"",
      "The statement continued that the Chinese government \"also fully respects the will of enterprises and supports them in conducting business negotiations on an equal footing in accordance with market principles.\"",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday in Madrid after meetings with Chinese officials on a range of issues, including TikTok, that the commercial terms had been agreed upon.",
      "Oracle \u2014 the tech company co-founded by billionaire Larry Ellison \u2014 has long been seen as a possible buyer if the U.S. government forced a TikTok sale. Mr. Trump has described Ellison as a friend. (Larry Ellison's son, David Ellison, is the chairman & CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison Family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "In 2020, Mr. Trump endorsed a deal that would see Oracle and Walmart taking a 20% stake in a U.S.-based entity called TikTok Global. And in recent years, as TikTok has sought to regain trust with American users and regulators, it has partnered with Oracle to route U.S. TikTok users' activity through the Texas-based company's servers.",
      "Mr. Trump was circumspect about a deal with reporters in the Oval Office on Monday. \"We may let it die, or we may, I don't know, it depends. Up to China. It doesn't matter too much. I'd like to do it for the kids. They like it.\"",
      "Last year, Congress passed and then-President Joe Biden signed a bill that essentially gave TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, an ultimatum: either divest from TikTok or face a ban in the U.S. The Supreme Court upheld the law in a unanimous 9-0 decision. But Mr. Trump has issued a series of orders unilaterally delaying its enforcement. The latest came in June, when he pushed back the deadline for enforcing the measure until this Wednesday.",
      "The president's orders have directed the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against tech companies such asApple and Google for failing to comply with the law by offering the TikTok app on their platforms.",
      "The TikTok divestiture law was passed in 2024 after years of bipartisan concern over possible national security risks posed by the ultra-popular video app. Those include worries that the Chinese government could force ByteDance to divulge information on U.S.-based users or manipulate the platform's algorithm to control what Americans see. TikTok has long denied that the Chinese authorities exert any influence on the platform.",
      "The concerns stretch back to Mr. Trump's first term. The president signed an executive order to ban TikTok in the U.S. in 2020 on national security and data privacy grounds, but the move was blocked by a judge. Four years later, Mr. Trump\u00a0 changed his view and expressed support for the app, which he has credited for his improved performance among younger voters in last year's election.",

      "Tesla said in a regulatory filing that it will hand Musk shares worth as much as 12% of the company in a dozen separate packages if the company meets certain performance targets, including massive increases in car production, share price and operating profit. If approved by shareholders, the new pay package could make Musk the world's first trillion dollar executive, and would mark a new level of outsized pay in a country already known for extreme compensation. But the payoff is in shares, not cash, and the goals are extreme as well.",
      "To get his first package of shares equivalent to 1% of the company, Musk would have to convince investors in the stock market that Tesla is worth $2 trillion in total, double what they value it today, and also hit several other milestones. To receive all the shares offered and make him the world's first trillion-dollar man would require that market value to then rise to $8.5 trillion, double that of the world's most valuable company now, chipmaker Nvidia.",

    "summary": "A federal immigration judge has ordered Mahmoud Khalil \u2014 a former Columbia University graduate student linked to pro-Palestinian protests \u2014 to be deported.",
    "story": [
      "A federal immigration judge has ordered Mahmoud Khalil \u2014 a former Columbia University graduate student linked to pro-Palestinian protests \u2014 to be deported to either Algeria or Syria.",
      "The ruling was issued last week, but it first came to light in court papers filed by Khalil's lawyers on Wednesday as part of his lawsuit against the government. A green card holder, Khalil alleges the Trump administration detained him for months and sought to deport him as part of a wider policy of punishing foreign students for protesting Israel's conduct in its war against Hamas. The Trump administration has accused him of \"hateful behavior and rhetoric.\"",
      "On Friday, Louisiana-based immigration Judge Jamee Comans denied Khalil's motion for a waiver preventing his removal from the U.S. because he allegedly misrepresented his background on his green card paperwork. Comans once again ordered him to be deported to either Algeria, where Khalil is a citizen, or Syria, where he was born.",
      "Khalil now has 30 days to appeal Comans' ruling to a Justice Department body called the Board of Immigration Appeals, and if his appeal is rejected, he will lose his green card status and be ordered to leave the country, his lawyers said in a letter Wednesday to U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz.",
      "Lawyers for Khalil told Farbiarz they plan on amending his lawsuit against the administration in light of \"these latest, highly unusual developments.\" In a statement Wednesday, Khalil's legal team argued the immigration judge \"rushed to a decision without providing a hearing on the evidence as due process requires, engaging in multiple procedural irregularities.\"",
      "\"It is no surprise that the Trump administration continues to retaliate against me for my exercise of free speech,\" Khalil said in the statement. \"Their latest attempt, through a kangaroo immigration court, exposes their true colors once again.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment.",
      "The legal fight between Khalil and the federal government stretches back to March, when he was first detained by immigration agents in New York. Khalil is one of several international students who were detained due to their links to pro-Palestinian campus activism, which the Trump administration alleges is riddled with antisemitism \u2014 a charge the protesters deny.",
      "Initially, the Trump administration argued Khalil could be deported under a federal law allowing noncitizens to be removed if the Secretary of State determines that their presence poses \"adverse foreign policy consequences.\"",
      "In June, Farbiarz blocked the government from deporting Khalil on foreign policy grounds, finding his \"career and reputation are being damaged and his speech is being chilled.\" A month later, Khalil was released from immigration detention in Louisiana.",
      "But his immigration case continued under a separate allegation leveled by the Trump administration. In addition to the foreign policy claims, the government had accused Khalil of leaving out details about his past associations on his immigration paperwork, including membership in a United Nations agency that works with Palestinians and his \"continuing employment\" at the British Embassy in Lebanon.",
      "In last week's ruling, Comans found that Khalil was not legally entitled to a waiver of deportation on those allegations. The immigration judge also said that Khalil shouldn't get discretion from the court because of the \"gravity of his conduct.\" She called Khalil an intelligent, ivy-league educated individual\" who should've known disclosure was required.",
      "\"This Court finds that Respondent's lack of candor on his [immigration forms] was not an oversight by an uninformed, uneducated applicant,\" the judge wrote. \"Rather, this Court finds that Respondent willfully misrepresented material fact(s) for the sole purpose of circumventing the immigration process and reducing the likelihood his application would be denied.\"",
      "Khalil has denied making misrepresentations, saying he was not a member of the U.N. agency, but was instead an unpaid intern through Columbia. He has also stated that he stopped working at the British Embassy in Beirut in 2022, despite the government's claims that he continued working there after that.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, his lawyers called the claims \"baseless\" and \"pretextual.\"",

    "story": [
      "Tropical Storm Gabrielle formed Wednesday morning over the central Atlantic Ocean, becoming the seventh named storm of the\u00a02025 Atlantic hurricane season. Forecasters expect the weather system to remain over open waters for the next several days and haven't yet warned of any hazards that could potentially affect land. But it may become a low-grade hurricane as it intensifies over the weekend.",
      "The storm's current forecast predicts that Gabrielle's track will carry it north of the Caribbean and away from land, but the system could reach Bermuda next week as it continues to strengthen, CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan said.",
      "A map produced by Nolan shows Gabrielle's anticipated westward path through Monday, at which point it may be packing hurricane-force winds as strong as 85 mph. The storm could develop into a hurricane Sunday as it passes near the Caribbean, according to the map.",
      "Gabrielle developed before 11 a.m. ET on Wednesday, and in the evening, it was situated roughly 895 miles east of the northern Leeward Islands and tracking northwest at 16\u00a0miles per hour, the National Hurricane Center said in an advisory.",
      "Its maximum sustained winds on Wednesday night were 50 mph, just over the threshold that differentiates a tropical depression from a tropical storm. Gabrielle grew from a tropical depression in the Atlantic that meteorologists initially flagged earlier on Wednesday.",
      "Tropical storm force winds extended outward some 175 miles from Gabrielle's center on Wednesday morning, the Hurricane Center said, adding that the storm's path and overall forecast remained \"highly uncertain\" as its center was still poorly defined.",
      "Gabrielle took shape about one week after what was historically considered the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs annually from June 1 to Nov. 30 and has in the past become most active around Sept. 10.",
      "Officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration initially predicted the 2025 season would be busier than usual and produce more named storms than an average year, but hurricane activity has so far been quieter than anticipated.",
      "At the start of the season, NOAA's outlook suggested that between 13 and 19 named storms would form in the Atlantic, with as many as nine strengthening into hurricanes and as many as five becoming Category 5 storms, which are the most powerful. The agency revised the outlook slightly in August, predicting that the season would see 13 to 18 named storms, including five to nine hurricanes, two of which could be major.",
      "Of the six named tropical storms that have developed this year before Gabrielle, only one, Chantal, made landfall.",

      "\"As a bio major, you have to take a lot of hard science classes, math classes,\" Croll told CBS News. \"So, there's going to be struggles along the way that, you know, I'm not going to be able to access a tutor all the time. So I think AI will be a little helpful in that.\"",
      "The goal of the initiative, AI Fluency, is that students, beginning with the class of 2029, will graduate and be fluent in both their major and AI.",
      "\"I hope that they learn how to use it effectively for, you know, brainstorming, for organizing thoughts, but they don't replace, sort of, their critical thought with it,\" said Kevin Richards, an assistant language professor at OSU.",

      "OSU is hoping that threading AI into its curriculum will help its students' resumes stand out. Baldwin is tentatively optimistic it will give her an advantage when she enters the workforce.",
      "\"There's a lot I didn't know about before taking this class,\" Baldwin said. \"And if there's other college students that haven't been offered a class like this, and haven't been told about these new AI tools, then maybe have a leg up in that sense.\"",

    "story": [
      "Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old accused of assassinating conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Utah, was afraid of being shot by police and ultimately agreed to a peaceful surrender with the help of his family, a sheriff in Utah said.",
      "Robinson was \"truly fearful of being shot by law enforcement,\" as well as fearful of a SWAT team hit on his house, Washington County Sheriff Nate Brooksby said Wednesday during a brief news conference. Brooksby also recounted how a friend and former deputy called him on Thursday, the day after Robinson\u00a0allegedly shot and killed\u00a0Kirk at Utah Valley University in Utah County, to tell him who Kirk's alleged shooter was.",
      "Brooksby described the phone call he had with his friend, the events that led to Robinson's arrest, and how his department, along with Robinson's family, convinced the suspect to surrender. The sheriff also dispelled certain false reports that had been spreading online.",
      "\"I received a call from a friend of mine who happens to be a retired detective that worked for me for many years,\" Brooksby said. \"He said, 'Hey, I know who Charlie Kirk's shooter is. I know the family through religious association and he's in Washington County now, and we're working on trying to get him to come in voluntarily.'\"",
      "Brooksby said he then called the Utah County Sheriff to alert the lead investigators. \"He was shocked as I was to hear the news,\" he said. Their brief call lasted 40 seconds.",
      "The sheriff said Robinson knew it was \"just inevitable\" that he was going to get caught after his pictures and the gun he allegedly used were reported in the news.",
      "Brooksby said Robinson agreed to come in only under conditions that avoided a heavily armed raid.",
      "\"He didn't want a big SWAT team hitting his parents' house or his apartment. He was truly fearful of being shot by law enforcement,\" Brooksby said. \"So the conditions were as relaxed and comfortable and almost to the point of inviting. And if at the end of the day we accomplish him surrendering peacefully on his own, I'm going to make some concessions to make that happen.\"",
      "Robinson was driven by the retired detective and his parents to the Washington County Sheriff's Office shortly before 9 p.m. on Thursday, Brooksby said. He was greeted by plainclothes detectives and placed in a secure interview room, and given water while authorities waited for state and federal investigators to arrive.",
      "\"He was sitting on a very comfortable couch with a water bottle in his hand, not restrained.\" Brooksby said, describing Robinson's demeanor as \"quiet and sober.\"",
      "The sheriff credited his former colleague for using community ties to defuse a tense situation.",
      "\"He deserves whole credit,\" Brooksby said. \"Tyler's family trusted this individual. They knew he was involved in law enforcement at some point and enough community involvement there that they trusted that we could facilitate a peaceful, calm, relaxed surrender.\"",
      "Addressing a few allegations that spread on social media, the sheriff said Robinson's father was not the former police officer who turned in the suspect, adding that his friend had received threats because of those false social media posts.",
      "Two federal law enforcement sources confirmed to CBS News that Robinson's father saw the photos released by authorities and confronted his son. Robinson admitted to being the person in the photos and said he would rather die by suicide than turn himself in, prompting his father to call a youth pastor close to the family, the sources said.",
      "Authorities said Robinson had allegedly\u00a0confessed to the killing in text exchanges with his roommate. A spokesperson for Discord\u00a0also confirmed\u00a0to CBS News on Monday that Robinson appeared to admit to committing the shooting in messages posted to the social media platform last week.",
      "Robinson was charged Tuesday with aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm, two counts of obstruction of justice, two counts of witness tampering, and committing a violent offense in the presence of a child.",

If you are receiving this video, it means that I did not make it back on this trip, and I was defeated by my mortal enemy, the woke mind virus at Utah Valley University, where Charlie Kirk was assassinated.\"",
      "\"I hope by seeing this video, you all can understand what made me perform such actions, and can view me as the hero that I know I am. I would like to request a gold statue be erected in place of Mario the Dragon, on the crossing of Market and I think 31st Street, in Philadelphia Pennsylvania. Thank you all,\" Rogers continued.",

      "When detectives asked Rogers about the video, he allegedly admitted to making it and said it was \"posted as a joke on an unlisted YouTube video and sent to 12-15 people,\" according to the affidavit. It further notes that Rogers \"admitted to leaning to the left but did not claim any particular party,\" and said he used the word \"woke\" as \"a vague idea.\"",
      "Several agencies were under alert for a possible violent attack at the UVU campus, according to the affidavit, which found probable cause to charge Rogers with making a threat of terrorism, causing an emergency agency to act.",
      "\"Blake posted a threat involving bodily injury, death, or substantial property damage and he caused an official or volunteer agency organized to deal with emergencies to take action due to the actor's conduct posing a serious and substantial risk to the general public,\" it said.",
      "A magistrate judge ruled he can post $1,000 bail, according to court papers. Rogers has no prior violent offenses, according to the Public Safety Assessment Report.",
      "\"We do at this time believe that this was an isolated incident. There's no indication that there were any other individuals involved,\" said Talbot.",

    "summary": "Hegseth and each service secretary said posts mocking or celebrating the assassination of Charlie Kirk are unacceptable.",
    "story": [
      "The Pentagon has been looking through dozens of social media posts that appear to come from U.S. service members in the wake of conservative political activist Charlie Kirk's assassination, brought to the military's attention through various means. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has publicly warned against any commentary mocking or praising his killing.",
      "In a post on X, he said of anti-Kirk posts, \"We are tracking all these very closely \u2014 and will address, immediately. Completely unacceptable.\"",
      "Already, at least one Marine officer has been pulled from recruiting duties pending an investigation into his post, and five Army officers and an Army reserve officer have been suspended while their social media posts are under review, service officials said.",
      "It's unclear how many service members across the military branches are being investigated over remarks related to Kirk. Some service members have been targeted online for even quoting statements Kirk made in the past.",
      "Current and former service members, some congressional members, including GOP Rep. Derrick Van Orden of Wisconsin, and social media accounts like the far right Libs of TikTok, which has over 4 million followers on X, and Mostly Peaceful Memes, have been publicly flagging posts and tagging the Defense Department for review since last week.",
      "But defense officials said consequences would vary, depending not only on the substance of the comments but also on whether the author is a civilian employee or a uniformed service member. While civilians retain broad free speech protections, service members operate under tighter limits governed by service directives and Uniform Code of Military Justice.",
      "For instance, service members could face disciplinary measures for violating Article 92 of the code, which simply requires them to follow regulations, or Article 134, which prohibits conduct discrediting the armed forces.",
      "\"It's very easy to frame commentary \u2014 even somewhat benign commentary \u2014 about Charlie Kirk as somehow a violation of the UCMJ,\" said Dan Maurer, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and former military prosecutor who now focuses on national security and criminal law at Ohio Northern University's College of Law.",
      "Maurer told CBS News,\"The way that those laws are so broadly written, and given the reaction from the secretary of defense and from the president about people who comment at all about Charlie Kirk, it's entirely foreseeable that it will be at least threatened to be used.\"",
      "But proving a service member violated the UCMJ in a court martial could be challenging. Prosecutors, Maurer said, would have to show the posts are inciting violence or would be prejudicial to good order and discipline.",
      "In a 2008 case involving an Army soldier, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, the highest appellate court in the nation's military justice system, found that a soldier expressing white supremacist views online was not a violation of Article 134, even under the \"less protective First Amendment right afforded to servicemembers, and despite the offensive nature of [the solder's] views and communications.\"",
      "The court found that for speech to be prejudiced against good order and discipline, it had to have a \"direct and palpable effect on the military mission or environment.\" The court said the speech in the 2008 case was different from other cases because it was not directed at military members, his unit, or an expression of military policy and there was no impact on \"good order and discipline,\" and it was not \"service discrediting.\"",
      "There are also non-judicial ways to discipline troops, like letters of reprimand that could affect career advancement, or result in loss of pay or rank.",
      "When asked how many service members are under investigation, the Pentagon on Monday referred CBS News to each of the service branches.",
      "\"We will not tolerate military or civilian personnel who celebrate or mock the assassination of a fellow American,\" chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement.",
      "\"Those in our ranks who rejoice at an act of domestic terrorism are unfit to serve the American people at the Department of War.\"",
      "Army Secretary Dan Driscoll told reporters on Wednesday he didn't have an estimate for how many posts are under review.",
      "\"On a one-by-one basis, the Army is taking those very seriously and the command and the units are looking into each specific instance of that, and they'll take appropriate action,\" Driscoll said.",

      "The other two service secretaries, Navy Secretary John Phelan and Air Force Secretary Troy E. Meink, similarly posted last week on X about content related to Kirk.",

    "summary": "The Federal Reserve is cutting its benchmark interest rate as the U.S. economy faces headwinds, including a faltering labor market.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points \u2014 its first cut since December \u2014 as the U.S. grapples with a stalling labor market and slower economic growth.",
      "The Fed cut reduces the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to between 4% and 4.25%, down from its prior range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The last time the central bank eased borrowing costs was in December 2024, when it also trimmed rates by a quarter of a percentage point.",
      "Federal Reserve officials are also penciling in two more rate cuts in 2025, but only one in 2026, according to the central bank's summary of economic projections. That may disappoint Wall Street, with investors before the meeting projecting a total of five cuts over the rest of the year and 2026.",
      "According to those median\u00a0projections, Fed officials expect the nation's unemployment rate, currently 4.3%, to reach 4.5% by year-end before ticking down to 4.4% in 2026 and 4.3% the following year.",
      "Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) \u2014 the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation \u2014 is forecast to level off at 3% this year, well above the central bank's 2% annual target, before receding to 2.6% next year and 2.1% in 2027. The median projections for core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, forecast PCE of 3.1% this year.",
      "The move comes as the Fed contends with a two-fold economic challenge: curbing inflation, which has flared in recent months, while supporting job growth, which has slumped. The Fed typically seeks to tame inflation by nudging up interest rates to slow economic growth, while cutting rates in periods when the economy is faltering to encourage consumer spending and business investment.",
      "\"In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen,\" Powell said in a press conference following the Fed's two-day meeting.",
      "He added that recent labor data shows that what he termed \"people at the margins,\" which he said include recent college grads, are now having a harder time finding employment.",
      "\"The overall job-finding rate is very, very low, but the layoff rate is also very low,\" Powell noted. \"The concern is that if you start to see layoffs, the people who are laid off, there won't be a lot of hiring going on.\"",
      "In acting to lower interest rates, the Fed is signaling that it views the slowing labor market as a more pressing concern than rising prices, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell underlined at his\u00a0Jackson Hole address\u00a0last month in Wyoming.",
      "\"Concerns for the labor market's health are rising,\" said Cory Stahle, economist in the Indeed Hiring Lab, in a statement after the Fed's decision. \"Unemployment and layoffs are relatively stable at historically low levels, which is encouraging, but they are unlikely to stay that way if labor market conditions deteriorate further.\"",
      "At the same time, Powell said the Fed now views the pass-through of the Trump administration's tariff as being \"smaller and slower\" than central bank officials had expected earlier this year. \"We continue to expect [inflation] to move up, maybe not as much as we would have a few months ago,\" he said.",
      "The rate cut comes amid intense political pressure on the Fed, with President Trump repeatedly accusing Powell of moving too slowly to ease borrowing costs and shore up economic activity.",
      "Mr. Trump is also seeking to put his imprint on the Fed. To that end, he has\u00a0sought to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook from her seat on the central bank's board, alleging that she engaged in mortgage fraud. She has denied committing fraud and challenged Mr. Trump's authority to fire her, with an appeals court ruling Monday that Cook can keep her job.",
      "One vote for a jumbo cut",
      "An economic adviser to Mr. Trump, Stephen Miran, was\u00a0confirmed by the Senate\u00a0on Monday to take an open spot on the Fed's Board of Governors. He will also sit on the 12-member Federal Open Markets Committee, or FOMC, which sets interest rates for the Fed.",
      "\"Stephen Miran was a last-minute addition to the FOMC, but his vote won't drastically alter the outcome. He joined too late to submit an economic projection and path for monetary policy,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a report this week ahead of the Fed's rate cut.",
      "All of the voting FOMC members except one \u2014 Miran \u2014 voted in favor of the quarter-point cut, according to the central bank's statement. Miran voted for a larger cut of 0.50 percentage points, the Fed noted.",
      "A key question for consumers and businesses is whether the Fed trimming borrowing costs for the first time in nearly a year augurs additional cuts in 2025 and heading into 2026. Fed officials have two more meetings this year, set for October and December.",
      "Although the FOMC members were largely united on the size of today's cut, their projections of future cuts show a difference of opinion about the path of monetary policy moving forward. Many of the group's members don't expect the panel to make any more cuts this year, according to the summary of economic projections.",
      "\"That median hides the deep split on the FOMC \u2013\u2013 nine of 19 members don't anticipate further cuts this year,\" Michael Pearce, deputy chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a report.",
      "Powell noted that a quarter-point cut isn't likely to make a huge difference to the economy, but added, \"You have to look at the path\" of future cuts expected later this year and in 2026. \"It starts with a 25 basis point cut \u2014 it's not just one action,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "A dive team has identified a shipwreck off the coast of Nantucket as a World War I-era fishing boat that sank nearly 100 years ago with more than 20 men aboard.",
      "The ST Seiner was last seen in January 1929, according to a news release from the Atlantic Wreck Salvage, a company that searches for lost wrecks. The 139-foot ship, built in 1921, set sail from New London, Connecticut, on Jan. 9. The ship's captain made his last daily report to the Portland Trawling Company on Jan. 18. The next day, no report was made. The ship was set to arrive in port on Jan. 22, but never did, according to the news release. The news release did not say which port the ship was headed to.",
      "The Seiner was believed to have foundered and sank in a storm, the news release said. There were 21 men, including the captain, aboard when the ship went down. The men were from Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York and Newfoundland, Canada.",
      "The Portland Trawling Company and the U.S. Coast Guard mounted a search and rescue mission at the time, but no survivors were found. Previous attempts to search for the wreck in the 1990s failed because of the location of the wreck site.",
      "In 2022, a team used Atlantic Wreck Salvage's search vessel D/V Tenacious to discover the wreck site on Georges Bank, about 125 miles off the coast of Nantucket. The wreck site was about 200 feet underwater, the company said. Time and weather conditions meant the team members could not dive down to the wreckage. The shipwreck was not identified at the time.",
      "In July 2025, the team returned to the site and made a total of seven dives over two days. The team was able to identify the wreck as that of the Seiner.",
      "The ship had a number of distinctive features, including a double drum trawl winch and a raised forecastle deck, which helped divers confirm its identity, the news release said. Divers also took note of the ship's steam engine and boiler. Photos taken by the dive team show the ship's unique features.",
      "Sonar scans confirmed that the sunken vessel's length and beam matched that of the Seiner.",
      "\"No other steel or iron hull steam trawlers of this size are known to have sunk on Georges Bank,\" said Captain Eric Takakjian, one of the leaders of the expedition, in the news release.",
      "Jennifer Sellitti, the managing member of Atlantic Wreck Salvage, said that the discovery is \"bittersweet.\" The company said that the descendants of the men lost aboard the ship are encouraged to reach out to them.",
      "\"While the team celebrates this important historical find, we are mindful of the loss endured by the families, colleagues, and loved one of those who went down with the ship,\" Sellitti said. \"We hope this discovery can provide some measure of closure to the descendants of those who perished.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 17 Sep 2025 15:36:24 -0400",
    "summary": "Several factors are driving up home insurance premiums across the U.S. to record highs.",
    "story": [
      "Homeowners insurance rates are rising across the U.S., driven by climate change, rising cost of building materials and surging home prices.",
      "Almost half of property insurance policy holders in the U.S. said their premiums rose over the past year, the highest rate of increases in more than a decade, according to a\u00a0study\u00a0this week from data analytics company J.D. Power.",
      "Average homeowners insurance costs have risen nearly 70% over the past five years, according\u00a0to data from ICE Mortgage Technology. On average, single-family homeowners with a mortgage now pay $2,370 a year for their property policy. In 2025, homeowners insurance costs rose have risen most sharply in California, where premiums in Los Angeles were up 19.5% compared to a year ago, according to the loan analytics firm.",
      "Soaring homeowners insurance rates are leading some Americans to switch insurers, or do without coverage altogether \u2014 a risky step that can prove financially ruinous and that experts strongly discourage.",
      "\"All things being equal, if you raise prices customers aren't happy,\" J.D. Power managing director Craig Martin told CBS MoneyWatch. \"As premiums increase, it starts to impact how people perceive insurance, and they start to wonder if their insurer cares about them or their profits.\"",
      "Property insurance premiums vary by geography, and are typically higher in places where residents are more vulnerable to disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires that scientists link to climate change, according to insurance experts.",
      "\"The price of insurance is increasing as the level of risk increases,\" said Sean Kevelighan, CEO of the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group that provides information to consumers. \"We are beginning to see some trends of Americans making tougher decisions about their insurance.\"",
      "According to a recent Realtor.com survey of homeowners, nearly 60% of respondents said they might forgo purchasing property coverage if it becomes too expensive.",
      "\"Households are feeling squeezed, and more are considering going without home insurance altogether,\" Realtor.com economic data analyst Hannah Jones told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "What's behind rising premiums?",
      "Several factors have led to the surge in property insurance costs:\u00a0higher home values, mounting climate-related risks, and the higher cost of lumber, steel and other building materials, insurance experts said. In June, the median home sale price in the U.S. hit a record high of nearly $400,000, according to online real estate firm Redfin.",
      "\"We've seen costs related to construction materials rise, and the price of insurance is a reflection of risk, plus the cost to pay a claim,\" Kevelighan said.",
      "\"It's a double whammy,\" Jones added. \"If your home is worth more, it costs more to insure, and also your home is more at risk, so you stand to lose more if you go without insurance.\"",
      "\"We don't recommend going without insurance because it leaves you extremely exposed in case you do suffer property damage, or a complete loss of property,\" she said.",
      "However, homeowners do have alternatives when it comes to choosing an insurer, while there are steps they can take to try to minimize their coverage costs.",
      "\"A few of these things are under people's control,\" NerdWallet homeowners insurance expert Holden Lewis told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you are in a place where there are a lot of wildfires, you can change your landscaping so you don't have flammable materials, for example.\"",
      "A home that's perceived as less vulnerable is less costly to insure, he explained.",
      "\"In storm-vulnerable areas, having storm shutters and tie-downs to keep your roof from blowing off can reduce your premiums,\" he added.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. government is adding more questions to the civics test that applicants need to pass to become American citizens, the latest step by the Trump administration to tighten the legal immigration process.",
      "The move will reinstate a 2020 test from the first Trump administration that had been scrapped by the Biden administration, which argued the additional questions created unnecessary barriers for legal immigrants seeking to become citizens.",
      "Among other requirements, legal immigrants applying to become U.S. citizens must demonstrate they have lived in the U.S. as lawful permanent residents for at least 3 or 5 years, depending on their case; that they can read, write and speak English; and that they have a basic understanding of America's history and political system.",
      "The civics test has long been administered to assess the last requirement. Under the new version of the test, applicants will need to study 128 questions about U.S. history and politics, and answer 12 out of 20 of those questions correctly. Previously, under a test dating back to 2008, citizenship applicants had to study a pool of 100 questions and answer 6 out of 10 questions correctly.",
      "The test is administered orally, and the questions are not multiple choice. Most have several acceptable answers. Those who fail the test get a second chance to pass. If they fail again, their citizenship application is denied. Those 65 or older who have been in the U.S. as permanent residents for 20 or more years only have to study a pool of 20 questions, and can take the citizenship test in their preferred language.",
      "The new test will apply to those who file citizenship applications after mid-October, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the federal agency that adjudicates requests from prospective citizens.",
      "Some of the new questions deal with the 10th Amendment, the Federalist Papers, former President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Founding Fathers Alexander Hamilton and James Madison and examples of American innovation.",
      "In recent weeks, the Trump administration has announced other measures to more heavily scrutinize those applying for U.S. citizenship, including by expanding the factors considered when determining whether applicants have \"good moral character,\" another requirement to become an American citizen.",
      "It has also reinstated a long-dormant practice, known as \"neighborhood checks,\" that entails sending government investigators to interview the neighbors and co-workers of applicants to assess their eligibility for American citizenship.",
      "Matthew Tragesser, a spokesman for USCIS, said the reinstatement of the 2020 civics test would help ensure that those allowed to become citizens \"are fully assimilated and will contribute to America's greatness.\" He said the move was the \"first of many\" changes.",
      "\"American citizenship is the most sacred citizenship in the world and should only be reserved for aliens who will fully embrace our values and principles as a nation,\" Tragesser added.",

      "In the forests of Uganda and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, chimps crowd into fig and plum trees, feasting on fruit that's sweet, soft and just a little boozy. A new study shows those daily snacks quietly add up to the equivalent of nearly two alcoholic beverages for humans.",
      "A team of scientists at University of California Berkeley and other institutions tested the fruit chimps actually snack on: figs in Uganda's canopy and the plum-like fruits on the forest floor in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Collecting the data wasn't easy \u2014 with little electricity beyond solar panels and constant humidity threatening the instruments, researchers spent three seasons hauling equipment and calibrating test kits to measure alcohol in many different tropical fruits.",
      "In the end, they found that on average, the fruit's alcohol content came in at about .3% by weight. This is kombucha-level, but when chimpanzees eat 10 pounds of fruit a day and weigh around 90 pounds, it adds up to about 14 grams of ethanol, equating to about two cocktails for a human.",
      "But don't picture chimps swinging drunkenly from the trees. To actually get drunk, they'd have to binge on fruit until their bellies ballooned, the researchers said. Instead, they're exposed to a steady low dose, a quiet buzz from nature's own fermentation process.",
      "Senior author of the paper and UC Berkeley professor of integrative biology Robert Dudley first floated the \"drunken monkey\" hypothesis in 2000, arguing that our attraction to alcohol could come from ancestral fruit-eating habits. Dudley argued that it makes sense primates would be tuned to alcohol, since their diets have long revolved around ripe fruit.",
      "\"Once you start eating, it acts as an aperitif,\" he said. \"The pleasure of association with drinking alcohol increases feeding rates.\"",
      "Other animals chase the same buzz too.",
      "\"Open a bottle of beer outside and a fruit fly appears almost instantly,\" Dudley said.",
      "Spider monkeys in Panama, slow lorises in Malaysia and even elephants have been documented consuming naturally fermented fruit or nectar.",
      "What makes this study different is that it provides the first direct chemical measurements of ethanol in the fruits that wild chimps routinely eat, and then connects those numbers to daily intake.",
      "The open question is whether chimps are actually selecting fruit for its alcohol content or just chasing sugar and calories. Either way, Dudley says the story connects to us.",
      "\"We inherited the taste for alcohol,\" Dudley said. \"Even though our diets have diversified \u2026 that bias to consume quickly when this molecule is present could still be a powerful force.\"",

    "story": [
      "Thousands of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia amid the country's ongoing invasion are being forcibly \"reeducated\" in at least 210 facilities around Russia and Russian-occupied Ukraine, according to a study published Tuesday by the Yale School of Public Health's Humanitarian Research Lab.",
      "The researchers say that Ukrainian children in the eastern regions occupied by Russia since its full-scale invasion began in February 2022 have been sent to the facilities where, \"in many cases, (they) are placed in programs of forced militarization that include, though are not limited to, combat and paratrooper training.\"",
      "\"Children at some facilities have been engaged in the production of military equipment for Russia's armed forces, including drones,\" the Yale study said.",
      "The researchers said their conclusions were based on \"publicly available data sources and commercially available satellite imagery,\" and that the analysts \"evaluated each data source for reliability, veracity, and credibility using assessment criteria derived from the Berkeley Protocol\" for open-source research, and an intelligence assessment framework used by NATO.",
      "The Yale researchers do not provide an estimate of the total number of children abducted by Russia. They note that while some have been returned, \"other groups of children have been held indefinitely. In some cases, children who have entered this network of camps, so-called family centers, and other facilities have entered Russia's program of coerced fostering and adoption, eventually being placed with families in Russia and becoming naturalized citizens of the Russian Federation.\"",
      "The report details at least eight different types of facilities to which Ukrainian children have been taken, including summer camps, mental health institutions, at least one military base and even a monastery. It said the objective for Russian authorities is to indoctrinate the Ukrainian children with pro-Russian, anti-Ukrainian cultural and patriotic narratives.",
      "Ukraine's state-run \"Bring Kids Back\" program, launched by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, says more than 19,500 Ukrainian children have been abducted since Russia's invasion began. It says only about 1,600 have been returned, including 101 who were bought back in August.",
      "In March 2023, the U.N.'s International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin, accusing him of committing \"the war crime of unlawful deportation of population (children) and that of unlawful transfer of population (children) from occupied areas of Ukraine to the Russian Federation.\"",
      "The court also issued an arrest warrant for Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, the commissioner for children's rights in the Office of the President, accusing her of committing the same crimes.",
      "Zelenskyy said last week that he would raise the issue of abducted Ukrainian children during the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York next week. He said he would host the event along with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, and that \"many leaders will join us.\"",
      "In August, after meeting with Zelenskyy and European leaders in Washington, President Trump said in a social media post that he and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had discussed \"the massive Worldwide problem of missing children,\" with a goal of \"bringing them home to their families.\"",
      "Von der Leyen, in her own post, thanked Mr. Trump, and added that \"every single Ukrainian child abducted by Russia must be returned to their families.\"",
      "Mr. Trump didn't mention Russia specifically in his own remarks. First lady Melania Trump, several days before the White House meetings, had penned an open letter to Putin pleading with the Russian leader to protect \"the innocence of these children,\" though not specifying which children she was referring to.",
      "Mr. Trump handed that letter to Putin in person when the two men met in Alaska last month, according to The Wall Street Journal.",
      "Russia's state-run media did not indicate any response from the Kremlin to the allegations made in the Yale lab's report. The Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C., didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from CBS News.",
      "Two years ago, in a report published during the Biden administration that was titled \"The Kremlin's War Against Ukraine's Children,\" the State Department noted the ICC arrest warrants, and said Russia's response included \"threats of nuclear strikes, false claims about Western 'experiments on children' and anti-Russian 'hysteria,'\" as well as \"calls for the arrest of ICC judges, and claims that Ukraine's children were taken away 'for their safety.'\"",
      "Putin's government \"appears determined to erase Ukraine's existence as a state by attempting to rob it of its future,\" the Biden-era State Department report said, adding that \"mounting evidence shows Russia uses forcible relocation, re-education, and, in some cases, adoption of Ukraine's children as key components of its systematic efforts to suppress Ukraine's identity, history, and culture.\"",
      "In response to CBS News questions about the Yale study, a State Department spokesperson said President Trump and first lady Melania Trump had \"repeatedly called for the safe return of Ukrainian children home to their families.\"",
      "The spokesperson said Mr. Trump's special envoy to Ukraine, Gen. Keith Kellogg, and and his deputy were working to advance that \"goal along with the President's aim to stop the killing in Ukraine,\" adding that the envoys \"have met with a variety of groups and individuals in that effort.\"",

      "\"These labs in two different countries reached the same conclusion: Alexei was killed. More specifically, he was poisoned,\" Navalnaya said in the video, which was posted on social media.

She did not provide direct proof that Navalny had been poisoned or that it had been carried out by prison authorities.",

      "Navalnaya disputed Russian officials' version of events and said her husband exhibited no instances of heart disease while alive.",
      "Navalny previously suffered from another poisoning in 2020, when the opposition leader fell sick on an internal flight in Russia. He was flown to Berlin while still in a coma for treatment two days later. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established that he was exposed to the Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent.",

    "summary": "Christian Brueckner, who prosecutors believe abducted British toddler Madeleine McCann, has been released from prison after serving a sentence in an unrelated rape case.",
    "story": [
      "Christian Brueckner, the convicted rapist identified by German prosecutors as the prime suspect in the 2007 disappearance of British toddler Madeleine McCann in Portugal, was released from prison in northern Germany on Wednesday after serving his sentence in an unrelated rape case.",
      "Shortly after 9 a.m. local time, Brueckner was driven out of the Sehnde prison in a black Audi, accompanied by his lawyer and a police escort. Police confirmed that he had left the facility but said they did not know where he was going.",
      "Brueckner, 48, just completed a seven-year prison sentence for the 2005 rape of a 72-year-old American woman in Portugal. Upon his release, he was fitted with an electronic ankle tag, a condition imposed to enable authorities to monitor his movements. His lawyers have declined to say where he will live.",
      "German prosecutors have said they believe Brueckner is responsible for McCann's disappearance from her family's vacation rental home in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz, citing evidence including cell phone data that placed him near the resort at the time. McCann was 3 years old at the time.",
      "Brueckner, who lived for years in Portugal's southern Algarve region, where Praia da Luz is located, has multiple prior convictions for sexual offenses, including against children, and a long record of petty crimes. Despite the circumstantial evidence, however, he has never been charged in relation to the McCann case and has always denied any involvement in her disappearance.",
      "To many observers, the case has highlighted significant differences between the legal systems in Germany and the U.K.",
      "Mark Stephens, a consultant at the British legal firm Howard Kennedy, told CBS News the legal thresholds differ between the countries.",
      "\"In the U.K. and the U.S., you need to believe there's better than a 50% chance of a successful prosecution before charges are brought. Circumstantial evidence can be used. The law recognizes that you won't always have key evidence. In a rape case, for example, you need some kind of corroboration, some supporting evidence. But in a murder case, that's the exception \u2014 you don't need that. So, you could prosecute if you thought the circumstantial evidence was sufficient.\"",
      "In Germany, however, he said the legal system sets a much higher threshold for prosecution.",
      "\"The prosecutors' statement says they haven't gathered enough direct evidence to charge him,\" said Stephens. \"That's because under German rules, circumstantial and inferential evidence isn't admissible in the same way.\"",
      "Madeleine's disappearance remains one of the most high-profile unsolved cases in the world, and even after his release, Brueckner will likely remain at the center of the inquiry, as he's been since German prosecutors publicly\u00a0identified him as a suspect\u00a0in 2020.",
      "British investigators had hoped to question Brueckner just days before his release in Germany, to clarify key details about his movements in Praia da Luz around the time that McCann vanished. The London Metropolitan Police submitted a formal request for an interview with him, but Brueckner declined to speak with the investigators earlier this week.",

    "story": [
      "An independent panel of experts commissioned by the United Nations Human Rights Council has concluded \"on reasonable grounds that the Israeli authorities and Israeli security forces have committed and are continuing to commit\" acts of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "In its report published Tuesday, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel \u2014 which was established by the HRC in 2021 \u2014 said it had collected and analyzed evidence in relation to alleged human rights violations committed by all parties in the Israel-Hamas war, which Israel launched in response to the Hamas-orchestrated Oct. 7, 2023 terror attack.",
      "\"Today, we witness in real time how the promise of 'never again' is broken and tested in the eyes of the world. The ongoing genocide in Gaza is a moral outrage and a legal emergency,\" Navi Pillay, Chair of the Commission, said at a Tuesday news briefing. \"There is no need to wait for the International Court of Justice to declare it a genocide. All states are obligated to use whatever means within its (their) power to prevent the commission of genocide. And so we urge member states to ensure accountability for any crimes that have been committed and prevent further crimes from being committed, not just in Gaza, but the entire occupied Palestinian territory.\"",
      "Israeli's Foreign Minister Gideon Saar called the report \"fake.\"",
      "\"The report relies entirely on Hamas falsehoods, laundered and repeated by others,\" Saar said, echoing the language used in past Israeli government statements responding to accusations it is committing genocide. \"In stark contrast to the lies in the report, Hamas is the party that attempted genocide in Israel \u2014 murdering 1,200 people, raping women, burning families alive, and openly declaring its goal of killing every Jew.\"",
      "Genocide is defined under international law as the commission of certain acts against a group \"with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.\"",
      "Those acts include \"causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group,\" and \"forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.\"",
      "In its report, the commission said it found that Israeli authorities and security forces, \"have committed and are continuing to commit the following actus reus of genocide against the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, namely (i) killing members of the group; (ii) causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (iii) deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; and (iv) imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group.\"",
      "The commission also said statements made by Israeli authorities have demonstrated \"direct evidence of genocidal intent,\" and that, alongside circumstantial evidence of similar intent, \"the Israeli authorities and Israeli security forces have had and continue to have the genocidal intent to destroy, in whole or in part, the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.\"",
      "Based on its analysis, the commission said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Isaac Herzog and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant had, \"incited the commission of genocide and that Israeli authorities have failed to take action against them to punish the incitement.\"",
      "\"The Commission concludes that the State of Israel bears responsibility for the failure to prevent genocide, the comission of genocide and the failure to punish genocide against the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip,\" the report said.",
      "\"The commission has not fully assessed statements by other Israeli political and military leaders, including Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir and Minister of Finance Bezalel Smotrich, and considers that they too should be assessed to determine whether they constitute incitement to commit genocide,\" the commission added.",
      "The report said Israel should \"immediately end the commission of genocide in the Gaza Strip\" and implement a permanent ceasefire, allowing the free flow of humanitarian aid into the Palestinian territory. It also called on other U.N. member states to \"employ all means reasonably available to them to prevent the commission of genocide in the Gaza Strip,\" including stopping the transfer of arms and other equipment to Israel.",
      "A number of scholars and international and Israeli human rights groups had previously accused Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "In August, the International Association of Genocide Scholars \u2014 a group of academics specializing in the subject \u2014\u00a0declared in a resolution that Israel's actions in Gaza since the 22-month war began constitute genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. The group has in turn faced heavy criticism from Israeli officials and Jewish groups about the way they operate and acquire members, though they have since suspended their membership system in response to what they call a \"campaign of spam and harassment.\"",
      "In July, Israeli rights group B'Tselem and the Physicians for Human Rights organization accused Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "The International Court of Justice is also hearing a case, brought by South Africa's government, that accuses Israeli forces of committing genocide.",

    "summary": "The ongoing fallout over Epstein is likely to follow Trump on his formal state visit to the U.K., which just lost its ambassador in D.C. to the scandal.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0President Trump arrived in London on Tuesday for a historic second official state visit to the U.K., and he can look forward to the pomp and pageantry of a formal state dinner at Windsor Castle on Wednesday evening, hosted by King Charles III.",
      "But the timing of his visit is potentially awkward for Mr. Trump and his host, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and will likely bring more unwanted questions for the U.S. leader, coming immediately on the heels of the Starmer's decision to fire his ambassador in Washington, Peter Mandelson, in response to new revelations about his past friendship with the late convicted sex offender .",
      "Trump to get an unprecedented second royal reception",
      "In the early weeks of Mr. Trump's second term, Starmer had an ace in the hole to gain some favor as he arrived for a visit at the White House. Starmer came armed with a royal invitation from King Charles for an unprecedented second official state visit.",
      "It was seen as a savvy diplomatic move, with Starmer recognizing Mr. Trump's admiration for the British monarchy and royal family.",
      "\"My relationship is very good with the U.K. and King Charles is my friend. This is the first time this has ever happened, to be honored twice,\" Mr. Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews before his departure on Tuesday.",
      "The president is set to be greeted Wednesday with the full pomp, regalia and public spectacle offered by the U.K.'s royals. When they arrive Wednesday in Windsor, just west of London, Mr. Trump and first lady Melania will be taken by royal carriage, alongside King Charles, Queen Camilla and the Prince and Princess of Wales, to Windsor Castle, escorted by three different military bands and a regiment of the British Army on horseback.",
      "Events on the day will include a flypast by British and American F-35 fighter jets, as well as other Royal Air Force planes, all capped by a state banquet at the castle in the evening.",
      "\"I hate to say it, but nobody does it like you people in terms of the pomp and the ceremony,\" Mr. Trump told Starmer at a joint news conference during a visit to one of his golf courses in Scotland in July.",
      "The second official state visit for Mr. Trump is a rarity in modern times. Historically, second-term U.S. presidents have not been offered new full state visits, and have instead generally been invited for tea or lunch with the monarch at Windsor Castle.",
      "\"Ultimately, it's happening because, you know, the royal family \u2014 no pun intended \u2014 is the biggest trump card this government can play at big moments of international statesmanship and diplomacy,\" Roya Nikkhah, the royal editor for the Sunday Times newspaper, told CBS News ahead of Mr. Trump's arrival. \"There's a lot in it for us and our government in terms of national interest, and President Trump will get all those images that he desperately wants to have again.\"",
      "Growing divisions in the United Kingdom",
      "While Mr. Trump is briefly leaving behind a United States still rattled by the assassination of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk last week, he's touching down in a nation facing its own political divisions.",
      "Mr. Trump's visit comes as Starmer faces the most significant political headwinds of his one-year premiership. His government has come under mounting pressure from an ascendant right-wing political movement at home, against a backdrop of growing polarization in Britain. Powerful outside voices, including tech billionaire and former close Trump ally Elon Musk, have been accused of stoking these divisions",
      "A demonstration in London organized by far-right, anti-immigration activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, drew more than 110,000 people on Saturday, billed as a rally to \"Unite the Kingdom\" and for free speech. Musk himself addressed the rally by video-link. Eight people were arrested, and a small number of Robinson supporters clashed with police officers who were keeping them apart from counterprotesters.",
      "As CBS News' Haley Ott reported from the protest on Saturday, among the Union Jacks and England flags carried by many members of the crowd, there were also MAGA hats and American flags.",
      "\"Britain is a nation proudly built on tolerance, diversity and respect. Our flag represents our diverse country and we will never surrender it to those that use it as a symbol of violence, fear and division,\" Starmer said in a social media post on Sunday, rebuking some of the behavior seen at the march.",
      "There has also been much criticism of the rhetoric employed by Musk when he addressed the weekend demonstration.",
      "\"Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die,\" the billionaire, who has been a vocal critic of Starmer since he took office in July 2024, told the crowd.",
      "While Mr. Trump may no longer be on friendly terms with Musk, his administration is ideologically aligned with the two central themes of Saturday's demonstration in London: advocating for free speech and an aggressively nationalist immigration policy.",
      "That could make discussions with Mr. Trump diplomatically challenging for Starmer to navigate when they meet later this week.",
      "U.K. ambassador's dismissal over Epstein badly timed for Starmer and Trump",
      "The man who would have had a key role in the organization of the president's state visit is no longer in his post. Peter Mandelson was fired by Starmer as British Ambassador to the United States last week after new details emerged of his ties to Epstein. That also helped put the issue and questions around Mr. Trump's own past relationship with Epstein back in the headlines, a subject he has dismissed as a Democrat-inspired \"hoax.\"",
      "Starmer removed Mandelson from the key post after days of drip-fed revelations about Mandelson's years-long friendship with convicted sex offender Epstein, who was found dead in his jail cell in New York in 2019.",
      "Pressure started mounting on Starmer to take action when messages written by Mandelson to Epstein were released by the U.S. House Oversight Committee earlier this month, as part of a redacted 2003 \"birthday book\" to the late financier. They included a series of short notes accompanied by photos.",
      "Among other personal messages, Mandelson wrote that Epstein was known for \"taking you by surprise... in one of his glorious homes he likes to share with his friends (yum yum),\" and that \"wherever he is in the world, he remains my best pal!\"",
      "The final straw for Starmer, however, came after Bloomberg published a selection of emails on Sept. 10, from about 100 emails said to have been exchanged between Mandelson and Epstein between 2005 and\u00a0 2010. Their contents, including suggestions by Mandelson that Epstein vigorously defend himself against the sexual misconduct allegations, led to Starmer promptly firing the ambassador.",
      "In a podcast interview, Mandelson acknowledged the veracity of his correspondence with Epstein and expressed his deep regret that he had ever interacted with him, insisting he never saw evidence of the financier's crimes and had believed previous rebuttals issued by his attorneys.",
      "The \"birthday book\" in question is the same document The Wall Street Journal first reported the existence of in July, prompting Mr. Trump, who is also alleged to have written a message for Epstein in the book, to file a lawsuit against the newspaper and the owner of its parent company, Rupert Murdoch.",
      "The Wall Street Journal published the full document, showing Mr. Trump's alleged signature, last week.",
      "Mr. Trump denies writing the message, calling it and the signature \"fake.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and Starmer are unlikely to avoid questions from journalists during the state visit this week about the deceased sex offender.",

      "The Biden administration in 2021 imposed restrictions on Hungarian passport holders born outside of Hungary and reduced the timeframe of authorized travel permitted under the Visa Waiver Program, citing a simplified naturalization policy backed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban that extended citizenship to people born abroad who claimed Hungarian ancestry.",
      "Officials said at the time that nearly 1 million people were granted citizenship between 2011 and 2020 without adequate vetting.",
      "Under the Visa Waiver Program, most citizens of participating countries are allowed to visit the United States for 90 days or fewer, if they obtain approval within the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA). Citizens from more than 40 countries are eligible to travel to the U.S. under the Visa Waiver Program, according to the State Department's\u00a0website.",
      "While ESTA approvals typically allow travel over a span of two years, restrictions added by the U.S. in 2023 had reduced that validity period for the Hungarian travelers born outside the country from two years to one, and limited the authorization to only one entry into the U.S.",
      "Beginning Sept. 30, the Trump administration is restoring the validity period back to two years and allowing Hungarians to make multiple entries into the U.S. within that time.",
      "\"The United States and Hungary have a strong security partnership, and that commitment is reflected in the actions that Hungary has taken to meet the security standards of the Visa Waiver Program,\" Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.",

      "While Mr. Trump has embraced Orban, the Biden administration had a colder relationship with the NATO ally. Then-President Biden criticized the Hungarian leader in 2024 as \"looking for a dictatorship.\" Hungary for months delayed the expansion of NATO to include Sweden and Finland, arguing their additions would antagonize Russia.",

Some of North America's most popular comedians, along with comics from Europe and elsewhere, are featured on the bill, including Dave Chapelle, Kevin Hart and Bill Burr.",
      "The festival will be the latest in a series of sports and cultural events hosted by Saudi Arabia's government that critics say amount to an effort to obscure the country's reputation for rampant human rights abuses.",
      "\"The Saudi government has invested billions into high profile entertainment events like these in a deliberate effort to whitewash the country's human rights record and deflect from the egregious abuses that continue to happen inside of the country,\" Human Rights Watch researcher Joey Shea told CBS News. \"These investments are a part of the broader strategy to... have people thinking about a comedy event, for example, rather than the soaring number of executions that are happening inside of the country.\"",
      "HRW noted specifically the state execution of journalist Turki Al-Jasser, who was killed in June following seven years of detention after reportedly being identified as the author of several anonymous tweets criticizing the Saudi royal family.",
      "Al-Jasser had been convicted of terrorism and high treason on the basis of posts he was accused of authoring, according to UNESCO.",
      "UNESCO's director general Audrey Azoulay condemned his execution, saying: \"A death sentence imposed on journalists constitutes a serious attack on freedom of expression and freedom of the press. Journalists must be able to report without fear for their lives or safety.\"",
      "Reporters Without Borders, an organization that works to protect journalists, branded the charges against Al-Jasser as \"false.\"",
      "\"This execution of a journalist went forward to very little international criticism and this is clearly a result of these billions that had been invested in the country's whitewashing strategy,\" Shea told CBS News.",
      "When asked whether they believed the comedians would be able to freely tell jokes at the festival, the HRW researcher predicted there would be clear red lines drawn by organizers to prevent any criticism of Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman, who has already taken over as ruler of the highly conservative Islamic kingdom, as well as his policies and the broader royal family.",
      "Shea called on the high-profile entertainers attending the event \u2014 funding for which comes from the Saudi government's General Entertainment Authority \u2014   to mitigate the positive effect that their presence might have on the country's reputation for human rights abuses, including by \"speaking out about the abuses.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 16 Sep 2025 08:24:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Some ancient societies in Asia appear to have smoke-dried their dead, effectively mummifying them thousands of years earlier than their Egyptian counterparts, new research has found.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists have discovered what's thought to be the oldest known mummies in the world in southeastern Asia dating back up to 12,000 years.",
      "Mummification prevents decay by preserving dead bodies. The process can happen naturally in places like the sands of Chile's Atacama Desert or the bogs of Ireland where conditions can fend off decomposition. Humans across various cultures also mummified their ancestors through embalming to honor them or send their souls to the afterlife.",
      "Egypt's mummies may be the most well-known, but until now some of the oldest mummies were prepared by a fishing people called the Chinchorro about 7,000 years ago in what's now Peru and Chile.",
      "A new study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences pushes that timeline back.",
      "Researchers found human remains that were buried in crouched or squatted positions with some cuts and burn marks in various archaeological sites across China and Vietnam and to a lesser extent, from the Philippines, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.",
      "Studying the bones further, scientists discovered the bodies were likely exposed to heat. That suggested the bodies had been smoke-dried over a fire and mummified by hunter-gatherer communities in the area.",
      "The practice \"allowed people to sustain physical and spiritual connections with their ancestors, bridging time and memory,\" study author Hirofumi Matsumura with Sapporo Medical University in Japan said in an email.",
      "The results were \"a great surprise,\" said Hsiao-chun Hung, senior research fellow at Australian National University.",
      "\"The bones are so ancient, and it is remarkable to discover that this tradition is so old, connecting the practices of ancient peoples with those still found in some communities today,\" Hung said.",
      "The process allowed relatives to maintain contact with the deceased, and in some cases was believed to allow the spirit to roam freely during the day and return to a body at night.",
      "\"I believe this reflects something deeply human \u2014 the timeless wish that our loved ones might never leave us, but remain by our side forever,\" Hung told Agence France-Presse.",
      "The researchers theorize that the practice may have been common in ancient Asian civilizations.",
      "\"This tradition may have been known among hunter-gatherer societies across a vast region, for many millennia,\" they wrote in the study,",
      "Dating methods used on the mummies could have been more robust and it's not yet clear that mummies were consistently smoke-dried across all these locations in southeastern Asia, said human evolution expert Rita Peyroteo Stjerna with Uppsala University in Sweden, who was not involved with the research.",
      "The findings offer \"an important contribution to the study of prehistoric funerary practices,\" she said in an email.",
      "Mummies are far from a thing of the past. Even today, Indigenous communities in Australia and Papua New Guinea smoke-dry and mummify their dead, scientists said.",

    "published": "Mon, 15 Sep 2025 22:39:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has added Colombia to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in nearly three decades.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Monday added Colombia to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in almost 30 years, a stinging rebuke to a traditional U.S. ally that reflects a recent surge in cocaine production and fraying ties between the White House and the country's leftist president.",
      "Even as it determined that Colombia had failed to comply with its international counternarcotics obligations, the Trump administration issued a waiver of sanctions that would have triggered major aid cuts, citing vital U.S. national interests.",
      "Nonetheless, it is a major step against one of the United States' staunchest allies in Latin America, and it could further hamper efforts to restore security in the countryside, according to Adam Isacson, a security researcher at the Washington Office on Latin America.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro said he regretted the decision, which overlooked decades of bloodshed by Colombian security forces and civilians all in the name of a U.S.-led drug war.",
      "\"Everything we do has nothing to do with the Colombian people,\" Petro said during a televised address Monday night. \"It is to prevent the American society from smearing its noses in order to work, work and work, because this drug is a stimulant.\"",
      "The U.S. last added Colombia to the list, through a process known as decertification, in 1997 when the country's cartels \u2014 through threats of violence and money \u2014 had poisoned much of the nation's institutions.",
      "It \"is a blunt tool and a huge irritant in bilateral relations that goes well beyond drug issues and makes cooperation far harder in any number of areas,\" Isacson said. \"That's why it's so rarely used.\"",
      "The president at the time, Ernesto Samper, was facing credible accusations of receiving illicit campaign contributions from the now-defunct Cali cartel, and a plane he was set to use for a trip to New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly session was found carrying 4 kilograms of heroin.",
      "A remarkable turnaround began once Samper left office. Successive U.S. administrations \u2014 both Republican and Democrats \u2014 sent billions in foreign assistance to Colombia to eradicate illegal coca crops, strengthen its armed forces in the fight against drug-fueled rebels and provide economic alternatives to poor farmers who are on the lowest rungs of the cocaine industry.",
      "That cooperation started to unravel following the suspension a decade ago of aerial eradication of coca fields with glyphosate. It followed a Colombian high court ruling that determined the U.S.-funded program was potentially harmful to the environment and farmers.",
      "A 2016 peace accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the nation's largest rebel group known as FARC, also committed Colombia to rolling back punitive policies likened to the U.S. spraying of Agent Orange during the Vietnam War in favor of state building, rural development and voluntary crop substitution.",
      "Since then, cocaine production has skyrocketed. The amount of land dedicated to cultivating coca, the base ingredient of cocaine, has almost tripled in the past decade to a record 253,000 hectares in 2023, according to the latest report available from the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime. That is almost triple the size of New York City.",
      "Along with production, drug seizures have also soared to 654 metric tons so far this year. Colombia seized a record 884 metric tons last year.",
      "But unlike past governments, manual eradication of coca crops under Petro's leadership has slowed, to barely 5,048 hectares this year \u2014 far less than the 68,000 hectares uprooted in the final year of his conservative predecessor's term and well below the government's own goal of 30,000 hectares.",
      "Petro, a former rebel himself, also has angered senior U.S. officials by denying American extradition requests, as well as criticizing the Trump administration's immigration crackdown and its efforts to combat drug trafficking in neighboring Venezuela.",
      "\"Under my administration, Colombia does not collaborate in assassinations,\" Petro said on Sept. 5 after the U.S. military carried out a deadly strike on a small Venezuelan vessel in the Caribbean that the Trump administration said was transporting cocaine bound for the U.S.",
      "\"The failure of Colombia to meet its drug control obligations over the past year rests solely with its political leadership,\" Trump said in a presidential memo submitted to Congress. \"I will consider changing this designation if Colombia's government takes more aggressive action to eradicate coca and reduce cocaine production and trafficking, as well as hold those producing, trafficking, and benefiting from the production of cocaine responsible, including through improved cooperation with the United States to bring the leaders of Colombian criminal organizations to justice.\"",
      "Under U.S. law, the president annually must identify countries that have failed to meet their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements during the previous 12 months.",
      "In addition to Colombia, the Trump administration listed four other countries \u2014 Afghanistan, Bolivia, Myanmar and Venezuela \u2014 as among 23 major drug transit or drug-production countries that have failed to meet their international obligations. With the exception of Afghanistan, the White House determined that U.S. assistance to those countries was vital to national interests and therefore they would be spared any potential sanctions.",
      "The redesignation of Venezuela as a country that has failed to adequately fight narcotics smuggled from neighboring Colombia comes against the backdrop of a major U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean that has already led to two deadly strikes on small Venezuelan vessels that the Trump administration said were transporting cocaine bound for the U.S.",
      "\"In Venezuela, the criminal regime of indicted drug trafficker Nicol\u00e1s Maduro leads one of the largest cocaine trafficking networks in the world, and the United States will continue to seek to bring Maduro and other members of his complicit regime to justice for their crimes,\" Trump's designation said. \"We will also target Venezuelan foreign terrorist organizations such as Tren de Aragua and purge them from our country.\"",

    "summary": "Christian Brueckner, a sex offender identified as the prime suspect in the 2007 disappearance of Madeleine McCann, is set to be released from a German prison.",
    "story": [
      "Berlin \u2014\u00a0Christian Brueckner, the convicted sex offender named by German authorities as the prime suspect in the disappearance of British toddler Madeleine McCann almost two decades ago, has refused to be interviewed by U.K. police just days before his expected release from prison.",
      "The 48-year-old German national is due to walk free by Wednesday after serving a seven-year sentence for a separate crime, the rape of a 72-year-old American woman in the same region of Portugal from which McCann vanished during a vacation with her family.",
      "While Brueckner remains under formal investigation over McCann's 2007 disappearance, he has never been charged in connection with the case and he continues to deny any involvement.",
      "His decision to decline the London Metropolitan Police's formal request for an interview is being seen as a setback in the long running search for answers in the case that has frustrated investigators in Britain, Portugal and Germany for years.",
      "British Investigators hoped to question Brueckner to clarify key details about his movements in Praia da Luz, the resort town in Portugal's southern Algarve region from which McCann, then three, disappeared. She vanished from her family's rental apartment while her parents had dinner nearby.",
      "For many connected to the case, Brueckner's looming release represents both a pivotal moment and an obstacle. Authorities have been weighing how much oversight they can reasonably maintain over the convicted sex offender once he is no longer behind bars.",
      "Prosecutors in the city of Braunschweig have petitioned the regional court in Hildesheim for what's known as supervisory oversight, a form of monitoring similar to parole that could allow them to impose strict conditions on Brueckner after his release, possibly including an ankle tracking tag.",
      "Brueckner could also be required to declare a fixed place of residence, inform authorities of any change in address or workplace, and face restrictions on where he is permitted to travel. Such restrictions could include barring him from areas linked to his past crimes. He could also be prohibited from leaving Germany without requesting explicit approval from authorities.",
      "Brueckner's attorney Friedrich Fuelscher declined to comment when asked by CBS News about the possibility of his client being subjected to supervisory oversight measures.",
      "A regional court will ultimately decide what measures, if any, to implement following Brueckner's release.",
      "Even if supervisory oversight measures are granted, they are unlikely to satisfy critics who believe the circumstantial evidence linking Brueckner to the McCann case should dictate more close cooperation with British investigators.",
      "His refusal to answer U.K. detectives' questions means they won't get a chance to push him about inconsistencies in his alibis or to confront him directly with witness statements they have gathered over the last 18 years.",
      "The McCann case remains one of the world's most high-profile missing persons investigations.",
      "Brueckner has been at the center of the inquiry since German prosecutors publicly identified him as a suspect in 2020, citing phone records and his history of violent crimes in Portugal's Algarve region. But no charges have ever been brought against him in the McCann case, as the circumstantial evidence has been deemed insufficient to move forward with charges under German law.",

      "\"DONALD TRUMP IS F------ AROUND. NOW HE'LL FIND OUT,\" the campaign's marketing materials read before they were changed, according to archived images of the campaign's website, as well as screenshots from the campaign's official X account.

      "\"No,\" Newsom insisted. \"Because I'm the same guy that walked on the tarmac with Donald Trump. I'm the same guy that would pick up his phone call. I'm the same person that sat down not just with Charlie Kirk, but with Steve Bannon, with the guy who created this space, you know, \u2018Language, Borders and Culture,\u2019 Michael Savage, back in the '90s, you know, was the dominant voice on talk radio.

      "\"I appreciate the question. I mean, I believe in civility. I believe in an open hand, not a closed fist,\" Newsom responded. \"I just think, at the end of the day \u2014 I said it inside a moment ago \u2014 divorce is not an option, period. Full stop.

      "\"This demonization is inspiring violence across the country,\" Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin warned. \"We have to turn down the temperature before someone else is killed.\"",
      "One example cited by DHS were comments by Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, a member of the cohort of progressive lawmakers on Capitol Hill known as \"the squad.\" During an interview with MSNBC on Sunday, Crockett likened ICE officers to slave catchers. \"As someone who understands history, when I see ICE, I see slave patrols,\" Crockett said.",

      "APPLE WINS BLOOD OXYGEN BATTLE FOR WATCH OWNERS",
      "Apple Watch Series 11 now includes FDA-cleared hypertension notification. (Apple)",
      "Apple Watch hypertension alerts explained",
      "Hypertension is often called the \"silent killer\" because it can strike without symptoms. Left unchecked, it increases the risk of heart attack, stroke and kidney disease. By adding passive blood pressure monitoring, Apple Watch aims to help millions detect early warning signs.",
      "Using its optical heart sensor, the watch reviews how your blood vessels respond to heartbeats over 30-day periods. If it detects consistent patterns of hypertension, you'll get a notification. Apple expects the feature could alert more than 1 million people with undiagnosed hypertension in its first year alone.",
      "Apple Watch sends users a \"Possible Hypertension\" alert when heart data shows consistent signs of elevated blood pressure. Paired with the iPhone, users can log blood pressure and follow up with doctors. (Apple)",
      "Clinical validation of Apple Watch hypertension feature",
      "Apple built the new hypertension notification feature on a foundation of years of health research. Since the launch of Apple Watch, heart health tools like ECG, AFib History and irregular rhythm notifications have helped users catch issues early. The hypertension notification now extends that mission by addressing one of the most common and dangerous silent conditions.",
      "The feature works in the background during waking hours, analyzing photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, changes in blood volume under the skin, to detect patterns that suggest chronic high blood pressure. You do not need to calibrate the feature or take direct blood pressure readings with the watch. Instead, the device tracks signals over 30 days and sends a notification if consistent signs of hypertension appear.",
      "CAN YOUR APPLE WATCH DETECT PREGNANCY?",
      "Study results confirm accuracy of hypertension alerts",
      "Apple developed the algorithm using data from more than 100,000 study participants across diverse ages, races, body types, and health statuses. The company then validated its accuracy through a pivotal clinical study with over 2,000 participants, who wore Apple Watch alongside an at-home cuff to compare results.",
      "The validation study showed the feature achieved a specificity rate above 92%, meaning it minimized false positives. Sensitivity rates were especially strong for Stage 2 hypertension, the more severe form of the condition, where the feature identified more than half of users at risk. That accuracy could help prevent strokes, heart attacks and kidney disease in those who may not otherwise know they have hypertension.",
      "Importantly, the study confirmed that the feature performed consistently across age groups, genders, races and skin tones, making it reliable for Apple's global user base. Apple also ran usability testing to fine-tune onboarding and notification language so people understand the alerts and what actions to take next.",
      "By passively monitoring and flagging possible signs of hypertension, Apple Watch helps fill a dangerous gap in diagnosis. Hypertension often goes unnoticed for years, but now, you can be alerted within just one month of wearing the watch.",

Their approach automatically flags signals that suggest you may have high blood pressure and encourages you to check it out. That\u2019s especially important because so many people remain undiagnosed. The feature also provides a way to archive blood pressures, so if people are measuring at home, they can bring that information to their doctor. This isn\u2019t a one-stop solution, but it has the potential to help consumers take charge of their health and identify hypertension earlier. The caveat is that people shouldn\u2019t rely on it exclusively\u2014regular care remains essential.\"",

    "summary": "New research shows how fatty acids in cooking oil can safely dissolve and recover silver from circuit boards without harmful chemicals or environmental damage.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out whats clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "What if your old bottle of cooking oil could help save the planet and your smartphone? That's the big idea behind a groundbreaking discovery by researchers in Finland.",
      "Scientists from the University of Helsinki and the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 have found that you can recover silver from electronic waste using common kitchen ingredients like vegetable oil and hydrogen peroxide. This sustainable, scalable method published in the Chemical Engineering Journal could change how we mine precious metals from our growing piles of electronic junk.",

      "OLD SMARTPHONES ARE BEING TURNED INTO TINY DATA CENTERS",
      "Scientists have discovered a new method of silver extraction from electronics by using cooking oil. (Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "How cooking oil recovers silver from electronic waste",
      "Here's how it works. Fatty acids found in oils like sunflower or olive oil are mixed with hydrogen peroxide. When heated slightly, this combo safely dissolves silver from old circuit boards, wires or keyboard connectors. Then, using ethyl acetate, a far less toxic alternative to industrial solvents, researchers pull out the silver in a solid form. Unlike traditional methods that rely on harsh acids or cyanide-based solutions, this technique avoids toxic runoff and air pollution. Think of it as salad dressing meets science lab, without the environmental mess.",
      "Why recycling silver from e-waste is urgently needed",
      "Silver powers the devices you use every day, such as phones, solar panels, electric vehicles and even medical tech. But less than 20% of it gets recycled. As demand rises and natural resources shrink, finding clean ways to reclaim silver isn't just smart, it's necessary. Silver prices have surged sixfold in the last 25 years. At the same time, supply has lagged. That makes e-waste a goldmine, literally, for anyone who can unlock its hidden metals without poisoning the environment.",

      "Fatty acids found in cooking oil can stabilize silver ions for easier extraction. (Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images)",
      "How scientists extract silver using fatty acids and light",
      "To figure out exactly how this all works, researchers used advanced computer models to study how fatty acids interact with silver ions. The process not only stabilizes the silver but also allows for easy recovery using light and simple solvents. Better still, the ingredients can be reused, and there's no chemical waste or massive cost. And it's highly selective. The method targets silver while leaving other metals behind, a major step forward in urban mining. In testing, even silver-coated keyboard connectors were cleanly processed into pure elemental silver powder using this system.",
      "Indian laborers sift through a heap of pre-owned mobile phones in an electronic waste workshop Dec. 5, 2023, in New Delhi, India.\u00a0 (Yawar Nazir/Getty Images)",
      "What this means for you",
      "This research brings us closer to safe, at-home or small-scale recycling kits that could recover silver from old gadgets. Recyclers and manufacturers could adopt this method to reduce chemical waste and operating costs, while protecting workers and the environment. This method supports a future where nothing goes to waste. It keeps valuable materials in use, cutting down the need for mining and pollution. Silver is vital for making many of the tech items we use every day. Reusing it responsibly means cleaner energy at a lower cost and less reliance on mined resources.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "We've long known that waste is a problem. Now, it might also be the solution. By turning everyday ingredients into powerful recycling tools, scientists are showing us what's possible when chemistry and sustainability meet. The process is still being refined, but the promise is clear: a greener future where reclaiming valuable metals doesn't cost the earth, or our health.",

      "Hackers who break into one account often attempt to use the same password across your other logins. This tactic becomes even more dangerous when AI is involved because a chatbot can quickly test stolen credentials across hundreds of sites. The best defense is to create long, unique passwords for every account you have. Treat your passwords like digital keys and never reuse the same one in more than one lock.",

Our No. 1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks.

AI tools now help criminals generate highly realistic phishing attempts designed to trick you into handing over logins. By enabling\u00a02FA, you add an extra layer of protection that they cannot easily bypass. Choose app-based codes or a physical key whenever possible, as these are more secure than text messages, which are easier for attackers to intercept.",
      "AI-driven attacks often exploit the most basic weaknesses, such as outdated software. Once a hacker knows which companies or individuals are running old systems, they can use automated scripts to break in within minutes. Regular updates close those gaps before they can be targeted. Setting your devices and apps to update automatically removes one of the easiest entry points that criminals rely on.",
      "One of the most alarming details in the Anthropic report was how the hacker used AI to craft convincing extortion notes. The same tactics are being applied to phishing emails and texts sent to everyday users. If you receive a message demanding immediate action, such as clicking a link, transferring money or downloading a file, treat it with suspicion. Stop, check the source and verify before you act.",
      "The hacker in this case built custom malware with the help of AI. That means malicious software is getting smarter, faster and harder to detect. Strong antivirus software that constantly scans for suspicious activity provides a critical safety net.

      "The attack relies on ClickFix tactics, where victims searching for Mac troubleshooting help are lured to fake websites or GitHub repositories. These spoofed sites trick users into copying and pasting a one-line command in Terminal, supposedly to fix an error. Instead, the command silently downloads Shamos, bypasses macOS Gatekeeper protections, and installs the malware.",
      "Once inside, Shamos searches for sensitive data, Apple Notes, Keychain items, browser passwords, and even cryptocurrency wallets. The stolen information is zipped and sent directly to attackers, often alongside additional malware like botnet modules or fake Ledger wallet apps.",

      "Cybercriminals distribute these fake \"fixes\" through so-called \"malvertising\" campaigns and spoofed tech help sites with names like mac-safer[.]com or rescue-mac[.]com. These pages pose as trusted troubleshooting guides and appear in search results for common Mac issues, such as \"how to flush resolver cache.\"",
      "The websites encourage victims to copy and paste commands that download malicious Bash scripts. These scripts grab the user's password, remove file protections, and launch Shamos.

      "Copy-pasting commands into Terminal may seem like an easy fix, but it's also one of the easiest ways for attackers to bypass Apple's built-in protections. If you see a command on a website, forum, or GitHub repository, don't execute it unless you fully understand what it does. Instead, confirm with Apple's official support site or the Apple Community forums, where experienced users and moderators can verify safe troubleshooting steps.",
      "Hackers know that when your Mac has a problem, you'll search for a quick solution.

If the account looks suspicious, inactive, or brand-new, avoid it.",

A personal data removal service scans data broker sites and removes your exposed information, making it harder for attackers to resell or exploit it after a breach.

      "Steven Bixby, 58, was set to die in May for the 2003 killings of two police officers before the state Supreme Court stopped his execution in order to determine his mental competency. A lower court was asked to evaluate if his beliefs about the legal system meant his lawyers were unable to defend him.",
      "The latest ruling, issued by Judge R. Scott Sprouse, gives the execution the green light, at least for now. Addressing concerns about the ability of Bixby's lawyers to defend him, Scott said their client cooperates with his legal team and the psychiatrists who treat and question him.",

The Bixbys then killed state Constable Donnie Ouzts as he and other officers responded to the home because Wilson had been missing for an hour, leading to a 12-hour standoff as officers and the family fired hundreds of shots at each other, investigators said.",

      "The handwritten motion came after the judge held a hearing last month to determine if Bixby was mentally competent for execution.",
      "At the hearing, lawyers for Bixby said that he is convinced the U.S. legal system is unconstitutional and wrong, and refuses to share information needed to help him avoid execution. Prosecutors contended that Bixby's beliefs are shared by others and that he understands why the state wants to end his life.",

      "The Justice Department responded to a request for comment by sending a series of X posts, including Bondi\u2019s most recent one clarifying that the agency's focus is on hate speech that could cause violence.",
      "Trump has continued to support Bondi, who also drew the wrath of MAGA supporters in July, when she released a memo saying there was \u201cno credible evidence found\u201d that late financier and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein blackmailed prominent people. It set off anger among Trump\u2019s biggest supporters, whom he had promised full transparency on the issue for years.",
      "Despite Bondi\u2019s high-profile flubs, Trump has generally forgiven and continued to back her.",
      "Asked Tuesday about Bondi\u2019s hate speech remarks, he threatened a reporter.",
      "\u201cWe will probably go after people like you, because you treat me so unfairly, it\u2019s hate,\u201d Trump told a reporter from ABC News.",
      "A White House official granted anonymity to speak freely told NBC News that Trump \u201cfully supports Bondi and thinks that she\u2019s doing a tremendous job.\u201d",
      "Still, cover from Trump and the White House has not stopped a wave of conservative critics from going after Bondi for her original comments, which generally run contrary to the philosophy of Kirk, who once said \u201chate speech does not legally exist in America.\u201d",
      "Conservative commentator Megyn Kelly criticized Miller\u2019s question about hate speech Tuesday on her podcast, saying it didn\u2019t sound like \u201ca question a conservative would ask.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd then for Pam Bondi to not say, \u2018Whoa, whoa, sister, we on the right do not crack down on hate speech. We don\u2019t believe in that nonsense\u2019 ...  was kind of extraordinary,\u201d Kelly added.",
      "Conservative commentator Matt Walsh called on Bondi to be removed from office, arguing her entire position is now at odds with hard-fought free-speech gains made by the new political right in recent years.",
      "\u201cGet rid of her. Today,\u201d he said Tuesday on X. \u201cThis is insane. Conservatives have fought for decades for the right to refuse service to anyone. We won that fight. Now Pam Bondi wants to roll it all back for no reason.\u201d",
      "While Bondi\u2019s comments have been getting the most heat, Trump and other members of his administration have also promised to go after organizations and people who they believe celebrated Kirk\u2019s death or who contribute to political violence.",
      "\u201cWhen you see someone celebrating Charlie\u2019s murder, call them out,\u201d Vice President JD Vance said Monday. \u201cAnd, hell, call their employer. We don\u2019t believe in political violence, but we do believe in civility, and there is no civility in the celebration of political assassination.\u201d",
      "In February, after a 25-year-old staff member for Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency resigned after The Wall Street Journal reported that he had made comments online supporting racism and eugenics, Vance advocated for rehiring him, saying it was too punitive for people to lose their jobs over social media posts.",
      "Vance said he \u201cobviously\u201d disagreed with the posts but added, \u201cI don\u2019t think stupid social media activity should ruin a kid\u2019s life.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t reward journalists who try to destroy people. Ever,\u201d he said.",
      "Vance's office declined to comment.",
      "Vance struck a more conciliatory tone Wednesday in Howell, Michigan, where he paid tribute to Kirk.",
      "\u201cI want to let you know that whether you\u2019re a Democrat or Republican \u2014 whatever your belief is \u2014 I will fight for your right to speak your mind,\u201d he said. \u201cWe reject political violence, and we reject the crazy left-wing radicals that gunned down our friend Charlie Kirk. Let\u2019s talk to one another and not try to shoot each other down for disagreeing.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "An immigration judge has ordered Mahmoud Khalil be deported to Algeria or Syria, alleging he omitted information from his green card application, according to court documents filed Wednesday.",
      "Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student whose case has been at the center of the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration and on vocal opponents of Israel's war in Gaza, was detained by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement in March and released in June.",
      "Immigration Judge Jamee Comans, based out of Jena, Louisiana, on Friday denied Khalil's motion for a waiver preventing his removal from the United States because of alleged misrepresentations made in an application for an adjustment of status.",
      "Khalil's attorneys said they have 30 days from the Friday order to appeal the decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals.",
      "In that order, Comans cited that on June 20, the court issued a written decision denying Khalil\u2019s application for asylum and ordered he be removed to Algeria and Syria.",
      "She doubled down on that ruling, saying the court found Khalil\u2019s \u201clack of candor on his I-485 form was not an oversight by an uninformed, uneducated applicant.\u201d The form is an application to register permanent residence or adjust status.",
      "\u201cRather, this Court finds that Respondent willfully misrepresented material fact(s) for the sole purpose of circumventing the immigration process and reducing the likelihood his applications could be denied. This Court cannot and will not condone such an action by granting a discretionary waiver,\u201d Comans said.",
      "In a letter to U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz, the Biden-appointed judge presiding over Khalil\u2019s habeas corpus petition case in federal court in New Jersey, Khalil\u2019s attorneys said Wednesday: \u201cThe only meaningful impediment to Petitioner\u2019s physical removal from the United States would be this Court\u2019s important order prohibiting removal during the pendency of his federal habeas case.\u201d",
      "Farbiarz previously blocked the Trump administration from deporting Khalil over the allegation that he poses a national security risk; however, the government continued to pursue his removal based on the allegations related to his green card.",
      "In a statement, Khalil said, \u201cIt is no surprise that the Trump administration continues to retaliate against me for my exercise of free speech. Their latest attempt, through a kangaroo immigration court, exposes their true colors once again.",
      "\u201cWhen their first effort to deport me was set to fail, they resorted to fabricating baseless and ridiculous allegations in a bid to silence me for speaking out and standing firmly with Palestine, demanding an end to the ongoing genocide,\u201d he continued. \u201cSuch fascist tactics will never deter me from continuing to advocate for my people\u2019s liberation.\u201d",
      "Khalil, a native of Syria and citizen of Algeria, entered the United States on a student visa in December 2022, and his status was adjusted to lawful permanent resident last November.",
      "The Trump administration has accused Khalil, a green card holder, of withholding information about his membership in certain organizations, including that he was a political officer of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency of Palestine Refugees and that he was part of Columbia University Apartheid Divest. Furthermore, the Trump administration said he failed to disclose his previous employment at the Syria Office in the British Embassy in Beirut in his permanent residency application last year.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "NBC News reviewed more than 100 pages of documents the federal government submitted in its effort to deport Khalil, along with evidence filed by his legal team \u2014 including his permanent residency application, articles about his activism and contracts and letters outlining his internship and work experience.",
      "In some cases, the government appeared to rely on unverified tabloid reports about Khalil. In others, its claims were factually incorrect because of inconsistent timelines and mischaracterizations of his work history."

    "published": "Wed, 17 Sep 2025 10:00:41 GMT",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates Wednesday afternoon as it faces Trump attacks on its independence and slowing job growth.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve announced a highly anticipated interest rate cut Wednesday, a move indicating that concerns about a slowing labor market now outweigh ongoing worries about inflation.",
      "It's the Fed's first rate cut this year. Policymakers opted for a quarter-point cut to the central bank's benchmark rate, in line with expectations. It's now set at 4% to 4.25%.",
      "\"The labor market is really cooling off,\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference Wednesday after the announcement.",
      "The Trump administration has mounted an unprecedented pressure campaign that has included attacks on Powell for not lowering rates sooner, as well as an effort to unseat a Biden-era Fed appointee over accusations of mortgage fraud.",
      "But Powell and the Fed had resisted Trump's pressure, saying its dual mandate of keeping both unemployment and inflation low meant it needed to be careful not to overheat the economy and risk a return to rapidly rising prices.",
      "\"We\u2019ve done very large rate hikes and very large rate cuts in the last five years, and you tend to do those at a time when you feel that policy is out of place and needs to move quickly to a new place,\" Powell said. \"That\u2019s not at all what I feel.\"",
      "The vote for the quarter-point cut by the Fed's rate-setting committee was 11 to 1. The sole dissenter, in favor of a larger half-point cut, was newly appointed governor Stephen Miran. He was sworn in this week even as he maintains his title as chair of the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, though he is officially on leave from that role.",
      "President Donald Trump's two other appointed governors, Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, both voted for the quarter-point cut.",
      "In its statement Wednesday, the Fed indicated it expects two more rate cuts this year. However, seven of the 12 officials on the Fed's rate-cutting committee indicated that rates should remain unchanged for the rest of the year.",
      "The committee will meet again in October and December.",
      "The labor market appears to be slowing dramatically. August\u2019s jobs report showed that just 22,000 jobs were added, far below economists\u2019 expectations. That report also showed that the United States lost jobs in June. So far this year, the economy has added 598,000 jobs, compared with 1.4 million for the first eight months of 2024. The unemployment rate also ticked higher last month, to 4.3%, a level not seen since September 2017 outside of the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "At the news conference, Powell called the labor market \u201cunusual,\u201d noting that fewer firms are hiring \u2014 but that the available supply of workers is also declining because of Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.",
      "Lower rates could help businesses hire as it becomes less expensive to take out loans and credit card rates fall for consumers.",
      "At the same time, inflation has been creeping up. Since April, when Trump announced his sweeping \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs, inflation has increased from 2.3% to 2.9% in August. The Fed\u2019s inflation target is 2%.",
      "Fed officials said in a separate set of economic projections that they see two additional quarter-point rate cuts this year and a third in 2026.",
      "\u201cAfter weak July and August employment reports and a large negative preliminary benchmark revision, job growth now appears to be much lower and below the breakeven rate, the risks still tilt toward further negative revisions, the unemployment rate has risen slightly for two months in a row, and our broader measure of labor market slack has risen a bit more,\u201d Goldman Sachs economists wrote."

    "story": [
      "Billy Zane did such a good job playing the late Marlon Brando in his new film that one of Brando\u2019s daughters asked, \u201cIs that you or Daddy?\u201d",
      "\u201cRebecca Brando \u2014 we showed her some photos and she\u2019s one of the executors of his estate ... and she honestly said, \u2018Is that you or Daddy?\u2019\u201d Zane, who plays the legendary actor and father of 11 in the new film \u201cWaltzing with Brando,\u201d told TODAY on Sept. 17.",
      "Zane\u2019s response: \u201cI was like, \u2018Well, I think we did it, right? That\u2019s the acid test, right there.\u2019\u201d",
      "Brando, whose work includes, \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d \u201cA Streetcar Named Desire\u201d and \u201cApocalypse now,\u201d died in 2004 at age 80. Brando was married three times and fathered nine children and adopted two.",
      "Brando\u2019s last marriage was to Tarita Teriipaia, a French Polynesian actor whom he met in Tahiti while filming a movie.",
      "In \u201cWaltzing with Brando,\u201d Zane plays the Hollywood star during the 1970s, when Brando dreamed of opening a sustainable luxury resort on his privately owned island in Tahiti, to the skepticism of his hired architect Bernard Judge. While Brando never achieved the dream in his lifetime, The Brando Resort opened in 2014.",
      "Brando\u2019s daughter isn\u2019t the only Hollywood daughter connected to \u201cWaltzing with Brando \u2014 Zane\u2019s daughter Ava Zane plays Sabrina Judge, the daughter of architect Bernard Judge.",
      "\u201cSo proud of my daughter @itsava.zane upon her feature film debut in @waltzwithbrando as as Sabrina Judge, the refreshingly sweet and wryly humorous daughter of Architect Bernard Judge,\u201d Zane captioned an Instagram photo in which he poses on the red carpet with Ava."

      "The cast of \"Hamilton\" reunited a decade after the start of their original Broadway run to celebrate the legendary show at the Delacorte Theater. Only they weren't there to take the stage.",
      "The famed cast instead sat in the crowd with fellow theatergoers to watch the official filmed version of their performance, which hit movie theaters for the first time on Sept. 5.",
      "Outside the Public Theater's open-air amphitheater, the home of Shakespeare in the Park, the red carpet was rolled out for the premiere of the five-year-old film. The footage from the theatrical release was filmed in 2016 and released on Disney+ in 2020.",
      "\"When you are performing a number in a musical, in a show, you can be really focused on what you have to do,\" says Ren\u00e9e Elise Goldsberry, who originated the role of Angelica Schuyler. \"The beauty of watching this movie is that you realize you were never doing it by yourself.\"",
      "The theatrical release is just one way the team behind \"Hamilton\" is celebrating the musical's landmark 10th anniversary.",
      "In June, the original Broadway cast reunited for a medley of songs at the Tony Awards. On Aug. 6, the current cast performed the show for members of the original production and celebrities at an invite-only anniversary event. And just days after the film premiere event at the Delacorte on Sept. 3, Leslie Odom Jr. returned to the Richard Rodgers Stage to reprise his Tony Award-winning performance as Aaron Burr.",
      "\"Hamilton\" has become a cultural juggernaut since its Broadway debut, with its music seemingly sparking a new TikTok trend every few months and Broadway tickets still selling out. (Some tickets for Odom's performances are going for more than $1,000 resale.)",
      "The musical's inspiration famously began with Lin-Manuel Miranda reading a more than 800-page biography about Alexander Hamilton by Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer, Ron Chernow.",
      "\"There are all these children across the country who miraculously know who I am. They come running up to me in the street and they'll want to sing one of the songs from the show with me. They know the entire musical by heart,\" Chernow says.",
      "In addition to its 10 years and counting on Broadway, the show has had runs in Chicago, London\u2019s West End, Puerto Rico, Germany, four U.S. tours and more. It all started on Aug. 6, 2015 \u2014 when the production formally opened at the Richard Rodgers Theatre, where it's been ever since.",
      "Ten years later, the cast recall how they got there and what was going on behind the scenes, from the birthday that kept them \"grounded,\" to Miranda hiding in a bathroom (and who was in the stall next to him)."

    "link": "https://www.today.com/popculture/movies/robert-redford-the-natural-baseball-movies-rcna231678",
    "published": "Wed, 17 Sep 2025 14:42:37 GMT",
    "summary": "Robert Redford and \"The Natural\" helped popularize baseball movies, which were once thought to be too risky to make.",
    "story": [
      "In the parlance of America\u2019s pastime, Robert Redford and \u201cThe Natural\u201d keyed a two-out rally for baseball movies.",
      "The 1980s were a golden era for baseball cinema: \u201cBull Durham,\u201d \u201cField of Dreams,\u201d \u201cEight Men Out\u201d and \u201cMajor League\u201d all come to mind. So does \u201cThe Natural,\u201d which predates all of those titles and may have very well set the stage for the idea that baseball on the silver screen could be a home run.",
      "When \u201cThe Natural,\u201d starring Redford, who died Sept. 16 at the age of 89, was released on May 11, 1984, baseball movies were not exactly a bankable risk. It had been years since the notable releases of films like \u201cBang the Drum Slowly\u201d and \u201cThe Bad News Bears.\u201d Films centered on the national pastime were like sending a .100 hitter up to the plate to pinch hit in the bottom of the ninth. Redford, though, was a titan of film, who remained undeterred.",
      "\u201cAt that time, there was always a lot of negative things. Like, at that point, there had not been a successful baseball film in a long, long time,\u201d the film\u2019s director, Barry Levinson, said on \u201cThe Rich Eisen Show\u201d this past March.",
      "\u201cAnd all had been failures, so when we were working on it, there was all this negative thing, like, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t know. Baseball movies. That genre\u2019s over. It\u2019s gone. Done.\u2019 Redford wanted to do the film. We met on it, by happenstance, actually, and went from there.\u201d",
      "Indeed, \u201cThe Natural\u201d blazed a path for other baseball movies that followed. It is even immortalized at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.",
      "\u201cIn truth, \u2018The Natural\u2019 scattered its own seeds,\u201d wrote Noah Gittell in his 2024 book, \u201cBaseball: The Movie,\u201d which traces the history and impact of baseball films. \u201cIt opened as the number one film in America and came in 14th that year in the domestic box office. Not a World Series contender, but certainly a playoff team, and popular enough to finally shatter the stubborn myth that baseball movies were box office poison.\u201d",
      "Based on Bernard Malamud\u2019s 1952 novel of the same name, \u201cThe Natural\u201d was nominated for four Academy Awards, including a third best supporting actress nod in as many years for Glenn Close. The story of an aging ballplayer who seemingly comes out of nowhere to get a chance with a losing baseball team may seem like the stuff of Hollywood lore, but it\u2019s dark and moody.",
      "\u201cI think film is a great way to tell a story because it\u2019s visual,\u201d Redford told Orion magazine in 2024. \u201cIt\u2019s got movement in it and captures people\u2019s attention differently. That\u2019s a big deal for me. Film can take people to places they\u2019ve never seen and create a connection for them.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Natural\u201d most definitely created a connection. It is a visceral film, with imagery that those who\u2019ve seen it have never forgotten: Redford, as Roy Hobbs, knocking the cover off the ball and later smashing the lights with a dramatic home run are just two examples. The film\u2019s score adds to the emotional depth of the story; it\u2019s no wonder part of the theme for the movie by Randy Newman \u2014 his score also earned an Oscar nod \u2014 appeared at the end of the final episode of \u201cThe Wonder Years.\u201d",
      "In the decade that followed \u201cThe Natural,\u201d baseball on the big screen became more common. In addition to \u201cBull Durham,\u201d \u201cField of Dreams,\u201d \u201cEight Men Out\u201d and the first two \u201cMajor League\u201d films, \u201cA League of Their Own,\u201d \u201cThe Sandlot,\u201d \u201cLittle Big League\u201d and \u201cRookie of the Year\u201d all hit theaters. Heck, baseball even played a large part in \u201cThe Naked Gun.\u201d",
      "Gittell wrote that baseball movies, which had been made for decades before the \u201880s, had finally found a place, thanks to \u201cThe Natural.\u201d",
      "\u201cIts success launched the baseball movie boom that would last a decade and produce some of the most beloved films of all time. It marked the creation of a new legend: for baseball cinema, for the heartland, and for America itself,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Levinson isn\u2019t sold on the idea that \u201cThe Natural\u201d opened the floodgates for offerings like \u201cBull Durham\u201d and the \u201cMajor League\u201d series, but he does acknowledge its impact.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a good question,\u201d he said while appearing in 2014 at the Virginia Film Festival. \u201cI don\u2019t know because it was really not thought of as a commercial-type of thing to do. And then when the film worked, then all of a sudden it was like, \u2018Oh, we can have a baseball movie.\u2019 And then, all of a sudden, there\u2019s \u2018Bull Durham\u2019 and all those others that came after that.\u201d",
      "The irony is that \u201cThe Natural\u201d was not universally lauded by critics.",
      "\u201cWhy didn\u2019t they make a baseball picture? Why did \u2018The Natural\u2019 have to be turned into idolatry on behalf of Robert Redford?\u201d famed film critic Roger Ebert began his two-star review of the movie.",
      "\u201cThe Natural,\u201d though, possesses a kind of mysticism and mythical quality that would come out again in the romanticism of \u201cField of Dreams.\u201d It spoke about the magic and tragedy of baseball, whether ethereal or comical, themes that would be seen again in those later movies of the \u201880s and \u201890s. Talk to people about the best baseball movies ever and it inevitably appears high up on the list.",
      "\u201cThe Natural,\u201d made in the \u201880s, originally written in the \u201850s and taking place in the \u201830s, provided a dose of nostalgia and a reminder of the beauty of the game, which connected with those who see the good in it.",
      "\u201c\u2018The Natural\u2019 gets how baseball feels: timeless and mythic, like the only thing that lasts in a world teeming with ephemera,\u201d Gittell wrote. \u201cIt captures the moment of transformation from men into gods that\u2019s possible every time you turn on a baseball game.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a sentiment that would be echoed many times over in future baseball films \u2014 films that proved baseball and movies do indeed go together."

      "Barbra Streisand has shared an emotional tribute to late Hollywood legend Robert Redford, who she famously co-starred with in the classic romantic drama \"The Way We Were\" (1973).",
      "Streisand, 83, posted a black-and-white image on Instagram of her and Redford, who died Sept. 16 at his Utah home at age 89. In her caption, she called him \u201cone of the finest actors ever.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery day on the set of \u2018The Way We Were\u2019 was exciting, intense and pure joy. We were such opposites: he was from the world of horses; I was allergic to them! Yet, we kept trying to find out more about each other, just like the characters in the movie,\u201d she recalled.",
      "Streisand went on to describe Redford as \u201ccharismatic, intelligent, intense, always interesting \u2014 and one of the finest actors ever.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe last time I saw him, when he came to lunch, we discussed art and decided to send each other our first drawings,\u201d she wrote, adding, \u201cHe was one of a kind and I\u2019m so grateful to have had the opportunity to work with him.\u201d",
      "In Streisand\u2019s 2023 memoir, \u201cMy Name is Barbra,\u201d she detailed how she persuaded Redford to take on the role of Hubbell, the star-crossed lover of her character, Katie, after he initially declined it.",
      "Streisand wrote that she wanted Redford for the role because he was a \u201crare combination\u2026 an intellectual cowboy\u2026 a charismatic star who is also one of the finest actors of his generation,\u201d according to an excerpt from the book published by Vanity Fair.",
      "Redford turned down the role, she wrote, because he felt the character of Hubbell was \u201cshallow and one-dimensional.\u201c His refusal prompted Streisand to urge director Sydney Pollack to \u201cgive him whatever he wants.\u201d",
      "Pollack brought in two new writers who breathed life into the Hubbell character, infusing his \u201cgolden-boy exterior\u201d with inner depth.",
      "\u201cThe negotiations went down to the wire,\u201d Streisand recalled in her memoir. \u201cI was in the middle of filming \u2018Up the Sandbox\u2019 in Africa, and one day I got a telegram from (Hollywood agent) Sue Mengers that simply said: \u2018Barbra Redford!\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s when I knew he\u2019d finally said yes\u2026 and I was so thrilled! The courtship had been tough, but Bob\u2019s reluctance had a big influence on the script and ultimately resulted in a richer, more interesting character,\u201d wrote Streisand.",
      "\u201cThe Way We Were\u201d went on to become a box-office success. It was also nominated for six Academy Awards, winning two, including one for best song for Streisand\u2019s rendition of the theme song \u201cThe Way We Were.\u201d",
      "Streisand and Redford reunited publicly several times over the years, including in 2002 when Streisand presented Redford with the Honorary Academy Award for lifetime achievement.",
      "\"He's always interesting. He's always interested. He's very smart. Very private. He's self-assured but shy, and I adored working with him,\" Streisand said during her speech.",
      "In 2015, she lauded Redford again when she presented him with the Film Society of Lincoln Center\u2019s Chaplin Award.",
      "\u201cYou never quite know what he\u2019s really thinking, and that makes him fascinating to watch on screen,\u201d Streisand said during the ceremony, according to Entertainment Weekly. \u201cBob understands the power of restraint. You\u2019re never going to get it all, and that\u2019s the secret, I think. That\u2019s the mystery. That\u2019s what makes you want to keep looking at him.\u201d",
      "For his part, Redford also had fond memories of working with Streisand on \u201cThe Way We Were.\u201d",
      "\u201cI remember the fun we had,\u201d he recalled when he and Streisand sat for a 2010 joint interview with Oprah Winfrey. \u201cI remember liking her energy and her spirit; it was wonderful to play off of. I also really enjoyed kidding her. She was fun to kid.\u201d"

    "published": "Tue, 16 Sep 2025 20:41:52 GMT",
    "summary": "Actress Melissa Joan Hart talks about how she is shifting her parenting strategies with her three sons.",
    "story": [
      "When it comes to raising kids, actress Melissa Joan Hart wishes she would have done one thing sooner: leaning in to \"natural consequences.\"",
      "\"I'm very much about natural consequences now, and I feel like I kind of missed the boat a little bit on my older kids,\" she tells TODAY.com. Hart, who starred as the title characters in \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch\" and \"Clarissa Explains it All,\" is raising three boys with her husband, musician Mark Wilkerson: Mason, 19, Braydon, 16, and Tucker, 12.",
      "\"We saved them in a lot of cases, especially when it comes to school,\" she says. \"And that's detrimental to their development when they don't have to problem-solve or troubleshoot.\"",
      "Natural consequences as a parenting strategy means that parents let kids experience real-world accountability for their actions, rather than swooping in to solve their problems. So if your child forgets their soccer cleats, for example, you let them figure it out \u2014 and maybe they don't get to play in the game or they get in trouble with the coach \u2014 rather than \"saving\" them by bringing their cleats to school.",
      "Rather than taking charge of school projects as she might have done with older sons Mason and Braydon, Hart says she tries to be less of a leader and more of a helper with Tucker's sixth grade homework.",
      "The actress is spilling secrets as part of Pop Secret\u2019s \u201cSpill Everything\u201d campaign that encourages people to share their popcorn-worthy confessions \u2014 and hear Hart's \u2014 via the Pop Secret Hotline. Hart, who is the \u201cChief of Butter\u201d for the campaign, lets another secret fly: She loves popcorn so much that she insisted on a year\u2019s supply before agreeing to the role.",
      "Popcorn may be consistent, but parenting attitudes can change, and Hart certainly seems to be shifting her view on handling situations with her sons. \"I let them get away with stuff, or helped them through stuff, when they probably need to figure it out themselves,\u201d she says.",
      "It can be hard for parents to allow kids to experience natural consequences.",
      "\"You kind of give up on it,\" she acknowledges. \"They're your personal baby, so of course you want to forgive them and move on and let them go to that football game. We should normalize saying, 'My kids can't sleep over because they're being grounded.'\"",
      "Like many parents, Hart struggles with finding the appropriate consequences for her kids' actions. \"As they get older, they get smarter and wiser and more crafty,\" she says, groaning that when she turned off the wifi as a consequence, they found a way to turn it right back on without her knowledge.",
      "Hart also stops to poke fun at herself, because as she touted the benefits of natural consequences, she was waiting at the pharmacy to pick up a prescription for her 19-year-old son that he could have retrieved himself.",
      "\"But he had work and I didn't want him to leave work, so ... \" she says with a laugh."

    "story": [
      "\"High Potential\" isn\u2019t your typical crime drama.",
      "Kaitlin Olson (\"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\") plays a brilliant single mom of three whose photographic memory catapults her from a job as a cleaner to one as the LAPD's secret weapon.",
      "In the first season, Morgan Gillroy juggled motherhood and solving cases that stumped seasoned detectives. She also uncovered secrets about one of her ex-husbands, who disappeared 15 years ago.",
      "As fans prepare for Season 2's premiere on Sept. 16, here\u2019s what you need to remember from last season.",
      "What Happened to Morgan's Ex-Husband, Roman?",
      "At the heart of the series is Morgan\u2019s first ex-husband, Roman, who vanished 15 years ago during a late-night trip to buy diapers.",
      "For years, Morgan feared the worst \u2014 that Roman was dead. Her eldest daughter, Ava, believed Roman had abandoned them. Over the course of Season 1, the mystery surrounding Roman\u2019s disappearance continued to shape Morgan\u2019s personality and Ava\u2019s resentment.",
      "The season finale brought a breakthrough: Detective Karadec (Daniel Sunjata) discovered Roman\u2019s whereabouts, confirming he is alive. This sets the stage for emotional reunions and potentially explosive confrontations in Season 2, as the truth behind Roman\u2019s long absence remains unclear.",
      "Morgan re-married and had two children with her second husband, Ludo Radovic (Taran Killam) \u2014 though they've also split.",
      "Ava\u2019s Perspective on Her Dad Changed",
      "Ava (Amirah J.) grew up without her father and, for years, assumed Roman had abandoned the family.",
      "Her perspective began to shift after overhearing a conversation between Morgan and Selena (Judy Reyes), her mother\u2019s boss: Roman\u2019s car had been found shortly after his disappearance, impounded with a pack of diapers inside; a clue that he likely didn\u2019t leave voluntarily. The revelation brought Ava to tears.",
      "In Episode 9, Morgan asked Ava if she had taken some of Roman\u2019s belongings while going through his things, telling her she shouldn\u2019t have to sneak around. Ava confessed she had overheard the earlier conversation about the diapers, signaling that she no longer believed her father had abandoned them.",
      "By the season finale, Episode 13, Ava had created photo albums and artwork for Roman, preparing to catch him up on everything he had missed if he ever returns. Her emotional preparation highlights her longing and hope for reconciliation, and the mother-daughter dynamic promises to remain central in Season 2.",
      "A Love Triangle Brewed Between Morgan, Karadec and Tom",
      "Season 1 teased a slow-burn romance between Morgan and Detective Adam Karadec, as well as Morgan\u2019s growing connection with Tom (JD Pardo), a former janitor-turned-nurse. Tom becomes Morgan\u2019s romantic interest due to their shared down-to-earth nature and witty banter, offering a contrast to Karadec\u2019s intensity.",
      "At the season-ending police gala, Karadec\u2019s feelings for Morgan were clear, though she remained unaware. Awestruck by her appearance, he called her stunning before becoming flustered. During a slow dance, he expressed concern about Morgan meeting Gio, a dangerous man linked to Roman\u2019s case, and offered to go in her place. Calling her \u201cpartner\u201d and asking her to trust him, Karadec\u2019s willingness to risk danger marked a turning point in their relationship, and Morgan\u2019s acceptance showed deep trust after 15 years of grief.",
      "Their intimate moment was cut short when Tom, attending the gala as Morgan\u2019s date, interrupted the dance, teasing a love triangle in the making.",
      "A New Villain Enters the Scene",
      "Season 1 ended on a chilling note with the introduction of a new, and still unnamed, villain referred to as the \"gamer\" (David Giuntoli).",
      "Unlike Morgan\u2019s usual cases, this adversary targeted her personally, leaving cryptic messages and forcing detectives to solve elaborate puzzles.",
      "In the finale, the gamer confronted Morgan at a grocery store, declaring, \u201cYou\u2019re the one, Morgan. We shall play again, me and you.\u201d",
      "His obsession with childhood games, coded messages, and psychological manipulation sets up a serialized storyline with darker and more personal stakes for Season 2."

      "The study was initiated at Ukraine\u2019s request to better understand the full size of the network of facilities where children are held, to help them eventually return to their homeland, Nathaniel Raymond, the executive director of the research lab, said in a telephone interview Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really important that all the people involved in different ways to bring the kids back have the most accurate geospatial information possible, and this is it,\u201d he said.",
      "Using open-source intelligence, news reports and Russian government documents, as well as satellite imagery, the Yale report identified 210 different locations where children are taken. Some are brought to locations temporarily, while others are given Russian citizenship and coerced into forced adoption, the report says.",
      "At most sites, children go through \u201cre-education\u201d programs to enforce Russian patriotism, including lectures in Russian history and singing the national anthem, it adds.",
      "Others, particularly older children, have received military training at cadet academies and a military base, including \u201cdrone control and tactics training,\u201d and have participated in shooting and grenade-throwing competitions, according to the report.",
      "The researchers said they cannot verify if any of the children given military training were ever conscripted into the Russian military or were otherwise deployed in the war in Ukraine.",
      "Russia\u2019s children\u2019s rights commissioner, Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, and the country\u2019s foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s official \u201cBring Kids Back\u201d program, which partners the government with other countries and international organizations to return kids from Russia, has recorded nearly 20,000 cases of unlawful deportations and forced transfers of children.",
      "The new report does not estimate the number of children who have been held either temporarily or indefinitely in Russia. But Raymond said identifying the locations gives a better sense of the scale, comparing it to the carnival game of trying to guess the number of jelly beans in a jar.",
      "\u201cRight now, with this report, we volumetrically know as much as we\u2019re probably going to know how big the jar is, and the jar is gigantic,\u201d he said.",
      "The report builds on research that has helped support allegations of war crimes against Russian President Vladimir Putin issued by the International Criminal Court, which has issued an arrest warrant accusing him of overseeing the forced abductions and deportations. The ICC has also accused Lvova-Belova of committing similar crimes.",
      "The Kremlin has previously denied the allegations and said the warrants were \u201coutrageous.\u201d",
      "Ukraine has made the return of abducted children central to any talks with Russia to end the war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy raised the issue with President Donald Trump during a meeting at the White House last month, days after Trump\u2019s meeting with Putin in Alaska.",
      "Last week, Zelenskyy announced plans to hold a \u201chigh-level event\u201d on abducted children during the meeting of the U.N. General Assembly later this month.",
      "The research was hampered after State Department funding for the Conflict Observatory program, which Yale was part of, was cut by executive order by Trump. It has not been restored. All of the data would have been lost, but a contractor working on the project in Florida protectively kept a backup, according to Raymond.",
      "The lab\u2019s repository of data has been transferred to Europol, a European law enforcement agency.",
      "The researchers have also stopped directly sharing their findings with the ICC after the Trump administration-imposed sanctions on the court in February.",
      "Previously, Raymond said, the lab had cooperated with the ICC on investigations of allegations of war crimes committed in Ukraine on the basis of an agreement put in place during the Biden administration.",
      "Now, he said, researchers are operating under the assumption that the previous agreement is no longer valid. \u201cWe no longer believe that it is safe for us to attempt to share information with them, given the lack of clarity legally from the Trump administration,\u201d he said.",
      "However, a new bipartisan push in the Senate is underway to label Russia a state sponsor of terrorism unless it returns Ukrainian children taken during the war. Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.; Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.; Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.; and Katie Britt, R-Ala., introduced a bill last week threatening to add both Russia and Belarus to the list, which currently includes only Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria."

      "Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said Wednesday that the destruction in the Gaza Strip could be turned into a lucrative real estate opportunity, echoing past remarks by President Donald Trump that outraged Palestinians and their supporters and raised questions about international law.",
      "Speaking at a real estate conference in Tel Aviv focused on the theme of urban renewal, Smotrich \u2014 a far-right minister in an Israeli government known for its right-wing political positions \u2014 said serious discussions were underway to rebuild Gaza as a business enterprise with American help.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a business plan \u2014 listen to me carefully \u2014 there\u2019s a business plan set by the most professional people there is and is on President Trump\u2019s table and how this thing turns into a real estate bonanza. I\u2019m not kidding; it pays off,\u201d he said, according to The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI have started negotiations with the Americans \u2014 I say this not jokingly now \u2014 because I also demand, we paid a lot of money for this war, so we need to divide how we make a percentage on the land marketing later in Gaza. And now, no kidding, we\u2019ve done the demolition phase, which is always the first phase of urban renewal. Now we need to build; it\u2019s much cheaper.\u201d",
      "Any plans to take over the land or property left behind by displaced Palestinians would be a violation of international law, experts say.",
      "\u201cThis plan is tied to the plan to dispel or expel the civilian population, the so-called voluntary emigration plan, and then afterwards to assume permanent control over Gaza. And this is illegal,\u201d said Adil Haque, a law professor and expert on the law of armed conflict at Rutgers University.",
      "Smotrich\u2019s comments mirror remarks this year in which Trump described a possible U.S. takeover of Gaza to turn it into a \u201cRiviera of the Middle East.\u201d Trump did not flesh out details of that takeover plan, and there was no official reaction from the administration to the plan Smotrich described Wednesday.",
      "But a White House official told NBC News that Trump has been supportive of reconstruction plans for Gaza, which is home to about 2 million people.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has long promoted solutions that would help the people of Gaza rebuild,\u201d the official said. \u201cHowever, Hamas must first agree to disarm and give up rule in Gaza.\u201d",
      "Israeli bombs battered Gaza City on the second day of a devastating incursion into a dense urban environment that has sent thousands of Palestinians streaming south in hope of finding safer ground. A spokesperson for the Health Ministry in Gaza said more than 100 people were killed Wednesday, 80 of them in Gaza City alone.",
      "If Smotrich\u2019s real estate plan gains support among other officials within the Israeli government, the civilians escaping the Gaza City offensive may not have homes to go back to.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s appalling that any state would seek to profit from the suffering and dispossession of a civilian population,\u201d said Haque, the Rutgers law professor. \u201cKilling, injuring, displacing ordinary people is one of the most serious actions that any state can take, and they should only do so when it\u2019s absolutely necessary for some defensive purpose.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd so to seek instead to profit by it, to acquire territory, to sell it to others, to benefit from it is just completely unacceptable,\u201d he said.",
      "A United Nations commission said Tuesday that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. It called on the international community to end the campaign and punish the top officials it found responsible for inciting it.",
      "More than 65,000 people have been killed in Gaza, a grim milestone that was reached Wednesday, according to local health officials, whose numbers are considered credible by the United Nations and other international experts.",
      "The conflict began on Oct. 7, 2023, with the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and about 250 were taken hostage. The Israeli military believes about 20 of the 48 hostages still in Gaza are alive."

      "LONDON \u2014 President Donald Trump enjoys spectacle, but this is not what Britain had in mind.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer fought to offer Trump a second state visit starting Wednesday \u2014 an unprecedented flourish meant to bolster Starmer\u2019s authority and flatter the American leader at a crucial moment for the United Kingdom and its allies.",
      "Instead, Trump arrived in a fractious Britain to meet with political leaders beset by long-running discontent and royals navigating family feuds.",
      "Should he open the country's notorious tabloids, the president could survey the fallout from flag-waving far-right marchers in the streets, feverish speculation about the prime minister's position and a family summit over tea that sought to ease those royal tensions.",
      "The backdrop could hardly be worse for the carefully planned choreography of pomp and ceremony.",
      "The prime minister\u2019s hand-picked ambassador to Washington, Peter Mandelson, was fired last week after revelations of his years-old correspondence with Jeffrey Epstein, the late convicted sex offender and financier.",
      "Appointing Mandelson was billed as a savvy move designed to curry favor with Trump, but it has instead detonated into the gravest crisis of Starmer\u2019s premiership so far \u2014 crystalizing bubbling frustrations with his yearlong tenure. Starmer\u2019s deputy, Angela Rayner, also resigned in September after admitting she underpaid property taxes.",
      "Starmer's approval ratings continue to plunge as far-right Reform UK, led by Trump ally Nigel Farage, capitalizes on the public discontent to pull ahead in some polls.",
      "This has all fueled growing whispers of a leadership contest \u2014 a remarkable reversal for a prime minister who won a huge majority just 15 months ago on a vow of stability.",
      "On the streets, the mood is darker still.",
      "A far-right march led by Tommy Robinson, a convicted fraudster with a violent criminal record, drew more than 100,000 people to the streets of the capital Saturday. Elon Musk, formerly Trump\u2019s right-hand man in the White House, called into the rally. He urged a \u201cdissolution of Parliament\u201d and told attendees that \"you either fight back or you die,\" in comments that were condemned by Starmer and others.",
      "While the politics look volatile, Trump's state visit will showcase an institution Britain has long turned to as a bastion of consistency and grandeur.",
      "Yet, his arrival at Windsor Castle on Wednesday, where King Charles III is expected to make a speech in honor of the president, comes at a time when the royals are also under renewed scrutiny.",
      "Prince Andrew is back in the headlines thanks to renewed coverage of Epstein, an unwelcome reminder of unresolved questions about his role. Meanwhile, the frenzied coverage of Prince Harry\u2019s tea with the king last week has resurfaced family tensions that led father and son to go almost two years without meeting.",
      "While Harry suggested Sunday that he wants to see his father more often, relations with his brother, Prince William, the heir to the throne, do not appear to have improved.",
      "Starmer had hoped that hosting a U.S. president \u2014 with all the King\u2019s Guards, red carpets and palace banquets that it will entail \u2014 would broadcast strength and competence.",
      "But Trump's visit, analysts say, may only amplify Britain\u2019s domestic turmoil, rather than mask it.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s administration tends to be very interested in the domestic politics of European countries,\u201d said Olivia O\u2019Sullivan, director of the UK in the World Programme at the London-based think tank Chatham House.",
      "For Starmer, there\u2019s \u201ca pretty challenging landscape at home and overseas,\u201d she told NBC News, and a likelihood that Trump may \u201csay something or address something outside of the carefully diplomatically choreographed statements and announcements.\u201d",
      "The prospect of a second state visit for Trump drew criticism, with opponents accusing Starmer of needlessly flattering a deeply polarizing figure in the U.K. A mass demonstration is planned on the first day of his trip, with a further protest planned near Windsor Castle.",
      "The risk, experts argue, is that Trump\u2019s presence could further weaken Starmer at home.",
      "\u201cTrump is so unpopular with most Brits that no one \u2014 not even Nigel Farage \u2014 is going to win many voters over by being seen close to him,\u201d said Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London.",
      "A recent poll found that 70% of Britons disliked Trump, and 44% thought his state visit should be canceled.",
      "While many on Britain\u2019s far right \u201clove Trump,\u201d he added, \u201can awful lot more Brits think he\u2019s either nuts or dangerous \u2014 or both \u2014 so anyone seen to be fanboying him will get short shrift.\u201d",
      "While Trump will get his desired display of grandeur when he lands in London, turmoil bubbles underneath."

    "story": [
      "Tests by two foreign laboratories show that Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned before he died in an Arctic penal colony last year, his wife said Wednesday.",
      "Russia\u2019s prison service reported in February 2024 that Navalny died after having felt unwell following a walk around the high-security facility in a remote town above the Arctic Circle where he was serving a combined 30\u00bd-year jail sentence.",
      "He was 47.",
      "His wife, Yuliya Navalnaya, has since taken up the mantle of his struggle against official corruption and President Vladimir Putin\u2019s government, in which he survived several poisoning attempts.",
      "She said in a video on X early Wednesday that she had managed to have lab tests conducted in a bid to confirm the suspicion that he died at the hands of the Kremlin.",
      "\u201cWe managed to transfer Alexei\u2019s biological materials abroad,\u201d Navalnaya wrote.",
      "\u201cLaboratories in two different countries conducted examinations. These laboratories, independently of each other, concluded that Alexei was poisoned,\u201d she said.",
      "Navalnaya did not give any further details about the tests or which countries were involved. In her video message, she said her husband's biological materials were \"smuggled abroad.\"",
      "\u201cI demand that the laboratories that conducted the analyses publish their results\u201d she added, before she appeared to accuse them of \"pandering to Putin on account of so-called higher considerations.\"",
      "Russia's Foreign Affairs Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday, \"I don\u2019t know anything about these statements of hers and I can\u2019t say anything on this.\"",
      "News of Navalny's death drew outrage from the West, where many leaders blamed Putin. Former President Joe Biden said he was \u201cboth not surprised and outraged.\u201d",
      "The Kremlin dismissed what it said were \u201cabsolutely rabid statements.\u201d",
      "Navalny\u2019s team said afterward that his mother and lawyers were denied access to his body and were told the probe into what killed him had been extended.",
      "Navalnaya accused the Kremlin of hiding his body to cover up having killed him. He had previously been poisoned with a military nerve agent while on a business trip in Russia in 2020 \u2014 an attempt on his life that he blamed directly on Putin.",
      "Navalny\u2019s body was finally returned a week after his death, and thousands turned out to mourn him at a funeral in Moscow.",
      "Hundreds of people were detained in the days after Navalny\u2019s death for simply laying flowers in his honor at memorials around Russia."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 President Donald Trump touched down Tuesday in a country whose king is prepared to fete him, and whose citizenry roundly dislikes him.",
      "Happily for the president, he will see a lot of King Charles III and little of everyday Britons in a two-day trip where he\u2019ll make history as the first elected leader to receive not one but two state visits courtesy of the royal family.",
      "Looming over Trump\u2019s arrival in Europe is the war playing out on the east end of the continent. Hostilities between Russia and Ukraine took an escalatory turn last week when Russian drones entered Poland\u2019s airspace and were shot down.",
      "The incident renewed fears that Russian President Vladimir Putin may widen the conflict and threaten other European democracies unless he is stopped. As the war grinds on, Trump\u2019s effort to make peace has stalled, giving rise to complaints among some diplomats and members of Congress that he is not putting enough pressure on Putin to halt the attacks.",
      "The war figures to come up when Trump meets privately on Thursday with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at Chequers, his official country residence outside London. There, the two leaders will view the archives of former Prime Minister Winston Churchill.",
      "The symbolism is unmistakable. Churchill and President Franklin D. Roosevelt forged an invaluable friendship as they joined to fight Nazi Germany in World War II. Russia was part of the troika that defeated Adolf Hitler.",
      "Now, the West faces threats from a Russian dictatorial regime, and Europe again is beseeching the U.S. president to come to its aid.",
      "Whether Trump is on board seems to depend on the day. He has sent mixed signals about responsibility for the war, which began in 2022 when Russia sent tanks and troops rolling into Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rallied his country and prevented a quick rout. In a post on his social media site Saturday, Trump wrote that the war is not his. Rather, he wrote, \u201cit is [former President Joe] Biden\u2019s and Zelenskyy\u2019s war.\u201d He did not mention Putin.",
      "But speaking to reporters the following day, he cast Russia as the \u201caggressor.\u201d",
      "Trump said over the weekend that he is prepared to slap \"major\" sanctions on Russia, but first wants all 32 nations in the NATO military alliance to stop buying Russian oil.",
      "\u201cI hope that the leaders who meet Trump these days behind closed doors are very frank about it,\u201d Marko Mihkelson, who chairs the foreign affairs committee in Estonia\u2019s Parliament, said in an interview. \u201cIf Mr. Trump thinks that this is not his war or that he can run away and that Ukraine is somehow a faraway country, that would be an epic mistake.\u201d",
      "First, though, comes the pomp. World leaders have long used flattery in attempting to win favor with Trump. In this instance, Starmer hand-delivered an invitation from King Charles during a meeting in the Oval Office in February. Trump\u2019s last state visit, in 2019, was a \u201ctremendous success,\u201d gushed Starmer, who is relying on Trump to stand up for Ukraine and prevent further Russian aggression.",
      "\u201cEvery time the European Union tries to push against Trump, they\u2019ve gone to incredible efforts to butter him up,\" said Michael Bociurkiw, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank. He mentioned that Mark Rutte, secretary-general of the NATO military alliance, called Trump \"Daddy\u201d at a summit in June and how European leaders praised Trump during a visit to the White House in August to discuss the war, likening them to a \u201ccheerleading squad meeting with the football coach.\u201d",
      "The upcoming state dinner \"is another iteration of what has become the strategy for dealing with Trump,\" said Michael McFaul, who was ambassador to Russia during the Obama administration.",
      "\"I'm not surprised that they [the British] are going to do it, and because of our cultural and historical connections, they can do it like virtually no other country in the world,\" he continued.",
      "A group called the \u201cStop Trump Coalition\u201d is staging a protest during the president's visit, but he isn\u2019t likely to see it. He\u2019ll be an overnight guest of the king and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle on Wednesday and will join the royal couple for a carriage procession inside the private estate. By contrast, when French President Emmanuel Macron visited earlier this year, his carriage ride took him through the town of Windsor."

      "Asked by a reporter Monday in the Oval Office whether he planned to provide proof that the second vessel was carrying narcoterrorists, Trump indicated that the video supported his argument.",
      "\u201cWell, we have proof. All you have to do is look at the cargo that was, like \u2014 it spattered all over the ocean, big bags of cocaine and fentanyl all over the place, and it was \u2014 plus, we have recorded evidence that they were leaving,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, condemned the strikes, calling them an \"outrageous violation of the law.\"",
      "\"These reckless, unauthorized operations not only put American lives at risk, they threaten to ignite a war with Venezuela that would drag our nation into a conflict we did not choose,\" Reed said.",
      "Venezuelan government officials did not specifically refer to the second strike Monday, but Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said at a televised news conference on state-run media after Trump\u2019s announcement that the United States was deliberately provoking Venezuela. He added that the relations between the two countries had crumbled, and he placed the blame on the United States.",
      "\u201cSome hope we will fall into the provocations that the U.S. deliberately makes to generate an open military confrontation,\u201d Cabello said.",
      "The Venezuelan government has argued that the boat targeted earlier this month was a fishing vessel. A day after that strike, Trump threatened further escalation, telling reporters that \u201cVenezuela has been a very bad actor.\u201d",
      "Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro had vowed one day before that strike to declare his country a \"republic in arms\" should it be attacked by U.S. forces.",
      "A source familiar with the first strike told NBC News at the time that the U.S. government\u2019s goal was to pressure Maduro to make rash decisions that could lead to his ouster, without the deployment of American troops inside the country.",
      "The Trump administration has placed renewed pressure on Venezuela, leading to tensions between the two countries. The State Department this year designated eight drug cartels and criminal organizations as \u201cglobal terrorists,\u201d giving the government new legal authority to take military action against them.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a Venezuela hard-liner, said in an interview last month that the designation made dealing with the groups a \u201cnational security issue.\u201d",
      "After the strike Monday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reposted video of the explosion and said \"narco-terrorists are the enemies of the United States.\"",
      "\"We will stop at nothing to defend our homeland and our citizens,\" Hegseth said on X. \"We will track them, kill them, and dismantle their networks throughout our hemisphere \u2014 at the times and places of our choosing.\""
