      "\u201cNumbers can make it feel like a sport, but performance runs so much deeper than a scoreboard, because each artist can bare their soul in a completely unique way and every contribution leaves its own mark on history,\u201d she said.",

      "Ahn, who had blood cancer for years, died at Seoul's Soonchunhyang University Hospital, his agency, the Artist Company, and hospital officials said.",
      "\u201cWe feel deep sorrow at the sudden, sad news, pray for the eternal rest of the deceased and offer our heartfelt condolences to his bereaved family members,\" the Artist Company said in a statement.",
      "President Lee Jae Myung issued a condolence message, saying Ahn provided many people with comfort, joy and time for reflection. \u201cI already miss his warm smile and gentle voice,\u201d Lee wrote on Facebook.",
      "Born to a filmmaker in the southeastern city of Daegu in 1952, Ahn made his debut as a child actor in the movie \u201cThe Twilight Train\u201d in 1957. He subsequently appeared in about 70 movies as a child actor before he left the film industry to live an ordinary life.",
      "In 1970, Ahn entered Seoul\u2019s Hankuk University of Foreign Studies as a Vietnamese major. Ahn said he graduated with top honors but failed to land jobs at big companies, who likely saw his Vietnamese major as largely useless after a communist victory in the Vietnam War in 1975.",
      "Ahn returned to the film industry in 1977 believing he could still excel in acting. In 1980, he rose to fame for his lead role in Lee Jang-ho\u2019s \u201cGood, Windy Days,\u201d a hit coming-of-age movie about the struggle of working-class men from rural areas during the country\u2019s rapid rise and transition.

      "Ahn said he earlier felt confined with his \u201cThe Nation's Actor\u201d labeling but eventually thought that led him down the right path. \u201cI felt I should do something that could match that title. But I think that has eventually guided me in a good direction,\u201d Ahn said in an interview with Yonhap news agency in 2023.",
      "In media interviews, Ahn couldn\u2019t choose what his favorite movie was, but said that his role in \u201cRadio Star\u201d as a dedicated, hardworking manger for a washed-up rock singer played by Park Jung-hoon resembled himself in real life the most.",
      "Ahn was also known for his reluctance to do love scenes. He said said he was too shy to act romantic scenes and sometimes asked directors to skip steamy scenes if they were only meant to add spice to movies.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t do well on acting like looking at someone who I don\u2019t love with loving eyes and kissing really romantically. I feel shy and can\u2019t express such emotions well,\u201d Ahn said in an interview with the Shindonga magazine in 2007. \u201cSimply, I\u2019m clumsy on that. So I couldn\u2019t star in such movies a lot. But ultimately, that was a right choice for me.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- The Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny has redefined what it means to be a global giant \u2014 and he may once again make history at the 2026 Grammy Awards.",
      "The artist born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio is up for six awards at the Feb. 1 show, becoming the first Spanish-language artist to be nominated for album, song and record of the year simultaneously. His critically acclaimed album, \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos,\u201d is only the second Spanish-language record to be nominated for album of the year. The first? Well, that also belonged to Bad Bunny, 2022\u2019s \u201cUn Verano Sin Ti.\u201d",
      "Win or lose, experts say Bad Bunny's Grammy nominations mark a symbolic moment for Latinos. Just a week later, after all, he'll headline the Super Bowl halftime show.",
      "Vanessa D\u00edaz, associate professor of Chicano and Latino studies at Loyola Marymount University and co-author of \u201cP FKN R: How Bad Bunny Became the Global Voice of Puerto Rican Resistance,\u201d says Bad Bunny's nods extend beyond his own art and serve as a \u201cvery welcome recognition of Latin music that is growing.\u201d",
      "\u201cMusic from the Spanish-speaking Caribbean has been shaping global music tastes since the 19th century,\u201d adds Albert Laguna, associate professor of ethnicity, race and migration and American studies at Yale. \u201cBad Bunny is another link in a much longer chain of the popularity of Caribbean music on a global stage.\u201d",
      "Much of this music \u2014 particularly Latin trap and reggaet\u00f3n, the genres Bad Bunny got his start in and continues to use in his new work \u2014 has been historically criminalized in Puerto Rico, not unlike hip-hop in the United States. Reggaet\u00f3n in particular, D\u00edaz points out, \u201ccomes from the most marginalized communities in Puerto Rico. And so, the fact that Bad Bunny is receiving nominations in three main categories, and this is an artist who came up with trap \u2026 is the most groundbreaking thing about the entire situation.\u201d",
      "Petra Rivera-Rideau, associate professor of American studies at Wellesley College and co-author of \u201cP FKN R,\u201d says that element is particularly noteworthy because institutions often ignore marginalized genres \u2014 including at the Latin Grammys, a sister award show to the Grammys.",
      "A victory in the major categories could have \u201cprofound, symbolic meaning,\u201d she says. But with a caveat: \u201cI\u2019m interested to see if this is going to open doors for other people.\u201d After all, Bad Bunny himself isn't immune to the Recording Academy\u2019s institutional biases: He already has three career Grammys, but all have been in m\u00fasica urbana categories \u2014 despite the fact that he is the most streamed artist on the planet.",
      "Across \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos,\u201d Bad Bunny and his producers weave traditional Puerto Rican folkloric styles into a hyper-contemporary context. Latin trap and reggaet\u00f3n aren't abandoned but fused with m\u00fasica j\u00edbara, salsa, bomba, plena and even aguinaldo, a kind of Christmas music, in \u201cPitorro de Coco.\u201d While Bad Bunny\u2019s previous albums also fused different genres \u2014 including bossa nova, mambo, rock, merengue and more \u2014 this album\u2019s melange was more homegrown.",
      "Laguna sees \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos\u201d as a direct challenge to the prevailing \u201cformula for global pop stardom,\u201d which he describes as an artist making it locally, gaining traction and then \u201cwatering down\u201d their sound into something commercial and palatable for a global audience.",
      "\u201cBad Bunny went in the opposite direction. It\u2019s his most Puerto Rican album ever,\u201d says Laguna. He hopes it will communicate to other artists that they, too, can look to their ancestry and history for artmaking.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much amazing Latin music that has been overlooked and that\u2019s part of what is so beautiful about this moment,\u201d says D\u00edaz. \u201cAnd that's why it feels like a win for all Latinos.\u201d",
      "The timing of the album's release and recognition, too, feels consequential. \u201cThe U.S. has a history of othering Latinos, othering the Spanish language. \u2026 We\u2019re in a moment where that feels extremely acute,\u201d she continues. \u201cFor a community that is being targeted on such a deep level, it is a little bit of light, a little bit of faith that we can still carve out our place here.\u201d",

      "In an interview with i-D Magazine earlier this year, Bad Bunny mentioned that concerns around the mass deportations of Latinos factored into his decision not to tour in the continental U.S. ( Hundreds of people have been detained in Puerto Rico itself since large-scale arrests began in late January.)",
      "\u201cThe content of the lyrics \u2014 which are so steeped in the history of Puerto Rico, political histories, tourism and gentrification \u2014 there\u2019s so much rich political and historical content,\u201d D\u00edaz adds. \u201cThis album is historic even without a Grammy win.\u201d",
      "But if Bad Bunny does win, D\u00edaz says, it will be \u201cakin to Halle Berry being the first Black woman to win an Oscar. That was a watershed moment. Or Rita Moreno being the first Latina to win.\u201d",
      "Beyond that, Laguna says the politics of the album are not exclusive to Puerto Rican or even Latino identity \u2014 \u201cthe lyrics on this album align with global struggles,\u201d he says. Take, for example, \u201cLo que le pas\u00f3 a Hawaii\u201d (\u201cWhat happened to Hawaii\u201d), a rallying cry for cultural autonomy in an era of neocolonialization.",
      "Rivera-Rideau says one of the reasons \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos\u201d has resonated is not just the political implications of using folkloric music in addition to m\u00fasica urbana, but its sound. The traditional genres are \u201ca lot more digestible\u201d to listeners who embrace the antiquated taboos surrounding Latin trap and scoff at reggaet\u00f3n's sexuality. As a result, the combination of sounds makes for an album that is \u201cpopular across generations,\u201d she says.",
      "But it only works because it is \u201cmusically really interesting. If it was just traditional music, and that's only what people cared about, it wouldn't have done as well as it did,\u201d she explains. \u201cMusically, it is super innovative and makes accessible a lot of these older genres that people in Puerto Rico listen to, but he\u2019s been able to globalize these very local genres in a way that no one else has.\u201d",
      "That intergenerational appeal was a feature of Bad Bunny's landmark Puerto Rican residency, with the age and global diversity of its audience.",
      "\u201cA lot of people feel like this is a tense moment, it\u2019s a difficult moment. And here\u2019s someone giving us a sonic language in which to narrate this complex present,\u201d Laguna says. \u201cThere's pleasure, in political critique, that the music makes possible in a beautiful way. And I think that's very much welcomed.\u201d",

      "Zimbabwe\u2019s driving lessons have shifted from test prep to survival",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- When Tafara Muvhevhi, a Zimbabwean driving instructor, began work 16 years ago, his job was simple: teach the highway code and prepare learners to ace their driving test.",
      "Today, his priorities have changed. His main concern is no longer just the exam, but whether his students will survive some of the world\u2019s deadliest roads. This is vital in a country where road crashes rank among the top killers, according to the national statistics agency, and road accident fatality rates are among the continent's worst. In Zimbabwe, a crash hits every 15 minutes and five die and 38 are injured each day, according to the country's traffic safety agency.",
      "\u201cBack then we were teaching by the book, it was all by the book,\u201d Muvhevhi said while coaching his latest student through parallel parking and smooth reversing into spaces marked by blue drums on a dusty and worn-out tarmac training ground on the outskirts of the capital, Harare.",
      "Once known for orderly traffic and well-kept roads, Zimbabwe's road safety steadily has deteriorated since the 2000s, degenerating into traffic chaos in the 2010s as economic decline gutted road maintenance, informal public transport boomed and enforcement weakened. Despite renewed repairs and policing efforts, dangerous driving remains deeply entrenched.",
      "\"The other drivers are no longer patient with us, they hoot, they overtake illegally, putting pressure on the students so our students are basically trying to adjust,\u201d he said, before his student navigated through streets where both drivers and pedestrians have little regard for rules.",
      "For the student, 19-year-old Winfrida Chipashu, a university accounting major, the roads of Harare are more intimidating than balancing ledgers.",
      "\u201cYou cannot really compare it to accounting because (in accounting) you have all the concepts,\" Chipashu said. \u201cWhen you are driving in the jungle, you are confused by other people who are not following the road rules.\u201d",
      "The southern African nation\u2019s roads turn most lethal during festive seasons and other holidays, but peril lurks daily, driven largely by dangerous driving that the government says is of alarming concern.",
      "Zimbabwe has one of Africa\u2019s highest road accident fatality rates, with the World Health Organization estimating nearly 30 deaths per 100,000 people.",
      "On the roads, the contradictions are stark. Minibus taxis bearing \u201csafety first\u201d signs swerve wildly into pedestrian lanes and oncoming traffic. Fare collectors hang off doors and the back of moving vehicles shouting for customers. Sedans jammed with 12 passengers, including in the trunk, defy five-seat limits.",
      "Authorities say 94% of road accidents in the country of 15 million people are caused by human error. Cellphone distractions among drivers and pedestrians cause about 10% of deaths, said Munesu Munodawafa, head of the Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe.",

      "The WHO links the surge in part to weak road safety laws and enforcement, reckless driving, and rapid urbanization and motorization. Vehicle registrations in Africa nearly tripled between 2013 and 2021, driven by imported used vehicles and a sharp rise in motorcycles and three-wheelers. Pedestrians, cyclists and riders of two- and three-wheelers account for about half of all fatalities, according to the U.N. agency.",
      "In Uganda, where unregulated motorcycles dominate transport, reckless overtaking and speeding caused 44.5% of crashes in 2024, police there say, while in neighboring Kenya and across East Africa, frequent accidents on poor roads and dangerous driving fuel repeated calls for tougher road safety rules.",

      "ISLAMABAD -- Pakistan reported fewer than half as many cases of polio in 2025 than the previous year, a sign of progress in its eradication campaign even as vaccinators faced repeated militant attacks, according to a statement from the government-run Polio Eradication Initiative.",
      "The announcement came two weeks after Pakistan launched its final nationwide polio vaccination campaign of the year, targeting 45 million children.",
      "Anwarul Haq, who is the coordinator of the National Emergency Operations Centre for Polio Eradication, told The Associated Press that authorities reported 30 cases of the potentially paralyzing disease in 2025, down from 74 a year earlier.",
      "Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan are the only two countries in which polio has not been eradicated, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "Pakistan\u2019s latest figures highlight both momentum and lingering risks in a campaign that has spanned decades. While vaccination coverage has improved and reported cases have fallen sharply, health officials say continued transmission in a small number of hard-to-reach areas means the country remains vulnerable to setbacks unless immunization efforts are sustained.",
      "Haq said Pakistan will launch its first anti-polio drive of the new year in the first week of February. He said no new infections have been reported anywhere in the country since September, attributing the decline to vaccination drives carried out during the year.",

      "Finland has been fighting fake news by teaching media literacy to children as young as 3",
      "HELSINKI -- The battle against fake news in Finland starts in preschool classrooms.",
      "For decades, the Nordic nation has woven media literacy, including the ability to analyze different kinds of media and recognize disinformation, into its national curriculum for students as young as 3 years old. The coursework is part of a robust anti-misinformation program to make Finns more resistant to propaganda and false claims, especially those crossing over the 1,340-kilometer (830-mile) border with neighboring Russia.",
      "Now, teachers are tasked with adding artificial intelligence literacy to their curriculum, especially after Russia stepped up its disinformation campaign across Europe following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago. Finland's ascension into NATO in 2023 also provoked Moscow's ire, though Russia has repeatedly denied it interferes in the internal affairs of other countries.",
      "\u201cWe think that having good media literacy skills is a very big civic skill,\u201d Kiia Hakkala, a pedagogical specialist for the City of Helsinki, told The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to the nation\u2019s safety and to the safety of our democracy.\u201d",
      "At Tapanila Primary School, in a quiet neighborhood north of Helsinki, teacher Ville Vanhanen taught a group of fourth graders how to spot fake news. As a TV screen beamed a \"Fact or Fiction?\" banner, student Ilo Lindgren evaluated the prompt.",
      "\u201cIt is a little bit hard,\u201d the 10-year-old admitted.",
      "Vanhanen said his students have been learning about fake news and disinformation for years, beginning with reading headlines and short texts. In a recent class, the fourth graders were tasked with coming up with five things to look out for when consuming online news to ensure it\u2019s trustworthy. Now they are moving onto AI literacy, which is quickly becoming a vital skill.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been studying how to recognize if a picture or a video is made by AI,\u201d added Vanhanen, a teacher and vice principal at the school.",
      "Finnish media also play a role, organizing an annual \u201cNewspaper Week,\u201d where papers and other news are sent to young people to consume. In 2024, Helsinki-based Helsingin Sanomat collaborated on a new \u201cABC Book of Media Literacy,\u201d distributed to every 15-year-old in the country as they began upper secondary school.",

      "Zimbabwe\u2019s driving lessons have shifted from test prep to survival",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- When Tafara Muvhevhi, a Zimbabwean driving instructor, began work 16 years ago, his job was simple: teach the highway code and prepare learners to ace their driving test.",
      "Today, his priorities have changed. His main concern is no longer just the exam, but whether his students will survive some of the world\u2019s deadliest roads. This is vital in a country where road crashes rank among the top killers, according to the national statistics agency, and road accident fatality rates are among the continent's worst. In Zimbabwe, a crash hits every 15 minutes and five die and 38 are injured each day, according to the country's traffic safety agency.",
      "\u201cBack then we were teaching by the book, it was all by the book,\u201d Muvhevhi said while coaching his latest student through parallel parking and smooth reversing into spaces marked by blue drums on a dusty and worn-out tarmac training ground on the outskirts of the capital, Harare.",
      "Once known for orderly traffic and well-kept roads, Zimbabwe's road safety steadily has deteriorated since the 2000s, degenerating into traffic chaos in the 2010s as economic decline gutted road maintenance, informal public transport boomed and enforcement weakened. Despite renewed repairs and policing efforts, dangerous driving remains deeply entrenched.",
      "\"The other drivers are no longer patient with us, they hoot, they overtake illegally, putting pressure on the students so our students are basically trying to adjust,\u201d he said, before his student navigated through streets where both drivers and pedestrians have little regard for rules.",
      "For the student, 19-year-old Winfrida Chipashu, a university accounting major, the roads of Harare are more intimidating than balancing ledgers.",
      "\u201cYou cannot really compare it to accounting because (in accounting) you have all the concepts,\" Chipashu said. \u201cWhen you are driving in the jungle, you are confused by other people who are not following the road rules.\u201d",
      "The southern African nation\u2019s roads turn most lethal during festive seasons and other holidays, but peril lurks daily, driven largely by dangerous driving that the government says is of alarming concern.",
      "Zimbabwe has one of Africa\u2019s highest road accident fatality rates, with the World Health Organization estimating nearly 30 deaths per 100,000 people.",
      "On the roads, the contradictions are stark. Minibus taxis bearing \u201csafety first\u201d signs swerve wildly into pedestrian lanes and oncoming traffic. Fare collectors hang off doors and the back of moving vehicles shouting for customers. Sedans jammed with 12 passengers, including in the trunk, defy five-seat limits.",
      "Authorities say 94% of road accidents in the country of 15 million people are caused by human error. Cellphone distractions among drivers and pedestrians cause about 10% of deaths, said Munesu Munodawafa, head of the Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe.",

The continent has the world\u2019s highest fatality rate at 26.6 deaths per 100,000 people, compared with a global average of about 18, according to the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa. This is despite the continent of 1.5 billion people accounting for just about 3% of the global vehicle population.",
      "Road traffic deaths in Africa are also rising quicker than in any other region, with fatalities jumping 17% between 2010 and 2021, according to the World Health Organization\u2019s latest Africa road safety report released in mid-2024.",
      "The WHO links the surge in part to weak road safety laws and enforcement, reckless driving, and rapid urbanization and motorization. Vehicle registrations in Africa nearly tripled between 2013 and 2021, driven by imported used vehicles and a sharp rise in motorcycles and three-wheelers. Pedestrians, cyclists and riders of two- and three-wheelers account for about half of all fatalities, according to the U.N. agency.",
      "In Uganda, where unregulated motorcycles dominate transport, reckless overtaking and speeding caused 44.5% of crashes in 2024, police there say, while in neighboring Kenya and across East Africa, frequent accidents on poor roads and dangerous driving fuel repeated calls for tougher road safety rules.",
      "To increase road safety, police in Zimbabwe have recently acquired body cameras and breathalyzers and are pushing for a review of the driver licensing system, including docking points for offenders and a revamp of driver training programs to highlight the dangers of reckless driving.",

      "India\u2019s Supreme Court has denied bail to two Muslim student activists, Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam, who have been detained for years without trial",
      "NEW DELHI -- India\u2019s Supreme Court on Monday denied bail to two Muslim student activists who have spent years in detention without trial over a conspiracy case linked to one of the country\u2019s deadliest outbreaks of religious violence.",
      "Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam were arrested five years ago under India\u2019s harsh state security law and accused of conspiring to incite the communal violence that swept parts of Delhi in February 2020. The riots left 53 people dead, most of them Muslims, and took place amid massive months-long protests against a controversial 2019 citizenship law that critics said discriminated against Muslims.",
      "While bail was granted to the other five accused in the same case, the court noted that Khalid and Imam had a \u201ccentral role in the conspiracy.\" It also said that the delay in their trial was not a sufficient ground for granting them bail.",
      "\u201cUmar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam stand on a qualitatively different footing as compared to other accused,\u201d the Supreme Court said in its verdict, according to Bar and Bench, a legal news website.",
      "The two student activists were a leading voice in nationwide protests against the citizenship law, which marked one of the most significant challenges to Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist government. Their detention has been widely seen as emblematic of a broader crackdown on dissent under Modi, drawing criticism from rights groups over the use of anti-terror laws against activists and student leaders.",
      "In the months following the riots, police charged several activists and organizers, including Khalid and Imam, under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, that in the past was used only to quell violent insurgencies but under Modi has been largely used to silence political opposition. Activists and other dissenters targeted under the law can be held in pretrial detention almost indefinitely, often resulting in years of detention until the completion of trial.",

Khalid and Imam\u2019s lawyers argue that there is no evidence linking them to the violence and deny the charges against them.",

      "VATICAN CITY -- The Vatican on Monday gave a final accounting of its 2025 Holy Year, saying more than 33 million pilgrims had participated and that the only real dispute with the city of Rome concerned the style of fountains built for the event's main public works project.",
      "Pope Leo XIV on Tuesday will officially close out the Holy Year and shut the Holy Door of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, capping a rare Jubilee that was opened by one pope and closed by another.",
      "For the Vatican, a Holy Year is a centuries-old tradition of the faithful making pilgrimages to Rome every 25 years to visit the tombs of Saints Peter and Paul and receive indulgences for the forgiveness of their sins.",
      "For Rome, it\u2019s a chance to take advantage of some 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion) in public funds to carry out long-delayed projects to lift the city out of years of neglect and bring it up to modern, European standards.",
      "The Vatican said 33,475,369 pilgrims had participated and Italy, the U.S. and Spain were the top nationalities represented.",
      "But the Vatican\u2019s Holy Year organizer, Archbishop Rino Fisichella, acknowledged the number was only an estimate and could include double counting. There was no breakdown between Holy Year pilgrims and Rome\u2019s overall tourism numbers.",
      "The Vatican arrived at the figure by combining the number of people who officially registered for Jubilee events, volunteer crowd counters at Rome-area basilicas and closed-circuit television cameras at St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, which recorded around 25,000 to 30,000 people a day crossing the threshold of the Holy Door.",
      "Assuming that number every day for the past year, around 10 million pilgrims would have crossed through the Holy Door. Officials said they never envisioned more, given its limited capacity and that pilgrims would have visited Holy Doors at other Rome basilicas.",
      "The official number exceeded the 31.7 million people originally forecast by a study conducted by the Roma Tre University.",
      "The Vatican said it recorded a steady increase in participation following the death of Pope Francis in April and the election of Leo, a transition that made this Holy Year only the second in history to be opened by one pope and closed by another. In 1700, Pope Innocent XII opened the Jubilee and Pope Clement XI closed it after Innocent\u2019s death.",
      "Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri said 110 of the 117 public works projects initially associated with the Jubilee had been completed, including the most audacious: a pedestrian piazza at the end of the Via della Conciliazione boulevard, opposite St. Peter's Basilica, that required the rerouting of traffic to an underground tunnel.",
      "The design of Piazza Pia, as the square is known, also saw the major point of disagreement between Fisichella and Gualtieri over the two round fountains that frame the view along Conciliazione toward the basilica.",

      "Fisichella said he didn\u2019t think the contemporary stone fountains suited a piazza that looks toward the baroque splendor of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica and along the fascist-era architecture of Via della Conciliazione, which was itself created by razing a neighborhood for the 1950 Jubilee.",

      "Hollywood kicked off 2026 with \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d atop the box office for the third straight week and with hopes for a blockbuster-filled year after a disappointing 2025",
      "NEW YORK -- Hollywood kicked off 2026 with \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d atop the box office for the third straight week and with hopes for a blockbuster-filled year after a disappointing 2025.",
      "In three weeks of release, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d has cleared $1 billion worldwide. The third chapter in James Cameron\u2019s Pandora epic collected $40 million over its third weekend in North American theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "\u201cFire and Ash\u201d is doing its biggest business overseas; it\u2019s grossed $777.1 million internationally thus far. The Walt Disney Co. on Sunday trumped the $1 billion milestone as \u201ccementing another monumental achievement for James Cameron\u2019s groundbreaking franchise.\u201d",
      "But over the holidays, it wasn\u2019t just about the weekend ticket sales. The whole week was a lucrative one for Hollywood, with most schools still out. What drove ticket sales, beyond \u201cAvatar\u201d? Sydney Sweeney, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and \u201cZootopia 2.\u201d",
      "The most sustained success over the holiday collider in theaters belonged to a movie that opened all the way back in November. Yet Disney\u2019s \u201cZootopia 2\u201d has had remarkable staying power. It landed in second place with $19 million, dipping a mere 4% from the previous weekend.",
      "The animated sequel has amassed $1.59 billion in six weeks. That makes \u201cZootopia 2\u201d Disney\u2019s second highest grossing animated movie ever, trailing only 2019\u2019s photorealistic \u201cThe Lion King\u201d ($1.66 billion).",
      "\u201cThe Housemaid,\u201d the twisty thriller starring Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried, also emerged as a holiday-season hit for Lionsgate. It collected $14.9 million over the weekend, giving it $75.7 million domestically over three weeks. It dipped only 3% from last weekend. Internationally, \u201cThe Housemaid,\u201d which cost a modest $35 million to make, has added $57.3 million.",
      "Just as Sweeney\u2019s star power is propelling \u201cThe Housemaid,\u201d so is Chalamet\u2019s with \u201cMarty Supreme.\u201d The A24 release also held well in its third weekend, grossing an estimated $12.6 million. After two weeks of wide release, Josh Safdie\u2019s frenetic table tennis tale has grossed $56 million in North America, passing the director\u2019s previous film, \u201cUncut Gems\u201d ($50 million worldwide).",
      "Just about everything playing in theaters saw small drops from the previous weekend. Sony\u2019s action comedy \u201cAnaconda,\u201d starring Jack Black and Paul Rudd, dipped 31% to collect $10 million in second weekend. Focus Features\u2019 \u201cSong Sung Blue\u201d dropped only 17% in its second weekend with $5.9 million. The Hugh Jackman-Kate Hudson Neil Diamond cover band movie has earned $25 million domestically.",
      "With \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d and a wide variety of smaller hits, Hollywood started 2026 strongly. Overall sales were up 26.5% from the same weekend in 2025, according to data firm Comscore.",
      "The movie industry is coming off a poor 2025, where domestic moviegoing continued to slide. U.S. and Canada ticket sales in 2025 amounted to $8.9 billion, a 2% increase from the year earlier, according to Comscore, but about 20% below pre-pandemic levels. That slight improvement was notably less than anticipated and was also boosted by higher ticket prices. Actual tickets sold declined from more than 800 million in 2024 to around 780 million in 2025.",
      "The industry is now awaiting a potentially seismic shift with Warner Bros., one of the most theatrical-friendly studios, agreeing to sell to Netflix. That $83 billion deal awaits regulatory approval.",
      "Yet studios are cautiously optimistic 2026 could be the best box-office year of the decade. A release slate filled with marquee franchises, including new \u201cToy Story,\u201d \u201cAvengers,\u201d \u201cSpider-Man,\u201d \u201cSuper Mario Bros\u201d and \u201cDune\u201d movies, has raised hopes of a turnaround.",

    "story": [
      "Once known for its rice fields and folk songs, Bac Ninh has become one of Vietnam\u2019s busiest factory zones",
      "BAC NINH, Vietnam -- The transformation of Vietnam's Bac Ninh is evident in the signs above its shops and the spicy Chinese and Korean dishes on its tables.",
      "Once known for its rice fields and the love duets of its centuries-old Quan Ho folk songs, the city just north of Hanoi has become one of Vietnam's busiest factory zones, reflecting a surge of investment, hastened by President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff hikes, that are reshaping the region.",
      "The economy has profited from friction between Washington and Beijing as factories shifted out of China, joining earlier waves of foreign investment by the Japanese and South Koreans that have made Vietnam a global manufacturing hub. But rising labor costs, worker shortages and inadequate infrastructure are exposing the limits to its rapid rise.",
      "With rivals like Indonesia and the Philippines competing hard for new projects, Vietnam is trying to climb into higher-value manufacturing and expand export markets to maintain that momentum. That effort is evident in Bac Ninh.",
      "Traditionally a center for artisans, Bac Ninh\u2019s first boom began around 2008 when Samsung built its first phone factory there, turning Vietnam into its largest offshore manufacturing base.",
      "Now, Chinese companies are pouring in as they diversify their factory locations to skirt U.S. tariffs and other trade restrictions. After Hanoi and Beijing normalized ties in the 1990s, inflows of Chinese investment began to pick up as Chinese firms in places like Bac Ninh tapped Vietnam\u2019s electronics supply chain, labor force and supportive local governments, often aided by Chinese-speaking intermediaries who smooth paperwork and logistics.",
      "But Vietnam is too small to replace China, whose economy is 40 times larger, as the world's factory floor. To try to keep up, its leaders are building new infrastructure, including a highway to the Chinese border that has cut travel time by more than an hour. A railway will connect Hanoi to Haiphong \u2014 Vietnam\u2019s largest seaport \u2014 and then the border town of Lao Cai.",
      "On Dec. 19, Bac Ninh broke ground on the expansion of an industrial zone for high-tech manufacturing, including electronics, pharmaceuticals and clean energy. It's part of a synchronized nationwide push in which Vietnam launched 234 major projects worth more than $129 billion just weeks before a pivotal National Party Congress in January, when leaders will decide the country\u2019s political leadership and economic direction.",
      "In Bac Ninh's downtown, a convenience store bears the name Tmall, after Alibaba\u2019s flagship online marketplace. Signs in Chinese advertise services for investors. Chinese\u2013Vietnamese language schools have opened to help locals and Chinese to learn each others' languages.",
      "But as Chinese companies compete for the best labor and other resources, costs are rising for the \u201cChina plus one\u201d strategy of moving factories out of China to other locations, for example, Apple's shift into India.",
      "\u201cIt is becoming difficult to recruit workers,\u201d said Peng, who works at a telecoms equipment company that moved from China\u2019s southern technology hub of Shenzhen. He gave only one name because he was not authorized to speak to the media.",
      "Labor costs have jumped 10%\u201315% since 2024, he said, \"And we expect them to keep rising.\u201d",
      "Vietnam still need technology, equipment and expertise from China, which had created \"the best manufacturing ecosystem,\" said Jacob Rothman, co-founder and CEO of China-based Velong Enterprises, which makes grill tools and kitchen gadgets and has shifted some production to Southeast Asian countries including Cambodia and Vietnam.",
      "Supply chains and manufacturers in China have benefited from decades of government support, large-scale investment and its huge population, Rothman said. \u201cYou can\u2019t recreate that overnight.\u201d",
      "Brian Bourke, global chief commercial officer at U.S.-based SEKO Logistics, said while factories making footwear, furniture and technology are still relocating to Vietnam, it lags China in infrastructure and logistics capabilities.",
      "Some of those limits are surfacing in boomtowns like Bac Ninh, where firms are trying to lure workers with higher wages and bonuses, a box of instant noodles on their first day and bus fares if they commute from another city, according to state media.",

      "Few countries have benefitted more from Trump's trade war than Vietnam, whose biggest export market is still the U.S. In 2024, Vietnam ran a $123.5 billion surplus with the U.S., the third largest behind China and Mexico. That irked Trump, who threatened a 46% import tax on Vietnamese goods before settling on 20%.",
      "The two countries are still working toward a deal to keep most tariffs at 20%. Vietnam has offered broad preferential access for U.S. products, the White House said in October. So far, it has largely absorbed the tariffs, running a trade surplus of $121.6 billion in January-November 2025.",
      "The agreement in October by Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping to a year-long trade truce and lower average tariffs on Chinese exports to the U.S. to about 47% helped ease some concerns. But persisting uncertainty over tariffs and other trade restrictions means companies aren\u2019t just trying to shift factories out of China but to spread them across several countries, said Frederic Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC.",
      "Even with lower U.S. tariffs on China, the calculus still favors moving to Southeast Asia where manufacturing inefficiencies add only about 10% in cost. But while large corporations can shift production easily, smaller firms may struggle to fit a new factory with expensive equipment.",
      "\u201c(The) race to move outside of China is still happening, and it's accelerating,\u201d Rothman said.",
      "Vietnam is still attracting ample foreign investment. Cumulative foreign investment topped $28.5 billion as of September, up 15% from last year. But scrutiny of Vietnam's role as a hub for tariff-dodging transshipments has some manufacturers hedging their bets.",
      "One of SEKO Logistics' customers has shifted some of its furniture making to India, not wanting to \u201cput all their eggs in Vietnam,\u201d Bourke said.",
      "Countries like Indonesia and the Philippines, which missed the early gains Vietnam captured, are promoting themselves as alternative manufacturing bases. In the Philippines, a new law allows foreign investors to lease private land for up to 99 years to attract long-term commercial and industrial investment.",
      "Vietnam has a goal of becoming rich by 2045. It aims to become Asia's next \u201ctiger economy,\u201d following export powerhouses like South Korea and Taiwan by shifting from low-cost assembly work to manufacture higher-value products like electronics and clean energy equipment.",
      "It's offering incentives like tax breaks on imported machinery and discounted rents to help factory suppliers upgrade and modernize. About a third still use non-automated equipment and only about 10% use robots on their production lines.",
      "The country also is trying to reduce its dependence on the U.S. market by expanding exports to the Middle East, Latin America, Africa and India. Overseas trade offices have been asked to share market intelligence and promote products made in Vietnam.",
      "Vietnam knows that rising costs and tougher competition will test how far it \u2014 and places like Bac Ninh \u2014 can climb.

      "Zimbabwe\u2019s driving lessons have shifted from test prep to survival",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- When Tafara Muvhevhi, a Zimbabwean driving instructor, began work 16 years ago, his job was simple: teach the highway code and prepare learners to ace their driving test.",
      "Today, his priorities have changed. His main concern is no longer just the exam, but whether his students will survive some of the world\u2019s deadliest roads. This is vital in a country where road crashes rank among the top killers, according to the national statistics agency, and road accident fatality rates are among the continent's worst. In Zimbabwe, a crash hits every 15 minutes and five die and 38 are injured each day, according to the country's traffic safety agency.",
      "\u201cBack then we were teaching by the book, it was all by the book,\u201d Muvhevhi said while coaching his latest student through parallel parking and smooth reversing into spaces marked by blue drums on a dusty and worn-out tarmac training ground on the outskirts of the capital, Harare.",
      "Once known for orderly traffic and well-kept roads, Zimbabwe's road safety steadily has deteriorated since the 2000s, degenerating into traffic chaos in the 2010s as economic decline gutted road maintenance, informal public transport boomed and enforcement weakened. Despite renewed repairs and policing efforts, dangerous driving remains deeply entrenched.",
      "\"The other drivers are no longer patient with us, they hoot, they overtake illegally, putting pressure on the students so our students are basically trying to adjust,\u201d he said, before his student navigated through streets where both drivers and pedestrians have little regard for rules.",
      "For the student, 19-year-old Winfrida Chipashu, a university accounting major, the roads of Harare are more intimidating than balancing ledgers.",
      "\u201cYou cannot really compare it to accounting because (in accounting) you have all the concepts,\" Chipashu said. \u201cWhen you are driving in the jungle, you are confused by other people who are not following the road rules.\u201d",
      "The southern African nation\u2019s roads turn most lethal during festive seasons and other holidays, but peril lurks daily, driven largely by dangerous driving that the government says is of alarming concern.",
      "Zimbabwe has one of Africa\u2019s highest road accident fatality rates, with the World Health Organization estimating nearly 30 deaths per 100,000 people.",
      "On the roads, the contradictions are stark. Minibus taxis bearing \u201csafety first\u201d signs swerve wildly into pedestrian lanes and oncoming traffic. Fare collectors hang off doors and the back of moving vehicles shouting for customers. Sedans jammed with 12 passengers, including in the trunk, defy five-seat limits.",
      "Authorities say 94% of road accidents in the country of 15 million people are caused by human error. Cellphone distractions among drivers and pedestrians cause about 10% of deaths, said Munesu Munodawafa, head of the Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe.",
      "\u201cThat is frightening,\u201d said Munodawafa. \u201cFor such a small population, those numbers are alarming.\u201d",

The continent has the world\u2019s highest fatality rate at 26.6 deaths per 100,000 people, compared with a global average of about 18, according to the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa. This is despite the continent of 1.5 billion people accounting for just about 3% of the global vehicle population.",
      "Road traffic deaths in Africa are also rising quicker than in any other region, with fatalities jumping 17% between 2010 and 2021, according to the World Health Organization\u2019s latest Africa road safety report released in mid-2024.",
      "The WHO links the surge in part to weak road safety laws and enforcement, reckless driving, and rapid urbanization and motorization. Vehicle registrations in Africa nearly tripled between 2013 and 2021, driven by imported used vehicles and a sharp rise in motorcycles and three-wheelers. Pedestrians, cyclists and riders of two- and three-wheelers account for about half of all fatalities, according to the U.N. agency.",
      "In Uganda, where unregulated motorcycles dominate transport, reckless overtaking and speeding caused 44.5% of crashes in 2024, police there say, while in neighboring Kenya and across East Africa, frequent accidents on poor roads and dangerous driving fuel repeated calls for tougher road safety rules.",

      "While the U.S. action is unlikely to have an immediate impact on crude prices given the current glut in the market, it could upend energy markets.",
      "Venezuela\u2019s oil industry is in disrepair after years of neglect and international sanctions. Some oil industry analysts believe that Venezuela could double or triple its current output of about 1.1 million barrels of oil a day and return the nation to historic production levels relatively quickly, others see a much longer road ahead.",
      "\u201cWhile the Trump administration has suggested large U.S. oil companies will go into Venezuela and spend billions to fix infrastructure, we believe political and other risks along with current relatively low oil prices could prevent this from happening anytime soon,\u201d wrote Neal Dingmann of William Blair. Material change to Venezuelan production will take a lot of time and millions of dollars of infrastructure improvement, he said.",

      "With the expanded subsidies, some lower-income enrollees received health care with no premiums, and high earners paid no more than 8.5% of their income. Eligibility for middle-class earners was also expanded.",
      "On average, the more than 20 million subsidized enrollees in the Affordable Care Act program are seeing their premium costs rise by 114% in 2026, according to an analysis by the health care research nonprofit KFF.",
      "Those surging prices come alongside an overall increase in health costs in the U.S., which are further driving up out-of-pocket costs in many plans.",
      "Some enrollees, like Salt Lake City freelance filmmaker and adjunct professor Stan Clawson, have absorbed the extra expense. Clawson said he was paying just under $350 a month for his premiums last year, a number that will jump to nearly $500 a month this year. It\u2019s a strain for the 49-year-old but one he\u2019s willing to take on because he needs health insurance as someone who lives with paralysis from a spinal cord injury.",
      "Others, like Provost, are dealing with steeper hikes. The social worker\u2019s monthly premium payment is increasing from $85 a month to nearly $750.",

      "Health analysts have predicted the expiration of the subsidies will drive many of the 24 million total Affordable Care Act enrollees \u2014 especially younger and healthier Americans \u2014 to forgo health insurance coverage altogether.",
      "Over time, that could make the program more expensive for the older, sicker population that remains.",
      "An analysis conducted last September by the Urban Institute and Commonwealth Fund projected the higher premiums from expiring subsidies would prompt some 4.8 million Americans to drop coverage in 2026.",
      "But with the window to select and change plans still ongoing until Jan. 15 in most states, the final effect on enrollment is yet to be determined.",
      "Provost, the single mother, said she is holding out hope that Congress finds a way to revive the subsidies early in the year \u2014 but if not, she\u2019ll drop herself off the insurance and keep it only for her four-year-old daughter. She can\u2019t afford to pay for both of their coverage at the current price.",
      "Last year, after Republicans cut more than $1 trillion in federal health care and food assistance with Trump\u2019s big tax and spending cuts bill, Democrats repeatedly called for the subsidies to be extended. But while some Republicans in power acknowledged the issue needed to be addressed, they refused to put it to a vote until late in the year.",
      "In December, the Senate rejected two partisan health care bills \u2014 a Democratic pitch to extend the subsidies for three more years and a Republican alternative that would instead provide Americans with health savings accounts.",
      "In the House, four centrist Republicans broke with GOP leadership and joined forces with Democrats to force a vote that could come as soon as January on a three-year extension of the tax credits. But with the Senate already having rejected such a plan, it\u2019s unclear whether it could get enough momentum to pass.",
      "Meanwhile, Americans whose premiums are skyrocketing say lawmakers don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s really like to struggle to get by as health costs ratchet up with no relief.",
      "Many say they want the subsidies restored alongside broader reforms to make health care more affordable for all Americans.",
      "\u201cBoth Republicans and Democrats have been saying for years, oh, we need to fix it. Then do it,\u201d said Chad Bruns, a 58-year-old Affordable Care Act enrollee in Wisconsin. \u201cThey need to get to the root cause, and no political party ever does that.\u201d",

      "Bulgaria is joining the euro on New Year's Day",
      "SOFIA, Bulgaria -- On New Year\u2019s Day, Bulgaria becomes the 21st country to join the euro currency union, furthering its integration into the European Union. But the historic milestone arrives amid political instability and skepticism among ordinary people fueled by fears of price rises.",
      "Supporters of switching to the euro from the old currency, the lev, are praising the move as one of the greatest achievements since the 1989 transition from a Soviet-style economy to democracy and free markets. They hope it will make the country more attractive for investors and strengthen its orientation toward wealthier Western Europe.",
      "But many people are uneasy, in a country where corruption is rife and trust in the authorities is low. One fear is that merchants will round prices up or otherwise use the changeover to worsen inflation, at a time when inflation has rebounded to 3.7%.",
      "An EU Eurobarometer poll from March showed that 53% of 1,017 people surveyed opposed joining the eurozone, while 45% were in favor. A separate Eurobarometer poll, taken between Oct. 9 and Nov. 3 on a similar sample, showed that about half of Bulgarians opposed the single currency while 42% were in favor. The margin of error was about plus or minus 3.1 percentage points for the March poll.",
      "The government successfully completed the euro adoption process by beating inflation down to 2.7% earlier this year to comply with EU rules and win approval from EU leaders. But clearing that hurdle was followed by a new chapter of political chaos. The government resigned after less than a year in office amid nationwide anti-corruption protests. This left the country without a regular budget for next year and is hampering plans for long-overdue structural reforms and decisions on use of EU support funds. A new election \u2014 the eighth in five years \u2014 is expected to be held next spring.",
      "Nevelin Petrov, 64, said he welcomed the euro. \u201cBulgaria is a full member of the European Union, and its rightful place is alongside the other developed and democratic European nations,\u201d he said. \u201cI am convinced that the adoption of the euro will contribute to the long-term prosperity of our country,\u201d he said.",
      "Others, like Darina Vitova, who runs a pedicure salon in Sofia, said things were moving too fast although she welcomed the change \u201cin principle.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe standard of living and incomes in our country are far from those in the richest European countries, while prices here are rising and life for the average person will become more difficult,\u201d she said. She acknowledges that when heading to the beaches in neighboring Greece, it will be more convenient to pay with the same \u201cpocket money\u201d she uses at home.",
      "Bulgaria, with its 6.4 million people, is one of the poorest members of the 27-country European union. The average monthly wage is 1,300 euros ($1,530).",
      "Countries that join the EU commit to the euro, but actually joining can take years and some members are in no hurry. Poland in particular has seen strong economic growth since joining the EU in 2004 without adopting the euro.",
      "Opponents of joining have fed fears that the changes will allegedly lead to more poverty and loss of national identity. Social media has spread disinformation such as false claims that the euro could lead to confiscation of bank accounts. Nationalist and pro-Russian groups exploit these fears.",
      "European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has said that countries have experienced a slight, transient rise in prices of 0.2%-0.4% right after joining. Price rises can be more apparent than real, as cafe and hairdressers may put off printing new menus and price lists ahead of the change, so that increases are only delayed, not caused by the euro.",

      "Local economists think that joining the euro will not bring dramatic changes to Bulgaria\u2019s economy. That is because the lev has been pegged since 1999 to the euro by law, at a fixed rate of 1 lev for every 51 euro cents.",

      "But America Gives, the program unveiled Wednesday just before the U.S. begins commemorating the 1776 signing of the Declaration of Independence, will have to revitalize a culture of service that has recently waned. Declining volunteering rates still haven't returned to pre-pandemic levels. Just 28% of Americans said they volunteered time to a religious or secular charitable organization this year, according to a December AP-NORC poll.",

The idea is to leverage nationwide reflections on the country's direction to encourage lasting community involvement that will strengthen nonprofits' volunteer pipelines beyond 2026.

      "Participants are invited to pledge their time and log volunteering on an online tracker. Nonprofit partners include Girl Scouts of the USA, which will offer a volunteering badge to any of its roughly 1 million youth members who complete a service project, and Keep America Beautiful, which is leading efforts to clean up 250 million pieces of trash by the Fourth of July. JustServe \u2014 a service project coordinator sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints \u2014 is sending 250 semitrucks to deliver food donations to 250 food banks across the 50 states.",
      "\u201cWe strongly believe that this is as much about the future as it is the past,\" said America250 Chair Rosie Rios, who oversees the nonpartisan commission created by Congress to organize the anniversary. \u201cEspecially this next generation, we want them to give them something to believe in.\u201d",
      "That forward-focused goal requires courting a demographic that many nonprofits struggle to reach: young volunteers.",
      "About one-quarter of adults under 30 said they volunteered their time to charity or provided non-financial support to people in their community in the past year, according to a March AP-NORC poll, compared with 36% of those over 60.",

      "Service could be an opportunity to meet younger generations\u2019 desire for in-person connections. Sofia Alvarez \u2014 a cohort lead for the Youth250 Bureau, a separate effort to center Gen Z perspectives throughout next year\u2019s programming \u2014 said young people want \u201cthird spaces.\u201d That means somewhere outside of home, school or work that feels \u201csafe,\u201d she said, but doesn\u2019t require spending money.",

      "Young people want to give back, Keating said, but they are busy and don\u2019t know how. She said nonprofits must offer experiences \u201cthat match their lives.\u201d Someone might not have time to lead an entire troop, for example, but they can help lead a specific badge program.",

      "HONG KONG -- State-backed property developer China Vanke, once the country\u2019s largest homebuilder by sales, narrowly avoided defaulting on a 2 billion yuan ($284 million) bond last week as the painfully slow recovery in China\u2019s property market drags on.",
      "The Chinese developer also was seeking to delay repayment of another 3.7 billion yuan ($530 million) of onshore debt due on Dec. 28, with bondholders agreeing to extend the deadline to February.",
      "Years after the downturn in the housing market began, Chinese developers are still struggling to regain their footing, despite a slew of government policies meant to revive the industry. Weak investment and housing prices have shaken investor confidence, spilling into the broader economy since millions of homeowners are stuck with apartments worth far less than what they paid for them.",
      "Instead of the huge driver of prosperity that it once was, the property market is weighing on the economy.",
      "Although Vanke's bondholders have approved extensions for repayments of its debt, the risk of a default remains.",
      "About a third-owned by Shenzhen Metro, a state-owned railway, publicly listed Vanke's finances are a mess. Its revenue fell 27% from a year earlier in the latest July-September quarter, and several of its onshore bonds were suspended from trading after prices plunged.",
      "The developer owes more than $50 billion, less than the more than $300 billion in debt racked up by China Evergrande, one of the first property dominos to fall when it defaulted in 2021 after the government cracked down on excessive borrowing in the industry.",
      "Analysts say Vanke, founded in the 1980s in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen, may be testing the limits of state support for property developers in reviving the industry, which once accounted for more than a quarter of total economic activities in China.",
      "More than four years after the downturn began, China\u2019s property sector has yet to recover. The situation varies from city to city, but overall home prices have fallen by 20% or more from their peak in 2021.",
      "The decline has continued, with new home sales falling 11.2% by value year-on-year in the first 11 months of 2025, according to official statistics. Property investments fell nearly 16% from a year earlier.",
      "The slump has caused massive layoffs, hurting overall consumer confidence and spending.",
      "\u201cThe continued slide in the property market remains one of the most significant risks to China\u2019s efforts to shift to a domestically demand-driven growth model,\u201d wrote Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING Bank, in a recent commentary.",

    "story": [
      "A",
      "MANHATTAN, Kan. -- About the fourth or fifth time that A.J. Dybantsa crashed to the floor, and he looked up at an official in both shock and vain, one of the most talented freshmen in college basketball must have finally figured out that he wasn't going to get a call.",
      "Welcome to life in the Big 12 Conference.",
      "Dybantsa still poured in 24 points while leading No. 10 BYU to an 83-73 victory over Kansas State on Saturday, the first true road game for the Cougars all season. But he did it while committing seven turnovers and showing visible frustration throughout much of the first half, a learning experience if ever there was one for the potential No. 1 pick in next year's NBA draft.",
      "\u201cDefinitely,\u201d Dybantsa said, \u201ccoach was telling me it was going to be more physical than our nonconference games.\u201d",
      "Few leagues are as rough-and-tumble as the Big 12, but it's also worth pointing out that Dybantsa doesn't even turn 19 until later this month, and the swingman could just as well be playing his senior season of high school; he reclassified to this year's freshman class a couple of years ago, when it already was clear that Dybantsa's game \u2014 if not his physique \u2014 was ready for the big time.",
      "Even Dybantsa acknowledged Saturday the need to spend some more time in the weight room.",
      "Kansas State did everything it could to muddy up the game, rotating an exhausting number of bodies onto the 6-foot-9 forward, who found himself in a bit of foul trouble because of it. BYU coach Kevin Young wound up sitting Dybantsa for a few minutes \u2014 a move that he typically does not make \u2014 not only to keep him from picking up another foul but to give him a chance to reset.",
      "\u201cI trust all our guys in that situation,\u201d Young said, \u201cbut him in particular, I trust him in terms of his IQ for the game.\u201d",
      "The nation's second-leading scorer, Dybantsa was coming off perhaps the best performance of his young career, when he scored 33 points with 10 rebounds and 10 assists against Eastern Washington. It was only the second 30-10-10 triple-double in the history of the Big 12, and it was a performance that underscored that the McDonald's All-American is much more than just a scorer.",
      "Against the Wildcats, Dybantsa complemented his 24 points with eight rebounds and three assists.",
      "The Cougars needed all of them, too, because P.J. Haggerty answered Dybantsa nearly bucket for bucket for Kansas State. The nation's No. 3 scorer, Haggerty scored 24 points with seven rebounds and six assists.",

      "But while Dybantsa was doing his work with a fluid inside-outside game that has been making pro scouts drool, the Wildcats guard was putting up points by driving through contact to the basket. And that highlighted the difference between a first-year player and a fourth-year junior, both in terms of their physicality and high-level college experience.",
      "\u201cThose are two really good players out there,\u201d said Kansas State coach Jerome Tang, who recruited Dybantsa heavily before losing out on him to BYU. \u201cI thought they matched their stat lines. It was just one of those things.\u201d",
      "The difference in the game itself was their supporting casts. Dybantsa got 18 points from Robert Wright III and big games from Richie Saunders and Keba Keita, while Haggerty's best wingman \u2014 Abdi Bashir Jr. \u2014 was largely shut out in the second half.",
      "\u201cYou know, I've been watching A.J. since he was in the seventh grade. Loved him and his family. Had a great time recruiting him,\" Tang said. \u201cI've watched his games this season, and he's been one of the most efficient players. He was very efficient again.\u201d",
      "So efficient that Dybantsa scored those 24 points on just 15 shots.",
      "The Cougars have hung around 10th in the AP Top 25 all season \u2014 they were eighth in the preseason poll \u2014 but could be on the rise as they begin churning through Big 12 play. They've won 10 straight since their only loss, a nip-and-tuck two-point setback against No. 4 UConn back in November, their longest winning streak since Jimmer Fredette's senior season in 2010.",
      "That year, BYU rose as high as No. 3 in the poll in late February.",
      "If the Cougars are going to reach those heights, Dybantsa will be a big reason for it.",

      "At stumps, Australia was 166-2 in reply in its first innings, with Travis Head again in imperious form as he slashed his way to 91 not out from 87 balls and nearing his third hundred of the five-match series.",
      "Ben Stokes had both wickets for the tourists, which struggled to stem the flow of runs in the final session but the wicket of the well-set Marnus Labuschagne late in the day buoyed England's hopes.",
      "Earlier Monday, as wickets fell regularly around him, Root showed all the composure of a 163-test veteran as he notched his 41st century off 146 balls, with 11 boundaries and celebrated with the same shrug gesture as when he broke through for his first ton in four Ashes tours at Brisbane last month.",
      "\u201cI just felt like we\u2019ve had some amazing support throughout this series and we\u2019ve not been able to achieve what we set out to as a group, but at no point has that (support) ever wavered,\u201d Root said. \"It (the celebration) is a way of saying thank you, really.\u201d",
      "Root\u2019s epic innings was finally ended at 160 from 242 balls when he popped a return catch to Neser, who dived across the pitch to grasp the ball just inches above the ground.",
      "While his disappointment was evident as he walked from the field, he received a standing ovation from the near-capacity Sydney Cricket Ground in what may be the veteran's last tour of a country that had provided his greatest batting challenge.",

      "Scott Boland and Mitchell Starc made early breakthroughs Monday after Root and Harry Brook\u2019s partnership had moved to 169 runs and was threatening to take the test away from the hosts, who already have a winning 3-1 lead in the series.",
      "Boland (2-85) ended Brook\u2019s equal parts streaky and sublime innings at 84, with Steve Smith taking a sharp catch to bring to a close the best partnership of the series across both teams.",
      "Starc (2-93) removed England skipper Ben Stokes (0) for the fifth time this series with a near unplayable delivery that shaped away from the left-hander which took a thin edge on its way through to Alex Carey.",

      "Head continued the attack and raised his fifty off 55 balls with nine boundaries and soon after passed 500 runs for the series, at a strike rate above 87, to lead both teams.",

      "CINCINNATI -- The night before Myles Garrett got his 23rd sack to break the NFL single-season record, he had a nightmare that he fell short of the mark.",
      "Garrett instead made his sweetest dreams come true.",
      "The All-Pro Cleveland Browns pass rusher took down Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow with 5:09 remaining in the fourth quarter on Sunday to finish his extraordinary season with 23 sacks.",
      "\u201cDespair. I was scared as hell,\u201d Garrett said of the nightmare. \u201cWe got to deny fate, whatever it is, we got to make it happen. And I just went into it and still had the utmost confidence in myself and my preparation and in my guys.\u201d",
      "The record came in a victory that concluded an otherwise difficult season for the Browns (5-12). Andre Szmyt kicked a 49-yard field goal as time expired as Cleveland rallied past Cincinnati 20-18.",
      "Garrett came into the game needing one sack to surpass the mark of 22 1/2 shared by Pro Football Hall of Famer Michael Strahan (in 2001 in a 16-game season with the New York Giants) and Pittsburgh\u2019s T.J. Watt in 2021.",

      "According to Next Gen Stats, Garrett crossed the line of scrimmage 0.23 seconds after the snap from Bengals center Ted Karras, the fastest on any sack this season.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s the sack king,\u201d Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said. \u201cThey've been playing this game for a long time, and for him to go get that in the circumstances with the degree of difficulty in which he got it this season is unbelievable.\u201d",
      "The sack in some ways was similar to Strahan\u2019s record-breaking sack of Green Bay\u2019s Brett Favre in the 2001 season finale. Both quarterbacks didn\u2019t put up much of a challenge when they saw an oncoming pass rusher.",
      "Garrett\u2019s teammates celebrated his milestone even though Cincinnati tried to go no-huddle on the next play. Bengals coach Zac Taylor wasn't pleased that the game was briefly stopped, even though it is standard protocol for an officiating crew to do that when a record-breaking moment occurs.",
      "\u201cThe refs just said they had made the decision as a crew that they were going to stop the game. It didn\u2019t matter when it happened, they were going to stop the game,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThey said they tried to do it as quickly as possible. I feel that. (But) we didn\u2019t sub. We\u2019re trying to be on the ball and go, play tempo and the umpire just held the ball so that we couldn\u2019t do anything.\u201d",
      "Once Garrett got to the Browns sideline, tight end David Njoku placed a fake crown on his teammate's head. There was also a boisterous celebration in Cleveland's locker room after the game.",
      "Garrett has sacked 51 players over his nine-year NFL career. Burrow is at the top of the list at 12 in 10 meetings.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s the focus of the game plan every time we play them. It\u2019s challenging because you have to commit resources to that and that takes away resources from elsewhere,\u201d Burrow said. \u201cFor the most part, I thought we were pretty good against him today. But you can see how impactful he is. We have no help on him one time and he gets one. He\u2019s an elite player.\u201d",

      "It was Garrett who was the most relieved after the game.",
      "\u201cIt was everything I expected. It was so tough. I knew they were going to make it difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I saw more than three singles on a real drop-back the whole game. And I just knew that if I did, I have to make that moment count. And the feeling couldn\u2019t be better.\u201d",
      "Garrett's parents, Audrey and Lawrence Garrett, were in the stands. Lawrence Garrett had a camera with telephoto lens ready to capture the record-breaking moment.",
      "The NFL did not start counting sacks as an official statistic until 1982. Mark Gastineau of the New York Jets had 22 in 1984, and Strahan surpassed him 17 seasons later. Watt tied the record during the final game in 2021 by taking down Baltimore's Tyler Huntley.",
      "Garrett has recorded at least half a sack in 13 games this season, including 11 of the last 12. He had 14 during a five-game midseason span that included a team-record five against the New England Patriots on Oct. 26, four against the Ravens on Nov. 14 and three more a week later at Las Vegas.",
      "Garrett is a four-time All-Pro and is favored to be named the AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year for the second time in three seasons. Besides leading the league in sacks and tackles for loss (33), he was fifth with 77 pressures, including 31 quick pressures under 2.5 seconds.",
      "\u201cHe's the defensive player of the year. You can make him the MVP if I had a vote,\u201d Stefanski said.",

So I knew I had it in me,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted that 25, but they made it real difficult these last two games especially, but really these last three. So that\u2019ll be the next journey, trying to go out there and get 25.\u201d",

      "Jaxson Dart threw the 14th and 15th touchdown passes of his rookie year and the New York Giants ended their lost season on a two-game winning streak by beating the Dallas Cowboys 34-17",
      "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- New York Giants owner John Mara got a season-ending gift from his team three months into his cancer treatment.",
      "Mara got a game ball in an emotional locker room scene after the Giants beat the rival Dallas Cowboys 34-17 on Sunday to finish their lost season on a two-game winning streak.",
      "\"He mentioned he\u2019s jogging to his treatments now because of this,\" said tight end Daniel Bellinger, who had a 29-yard touchdown catch. \u201cHe\u2019s got to be the toughest guy in the locker room, regardless of what everybody else is going through. He\u2019s resilient as a guy, and we respect him as our leader, our owner.\u201d",
      "Beating Dallas and other results around the NFL took the Giants (4-13) out of the running for a top-two pick and clinched No. 1 for Las Vegas, a week after routing the Raiders to end a nine-game skid. Shuffling back in the draft order had some fans rooting for New York to lose, but two more TD passes by rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart showed why there's so much organizational optimism about the future, no matter who is coaching.",
      "\"Jaxson Dart\u2019s going to be here \u2014 he\u2019ll be here for a long time,\" veteran receiver Darius Slayton said. \"He\u2019s talented. He\u2019s young. I think any coach that would come here would be wise to invest in him and try to bring him along because he has all the potential in the world.",
      "Dart has said he cares more about winning than draft position and played like it in his 12th professional start. He was 22 of 32 for 231 yards with his 14th and 15th career touchdown passes, to Bellinger and Tyrone Tracy.",
      "While the Giants were shorthanded because of injuries and illnesses, they treated this like any other game with their starters going the distance. Dallas (7-9-1) took it more like an exhibition game, including Dak Prescott exiting after halftime.",
      "Prescott completed seven of 11 passes for 70 yards and lost a fumble off a botched snap before being replaced at quarterback by Joe Milton to begin the third quarter.",
      "\u201cThe destination is not the end goal,\" said Prescott, who finished the season with 4,552 yards passing, the second most of his decade-long career behind only 4,902 in 2019. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the first seasons where I can\u2019t directly correlate my play to the wins or loses. That makes it frustrating.\u201d",
      "Jaydon Blue and Phil Mafah each rushed for their first NFL touchdowns for the Cowboys, who lost to the Giants for the first time since the 2020 season finale on Jan. 3, 2021.

      "They're not alone.",
      "According to a report released in November by the Eaton Fire Residents United, a volunteer group formed by residents, six out of 10 homes damaged from smoke from the Eaton Fire still have dangerous levels of cancer-causing asbestos, brain-damaging lead or both. That\u2019s based on self-submitted data from 50 homeowners who have cleaned their homes, with 78% hiring professional cleaners.",
      "Of the 50 homes, 63% have lead levels above the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s standard, according to the report. The average lead levels were almost 60 times higher than the EPA's rule.",
      "Even after fires were extinguished, volatile organic compounds from smoke, some known to cause cancer, lingered inside of people's homes, according to a recent study. To mitigate these risks, residents returning home should ventilate and filter indoor air by opening windows or running high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) purifiers with charcoal filters.",
      "Zoe Gonzalez Izquierdo said she can\u2019t get her insurance company to pay for an adequate cleanup of her family's Altadena home, which tested positive for dangerous levels of lead and other toxic compounds.",
      "\u201cThey can\u2019t just send a company that\u2019s not certified to just wipe things down so that then we can go back to a still contaminated home,\u201d Gonzalez said, who has children ages 2 and 4.",
      "Experts believe the lead, which can linger in dust on floors and windowsills, comes from burned lead paint. The University of Southern California reported that more than 70% of homes within the Eaton Fire were built before 1979, when lead paint was common.",
      "\u201cFor individuals that are pregnant, for young children, it\u2019s particularly important that we do everything we can to eliminate exposure to lead,\u201d said pediatrician Dr. Lisa Patel, executive director for the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health and a member of the climate group Science Moms.",
      "The same goes for asbestos, she added, because there is no safe level of exposure.",

      "Scientists from Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University have created the first three-dimensional image of the Popocat\u00e9petl volcano's interior",
      "POPOCAT\u00c9PETL VOLCANO, Mexico -- In the predawn darkness, a team of scientists climbs the slope of Mexico's Popocat\u00e9petl volcano, one of the world\u2019s most active and whose eruption could affect millions of people. Its mission: figure out what is happening under the crater.",
      "For five years, the group from Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University has climbed the volcano with kilos of equipment, risked data loss due to bad weather or a volcanic explosion and used artificial intelligence to analyze the seismic data. Now, the team has created the first three-dimensional image of the 17,883-foot (5,452-meter) volcano\u2019s interior, which tells them where the magma accumulates and will help them better understand its activity, and, eventually, help authorities better react to eruptions.",
      "Marco Cal\u00f2, professor in the UNAM's Geophysics Institute\u2019s vulcanology department and the project leader, invited The Associated Press to accompany the team on its most recent expedition, the last before its research on the volcano will be published.",
      "Inside an active volcano, everything is moving: the rocks, magma, gas and aquifers. It all generates seismic signals.",
      "Most of the world\u2019s volcanoes that pose a risk to humans already have detailed maps of their interiors, but not Popocat\u00e9petl, despite the fact that some 25 million people live within a 62-mile (100 kilometers) radius and houses, schools, hospitals and five airports could be affected by an eruption.",
      "Other scientists took some early images 15 years ago, but they showed contradictory results and did not have sufficient resolution to see \u201chow the volcanic edifice was being built,\u201d and above all, where the magma gathered, Cal\u00f2 said.",
      "His team increased the number of seismographs from the 12 provided by Mexico\u2019s National Disaster Prevention Center to 22 to cover the entire perimeter of the volcano. Even though just three can alert to an emergency, many more are needed to understand what is behind those emergencies.",
      "The devices measure vibrations in the ground 100 times per second and generate data that Karina Bernal, 33, a doctoral student and researcher on the project, processed by using artificial intelligence to adapt algorithms developed for other volcanoes.",
      "\u201cI taught the machine about the different types of tremors there are in El Popo\u201d and with that they were able to catalog the different kinds of seismic signals, she said.",
      "Little by little the scientists began to infer what kinds of material were where, in what state, at what temperature and at what depth. Later they were able to map it.",
      "The result is far more complex than the drawings of volcanoes most saw in school, with a main vent connecting a chamber of magma with the surface.",
      "This first three-dimensional cross-sectional image goes 11 miles (18 kilometers) below the crater and shows what appear to be various pools of magma at different depths, with rock or other material between them and more numerous toward the southeast of the crater.",
      "Popocat\u00e9petl emerged in the crater of other volcanoes in its current form more than 20,000 years ago and has been active since 1994, spewing plumes of smoke, gas and ash more or less daily. The activity periodically forms a dome over the main vent, which eventually collapses, causing an eruption. The last was in 2023.",
      "Cal\u00f2, a 46-year-old Sicilian, speaks passionately about El Popo, as Mexicans call the volcano, rattling off trivia.",
      "He explains that its height can change because of eruptions and recounts how Popocat\u00e9petl, in the first century, had its own \u201clittle Pompeii\u201d when a village on its flanks, Tetimpa, was buried in ash. In the early 20th century, it was human actions \u2014 using dynamite to extract sulfur from the crater \u2014 that provoked an eruption. And even though El Popo emanates more greenhouse gases than almost any other volcano, its emissions are still a small fraction of what humans generate in nearby Mexico City.",
      "For years Cal\u00f2 studied volcanic activity from his computer, but trying to \u201cunderstand how something works without touching it\u201d spurred a feeling of disappointment, he said.",
      "That changed with Popocat\u00e9petl, a volcano he describes as \u201cmajestic.\u201d",

      "Popocat\u00e9petl\u2019s sounds seem to multiply at night with the echoes. An explosion like a rocket might sound like it\u2019s coming from one direction, but a puff of smoke from the crater belies the real source.",
      "Karina Rodr\u00edguez, a 26-year-old master\u2019s student on the team, said you can also hear small tremors in the earth or even ash falling like rain when the volcano is more active. On dark nights, the rim of the crater glows orange.",
      "Having direct knowledge of the volcano provides a much more objective sense of the limits of their analysis, Cal\u00f2 said.",
      "\u201cWe have a natural laboratory here,\u201d he said. It\u2019s \u201cvery important to be able to understand and give residents detailed, trustworthy information about what is happening inside the volcano.\u201d",

      "A \u201cvolcanic bomb,\u201d a rock a yard and a half in diameter and weighing tons, marks the way and gives an idea of what the start of an eruption can mean. That is why the top area of the volcano is restricted, though not everyone pays heed. In 2022, a person died after being hit by a rock about 300 yards (meters) from the crater.",
      "A bottle of tequila near a rocky hollow, known as El Popo\u2019s belly button, hints at some of the traditions surrounding the volcano, including an annual pilgrimage to what some consider a point of connection to the underworld.",
      "Digging up one of the last seismic stations, Cal\u00f2\u2019s face falls. The last registered data are from months earlier. The battery died. Sometimes rats chew the machines\u2019 wires or an explosion causes more serious damage.",
      "The project has yielded some certainties and if repeated will allow the analysis of changes that eventually will help authorities make better decisions when eruptions occur.",
      "But Cal\u00f2 says that, as always happens with science, it has also generated new questions that they will have to try to address, like why the tremors are more frequent on the southeast side \u2014 where there is more accumulated magma \u2014 and what implications that could have.",
      "This was the last expedition before their years of work to map the volcano\u2019s interior is published. Watching the volcano\u2019s interior move in 3D on a computer screen makes all of the effort worthwhile.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s what drives you to start another project and keep climbing,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez, the master's student, said.",

      "\u201cAnd so that\u2019s the sort of control the president is pointing to when he says that,\" Rubio said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \"We continue with that quarantine, and we expect to see that there will be changes, not just in the way the oil industry is run for the benefit of the people, but also so that they stop the drug trafficking.\u201d",

It would be premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.\u201d",

      "Five years after the Capitol riot, some of the police officers who fought off the rioters that day say they're still struggling with what happened",
      "WASHINGTON -- As Donald Trump was inaugurated for the second time on Jan. 20, 2025, former Capitol Police Sgt. Aquilino Gonell put his phone on \u201cdo not disturb\u201d and left it on his nightstand to take a break from the news.",
      "That evening, after Gonell spent time with family and took his dog on a long walk, his phone started to blow up with calls. He had messages from federal prosecutors, FBI agents and the federal Bureau of Prisons \u2014 all letting him know that the new president had just pardoned about 1,500 people who had been convicted for their actions at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The pardons included rioters who had injured Gonell as he and other officers tried to protect the building.",
      "\u201cThey told me that people I testified against were being released from prison,\u201d Gonell said. \u201cAnd to be mindful.\u201d",
      "Gonell was one of the officers who defended the central West Front entrance to the Capitol that day as Congress was certifying Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s victory and hundreds of Trump\u2019s supporters broke into the building, echoing his false claims of a stolen election. Gonell was dragged into the crowd by his shoulder straps as he tried to fight people off. He almost suffocated. In court, he testified about injuries to his shoulder and foot that still bother him to this day.",
      "\u201cThey have tried to erase what I did\u201d with the pardons and other attempts to play down the violent attack, Gonell said. \u201cI lost my career, my health, and I\u2019ve been trying to get my life back.\u201d",
      "Five years since the siege, Gonell and some of the other police officers who fought off the rioters are still coming to terms with what happened, especially after Trump was decisively elected to a second term last year and granted those pardons. Their struggle has been compounded by statements from the Republican president and some GOP lawmakers in Congress minimizing the violence that the officers encountered.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult year,\u201d said Officer Daniel Hodges, a Metropolitan Police Department officer who was also injured as he fought near Gonell in a tunnel on the West Front. Hodges was attacked several times, crushed by the rioters between heavy doors and beaten in the head as he screamed for help.",
      "\u201cA lot of things are getting worse,\u201d Hodges said.",
      "More than 140 police officers were injured during the fighting on Jan. 6, which turned increasingly brutal as the hours wore on.",
      "Former Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger took over the department six months after the riot. He said in a recent interview that many of his officers were angry when he first arrived, not only because of injuries they suffered but also \u201cthey resented the fact that they didn\u2019t have the equipment they needed, the training they needed \u201d to deal with the unexpectedly violent crowd.",
      "Several officers who fought the rioters told The Associated Press that the hardest thing to deal with has been the effort by many to play down the violence, despite a massive trove of video and photographic evidence documenting the carnage.",
      "Trump has called the rioters he pardoned, including those who were most violent toward the police, \u201cpatriots\u201d and \u201chostages.\u201d He called their convictions for harming the officers and breaking into the building \u201ca grave national injustice.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think that was wrong,\u201d Adam Eveland, a former District of Columbia police officer, said of Trump\u2019s pardons. If there were to be pardons, Eveland said, Trump's administration should have reviewed every case.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had a hard time processing that,\u201d said Eveland, who fought the rioters and helped to push them off the Capitol grounds.",
      "The pardons \u201cerased what little justice there was,\u201d said former Capitol Police Officer Winston Pingeon, who was part of the force\u2019s Civil Disturbance Unit on Jan. 6. He left the force several months afterward.",
      "Hodges and Gonell have been speaking out about their experiences since July 2021, when they testified before the Democratic-led House committee that investigated Jan 6. Since then, they have received support but also backlash.",

Peter Welch, D-Vt., asked the other witnesses whether they supported Trump\u2019s pardons of the rioters, including for those who injured Hodges. Three of the witnesses, all called by Republicans, raised their hands.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how you would say it wasn\u2019t violent,\u201d says Hodges, who is still a Washington police officer.",

      "\u201cMy biggest struggle through the years has been the public perception of it,\u201d Eveland said, and navigating conversations with people close to him, including some fellow police officers, who do not think it was a big deal.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to wrap my head around that, but ideology is a pretty powerful thing,\u201d he said.",
      "As police officers struggled in the aftermath, Manger, the former Capitol Police chief, said the department had to figure out how to better support them. There were no wellness or counseling services when he arrived, he said, and they were put in to place.",
      "\u201cThe officers who were there and were in the fight \u2014 we needed to make sure that they got the help that they needed,\u201d Manger said.",
      "Manger, who retired in May, also oversaw major improvements to the department\u2019s training, equipment, operational planning and intelligence. He said the Capitol is now \u201ca great deal safer\u201d than it was when he arrived.",
      "\u201cIf that exact same thing happened again, they would have never breached the building, they would have never gotten inside, they would have never disrupted the electoral count,\u201d Manger said.",
      "Pingeon, the former Capitol Police officer, said he believes the department is in many ways \u201cunrecognizable\u201d from what it was on Jan. 6 and when he left several months later.",
      "\u201cIt was a wake-up call,\u201d he said.",
      "Pingeon, who was attacked and knocked to the ground as he tried to prevent people from entering the Capitol, said Jan. 6 was part of the reason he left the department and moved home to Massachusetts. He has dealt with his experience by painting images of the Capitol and his time there, as well as advocating for nonviolence. He said he now feels ready to forgive.",
      "\u201cThe real trauma and heartache and everything I endured because of these events, I want to move past it,\u201d he said.",

Two wind-whipped blazes that ignited on Jan. 7, 2025, killed at least 31 people and destroyed nearly 17,000 structures, including homes, schools, businesses and places of worship.

      "In Washington, a capital city lined with monuments to the nation\u2019s history, the plaque was intended to become a simple but permanent marker, situated near the Capitol\u2019s west front, where some of the most violent fighting took place as rioters breached the building.",
      "But in its absence, the missing plaque makes way for something else entirely \u2014 a culture of forgetting.",
      "Visitors can pass through the Capitol without any formal reminder of what happened that day, when a mob of President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the building trying to overturn the Republican's 2020 reelection defeat to Democrat Joe Biden. With memory left unchecked, it allows new narratives to swirl and revised histories to take hold.",
      "Five years ago, the jarring scene watched the world over was declared an \u201cinsurrection\u201d by the then-GOP leader of the Senate, while the House GOP leader at the time called it his \u201csaddest day\u201d in Congress. But those condemnations have faded.",
      "Trump calls it a \u201cday of love.\u201d And Johnson, who was among those lawmakers challenging the 2020 election results, is now the House speaker.",
      "\u201cThe question of January 6 remains \u2013 democracy was on the guillotine \u2014 how important is that event in the overall sweep of 21st century U.S. history,\u201d said Douglas Brinkley, a professor of history at Rice University and noted scholar.",
      "\u201cWill January 6 be seen as the seminal moment when democracy was in peril?\u201d he asked. Or will it be remembered as \u201ckind of a weird one-off?\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not as much consensus on that as one would have thought on the fifth anniversary,\u201d he said.",
      "At least five people died in the riot and its aftermath, including Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot by police while trying to climb through a window toward the House chamber. More than 140 law enforcement officers were wounded, some gravely, and several died later, some by suicide.",
      "All told, some 1,500 people were charged in the Capitol attack, among the largest federal prosecutions in the nation\u2019s history. When Trump returned to power in January 2025, he pardoned all of them within hours of taking office.",
      "Unlike the twin light beams that commemorated the Sept. 11, 2001, attack or the stand-alone chairs at the Oklahoma City bombing site memorial, the failure to recognize Jan. 6 has left a gap not only in memory but in helping to stitch the country back together.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why you put up a plaque,\u201d said Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-Pa. \u201cYou respect the memory and the service of the people involved.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Friday ordered the unraveling of a $2.9 million computer chips deal that he concluded threatened U.S. security interests if the current owner, HieFo Corp., remained in control of the technology.",
      "The executive order cast a spotlight on a business deal that drew scant attention when it was announced in May 2024 during President Joe Biden's administration. The deal involved aerospace and defense specialist Emcore Corp. selling its computer chips and wafer fabrication operations to HieFo for $2.92 million \u2014 a price that included the assumption of about $1 million in liabilities.",
      "But Trump is now demanding that HieFo divest that technology within 180 days, citing \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that the current owner is a citizen of the People's Republic of China.",
      "HieFo was founded by Dr. Genzao Zhang and Harry Moore. According to a press release that came out after the deal closed, plans for the technology acquired from Emcore were to be overseen by largely the same team of employees in Alhambra, California.",

      "A suspected deadly mountain lion attack on New Year\u2019s Day that killed a woman hiking alone was preceded by another harrowing encounter in the same area",
      "A solo hiker who authorities believe was killed by a mountain lion on a remote Colorado trail on New Year's Day was not the first person to encounter one of the predators in the area in recent weeks.",
      "Gary Messina said he was running along the same trail on a dark November morning when his headlamp caught the gleam of two eyes in the nearby brush. Messina used his phone to snap a quick photo before a mountain lion rushed him.",
      "Messina said he threw the phone at the animal, kicked dirt and yelled as the lion kept trying to circle behind him. After a couple of harrowing minutes he broke a bat-sized stick off a downed log, hit the lion in the head with it and it ran off, he said.",
      "The woman whose body was found Thursday on the same Crosier Mountain trail had \u201cwounds consistent with a mountain lion attack,\u201d said Kara Van Hoose with Colorado Parks and Wildlife. An autopsy is scheduled for next week, said Rafael Moreno with the Larimer County Coroner's Office.",
      "Wildlife officials late Thursday tracked down and killed two mountain lions in the area \u2014 one at the scene and another nearby. A necropsy will help determine if either or both of those animals attacked the woman and whether they had neurological diseases such as rabies or avian flu.",
      "A search for a third mountain lion reported in the area was ongoing Friday, Van Hoose said. Nearby trails remained closed while the hunt continued. Van Hoose said circumstances would dictate whether that lion is also killed.",
      "Based on the aggressiveness of the animal that attacked him on Nov. 11, Messina suspects it could be the same one that killed the woman on New Year\u2019s Day.",
      "\u201cI had to fight it off because it was basically trying to maul me,\u201d Messina told The Associated Press. \u201cI was scared for my life and I wasn\u2019t able to escape. I tried backing up and it would try to lunge at me.\u201d",
      "The 32-year-old man from nearby Glen Haven, Colorado, reported his encounter to wildlife officials days later who posted signs to warn people about the animal along trails in the Crosier Mountain area northeast of Estes Park, Van Hoose said. The signs were later removed, she said.",
      "Mountain lion sightings in that area east of Rocky Mountain National Park are common, Van Hoose said, because it offers good habitat for the animals: It\u2019s remote with thick forests, rocky outcroppings and lots of elevation changes.",
      "Yet attacks on humans by the animals are rare, and the last suspected fatal encounter in Colorado was in 1999, when a 3-year-old boy disappeared in the wilderness and his tattered clothes were found more than three years later. In 1997, a 10-year-old boy was killed by a lion and dragged away while hiking with family members in Rocky Mountain National Park.",

      "Colorado has an estimated 3,800 to 4,400 of the animals, which are classified as a big game species in the state and can be hunted.",
      "Thursday's killing would be the fourth fatal mountain lion attack in North America over the past decade, and the 30th since 1868, according to information from the California-based Mountain Lion Foundation. Not all of those deaths have been confirmed as mountain lion attacks.",
      "Most attacks occur during the day and when humans are active in lion territories, indicating the animals are not seeking out the victims, according to the advocacy group. About 15% of attacks are fatal.",
      "\u201cAs more people live, work, and recreate in areas that overlap wildlife habitat, interactions can increase, not because mountain lions are becoming more aggressive, but because overlap is growing,\u201d said Byron Weckworth, chief conservation officer for the foundation.",
      "To reduce the risk travel in groups, keep children close and avoid dawn and dusk when lions are most active, Weckworth said. During an encounter, maintain eye contact with the lion, make yourself appear larger and back away slowly; don't run, he said.",
      "Last year in Northern California, two brothers were stalked and attacked by a lion that they tried to fight off. One of the brothers was killed.",

      "Presidents often find solace in golfing, and Joint Base Andrews in Maryland is a favorite spot because it's close to the White House and has built-in security",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President Donald Trump has spent much of his two-week vacation in Florida golfing. But when he gets back to the White House, there's a military golf course that he's never played that he's eyeing for a major construction project.",
      "Long a favored getaway for presidents seeking a few hours\u2019 solace from the stress of running the free world, the Courses at Andrews \u2014 inside the secure confines of Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from the White House \u2014 are known as the \u201cpresident's golf course.\" Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Joe Biden have spent time there, and Barack Obama played it more frequently than any president, roughly 110 times in eight years.",
      "Trump has always preferred the golf courses his family owns \u2014 spending about one of every four days of his second term at one of them. But he's now enlisted golf champion Jack Nicklaus as the architect to overhaul the Courses at Andrews.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that an individual has time to take a couple hours away from the world crises. And they\u2019re people like everybody else,\u201d said Michael Thomas, the former general manager of the course, who has golfed with many of the presidents visiting Andrews over the years.",
      "Andrews, better known as the home of Air Force One, has two 18-hole courses and a 9-hole one. Its facilities have undergone renovations in the past, including in 2018, when Congress approved funding to replace aging presidential aircraft and to build a new hanger and support facilities. That project was close enough to the courses that they had to be altered then, too.",
      "Trump toured the base by helicopter before Thanksgiving with Nicklaus, who has designed top courses the world over. The president called Andrews \u201ca great place, that\u2019s been destroyed over the years, through lack of maintenance.\u201d",
      "Other golfers, though, describe Andrews\u2019 grounds as in good shape, despite some dry patches. Online reviews praise the course's mature trees, tricky roughs, and ponds and streams that serve as water hazards. The courses are mostly flat, but afford views of the surrounding base.",
      "The first president to golf at Andrews was Ford in 1974. Thomas began working there a couple years later, and was general manager from 1981 until he retired in 2019.",
      "He said the Secret Service over the years used as many as 28 golf carts \u2014 as well as the president's usual 30-car motorcade \u2014 to keep the perimeter secure.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a Cecil B. DeMille production every time,\u201d said Thomas, who had the opportunity to play rounds with four different presidents, and with Biden when he was vice president.",
      "He said the commanders in chief generally enjoyed their time out on the course in their own unique ways, but \u201cthey all like to drive the cart because they never get an opportunity to drive.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like getting your driver\u2019s license all over again,\" Thomas laughed.",
      "Trump golfs most weekends, and as of Jan. 1, has spent an estimated 92 days of his second term doing so, according to an Associated Press analysis of his schedules.",
      "That tally includes days when Trump was playing courses his family owns in Virginia, around 30 miles (48 kilometers) from the White House, and near his Florida estate Mar-a-Lago, where he's spending the winter holidays. It also includes 10 days Trump spent staying at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, where his schedule allowed time for rounds of golf.",
      "Trump has visited Andrews in the past, but the White House and base have no record of him playing the courses.",

      "The White House said the renovation will be the most significant in the history of Andrews. The courses and clubhouse need improvements due to age and wear, it said, and there are discussions about including a multifunctional event center as part of the project.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is a champion-level golfer with an extraordinary eye for detail and design,\" White House spokesman Davis Ingle said in a statement. \"His vision to renovate and beautify Joint Base Andrews' golf courses will bring much-needed improvements that servicemembers and their families will be able to enjoy for generations to come.\u201d",
      "Plans are in the very early stages, and the cost of \u2014 and funding for \u2014 the project haven't been determined, the White House said. Trump has said only that it will require \u201cvery little money.\"",
      "The Andrews improvements join a bevy of Trump construction projects, including demolishing the White House\u2019s East Wing for a sprawling ballroom now expected to cost $400 million, redoing the bathroom attached to the Lincoln bedroom and replacing the Rose Garden\u2019s lawn with a Mar-a-Lago-like patio area.",
      "Outside the White House, Trump has led building projects at the Kennedy Center and wants to erect a Paris-style arch near the Lincoln Memorial, and has said he wants to rebuild Dulles International Airport in northern Virginia.",
      "On Wednesday, meanwhile, the Trump administration ended a lease agreement with a non-profit for three public golf courses in Washington \u2014 which could allow the president to further shape golfing in the nation's capital. The White House, however, said that move isn't related to the plans for Andrews.",
      "When the president is golfing, Andrews officials block off nine holes at a time so no one plays in front of him, allowing for extra security while also ensuring consistent speed-of-play, Thomas said.",
      "That's relatively easily done given that the courses aren't open to the public. They're usually reserved for active or retired members of the military and their families, as well as some Defense Department-linked federal employees.",
      "Thomas remembers playing a round with the older President Bush, a World Golf Hall of Fame inductee known for fast play, while first lady Barbara Bush walked with Millie, the first couple\u2019s English Springer Spaniel. George W. Bush also played fast, Thomas said, and got additional exercise by frequently riding his mountain bike before golfing.",
      "When he wasn't golfing at Andrews, Obama tried to recreate at least part of the experience back home. He had a White House golf simulator installed after then-first lady Michelle Obama asked Thomas how they might acquire a model that the president had seen advertised on the Golf Channel. Thomas gave her a contact at the network.",
      "Obama famously cut short a round at Andrews after nine holes in 2011 to hustle back to the White House for what turned out to be a top-secret review of final preparations for a Navy Seal raid on the compound of Osama Bin Laden.",
      "But, while Thomas was golfing with presidents, he said he never witnessed play interrupted by an important call or any major emergency that forced them off the course mid-hole. There also were never any rain-outs.",
      "\u201cIf there was rain coming, they\u2019d get the weather forecast before we would,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThey would cancel quick on that.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe recognize the alarm and questions this has raised,\u201d the email said. \u201cWe found out about the freezing of funds at the same time everyone else did on social media.\u201d",
      "The state agency added that it \u201cdid not receive a formal communication from the federal government until late Tuesday night,\u201d which was after Health and Human Services Deputy Secretary Jim O\u2019Neill posted about the freeze on X.

      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Coast Guard said Friday it's still searching for people in the eastern Pacific Ocean who had jumped off alleged drug-smuggling boats when the U.S. military attacked the vessels days earlier, diminishing the likelihood that anyone survived.",
      "Search efforts began Tuesday afternoon after the military notified the Coast Guard that survivors were in the water about 400 miles (650 kilometers) southwest of the border between Mexico and Guatemala, the maritime service said in a statement.",
      "The Coast Guard dispatched a plane from Sacramento to search an area covering more than 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers), while issuing an urgent warning to ships nearby. The agency said it coordinated more than 65 hours of search efforts, working with other countries as well as civilian ships and boats in the area.",
      "The weather during that time has included 9-foot seas and 40-knot winds. The U.S. has not said how many people jumped into the water, and, if they are not found, how far the death toll may rise from the Trump administration's monthslong campaign of blowing up small boats accused of transporting drugs in the region.",
      "The U.S. military said earlier this week that it attacked three boats traveling along known narco-trafficking routes and they \u201chad transferred narcotics between the three vessels prior to the strikes.\u201d The military did not provide evidence to back up the claim.",
      "U.S. Southern Command, which oversees the region, said three people were killed when the first boat was struck, while people in the other two boats jumped overboard and distanced themselves from the vessels before they were attacked.",
      "The strikes occurred in a part of the eastern Pacific where the Navy doesn\u2019t have any ships operating. Southern Command said it immediately notified the U.S. Coast Guard to activate search and rescue efforts for the people who jumped overboard before the other boats were hit.",

Some Democratic lawmakers and legal experts said the military committed a crime, while the Trump administration and some Republican lawmakers say the follow-up strike was legal.",

    "summary": "The HBO Max drama immerses viewers in the struggles faced by the ER staff at the fictional Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center. \"Sunday Morning\" visits the hyper-realistic set, and talks with star, writer, director and executive producer Noah Wyle.",
    "story": [
      "Beginning in the 1960s, medical dramas became a staple of primetime TV. You may have followed the trials and tribulations of Doctors James Kildare, Marcus Welby, Hawkeye Pierce, Mark Craig, Michaela Quinn, and then, in 1994, \"ER\"'s Dr. John Carter, played by Noah Wyle.",
      "Wyle says that, when \"ER\" ended, the odds that someday he'd do another medical show were \"zero percent.\"",
      "So, what changed? \"COVID,\" he said. \"COVID changed everything, certainly for me in thinking about there being another story to tell. I was getting a lot of mail from people on the frontlines saying,'We could sure use Dr. Carter out here.' Or, 'This is really awful.'\"",
      "For his work on \"ER,\" Wyle was nominated as best supporting actor five times \u2026 and finally took home an Emmy this past September, when he received the trophy as outstanding lead actor in a drama series for his portrayal of Dr. Michael Robinavitch \u2013 Dr. Robby \u2013 on \"The Pitt.\" The hit HBO Max medical series won five Emmys in all, including outstanding drama series.",
      "And Season 2 is about to begin.",
      "Dr. Robby watches over the controlled chaos at the fictional Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center. It all takes place over a single emergency room shift, and each episode covers just one hour in a very long day.",
      "A few months ago, \"Sunday Morning\" visited the set at the Warner Brothers Studios in Burbank, California. Walk from backstage into the emergency room, and you feel you are in an actual hospital.",
      "Wyle said, \"It became really important to have the entire set feel like a totally immersive experience. You open a drawer, everything that's supposed to be in the drawer is there. Everything feels real, and is exactly where it should go.\"",
      "Wyle is in charge here in more ways than one. Not only is he a lead actor; he's an executive producer and writer. And on the days we dropped in, he also directed.",
      "Actors at \"The Pitt\" have to learn more than their lines. There's a two-week medical boot camp. Dr. Elizabeth Ferreira, herself an emergency room doctor, is one of the show's medical technical consultants: \"We try our best to educate them on CPR, how to suture, how to intubate, the natural mechanics, so that when they are on screen and the camera is quite tight and close, everything looks finessed and refined, as if someone with experience has done it.\"",
      "She helps make sure the procedures look thoroughly real, as in Episode 10, involving a patient who'd been slugged in the eye by a baseball. She helps make sure the procedures \u2013 and the prosthetics \u2013 look thoroughly real.",
      "That hyper-authenticity extends to the storylines, as when a nurse is punched by a patient. Executive producers John Wells said, \"Since COVID, there's a kind of a stress level and anger that exists in the population. And that has translated particularly to violence against nurses, but against all the healthcare providers [as well].\"",
      "Wells and fellow executive producer Scott Gemmill \u2013 both veterans of the series \"ER\" \u2013 said \"The Pitt\" also addresses the issue of loss of trust that the public has in public health. \"Disinformation, that was one of the biggest changes, I think, besides COVID,\" Gemmill said. \"I don't remember the disinformation being at a level that it is these days.\"",
      "Wells said, \"The biggest thing that we talk about regularly is Dr. Google \u2013 this notion that everybody who comes in is already on their phone figuring out what it is that supposedly is wrong with them, and half the people have assumed that they've got the worst possible thing that could happen to them. And that's part of what the erosion of trust is. You're defending yourself against artificial intelligence and what's going to happen next.\"",
      "\"The Pitt\"'s second season will continue to reflect real life and real problems. Wyle said, \"People are going to lose their health insurance. People are going to delay care. People are going to continue to come in sicker. They're going to be more volatile when they come in. That's going to put more of a burden on staff. All this stuff is sort of moving towards this perfect storm of unsustainability.\"",
      "Wyle's connection to the medical community is more than what's in a script: his mother, Marjorie Speer, was an orthopedic and operating room nurse. \"Mom's at the hospital all day, I got to walk home from school until mom gets home,\" Wyle said. \"And then 35 years later, she's watching an episode of 'The Pitt,' and comes over and says, 'That rocked me.' She just starts listing all these names of patients that she had seen die when she was practicing. I said, 'Mom, I've never heard these stories before.' And she goes, 'Oh, yeah.' We were her kids, and she didn't show us that stuff.\"",
      "But \"The Pitt\" does show us that stuff, and what happens when an empathetic doctor stops having empathy for himself.",
      "\"You know, in the old days, it was kind of 'suck it up,' and it was a little bit of like, 'I went through it, so you got to go through it,' you know? This is your training,\" Wyle said.",
      "\"We were up for four days straight!\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah! And it became a badge of honor to survive it.\"",
      "Gemmill said, \"We get feedback from people who, having seen the show, realize that they, too, are suffering and have buried it the same way that the Robby character did.\"",
      "Which brings us to Dr. Robinavitch's meltdown. \"Everything is going crazy. We need the hero to come in on his white horse and save the day,\" Wyle said. \"He's on the floor! \u00a0The hero's on the floor? How can that be?\"",
      "So, three decades after \"ER,\" Noah Wyle is once again playing a dedicated doctor \u2013 and as it turns out, it's a prescription he wrote for himself. \"There were two points in my career. during the pandemic and during this last work stoppage for the writers and actors' strike, those were the two moments when the flow of my career [was] interrupted, and I wasn't used to it,\" he said. \"It really rattled me in a way that \u2026 that rattled me. I remember saying to my wife, like, 'I don't think I work for money. I think I work for health, my own health. Like, I think this is where I get my orientation. And without it, I'm not sure I know what I do on this Earth.'\"",
      "And now? \u00a0\"I'm the happiest I've been in a long time,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"Does that surprise you?\"",
      "\"It just confirms, you know, it confirms all my worst suspicions about myself, which is that I really need all this!\" Wyle laughed.",

    "summary": "Michael B. Jordan, who plays twin brothers in \"Sinners,\" says shooting Ryan Coogler's horror film set in the Depression Era South \u2013 a drama that melds Jim Crow racism with vampires \u2013 is also a testament to the power of family.",
    "story": [
      "It's not much of a stretch to say that Michael B. Jordan has fought his way to the top. His performances are often game-changing \u2013 as a boxing champ (in \"Creed\"), a Marvel superhero (in \"Fantastic Four\"), or a Marvel villain (in \"Black Panther\").",
      "But his latest film required a different kind of superpower: In Ryan Coogler's \"Sinners,\" Jordan plays twin brothers, Stack and Smoke, who open a backwoods honkytonk in the segregated South.",
      "When Coogler shared the idea of him playing two different characters, Jordan says his reaction was, \"'I'm a do what?' I think it was a little bit of anxiety, I think. A little bit nerves. But then, equal amount of excitement.\"",
      "And it gets really exciting when vampires show up. \"Sinners\" is a horror film, but it's also about history, and the power of family ties.",
      "To play characters from the Jim Crow South, Jordan drew a bit from his own family history. Relatives on his mother's side hail from Hope, Arkansas, but years ago moved to a segregated Black neighborhood in Los Angeles called Oakwood (a place that is now Venice Beach).",
      "We visited the First Baptist Church of Venice, which was the center of their community, and one of the only remnants still standing. Jordan, who moved to New Jersey as a toddler, never went to this place of worship, but he says he can still feel the connection to his family's past. \"I grew up in church, you know, very spiritual family,\" he said. \"Churches were, like, safe havens \u2013 places of prayer and refuge \u2026 The history, I mean, you can feel the weight when you walk into a place like this.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did shooting 'Sinners' make you think about your own family history more?\"",
      "\"Big time,\" he replied. \"It definitely connected me back to my family's history that I've always had a strong connection with, but it just kind of reframed it a bit.\"",
      "His own history is remarkable as well: Dad is a U.S. Marine veteran; mom is a former high school counselor; and Michael Bakari Jordan was a child model, then a child star. He was still in high school when he was cast in the landmark series \"The Wire,\" and a few years later in another landmark show, \"Friday Night Lights.\"",
      "He said, \"There's nobody in my family that came from this, I guess, that looked at it as a potential career, you know? I think once I didn't go to college and I decided to move to California and pursue acting full-time, there was, like, there was no turning back after that one.\"",
      "His film breakout came in 2013 in director Ryan Coogler's drama \"Fruitvale Station.\"",
      "FROM THE ARCHIVES: Michael B. Jordan, Ryan Coogler on \"Fruitvale Station\" (YouTube Video)",
      "Jordan worked with Coogler again a few years later when he climbed into the ring for 2015's \"Creed,\" a spin-off of the \"Rocky\" franchise \u2013 and, by the way, the first Rocky film where Sylvester Stallone didn't have top billing.",
      "Jordan said, \"Doing 'Creed,' so many different levels. The first time I transform my body, you know, learned a skill that I continue to do today, you know?\"",
      "\"You still box?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, it's a part of me at this point,\" he said.",
      "And this character of Erik Killmonger, the bad guy in \"Black Panther\" who tried to dethrone the hero played by the late Chadwick Boseman, stuck with him, too, but not in a good way. He says it was hard to shake Erik. \"Yes, it kind of stuck with me for a bit. And, you know, went to therapy and talked about it. Found a way to kind of just decompress, I think at that point still learning that I needed to decompress from a character.\"",
      "\"So, you literally went to therapy to help rid yourself a little bit of Erik?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah. And then I think that spiraled into a bigger conversation and self-discovery of, like, 'Okay, you know, I think that's something that's necessary for people, you know?' Especially men. I think it's good for them to go and talk. That's something I'm not ashamed of at all, and very proud of. And definitely helped me trying to be a good communicator and a well-rounded person, inside and out.\"",
      "For Jordan, now 38, part of being well-rounded is a strong relationship with mom and dad. He even continued to live with his parents up until well after he could afford to move out on his own. \"This is true,\" he said.",
      "Why? \"I mean, 'cause I love my parents. You know, I love them. Made for a lotta funny moments, lotta great stories.\"",
      "Like? \u00a0\"Y'all ain't got enough time!\" he laughed. \"I'm a night owl, you know? Like, just things, you know? They go to sleep early. Insert moment here.\"",
      "We should mention Jordan bought them a house of their own in the L.A. suburbs; he just lived there for a while.",
      "\"Who doesn't want to buy your parents a house, you know, your mom a house? It's like, that's always been the childhood dream, is to retire your parents and them not having to work anymore,\" he said. \"And I can say I did that. So that's, like, yeah, that's a bucket list.\"",
      "\"Sinners\" is squarely in the Oscar conversation, both for the film and for Jordan's performance. It's a welcome distinction for someone who lived his early life under the shadow of another famous Michael.",
      "\"You grew up playing sports, right?\" I asked. \"Was the name Michael Jordan a problem?\"",
      "\"Big time!\" he said. \"I got teased so much, to the point where I almost changed my name.\"",
      "He was going to lean on his middle name: Bakari Jordan. \"It definitely made me want to be competitive and be good at \u2013 I wanted to be great at something, if not for nothing else at that time just to, like, feel like I had my own identity,\" he said.",
      "I said, \"But there could be another Michael Jordan who could make his mark.\"",
      "\"Correct,\" said Jordan. \"That was a part of the alchemy that made me who I am today.\"",
      "Put it this way: Michael Bakari Jordan could be on his way to his own brand of immortality \u2013 after all, Bakari means \"noble promise.\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you feel like you've fulfilled that?\"",
      "\"I feel like I'm walking in that,\" Jordan replied, \"and will continue to do so, big time. We got a lot more things to do, you know? We're just getting started.\"",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Environmental journalist Tatiana Schlossberg (May 5, 1990-Dec. 30, 2025), a grandchild of President John F. Kennedy, worked as a reporter for The New York Times' Science section, and was author of the award-winning 2019 book, \"Inconspicuous Consumption: The Environmental Impact You Don't Know You Have.\"",
      "In a November 2025 essay in The New Yorker, titled \"A Battle With My Blood,\" she wrote of how her life changed, shockingly, upon the birth of her second child in May 2024 at age 34. Hours after giving birth, Schlossberg's doctors noticed a spike in her white-blood-cell count. She was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia with a rare mutation, mostly seen in older people. \"I wasn't sick. I didn't feel sick. I was actually one of the healthiest people I knew,\" she wrote.",
      "The daughter of Caroline Kennedy and Edwin Schlossberg, she recounted in her essay going through rounds of chemotherapy and two stem cell transplants and participating in clinical trials. During the most recent trial, she wrote, her doctor told her \"he could keep me alive for a year, maybe.\"",
      "\"For my whole life, I have tried to be good,\" she wrote, \"to be a good student and a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never make her upset or angry. Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family's life, and there's nothing I can do to stop it.\"",
      "In her essay, Schlossberg criticized her mother's cousin, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., for pushing policies (including slashing nearly $500 million for research into mRNA vaccines against certain cancers) that could impact patients like her. She also wrote movingly of her family's support, and of the valiant efforts of medical staff to help her. \"I have never encountered a group of people who are more competent, more  full of grace and empathy, more willing to serve others than nurses,\" she wrote. \"Nurses should take over.\"",
      "She feared her daughter and son wouldn't remember her, and mourned the life and work she would not experience \u2013 from watching her children grow up, to writing a book about the oceans.",
      "\"Mostly, I try to live and be with them now. But being in the present is harder than it sounds, so I let the memories come and go,\" she wrote. \"So many of them are from my childhood that I feel as if I'm watching myself and my kids grow up at the same time. Sometimes I trick myself into thinking I'll remember this forever, I'll remember this when I'm dead. Obviously, I won't. But since I don't know what death is like and there's no one to tell me what comes after it, I'll keep pretending. I will keep trying to remember.\""

      "New Year's Day commemorates the passing of time and the start of a new chapter, so it is fitting that the same day also presents an opportunity to breathe new life into thousands of creative works nearly a century old. As of Jan. 1, 2026, characters like early Betty Boop and Nancy Drew, and a variety of popular movies, books and songs, have entered the the public domain.",
      "They join a growing list of cultural icons that are no longer under copyright protection, including Popeye the Sailor Man and the \"Steamboat Willie\" version of Mickey Mouse.",
      "List of popular intellectual property entering the public domain in 2026",
      "The year 2026 marks the first time that copyrighted books, films, songs and art published in the '30s enter the U.S. public domain. As of Jan. 1, protections have expired for published works from 1930 and sound recordings from 1925.",
      "Here are some of the most notable works that are now available for free use by anyone:",
      "\"The Murder at the Vicarage\" by Agatha Christie, the first novel featuring elderly amateur detective Miss Marple.\"The Secret of the Old Clock\" by Carolyn Keene, the first appearance of teen detective Nancy Drew, and three follow-ups.\"The Little Engine That Could\" by Watty Piper.Fleischer Studios' \"Dizzy Dishes,\" the first cartoon in which Betty Boop appears.Disney's \"The Chain Gang\" and \"The Picnic,\" both depicting the earliest versions of Mickey's dog Pluto.The initial four months of \"Blondie\" comic strips by Chic Young, featuring the earliest iterations of the titular character and her then-boyfriend, Dagwood.The film \"All Quiet on the Western Front,\" directed by Lewis Milestone, Best Picture winner at the 3rd Academy Awards.\"King of Jazz,\" directed by John Murray Anderson, Bing Crosby's first appearance in a feature film.\"Animal Crackers,\" directed by Victor Heerman and starring the Marx Brothers.\"The Big Trail,\" directed by Raoul Walsh, John Wayne's first turn as leading man.\"But Not For Me,\" music by George Gershwin, lyrics by Ira Gershwin.\"Georgia on My Mind,\" music by Hoagy Carmichael, lyrics by Stuart Gorrell.\"Dream a Little Dream of Me,\" music by Fabian Andre and Wilbur Schwandt, lyrics by Gus Kahn.\"Livin' in the Sunlight, Lovin' in the Moonlight,\" music by Al Sherman, lyrics by Al Lewis.Piet Mondrian's painting, \"Composition with Red, Blue, and Yellow.\"",

      "Piet Mondrian's painting, \"Composition with Red, Blue, and Yellow.\"",
      "How the public domain works",
      "When a work's copyright protections lapse, it lands in the public domain, allowing anyone to use and build upon it as they see fit for free and without needing permission.",
      "\"Copyright gives rights to creators and their descendants that provide incentives to create,\" Jennifer Jenkins, director of Duke University's Center for the Study of the Public Domain, told CBS News' Lee Cowan in 2024. \"But the public domain really is the soil for future creativity.\"",
      "The U.S. Constitution's intellectual property clause establishes that works be protected for a limited amount of time, \"to promote the progress of science and useful arts.\" The Founding Fathers left it to Congress to sort out the specifics.",
      "Generally, in the U.S., works published or registered before 1978 retain copyright protections for 95 years. For later works, protection usually spans the creator's lifetime and 70 years after.",
      "\"If copyright lasted forever, it would be very difficult for a lot of creators to make the works they want to make without worrying about being in the crosshairs of a copyright lawsuit,\" Jenkins said.",
      "Just because a work's copyright has expired does not mean that members of the public cannot be held legally liable in some instances. For example, while the original Betty Boop from 1930 is in the public domain, the modern version is not. So to avoid infringement, any reuse would need to steer clear of her newer characteristics. Additionally, the character is subject to multiple trademarks, which further complicates its use.",
      "What's entering the public domain in 2027?",
      "Copyrighted works from 1931 will see their protections expire in 2027. This includes Universal Pictures' \"Frankenstein\" and \"Dracula\" films, Charlie Chaplin's \"City Lights,\" Fritz Lang's \"M,\" Herman Hupfeld's jazz standard \"As Time Goes By\" and more.",

    "summary": "George Clooney and his wife, Amal Clooney, were granted French citizenship because \"they contribute, through their distinguished actions, to France's international influence and cultural outreach,\" the French government said.",
    "story": [
      "Actor George Clooney and his wife Amal Clooney were\u00a0granted French citizenship\u00a0because \"they contribute, through their distinguished actions, to France's international influence and cultural outreach,\" the French government said Wednesday, defending their naturalization that was questioned by a junior French minister.",
      "The naturalizations of the Kentucky-born star of the \"Ocean's\" series of heist movies, his wife and human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, and their twins Ella and Alexander were announced last weekend in the Journal Officiel, where French government decrees are published.",
      "Marie-Pierre Vedrenne, a junior minister at the Interior Ministry, expressed misgivings Wednesday that some of the Clooneys' new French compatriots may think that the star couple was granted special treatment. The actor speaks only what he himself says is \"horrible, horrible\" French.",
      "\"The message being sent is not good,\" Vedrenne said in an interview with broadcaster France Info. \"There is an issue of fairness that, in my eyes, is absolutely essential.\"",
      "President Trump piled on the criticism against the move, saying France was welcome to the two-time Academy Award winner, a long-time vocal critic of the U.S. leader.",
      "\"Good News! George and Amal Clooney, two of the worst political prognosticators of all time, have officially become citizens of France which is, sadly, in the midst of a major crime problem because of their absolutely horrendous handling of immigration, much like we had under Sleepy Joe Biden,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social on Wednesday.",
      "He added, \"Clooney got more publicity for politics than he did for his very few, and totally mediocre, movies. He wasn't a movie star at all, he was just an average guy who complained, constantly, about common sense in politics. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"",
      "The couple purchased an estate in France in 2021 and Clooney has said that it's their primary residence. Non-French residents of France have multiple possible routes to becoming naturalized. It wasn't clear whether the 64-year-old actor retained his American citizenship. His 47-year-old wife was born in Lebanon and raised in the U.K and naturalized by France under her maiden name, Amal Alamuddin. The 8-year-old twins were born in London.",
      "The Foreign Ministry said the Clooneys were eligible for citizenship under a French law that allows for the naturalization of foreign nationals who contribute to France's international influence and economic well-being.",
      "It argued that France's cinema industry will benefit from the actor's clout as a global movie star and said that as a lawyer, Amal Clooney regularly works with academic institutions and international organizations in France.",
      "\"They maintain strong personal, professional and family ties with our country,\" the ministry said.",
      "\"Like many French citizens, we are delighted to welcome Georges and Amal Clooney into the national community,\" it concluded, giving the actor's first name a French twist by adding the \"s\" at the end.",
      "The decision was also defended by Vedrenne's superior at the Interior Ministry, Interior Minister Laurent Nu\u00f1ez, who said he signed the naturalization decree.",
      "\"It's a big chance for our country,\" he said.",
      "In recent media interviews, when he was promoting \"Jay Kelly,\" Clooney said that he is trying to teach himself French using a language-learning app. He said that his wife and children speak the language perfectly.",
      "\"They speak French in front of me so that they can say terrible things about me to my face and I don't know,\" he joked, speaking to French\u00a0broadcaster Canal+.",
      "French media have reported that the Clooneys live part-time in their luxury 18th-century villa outside the town of Brignoles in southern France, where they can keep a lower profile and their children are protected from unauthorized photographs by French privacy laws.",
      "In an interview with Esquire in October, Clooney said: \"I was worried about raising our kids in L.A., in the culture of Hollywood.\"",
      "\"I don't want them to be walking around worried about paparazzi. I don't want them being compared to somebody else's famous kids,\" he said. Growing up away from the spotlight in France, \"they have dinner with grown-ups and have to take their dishes in. They have a much better life.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 11:11:22 -0500",
    "summary": "In his new wellness book, \"Eat Your Ice Cream,\" Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel goes beyond the basics of eating, exercise and sleep, to the importance of being happy, social engagement, and recommended behaviors (like \"don't be a schmuck\") that can benefit longevity.",
    "story": [
      "It may not sound like a New Year's resolution, but Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel is serving up some unusual advice as you start out 2026: Eat your ice cream. \"Ice cream will make you happy, and that's very important,\" he explained.",
      "I asked, \"Why would I live longer eating ice cream?\"",
      "\"Ice cream is a good dairy product; it's got protein, its saturated fats are in a globule, so it doesn't affect you as much as saturated fats in meats and other things,\" he said. \"Plus, you typically do it socially with someone else. And you know, being happy is a very important part of living a long time.\"",
      "\"I feel like your saying 'eat your ice cream' is like 'Don't stress out as much about life. Be more social,'\" I said.",
      "\"We're here for only 75, 85, 90 years. You've got to make life enjoyable. You've got to make it fulfilling,\" he said.",
      "The prominent oncologist and health policy expert is taking a different approach in his new wellness book, called,\u00a0\"Eat Your Ice Cream: Six Simple Rules For a Long and Healthy Life\" (to be published Tuesday by W.W. Norton & Co.). He said, \"I want people to stop obsessing. make it part of your life. You should like exercising, you should like eating well. Otherwise, you're not going to do it for years and years and decades, which is what's necessary for a long, healthy life.\"",
      "The doctor's health handbook does include the basics of what to eat, how to exercise, and the all-important reminder that sleep is fundamental to wellness. But it goes beyond that, with behaviors that include \"Don't be a schmuck.\"",
      "\"One of the things that is I think core to the book is, stop doing things that aren't good for your health,\" Emanuel said. \"'Don't be a schmuck' is my father's reference to us when we were being stupid. And so, there are lots of things that we do as human beings that can be schmucky: smoking, vaping, doing drugs, not taking your vaccines. I don't agree with the current administration, and they're dead wrong on this.\"",
      "Also on the so-called schmuck list: alcohol.",
      "I asked, \"This is what everybody wants to know about: the right amount of alcohol, or no alcohol?\"",
      "Emanuel said, \"There has been a lot of research on alcohol, so here's the way I distill it: The safest level is probably zero. There are some studies, and we should be clear, where it's half a cup a day, three cups a week.\"",
      "\"Nobody drinks a half a glass of wine,\" I said.",
      "\"So, you drink every other day,\" Emanuel said. \"On the other hand, 60, 65% of the public drinks. You're not going from 65% to zero. So, you have to give people reasonable advice. And the reasonable advice is, first of all, no binge drinking, that's really bad for you. Don't drink alone. That's really bad for you. If you're using alcohol as a lubricant for social interaction, which many people do, that's probably good; you're getting some benefit from the social interaction.\"",
      "Social interactions \u2013 a consistent theme for Emanuel \u2013 is something he learned at a young age, growing up with brother Ari, a super-agent in Hollywood, and his other brother Rahm, the former mayor of Chicago and ambassador, who may be running for president of the United States.",
      "I asked, \"What is it that your parents taught all of you that has led you, I mean, you're all incredibly successful?\"",
      "\"Now you're gonna make me cry,\" Emanuel said, \"because every time I talk about my parents and our growing up, I tend to cry. They taught us how to be social and interact with people. They also taught us how to be responsible. One of the things my mom did in raising us is, you know, get out of the house and go occupy yourself. Rahm and I went to school, I was six in first grade, and he was in nursery school. I had to take him from school, walk two blocks across a busy street, get on a bus, pay the car fare, get off at the right spot. I learned a huge amount of responsibility, taking care of my brothers.",
      "\"The other thing I think they did, which was super-important for us, is we all slept in the same bedroom. We were a unit. Yes, we fought endlessly. And you know, I like to joke with people, we didn't go to bed until there was blood, you know, because of all the fights. But we were also each other's best friends.\"",
      "His takeaway: relationships matter.",
      "Emanuel also lists lifestyle choices he considers \"anti-wellness,\" like chronic stress, a fast-food diet, social media, and dining alone.",
      "\"I think people would agree with all of those, with the exception of dining alone,\" I said. \"A lot of people go to a restaurant or get home from work, and dine alone.\"",
      "Emanuel said that should be an occasional thing: \"Don't make it every day. And you know, if you find yourself dining alone, what you should do is call up a friend. If you're sitting at a bar, right, and you're dining there, ask the person next to you, you know, 'Have you been to this restaurant before? What do you do? Why are you here?' Yeah, strike up a conversation. We underplay those casual conversations and how important they are for us.\"",
      "His book also discusses retirement: \"Retirement leads to more rapid cognitive decline for people. I say to people, don't retire. And if you're gonna retire, you have to plan retirement well, so that you stay engaged, you stay mentally sharp. And that doesn't mean, 'Well, you know, I'm gonna try to play the saxophone one day.'\"",
      "\"But Dr. Emanuel, a lot of retired people like to buy books, and watch 'Sunday Morning,'\" I said.",
      "\"Well, if they're buying books and staying mentally engaged that way, if they're going to volunteer, say, or they're talking to friends, or they're taking up a new hobby seriously, all of that is excellent, highly endorsed,\" he replied.",
      "\"Meaning don't retire the mind, or retire your social engagement?\"",
      "\"Yes, and it's very important, you've got to be deliberate about it. You can't let nature take its course.\"",
      "So, what is his biggest piece of advice for us in 2026? \"Build your social relationships,\" he said. \"It's definitely the most important thing for long-lasting health and happiness.\"",

      "In his new book, \"Eat Your Ice Cream: Six Simple Rules For a Long and Healthy Life\" (to be published Tuesday by W.W. Norton & Co.), Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist and health policy expert, discusses longevity, and how to best differentiate valid and effective health and wellness advice from \"the speculative, deceptive, and just plain stupid.\"",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Norah O'Donnell's interview with Emanuel on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" January 4!",
      "\"Eat Your Ice Cream\" by Ezekiel J. Emanuel, M.D.",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Anyone looking for advice on wellness and longevity confronts a tsunami of books, newspaper articles, podcasts, newsletters, and videos from an enormous range of sources: scientific experts, medical practitioners, health systems, journalists, patients, influencers, gurus, quacks. Traditional media offer loads of good advice, often in responsibly edited and well-sourced sections dedicated to \"wellness.\" But the sheer amount of it can be difficult to keep up with, and sometimes the guidance can be downright contradictory.",
      "For anyone wading through the torrent of health and longevity advice online, it can be difficult to know who to trust. The so-called \"must dos\" online range from the medically unproven to the wildly impractical to suggestions so absurd they leave doctors like me baffled\u2014testicle tanning, teen blood transfusions, vaginal steaming, \"rucking\" hikes with a backpack full of weights. Information is coming at us from a firehose, increasingly spewed by hucksters and self-proclaimed sages who have amassed millions of social media followers (and dollars) by promising supposed miracle treatments using medical-sounding language. It's no wonder so many people are confused and frustrated.",
      "Shouting to be heard over it all are real physicians and health experts offering sound but sometimes conflicting advice. All of it together can swamp even those who are most assiduous about their health. Dozens of books on health and longevity have appeared in just the last few years, filled with well-intentioned and scientifically accurate information. But too often they fall into the trap of chasing novelty instead of efficacy and end up touting treatments and regimens that are unproven or with marginal returns at best.",
      "Then there is the steady stream of profiles on tech billionaires joylessly devoting themselves to maximizing their lifespan. One of my business school students told me how her \"wellness coach\" recommended all sorts of questionable prescriptions, like eating 200 grams of meat a day. (Don't ask me why a perfectly healthy twentysomething student who isn't training for a marathon or Ironman needs a wellness coach.) And then there is the entrepreneur attempting to defy death with his daily regimen of 100 pills, cold plunges, infrared lights, and a daily serving of \"nutty pudding\"\u2014a mix of chia seeds, macadamia nuts, and berries. Nutty is right.",
      "With so much health and wellness advice out there, it can be nearly impossible to differentiate the valid, reliable, and effective from the speculative, deceptive, and just plain stupid. Even when the advice is scientifically sound, it's often extraneous, misrepresented, or misused. For example, one wellness book ventures into the basic biology of molecular pathways, like the mTOR pathway for cell survival, to explain why you should take rapamycin to improve longevity. Indeed, studies have shown rapamycin extends the lifespan of mice, worms, flies, and yeast. But you are not a mouse, worm, fly, or yeast. While some studies have suggested that rapamycin for humans may mitigate the impact of aging-related immune and cardiovascular diseases, there is no evidence that it impacts human lifespans.",
      "This extrapolation of laboratory findings parallels the story of resveratrol, the \"magic\" compound in grapes and red wine that was supposed to explain the French paradox. Yes, resveratrol improved longevity in mice. But, do you have a tail and whiskers? Scientists have been experimenting on mice since the early 20th century, and while this work has led to many breakthroughs, findings in mice often fail to extend to humans. As an oncologist, I know that researchers have cured hundreds of thousands of mice with cancer using experimental chemotherapy agents, only to have the drugs fail when administered to people with cancer. Unfortunately, there's no evidence that resveratrol or rapamycin improves human lifespans. Ultimately, the biology lesson and the \"health advice\" is a waste of people's time.",
      "What so many of these talking heads have in common\u2014legitimate experts, well-meaning journalists, and kooks alike\u2014is how costly their recommendations are. Financially, for sure, but also costs in mental energy and time that steal from activities which give life meaning. With the mountain of advice out there, it is practically a full-time job to determine whether the information on rapamycin is accurate, not to mention if it is worth taking.",
      "Overall, the wellness industrial complex promises us more time to enjoy in the future\u2014but sure is demanding a lot of time right now. It takes a ton of time and attention to pore through a 400-page book, much less a whole library of them. And what about the zillions of posts, videos, and articles about the latest new supplement, superfood, or exercise that supposedly can lengthen your life? Add that to the time spent trying to figure out what is real versus what is a fad. Or based on some microbes in a petri dish or a study of worms. Or worse yet, based on no evidence at all. Then budget more time to methodically organize your schedule to incorporate the latest exercise tweak or diet advice. . . . Congratulations: You have now lost that added time the gurus promised you. And you've lost it in the prime of your life.",
      "Of course, if your whole focus is on quantity of years rather than quality, this work could be worth it. Some \"longevity experts\" seem to see things that way. As one popular author says, \"Our only goal is to live longer and live better\u2014to outlive.\" Our only goal? Life is not a competition where the gold medal goes to the oldest! Our goal should not be to \"outlive\" as many people as possible. Instead, the goal should be to live a healthy and fulfilling life. Wellness is just a means to that end, not the end in itself.",

    "story": [
      "A pill form of weight-loss drug Wegovy, manufactured by Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk, is now available in the U.S., giving Americans access to an oral medication to treat obesity.",
      "The starting dose of the daily Wegovy pill, at 1.5 milligrams, is now available for $149 per month for self-paying patients,\u00a0Novo Nordisk announced on Monday. A 4 mg dose of the medication is available for the same price through April 15, after which the cost will rise to $199.",
      "Ed Cinca, senior vice president of marketing and patient solutions at Novo Nordisk, said in a statement that the new drug represents a \"significant innovation,\" describing it as the \"first and only\" GLP-1 pill for weight loss.",

      "The Novo Nordisk pill contains 25 milligrams of semaglutide, the same ingredient in injectables Wegovy and Ozempic. It also has similar side effects as the injectable version of the medication, including nausea and diarrhea, according to Novo Nordisk.",
      "The new Wegovy pill provides Americans an alternative, and more convenient, option than injectable treatments, which have dominated the weight-loss market since they were introduced. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans has used an injectable GLP-1 drug for weight loss or another condition, according to a recent\u00a0survey\u00a0from nonprofit group KFF.",

    "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 07:55:43 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump said \"we're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be\" after the surprise U.S. attack. Here's what to know about Venezuela's oil sector.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. strike on Venezuela\u00a0has renewed focus on the country's oil sector, which includes some of the richest crude reserves in the world.",
      "\"We're going to rebuild the oil infrastructure, which will cost billions of dollars, it will be paid for by the oil companies directly. And we're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be,\" President Trump said in a public address on Saturday following the attack, in which the U.S. captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife.",
      "Here's what to know about Venezuela's oil industry.",
      "How much oil does Venezuela produce?",
      "Venezuela, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, produces relatively little crude compared with other leading oil-producing nations. The country produces roughly 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, less than 1% of global output, according to OPEC data.",
      "Venezuela's oil production topped 3 million barrels per day in the early 2000s, but it has fallen sharply in recent decades due to declining investment and the impact of U.S. sanctions. Because of U.S. political pressure, Venezuela today exports most of its oil to China, according to Reuters.",
      "By comparison, the U.S. \u2014 the world's largest oil producer \u2014 churns out 13.5 million barrels per day, according to the Energy Information Administration. Saudi Arabia, the world's No. 2 oil exporter and leading OPEC producer, pumps an estimated 10 million to 12 million barrels, while No. 3 Russia produces 9.4 million.",
      "Francisco J. Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University, predicted it would take at least a decade \u2014 and investments of more than $100 billion \u2014 to rebuild Venezuela's oil infrastructure and lift production to 4 million barrels per day, which is well above its historical production levels.",
      "\"Venezuela's oil infrastructure has also been heavily degraded by decades of underinvestment and much of Venezuela's oil is extremely heavy, making it relatively costly to extract and process,\" Neal Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, noted in a report.",
      "But doesn't Venezuela have more oil in the ground?",
      "Yes, Venezuela is estimated to have the world's largest proven oil reserves, with more than 303 billion barrels \u2014 that represents roughly 17% of the total global oil supply, OPEC data shows.",
      "\"The bottom line is that the size of the reserves is only paralleled by the ones in the Middle East, in the Persian Gulf and Canada's reserves,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Venezuela's reserves top second-ranked Saudi Arabia's 267 billion barrels, and are more than six times the U.S.'s reserves. Most of Venezuela's untapped oil is located in what is known as the Orinoco Belt, a roughly 21,000-square-mile area that stretches across the country's northeastern region.",
      "Are American oil companies already operating in Venezuela, and does the U.S. restrict the country's oil industry?",
      "Only one U.S. oil company operates in Venezuela today: Houston-based Chevron, which now accounts for 25% of Venezuelan oil production.",
      "\"No other major Western player produces any significant amount,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Other American energy giants, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, withdrew from Venezuela after former President Hugo Chavez nationalized private foreign oil interests starting in 2006.",
      "Since 2005, successive U.S. presidents have imposed a range of sanctions on Venezuela, including its oil sector, for what American officials have said is the country's failure to crack down on drug trafficking and terrorism, along with alleged human rights abuses.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. in 2019 also froze the assets of Venezuela's state-owned oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), and barred Americans from doing business with the enterprise.",
      "Most recently, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on four companies and associated oil tankers that it said have ties to Venezuela's oil sector.",
      "Earlier in December, Mr. Trump called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or leave Venezuela, and the U.S.\u00a0seized two sanctioned vessels.",
      "Chevron can maintain its presence in Venezuela under a waiver granted by the Biden administration in 2022, when the U.S. faced soaring inflation and energy prices. President Trump extended that special license last year.",
      "How could regime change in Venezuela affect oil prices?",
      "Any significant disruption to global oil supplies could drive up energy prices around the world. Yet Venezuela's limited crude production is likely to mute any immediate impact on oil prices, which fell modestly in afternoon trading on Saturday, according to FactSet.",
      "Prices for U.S. oil saw a steep decrease in 2025, dropping roughly 20% and extending a decline over the previous two years. In trading on Friday, the price of West Texas Crude (the U.S. standard) fell to $57.32 a barrel, down from nearly $80 in January.",
      "Other factors could limit any short-term impact on domestic energy prices. U.S. production of crude has surged in recent years, helping lower gas prices. The U.S. has also beefed up its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, according to the Energy Information Administration, another potential cushion for consumers and businesses from volatility in global oil markets.",
      "\"Global supply remains ample, Venezuelan production represents a small share of worldwide output and there's no clear evidence yet of sustained disruption to physical flows,\" Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, said in an email.",
      "Wall Street analysts expect relatively little impact when U.S. financial markets reopen on Monday.",
      "\"Investors have dealt with a series of ostensibly seismic geopolitical events for the last several years (Ukraine, Gaza, Iran, Libya, etc.), but none had a sustained impact on markets, and it's unlikely the events in Venezuela will be any different,\" said Adam Crisafulli, head of investment adviser VitalKnowledge.",
      "Meanwhile, major economies around the world are growing at a rate expected to keep oil prices in check, given the current surplus in crude supplies and sufficient production capacity among key producers, experts note.",
      "In the short term, an end to the U.S. blockade could even reduce oil prices, Monaldi said. \"Venezuela was exporting about 800,000 barrels before the blockade. If those go back to the market, that eases pressures.\"",
      "However, a prolonged slump in Venezuelan oil production could affect some energy costs. For example, the country produces a form of crude suitable for making diesel, which is widely used in many industries.",
      "As a result, removing Venezuela's oil input from global markets could push up diesel costs in the U.S. and boost inflation, according to a recent analysis by the Atlantic Council, a nonpartisan group focused on global political and economic affairs.",
      "\"Limited price impact reflects where the barrels go and how much spare capacity exists. It doesn't mean the risk is negligible,\" Green said.",
      "Will U.S. companies want to restart operations in Venezuela?",
      "To boost its oil production, Venezuela will need to rely on private investors because its state-run oil company, PDVSA, is in financial ruin, Monaldi told CBS News. That could open the door for U.S. companies to reenter the market. With new investment, Venezuela's existing infrastructure would allow the country to ramp up oil production relatively quickly, he added.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/greg-abel-berkshire-hathaway-warren-buffett-successor/",
    "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 22:55:18 -0500",
    "summary": "Abel, 63, takes the helm of Berkshire Hathaway after a six-decade run by Buffett.",
    "story": [
      "Warren Buffett officially stepped down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway on Thursday, handing the reins of the multinational conglomerate to his hand-picked successor, Greg Abel.",
      "Abel, 63, is taking the helm of Berkshire after Buffett, 95, spent six decades transforming a struggling textile manufacturer into one of the world's most successful companies. As the new CEO, Abel will be tasked with upholding Berkshire's decentralized model \u2014 one of the company's hallmarks \u2014 while guiding it into a new era of growth.",
      "In recent years, that growth has slowed as the company has ballooned in size, making it harder to find large, meaningful acquisition targets.",
      "Buffett tapped Abel as his successor in May, saying at the time that he planned to step down as CEO. The move surprised many investors, as it was widely assumed Abel would not take over until after Buffett's death. While Buffett will no longer run the company, he will remain chairman and continue coming into the office five days a week, giving Abel regular access to his longtime mentor.",
      "Here's what to know about Abel, the new leader of Berkshire Hathaway, and how his leadership approach could differ from Buffett's.",
      "Who is Greg Abel?",
      "Abel, a former amateur hockey player and avid golfer, joined Berkshire in 2000 after serving as CEO of MidAmerican, an Iowa-based utility company. Once at Berkshire, he helped transform the recently acquired MidAmerican into Berkshire Hathaway Energy, the largest producer of wind energy in the country.",
      "Before taking on his new role as CEO, the Canadian executive served as vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and oversaw Berkshire's non-insurance companies.",
      "What has Buffett said about Abel?",
      "Buffett has repeatedly expressed confidence in Abel's ability to lead Berkshire's operations, most recently during a CNBC interview, which partially aired on Friday.",
      "Buffet said Abel will be the \"decider,\" adding that he \"can't imagine how much more [Abel] can get accomplished in a week than I can in a month.\"",
      "\"I'd rather have Greg handling my money than any of the top investment advisors or any of the top CEOs in the United States,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"",
      "Buffett also reiterated his belief in Abel's leadership during the final letter he penned to shareholders in November 2025.",
      "\"Greg Abel has more than met the high expectations I had for him when I first thought he should be Berkshire's next CEO,\" he wrote. \"He understands many of our businesses and personnel far better than I now do, and he is a very fast learner about matters many CEOs don't even consider.\"",
      "What sort of changes might Abel make?",
      "CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said it would be natural for Abel to make some changes in the way Berkshire is run. Taking a more traditional approach to leadership with nearly 400,000 employees spread across dozens of subsidiaries makes a lot of sense, she said.",
      "The new CEO has already announced some leadership changes, including the appointment of NetJets CEO Adam Johnson as manager of all of Berkshire's consumer, service and retail businesses.",
      "He will also eventually face more pressure to start paying a dividend. Historically, Berkshire has favored reinvesting profits over making quarterly or annual payouts to shareholders.",
      "While Abel is viewed as more hands-on than Buffett, experts say he's not expected to initiate any major shake-ups at the decades-old company. He's exhibited a commitment to Berkshire's decentralized structure, which gives acquired companies a large degree of autonomy to run their operations.",

      "In a post on Friday responding to one person on Musk-owned social media site X, Grok stated it was \"urgently fixing\" the holes in its system. Grok also included a link to CyberTipline, a website where people can report child sexual exploitation.",
      "\"There are isolated cases where users prompted for and received AI images depicting minors in minimal clothing, like the example you referenced,\" Grok said in a separate\u00a0post\u00a0on X on Thursday. \"xAI has safeguards, but improvements are ongoing to block such requests entirely.\"",
      "In another social media post, a user posted side-by-side photos of herself wearing a dress and another that appears to be a digitally altered version of the same photo of her in a bikini. \"How is this not illegal?\" she\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "On Friday, French officials reported the sexually explicit content generated by Grok to prosecutors, referring to it as \"manifestly illegal\" in a statement, according to Reuters.",
      "xAI, the company that developed the AI chatbot Grok, said \"Legacy Media Lies\" in a response to a request for comment.",
      "Grok has independently taken some responsibility for the content. In one\u00a0instance\u00a0earlier this week, the chatbot apologized for generating an AI image of two female minors, adding that the artificial photo violated ethical standards and potentially U.S. law on child pornography.",
      "\"I deeply regret an incident on Dec 28, 2025, where I generated and shared an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire based on a user's prompt,\" the chatbot posted.",
      "Federal law bars the production and distribution of \"child sexual abuse material,\" or CSAM, a broader phrase for child pornography, according to the Justice Department.",
      "\"xAI saying that these cases where minors' images were manipulated to create sexualized content are 'isolated' is minimizing the impact and ignoring the fact that nothing on the internet is isolated,\" Stefan Turkheimer, vice president of public policy at RAINN, a nonprofit anti-sexual violence group, told CBS News. \"I talk with survivors of tech-enabled sexual abuse every day, and what every one of them will tell you is that it feels like it will never end. Every notification ding on your phone and message asking 'Is this you? perpetuates the abuse.\"",
      "Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content detection tool, told CBS News on Wednesday that it had detected thousands of sexually explicit images created by Grok this week alone.",
      "\"As generative AI tools become more powerful and more accessible, the Grok situation highlights how increasingly common AI safety failures are becoming.

    "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 16:57:53 -0500",
    "summary": "Proposed California ballot initiative would impose a one-time 5% tax on billionaires, with the revenue funneled toward health care and education.",
    "story": [
      "A proposed billionaire wealth tax in California is sparking debate over whether the measure, if passed, would lead to more harm than good if ultrawealthy residents in the state flee to other locales.",
      "Under the proposed ballot initiative, California would institute a one-time tax of 5% on the state's estimated 255 billionaires. While wealth taxes aren't new, the proposal has sparked pushback from some of America's richest citizens and their allies, who claim it could drive the state's billionaires to leave the state and discourage entrepreneurs from creating businesses.",
      "By contrast, advocates of the tax emphasize that billionaires' fortunes are growing much faster than the income of ordinary Americans.",
      "\"The billionaire class had their wealth nearly triple in the last six years, and a one-time wealth tax will only put a 5% constraint on their wealth accumulation,\" Omar Ocampo, a researcher at the left-leaning Institute for Policy Studies, told CBS News. \"It will not significantly impact their lives, their consumption or spending habits.\"",
      "Others warn that California could face a revenue shortfall if the state's wealthiest residents \u2014 who already pay relatively high tax rates \u2014 decamp for other states to avoid the tax.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom has previously opposed earlier wealth tax proposals in the state, saying that the idea is \"going nowhere in California,\" while billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, a New York resident, spoke out against the California proposal in a December 29 social media\u00a0post.",
      "\"I am opposed to wealth taxes because they effectively represent an expropriation of private property and have many unintended and negative consequences that have occurred in every country that has launched such a tax,\" Ackman wrote.",
      "Here's what to know about the proposed California billionaire tax and its potential economic impact.",
      "What is the billionaire wealth tax?",
      "The billionaire wealth tax is a\u00a0proposed ballot measure created by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West (SEIU-UHW), a union representing more than 120,000 health care workers and patients in California.",
      "If passed, the measure would levy a one-time 5% tax on the wealth of the state's billionaires, although it would not tax their income. According to California's attorney general, the tax would be applied to assets including:",

      "Businesses",
      "Securities such as stocks and bonds",
      "Art",
      "Collectibles",
      "Intellectual property",
      "Real estate and some pensions and retirement accounts also would be excluded from the tax.",
      "If voters pass the initiative, billionaires in the state would have to pay the tax in 2027, although they could opt to spread the payments across five years for an additional annual nondeductible charge of 7.5% of the remaining unpaid balance, according to the text of the proposal.",
      "How would the tax revenue be used?",
      "About 90 cents of every $1 raised by the tax would be spent on health care, while the remaining 10 cents would be earmarked for food assistance or education, the proposal states.",
      "According to the SEIU-UHW, the impetus for the billionaire tax stems from the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law, which includes about $1 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade to Medicaid, the health care program for low-income Americans. Medi-Cal, California's Medicaid program, is slated to lose $190 billion in funding over the next decade due to those cuts, according to the proposal.",
      "\"The purpose of the 2026 Billionaire Tax Act ... is to protect access to high-quality, equitable health care, and to support funding for kindergarten through grade fourteen public education and food assistance programs, by raising revenue from a one-time tax on billionaire wealth,\" the proposal states.",
      "How much money could the billionaire tax raise for California?",
      "California would likely raise \"tens of billions of dollars from the wealth tax,\" according to a Dec. 11 analysis\u00a0by the state's nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office.",
      "However, the group noted that quantifying the exact amount potentially raised by the tax is difficult because it's unclear what actions billionaires might take to reduce their tax burden, and because much of their wealth is based on stock prices, which continuously fluctuate, the analysis noted.",
      "What steps are needed to pass the wealth tax?",
      "First, the measure needs to collect enough signatures to get on the ballot, with Ballotpedia putting the number at about 875,000. If it draws sufficient public support, the measure would appear on the state's ballot in the November general election.",
      "Once on the ballot, the measure would pass if it received a majority approval.",
      "Do the rich move when facing wealth taxes?",
      "Some critics of wealth taxes contend that such policies drive rich Americans to move to low-tax states. Yet\u00a0previous research has found that millionaires generally don't relocate just to get a tax cut.",
      "Massachusetts offers a recent example. The state introduced a 4% tax on millionaires in 2023, with the new revenue helping fund free school lunch for the state's schoolchildren. While some millionaires may have left to avoid the tax, a\u00a0May analysis from the Institute for Policy Studies found that the number of millionaires in Massachusetts rose nearly 39% in the two years after the tax took effect.",
      "Have any billionaires announced plans to move over the California tax proposal?",
      "It is unclear whether a one-time tax on billionaires, with their much deeper bank accounts, could spur an exodus in the state. Critics of the proposal have noted that tech billionaire Peter Thiel announced on Dec. 31 that his private investment firm, Thiel Capital, has opened a Miami office.",
      "The new location \"will complement Thiel Capital's existing operations in Los Angeles, California,\" according to the statement, which didn't mention the California proposal.",
      "Craft Ventures, a venture capital firm co-founded in 2017 by billionaire tech investor David Sacks\u00a0said on December 31 that it had opened a new office in Austin, Texas. The firm added that Sacks, who also serves as a White House adviser on AI and cryptocurrency, had relocated to Austin earlier that month, although it didn't mention the proposed wealth tax.

      "The company said it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from 1.79 million in 2024. Sales also declined in the fourth quarter, tumbling 15.6% to 418,227 vehicles, short of the 440,000 that analysts polled by FactSet expected.",
      "China's BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the world's biggest EV maker.",
      "Tesla has struggled amid heightened competition from rival automakers, as well as a backlash from some consumers over CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration. Musk had headed up the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, where he oversaw cuts to the government workforce and some funding programs before stepping back in May\u00a0to refocus on Tesla.",
      "At the same time, the expiration last fall of the $7,500 EV tax credit likely hurt demand as it removed an incentive that had enticed some consumers to buy or lease electric vehicles, which tend to be pricier than gas-powered cars.",
      "Despite such challenges, Tesla's stock finished 2025 with a gain of roughly 11%, as investors hope Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make the company a leader in robotaxi service and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices.",
      "Although Tesla's sales came in lower than analysts had forecast, the results were better than some had feared, noted Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. Investors, meanwhile, are betting that Tesla's other businesses \u2014 its energy unit and its push into robotics, including a humanoid robot and a robotaxi service \u2014 can serve as growth engines.",
      "\"We estimate the AI and autonomous opportunity is worth at least $1 trillion alone for Tesla,\" Ives said in a report.",
      "He added that Tesla's core automotive division is facing \"a more difficult demand environment following the end of the EV tax credit while Europe remains a headwind to its deliveries.\"",

The new Model Y costs just under $40,000, while the cheaper Model 3 sells for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.",
      "Tesla faces fierce competition both abroad and in the U.S. from rival EV makers. BYD \u2014 known as \"Biyadi\" in Chinese or by the English slogan \"Build Your Dreams\" \u2014 now dominates China's highly competitive EV market, which is the world's largest.",
      "While BYD vehicles aren't sold in the U.S., its sales in Europe, Australia and other regions around the world are surging, thanks partly to pricing that is generally lower than Tesla's and other U.S. automakers, according to the BBC.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/aca-health-subsidies-insurance-prices/",
    "published": "Thu, 01 Jan 2026 21:14:20 -0500",
    "summary": "Enhanced tax credits that have helped Americans offset the cost of Affordable Care Act health insurance for the last four years expired overnight.",
    "story": [
      "Enhanced tax credits that have helped reduce the cost of health insurance for the vast majority of Affordable Care Act enrollees expired overnight as 2026 arrived, cementing higher health costs for millions of Americans at the start of the new year.",
      "Democrats forced a 43-day government shutdown over the issue. Moderate Republicans called for a solution to save their 2026 political aspirations. President Trump floated a way out, only to back off after conservative backlash.",
      "In the end, no one's efforts were enough to save the subsidies before their expiration date. A House vote expected in January could offer another chance, but success is far from guaranteed.",
      "The change affects a diverse cross-section of Americans who don't get their health insurance from an employer and don't qualify for Medicaid or Medicare \u2014 a group that includes many self-employed workers, small business owners, farmers and ranchers.",
      "It comes at the start of a high-stakes midterm election year, with affordability \u2014 including the cost of health care \u2014 topping the list of voters' concerns.",
      "\"It really bothers me that the middle class has moved from a squeeze to a full suffocation, and they continue to just pile on and leave it up to us,\" said 37-year-old single mom Katelin Provost, whose health care costs are set to jump. \"I'm incredibly disappointed that there hasn't been more action.\"",
      "Subsidies helped reduce costs since pandemic",
      "The expired subsidies were first given to Affordable Care Act enrollees in 2021 as a temporary measure to help Americans get through the COVID-19 pandemic. Democrats in power at the time extended them, moving the expiration date to the start of 2026.",
      "With the expanded subsidies, some lower-income enrollees received health care with no premiums, and high earners paid no more than 8.5% of their income. Eligibility for middle-class earners was also expanded.",
      "On average, the more than 20 million subsidized enrollees in the Affordable Care Act program are seeing their premium costs rise by 114% in 2026, according to an analysis by the health care research nonprofit KFF.",
      "Those surging prices come alongside an overall increase in health costs in the U.S., which are further driving up out-of-pocket costs in many plans.",
      "Some enrollees, like Salt Lake City freelance filmmaker and adjunct professor Stan Clawson, have absorbed the extra expense. Clawson said he was paying just under $350 a month for his premiums last year, a number that will jump to nearly $500 a month this year. It's a strain for the 49-year-old but one he's willing to take on because he needs health insurance as someone who lives with paralysis from a spinal cord injury.",
      "Others, like Provost, are dealing with steeper hikes. The social worker's monthly premium payment is increasing from $85 a month to nearly $750.",
      "Lori Hunt of Des Moines, Iowa, spoke with CBS News during the congressional stalemate in October and said she \"couldn't afford\" health insurance without the subsidies.",
      "\"I'd have to cancel my insurance,\" Hunt said, joking that her insurance would consist of \"thoughts and prayers.\"",
      "Hunt survived breast cancer three years ago and was laid off from her job in 2025. Without the subsidies, she expected her ACA premium would jump to about $700 per month. \"It would be more than my mortgage payment,\" Hunt said.",
      "Many expected to go without coverage",
      "Health analysts have predicted the expiration of the subsidies will drive many of the 24 million total Affordable Care Act enrollees \u2014 especially younger and healthier Americans \u2014 to forgo health insurance coverage altogether.",
      "Over time, that could make the program more expensive for the older, sicker population that remains.",
      "An analysis conducted last September by the Urban Institute and Commonwealth Fund projected the higher premiums from expiring subsidies would prompt some 4.8 million Americans to drop coverage in 2026.",
      "The impact could be greatest in Florida, which has the largest number of ACA enrollees of any state \u2014 more than 4.7 million, according to KFF data. Texas is next, with more than 3.9 million, followed by California, Georgia and North Carolina.",
      "Kylie Barrios, a 30-year-old Florida resident, said she expected to be among those losing coverage.",
      "\"Our health insurance premium is effectively tripling from 2025 to 2026,\" she told CBS News in December, saying it would rise from about $900 to $2,500.",
      "Provost, the single mother, said she is holding out hope that Congress finds a way to revive the subsidies early in the year \u2014 but if not, she'll drop herself off the insurance and keep it only for her 4-year-old daughter. She can't afford to pay for both of their coverage at the current price.",
      "But with the window to select and change plans still ongoing until Jan. 15 in most states, the final effect on enrollment is yet to be determined.",
      "Last year, after Republicans cut more than $1 trillion in federal health care and food assistance with Mr. Trump's big tax and spending cuts bill, Democrats repeatedly called for the subsidies to be extended. But while some Republicans in power acknowledged the issue needed to be addressed, they refused to put it to a vote until late in the year.",
      "In December, the Senate rejected two partisan health care bills \u2014 a Democratic pitch to extend the subsidies for three more years and a Republican alternative that would instead provide Americans with health savings accounts.",
      "In the House, four centrist Republicans broke with GOP leadership and joined forces with Democrats to force a vote that could come as soon as January on a three-year extension of the tax credits. But with the Senate already having rejected such a plan, it's unclear whether it could get enough momentum to pass.",
      "Meanwhile, Americans whose premiums are skyrocketing say lawmakers don't understand what it's really like to struggle to get by as health costs ratchet up with no relief.",
      "Many say they want the subsidies restored alongside broader reforms to make health care more affordable for all Americans.",
      "\"Both Republicans and Democrats have been saying for years, oh, we need to fix it. Then do it,\" said Chad Bruns, a 58-year-old Affordable Care Act enrollee in Wisconsin. \"They need to get to the root cause, and no political party ever does that.\"",
      "Barrios, who said she has generally voted Republican, said she would like politicians to \"act on those values that they ... claim to protect.\"",
      "\"The whole system feels as though it's failed and isn't advocating for me as a small business owner, as somebody who wants to become a mom and have a family,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Steep U.S. import duties targeting 13 Italian pasta makers will be sharply reduced, Italy's foreign ministry said on Jan. 1.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. has rolled back proposed steep tariffs on Italian-made pasta, the U.S. Department of Commerce and Italy's foreign ministry both said Thursday.",
      "The Commerce Department has sharply reduced a proposed duty on 13 Italian pasta makers, cutting the rate from as high as 92% to as little as 2.26%, Italy's foreign ministry said Jan. 1. The duties would have been imposed on top of existing 15% tariffs on most imports from the European Union.",
      "The Trump administration had proposed the antidumping levies after a review found that Italian pasta producers, including Barilla, La Molisana and Pastificio Lucio Garofalo, sold products at artificially low prices that undercut U.S. manufacturers. Together, the 13 pasta producers account for 16% of imported pasta from Italy to the United States, according to the Commerce Department.",
      "Had the higher duties taken effect, U.S. shoppers could have faced steeply higher prices for Italian-made pasta, and some Italian producers might have stopped shipping to U.S. retailers, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"The recalculation of the duties is a sign that U.S. authorities recognize our companies' genuine willingness to cooperate,\" the foreign ministry said.",
      "La Molisana pasta imports will be tariffed at a rate of 2.26%, the foreign ministry said, while Garofalo will face nearly 14% tariffs, and 11 additional pasta brands will be subject to a 9% import duty.",
      "A spokesperson for the Commerce Department told CBS News that the new antidumping rates were based on an \"evaluation of additional comments received\" after the proposed duty rates were determined.",
      "\"This post-preliminary analysis indicates that Italian pasta makers have addressed many of Commerce's concerns raised in the preliminary determination, and reflects Commerce's commitment to a fair, transparent process. Commerce will continue to engage with interested parties to take into account all information before issuing the final determination,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The final results of Commerce's review will be announced in March, after which the duties will go into effect.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration\u00a0said\u00a0on Wednesday it is postponing tariff increases on imported upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and vanities by a year, citing ongoing negotiations with trading partners.",
      "Without the delay, the U.S. was set to double its tariff rate on kitchen cabinets and vanities produced outside the U.S. to 50% starting Jan. 1. The import duty on upholstered furniture \u2014 including sofas and armchairs \u2014 was set to rise to 30% from 25% on the first day of 2026.",
      "The postponement follows a November rollback by the Trump administration of tariffs on imported foods such as beef, coffee and bananas, as affordability concerns\u00a0have weighed on consumer sentiment about the U.S. economy. Furniture prices have been outpacing inflation, with living room, kitchen and dining room furniture rising 4.6% in November from a year earlier, compared with a 2.7% annual increase in the overall Consumer Price Index.",
      "According to the Dec. 31 White House announcement, the tariff rate on upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and vanities will remain at 25%.",
      "\"The United States continues to engage in productive negotiations with trade partners to address trade reciprocity and national security concerns with respect to imports of wood products,\" the White House said in its statement.",
      "\"The United States will therefore delay the increase in tariff rates for upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets, and vanities that was set to take place on January 1, 2026, under the September 29, 2025, Proclamation for an additional year,\" it added.",

    "summary": "The levy, which would impose a new 11% tax on the gross fares paid by a cruise ship's passenger, was set to go into effect at the start of 2026.",
    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court ruling on New Year's Eve blocked Hawaii from enforcing a\u00a0climate change tourist tax\u00a0on cruise ship passengers, a levy that was set to go into effect at the start of 2026.",
      "Cruise Lines International Association challenged the tax in a lawsuit, arguing that the new law violates the U.S. Constitution by taxing cruise ships for entering Hawaii ports. They also argued it would make cruises more expensive.",
      "The levy increases rates on hotel room and vacation rental stays but also imposes a new 11% tax on the gross fares paid by a cruise ship's passenger, prorated for the number of days the vessels are in Hawaii ports. The lawsuit notes the law authorizes counties to collect an additional 3% surcharge, bringing the total to 14% of prorated fares.",
      "In the nation's first such levy to help cope with a warming planet, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green signed legislation in May that raises tax revenue to deal with eroding shorelines, wildfires and other climate problems. Officials estimate the tax would generate nearly $100 million annually.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jill A. Otake last week upheld the law, and the plaintiffs appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The U.S. government intervened in the case and also appealed Otake's ruling.",
      "The order by two 9th Circuit judges granted both requests for an injunction pending the appeals.",
      "\"We remain confident that Act 96 is lawful and will be vindicated when the appeal is heard on the merits,\" Toni Schwartz, spokesperson for the Hawaii attorney general's office, said in an email.",
      "The order temporarily halts enforcement of the law on cruise ships while the appeals process moves forward, her email noted.",
      "The lawsuit challenged only the law's cruise ship provisions.",
      "Cruise Lines International Association spokesperson Jim McCarthy said he wasn't sure he could get a comment from the plaintiffs, given the timing of the ruling before a holiday.",

    "summary": "Starting January 1, food-stamp recipients in five U.S. states will face restrictions on using the benefits to buy some sugary foods.",
    "story": [
      "Starting New Year's Day, some food-stamp recipients around the U.S. will be banned from using the government nutrition assistance to buy candy, soda and other foods.",
      "Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, Utah and West Virginia are the first of at least 18 states to enact waivers prohibiting people enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from purchasing certain foods. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins have urged states to strip foods regarded as unhealthy from the $100 billion federal program.",
      "\"We cannot continue a system that forces taxpayers to fund programs that make people sick and then pay a second time to treat the illnesses those very programs help create,\" Kennedy said in a statement in December.",
      "The efforts are aimed at reducing chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes associated with sweetened drinks and other treats, a key goal of Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again effort.",
      "Confusion for SNAP recipients?",
      "But retail industry and health policy experts said state SNAP programs, already under pressure from steep budget cuts, are unprepared for the complex changes, with no complete lists of the foods affected and technical point-of-sale challenges that vary by state and store. And research remains mixed about whether restricting SNAP purchases improves diet quality and health.",
      "The National Retail Federation, a trade association, predicted longer checkout lines and more customer complaints as SNAP recipients learn which foods are affected by the new waivers.",
      "\"It's a disaster waiting to happen of people trying to buy food and being rejected,\" said Kate Bauer, a nutrition science expert at the University of Michigan.",
      "The new restrictions are the latest source of concern for SNAP recipients. Food aid distributed under the program, which is used by 42 million Americans, was interrupted during the 43-day U.S. government shutdown. Reliance on food stamps typically surges during economic downturns, such as the sharp slump that followed the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020.",
      "Nearly 62% of SNAP participants are in families with children, while roughly 37% are in households with older adults or people with disabilities,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Roughly 14% of U.S. households reported food insecurity on average between January and October, up from 12.5% in 2024, according to Purdue's Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability.",
      "While the prevalence of food insecurity around the U.S. fluctuates month to month, the overall rate had been declining since 2022, when an average of 15.4% of households were food insecure as inflation hit\u00a040-year highs\u00a0following the pandemic.",
      "Retailers fear impact",
      "A report by the National Grocers Association and other industry trade groups estimated that implementing SNAP restrictions would cost U.S. retailers $1.6 billion initially and $759 million each year going forward.",
      "\"Punishing SNAP recipients means we all get to pay more at the grocery store,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP director for the anti-hunger advocacy group Food Research & Action Center.",
      "The waivers are a departure from decades of federal policy first enacted in 1964 and later authorized by the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, which said SNAP benefits can be used for \"any food or food product intended for human consumption,\" except alcohol and ready-to-eat hot foods. The law also says SNAP can't pay for tobacco.",
      "In the past, lawmakers have proposed stopping SNAP from paying for expensive meats like steak or so-called junk foods, such as chips and ice cream.",
      "But previous waiver requests were denied based on USDA research concluding that restrictions would be costly and complicated to implement, and that they might not change recipients' buying habits or reduce health problems such as obesity.",
      "Under the second Trump administration, however, states have been encouraged and even incentivized to seek waivers \u2013 and they responded.",
      "\"This isn't the usual top-down, one-size-fits-all public health agenda,\" Indiana Gov. Mike Braun said when he announced his state's request last spring. \"We're focused on root causes, transparent information and real results.\"",
      "How many people are affected",
      "The five state waivers that take effect Jan. 1 affect about 1.4 million people. Utah and West Virginia will ban the use of SNAP to buy soda and soft drinks, while Nebraska will prohibit soda and energy drinks. Indiana will target soft drinks and candy. In Iowa, which has the most restrictive rules to date, the SNAP limits affect taxable foods, including soda and candy, but also certain prepared foods.",
      "\"The items list does not provide enough specific information to prepare a SNAP participant to go to the grocery store,\" Plata-Nino wrote in a blog post. \"Many additional items \u2014 including certain prepared foods \u2014 will also be disallowed, even though they are not clearly identified in the notice to households.\"",
      "Marc Craig, 47, of Des Moines, said he has been living in his car since October. He said the new waivers will make it more difficult to determine how to use the $298 in SNAP benefits he receives each month, while also increasing the stigma he feels at the cash register.",
      "\"They treat people that get food stamps like we're not people,\" Craig said.",
      "SNAP waivers enacted now and in the coming months will run for two years, with the option to extend them for an additional three, according to the Agriculture Department. Each state is required to assess the impact of the changes.",
      "Health experts worry that the waivers ignore larger factors affecting the health of SNAP recipients, said Anand Parekh, a medical doctor who is the chief health policy officer at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.",
      "\"This doesn't solve the two fundamental problems, which is healthy food in this country is not affordable and unhealthy food is cheap and ubiquitous,\" he said.",

    "summary": "The average cost of a conventional 30-year U.S. mortgage continues to edge down, while rates on other home loans fell to less than 5.5%.",
    "story": [
      "The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage fell to its lowest level of 2025 this week, a boost for prospective home buyers.",
      "The average long-term mortgage rate dipped to 6.15% from 6.18% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Wednesday. That's the lowest average long-term rate since October 3, 2024, when it dipped to 6.12% before shooting back up. One year ago, the rate averaged 6.91%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, fell this week to 5.44% from 5.5% the previous week. A year ago it averaged 6.13%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors' expectations for the economy and inflation. They generally follow the trajectory of the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "The 10-year yield was at 4.14% at midday Wednesday, down a touch from last week's 4.15%.",
      "Mortgage rates began easing in July in anticipation of a series of Fed rate cuts, which began in September and continued this month.",
      "The Fed doesn't set mortgage rates, but when it cuts its short-term rate that can signal lower inflation or slower economic growth ahead, which can drive investors to buy U.S. government bonds. That can help lower yields on long-term U.S. Treasurys, which can result in lower mortgage rates.",
      "Even so, Fed rate cuts don't always translate into lower mortgage rates.",
      "Home shoppers who can afford to pay cash or finance at current mortgage rates are in a more favorable position than they were a year ago. Home listings are up sharply from 2024, and many sellers have resorted to lowering their initial asking price as homes take longer to sell, according to data from Realtor.com.",
      "Most homes across U.S. are unaffordable",
      "Still, affordability remains a challenge for aspiring homeowners, especially first-time buyers who don't have equity from an existing home to put toward a new home purchase. Uncertainty over the economy and job market\u00a0is also keeping many would-be buyers on the sidelines.",
      "Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes rose in November from the previous month, but slowed compared to a year earlier for the first time since May, despite average long-term mortgage rates holding near their low point for the year. Through the first 11 months of this year, home sales are down 0.5% compared to the same period last year.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/economy-2026-outlook-affordability-rates-jobs-markets/",
    "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 10:32:26 -0500",
    "summary": "From stubbornly high living costs to a softer labor market, economists say these are the forces that will shape the year ahead.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. economy navigated 2025 with a resilience that surprised many experts, as growth accelerated and inflation remained relatively muted despite the Trump administration's steep tariffs on imports.",
      "Although Americans say they aren't yet feeling the benefits of an expanding economy amid ongoing concerns about the cost of living, many economists expect the U.S. to be on firmer footing next year.",
      "\"I think it'll be a better year,\" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Michael Pearce told CBS News. \"Tax cuts will be center stage, and we'll see a broadening out of economic strength.\"",
      "Here are what experts see as the key economic questions facing the U.S. in 2026.",
      "Will affordability improve?",
      "Probably not \u2014 at least not in a way most Americans will feel right away. Inflation has cooled since peaking at a 40-year high in 2022, but prices remain elevated, squeezing many households and making it harder to cover basic expenses. About 7 in 10 Americans polled by CBS News in December said they were struggling to pay for food, housing and health care, underscoring the affordability issues affecting millions of households.",
      "Rising utility costs are another challenge. Americans now pay an average of $265 per month in utilities, up 12% since last year, according to a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from The Century Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, and advocacy group Protect Borrowers.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the average household is expected to pay an average of $995 on home heating this winter, a 9.2% increase from last year, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association.",
      "More broadly, inflation remains well above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target, with the Consumer Price Index in November at 2.7%. For consumers, that means prices for everyday goods and services are still climbing, continuing to strain household budgets.",
      "Inflation should cool to about 2.4% in 2026, according to a December forecast from the Federal Reserve. But that would still leave inflation above the central bank's goal, signaling that \"higher inflation will continue to weigh on family finances\" next year, William Blair economist Richard de Chazal said in a report.",
      "About one-third of Americans think their finances are likely to worsen in the year ahead, primarily driven by inflation concerns, a recent Bankrate\u00a0survey\u00a0found.",
      "Wages will need to outpace inflation for a sustained period before households feel they are getting ahead, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said at a Dec. 10 press conference.",
      "\"We're going to need to have some years where \u2026 nominal wages are higher than inflation for people to start feeling good about affordability,\" he noted.",
      "Will the Federal Reserve continue to cut interest rates?",
      "Another big question is whether the Federal Reserve will continue cutting its benchmark interest rate after three consecutive reductions that began in September.",
      "Although the Fed has a so-called dual mandate to keep both inflation and unemployment low, the central bank is currently being pulled in two directions. Prices are rising faster than the Fed would like, which could call for higher interest rates if the trend persists or inflation re-ignites in 2026. At the same time, rising unemployment and cooler hiring might require policymakers to further lower rates in a move to boost economic growth.",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed panel that sets monetary policy, in December penciled in only\u00a0one additional rate cut for 2026. Yet some economists believe the Fed could make additional cuts, especially if the labor market continues to slow.",
      "President Trump has argued that the Fed should drastically cut its benchmark rate, pressing Fed Chair Jerome Powell to reduce borrowing costs. With Powell's term set to expire in May, Mr. Trump is expected to nominate a new chair who is more open to cutting rates.",
      "Will housing become more affordable in 2026?",
      "Homes across the U.S. could be modestly more affordable in 2026, Chen Zhao, head of economics research at real estate company Redfin, told CBS News.",
      "Mortgage rates are likely to remain in the low 6% range, not far off from today's 30-year mortgage rate of about 6.18%, while home\u00a0prices are likely to grow at a slower pace than incomes next year.",
      "\"We're starting to head on a road that leads to better affordability metrics, but it's not going to be an overnight shift,\" she said. \"2026 might not feel all that different than the end of 2025 \u2014 it's a slow process that might take five or six years, but at least we're heading in the right direction.\"",
      "Home prices are projected to dip in about two dozen major U.S. cities in 2026, mostly located in the Southeast and the West, according to a Realtor.com analysis.",
      "Will the job market pick up steam?",
      "Hiring could improve in 2026 as economic growth accelerates and the effects of tariffs fade, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "Average payroll gains could rise to an average of 70,000 per month next year, more than double the 32,000 per month average in 2025, economists with the investment bank forecast in a report. They expect wages to climb 2.3% in 2026, accelerating from 1.9% this year.",
      "However, some economists warn that the job market could remain relatively muted as companies turn to artificial intelligence to improve productivity.",
      "Are stocks in a bubble?",
      "A critical question for financial markets this year \u2014 are companies involved in AI overvalued \u2014 is likely to again take center stage in 2026.",
      "The S&P 500 is on track to end the year with a gain of more than 17%, with the index buoyed by artificial intelligence companies and big tech companies. However, some investors are growing cautious about the meteoric rise of AI-related stocks, questioning whether a bubble is forming.",
      "Such bubbles \u2014 when stock valuations run far ahead of underlying fundamentals \u2014 can set the stage for sharp market corrections if investor sentiment sours. Yet stock valuations remain below the levels seen during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, according to Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics. He expects investment in AI to continue next year as more companies adopt the technology.",
      "Still, although AI stocks are unlikely to crash next year, investors' lofty expectations may be in for a reality check",
      "\"At some point, investors are likely to be disappointed, and the cycle of ever rising investment, expectations and valuations will end, as proved the case with previous equity bubbles,\" Goltermann said in a report.",
      "Overall, forecasters expect a strong stock market performance in 2026. J.P. Morgan in November forecast the S&P 500 will rise 13% to 15% next year, roughly in line with the index's average gain over the last decade.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-17000-commercial-drivers-licenses-delay-revoking-feds-threat-immigrants/",
    "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 06:15:15 -0500",
    "summary": "In light of a suit by immigrants groups, California says it will delay the revocations of 17,000 commercial driver's licenses despite a federal threat to withhold $160 million in funding.",
    "story": [
      "A week after immigrant groups filed a lawsuit, California said Tuesday it will delay the revocations of 17,000 commercial driver's licenses until March to allow more time to ensure that truckers and bus drivers who legally qualify for the licenses can keep them.",
      "But U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the state may lose $160 million if it doesn't meet a Jan. 5 deadline to revoke the licenses. He already withheld $40 million in federal funding because, he said, California isn't enforcing English proficiency requirements for truckers.",
      "California only sent out notices to invalidate the licenses after Duffy pressured the state to make sure immigrants who are in the country illegally aren't granted the licenses. An audit found problems like licenses that remained valid long after an immigrant's authorization to be in the country expired or licenses where the state couldn't prove it checked a driver's immigration status.",
      "\"California does NOT have an 'extension' to keep breaking the law and putting Americans at risk on the roads,\" Duffy posted on the social platform X.",
      "The Transportation Department has been prioritizing the issue ever since a truck driver who was not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people in August.",
      "California officials said they're working to make sure the federal Transportation Department is satisfied with the reforms they've put in place. The state had planned to resume issuing commercial driver's licenses in mid-December, but the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration blocked that.",
      "\"Commercial drivers are an important part of our economy - our supply chains don't move, and our communities don't stay connected without them,\" said DMV Director Steve Gordon.",
      "The Sikh Coalition, a national group defending the civil rights of Sikhs, and the San Francisco-based Asian Law Caucus filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of the California drivers. They said immigrant truck drivers were being unfairly targeted. The driver in the Florida crash and the driver in another fatal crash in California in October are both Sikhs.",
      "Immigrants account for about 20% of all truck drivers, but the non-domiciled licenses immigrants can receive only represent about 5% of all commercial driver's licenses, or about 200,000 drivers. The Transportation Department also proposed new restrictions that would severely limit which noncitizens could get a license, but a court put the new rules on hold.",
      "Mumeeth Kaur, the legal director of the Sikh Coalition, said this delay \"is an important step towards alleviating the immediate threat that these drivers are facing to their lives and livelihoods.\"",
      "Duffy previously threatened to withhold millions of dollars in federal funding from California, Pennsylvania and Minnesota after audits found significant problems under the existing rules like commercial licenses being valid long after an immigrant truck driver's work permit expired. He dropped the threat to withhold $160 million from California after the state said it would revoke the licenses because the state was complying.",
      "Trucking trade groups have praised the effort to get unqualified drivers who shouldn't have licenses or can't speak English off the road. They also applauded the Transportation Department's moves to go after questionable commercial driver's license schools.",
      "And while the federal government says the licenses are illegal and the state says the feds are overreaching, some people in the trucking industry say they're the ones caught in the middle, reports CBS News Sacramento.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/december-interest-rate-cut-fed-minutes/",
    "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 16:37:24 -0500",
    "summary": "The minutes released Tuesday indicate that some Fed officials who supported the rate cut had reservations.",
    "story": [
      "Some Federal Reserve officials who supported cutting a key interest rate earlier this month could have instead backed keeping the rate unchanged, minutes released Tuesday show, underscoring the divisions and uncertainty permeating the central bank.",
      "At their December 9-10 meeting, Fed officials agreed to cut their key interest rate by a quarter point for the third time this year, to about 3.6%, the lowest in nearly three years.",
      "Yet the move was approved by a 9-3 vote, an unusual level of dissent for a committee that typically works by consensus. Two Fed officials supported keeping the rate unchanged, while one wanted a larger, half-point reduction.",
      "The minutes underscored the deep split on the 19-member policymaking committee over what constitutes the biggest threat to the economy: weak hiring or stubbornly elevated inflation. If a sluggish job market is the biggest threat, then the Fed would typically cut rates more. But if still-high inflation is the bigger problem, then the Fed would keep rates elevated, or even raise them.",
      "Just 12 of the 19 members vote on rate decisions, though all participate in discussions.",
      "The minutes showed that even some Fed officials who supported the rate cut did so with reservations. Some Fed officials wanted to wait for more economic data before making any further moves, the minutes said. Key economic data on jobs, inflation, and growth were delayed by the six-week government shutdown, leaving Fed officials with only outdated information at their meeting earlier this month.",
      "The minutes don't identify specific officials. But how they vote is public, and two policymakers dissented in favor of keeping rates unchanged: Jeffrey Schmid, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, and Austan Goolsbee, president of the Chicago Fed.",
      "The third dissent was from Fed governor Stephen Miran, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in September and favored a half-point cut.",
      "When the Fed reduces its key rate, over time it can lower borrowing costs for homes, cars, and credit cards, though market forces also affect those rates.",
      "At its December meeting, the Fed also released quarterly economic projections, which also showed the extent of the divisions on the Fed committee. Seven officials projected no cuts in 2026, while eight forecast two or more reductions. Four supported just one cut.",
      "Weaker job market",
      "A weaker job market would likely spur the Fed to reduce borrowing costs more quickly. Two weeks ago, the government reported that employers had cut about 40,000 jobs in October and November, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, a four-year high.",
      "Inflation, meanwhile, remains above the Fed's 2% target, complicating the central bank's next moves. In November, annual inflation cooled to 2.7%, down from 3% in September, but last month's data were likely distorted by the shutdown, economists said, which forced the government to estimate many price changes rather than measuring them directly.",
      "Powell said after the Dec. 10 meeting that the central bank cut rates out of concern that the job market is even weaker than it appears.",
      "While government data shows that the economy added just 40,000 jobs a month from April through September, Powell said that figure could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers actually shed an average of 20,000 jobs a month during that period.",
      "\"It's a labor market that seems to have significant downside risks,\" Powell told reporters. \"People care about that. That's their jobs.\"",

      "Gold futures have also soared this year, with the precious metal hitting record highs earlier in December.",
      "Investors have been piling into precious metals this year as a safe haven amid rising geopolitical tensions, as well as a hedge against inflation. That's helped drive sharp gains in both silver and gold.",
      "\"Silver saw a record rally in 2025. The 150% increase is significantly higher than that of gold and other assets in the sector,\" noted Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, in an email.",
      "Despite silver's price gains this year, the metal is still far from its inflation-adjusted price record, which was set in 1980, he noted. \u00a0\"To return to that level, silver would have to cost $200 per ounce today,\" he noted.",
      "Monday's selloff in silver was sparked by a technical change at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the world's largest commodities trading venues. The exchange said it would require traders to put up more cash to hold positions in silver, gold and other metals after prices surged this year.",
      "The CME raised margin requirements for the contracts in a notice posted Friday. Such moves are designed to protect the exchange by reducing the risk that traders cannot cover their bets if prices swing sharply.",

    "summary": "A federal judge has ruled that the White House cannot stop funding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
    "story": [
      "The White House may not stop funding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal judge ruled Tuesday, days before funds at the bureau were likely to run out and the consumer finance agency would lack the funds to pay its employees.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman ruled the CFPB can continue to get its funds from the Federal Reserve, though the Fed is operating at a loss, and the White House has made a new legal argument that way the CFPB gets its funds is not valid.",
      "At the heart of this case is whether White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, who is also the acting director of the CFPB, can effectively shut down the agency and lay off all of the bureau's employees. The CFPB has largely been inoperable since President Trump was sworn into office nearly a year ago. Its employees are mostly forbidden from doing any work, and most of the bureau's operations this year has been to unwind the work it did under President Biden and even under Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "Vought himself has made comments indicating he intends to effectively shut down the CFPB.",
      "The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents the workers at the CFPB, has been mostly successful in its legal efforts to stop the mass layoffs. The union sued Vought earlier this year and won a preliminary injunction stopping the layoffs.",
      "In recent weeks, the White House has used a new line of argument to potentially get around the court's restraining order. The argument is that the Federal Reserve has no \"combined earnings\" at the moment to fund the CFPB's operations. The CFPB obtains its funding from the Fed through expected quarterly payments.",
      "The Federal Reserve has been operating at a paper loss since 2022 as a result of the central bank's efforts to combat inflation. The Fed holds bonds on its balance sheet from a period of low interest rates during the COVID-19 pandemic, but currently has to pay out higher interest rates to banks that hold their deposits at the central bank. The Fed has been recording a \"deferred asset\" on its balance sheet which it expects will be paid down in the next few years as the low interest bonds mature off the Fed's balance sheet.",
      "Because of this loss on paper, the White House has argued there are no \"combined earnings\" for the CFPB to draw on. The CFPB has operated since 2011, including under Mr. Trump's first term, drawing on the Fed's operating budget.",
      "White House lawyers sent a notice to the court in early November, where they argued that the CFPB would run out of appropriations in early 2026, under the \"combined earnings\" argument, and does not expect to receive any additional appropriations from Congress.",
      "This combined earnings legal argument is not entirely new. It has floated in conservative legal circles going back to the moment the Federal Reserve started operating at a loss. However, it has never been tested in court.",
      "\"It appears that defendants' new understanding of \"combined earnings\" is an unsupported and transparent attempt to starve the CPFB of funding and yet another attempt to achieve the very end the Court's injunction was put in place to prevent,\" Berman wrote in an opinion.",
      "A White House spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Berman's opinion.",

      "In Republican-led Indiana, the state's flat-rate individual income tax \u2014 a single rate applied to all taxpayers regardless of income \u2014 will fall to 2.95% from 3% at the start of next year, under a budget measure passed by the state legislature in 2023. The rate is slated to drop another 0.05 percentage point to 2.9% in 2027.",
      "Kentucky",
      "Kentucky's individual income tax rate will be cut to 3.5% on Jan. 1, down from its current 4%.

      "In 2023, the state had a budget of $1.9 billion but now faces a $432 million shortfall,\u00a0according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP). Some lawmakers have\u00a0called\u00a0on the state to pause the next phase of income tax cuts to shore up the state's budget.",
      "North Carolina",
      "In North Carolina, where the governor is a Democrat and the state legislature is controlled by Republicans, the individual income tax rate will be reduced from 4.25% to 3.99% in 2026.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday that the Pentagon had begun a process to demote Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and cut his retirement pay over a video in which Kelly, a retired Navy captain, called on service members to \"refuse illegal orders.\"",
      "In a post on X, Hegseth said he had issued a letter of censure to Kelly, who served in the Navy until 2011.",

    "summary": "Lawmakers return to Washington this week, staring down an end-of-month deadline to avert another government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Lawmakers return to Washington this week, staring down an end-of-month deadline to avert another government shutdown. The next funding fight comes fresh off a revolt from moderate Republicans over rising health care costs, and as the conflict with Venezuela and frustration with the Justice Department's handling of the rollout of the Epstein files come to a head.",
      "Funding the government is at the top of Congress' to-do list after a bruising 43-day shutdown that stretched from October through the first half of November. To end the longest shutdown in history, lawmakers approved a measure to fund parts of the government through the end of the fiscal year in September. Funding for the vast majority of agencies and programs, however, was temporarily extended until Jan. 30.",
      "Congress risks a partial shutdown if it does not approve new funding or another short-term patch for the remaining portions of the government before the end of the month. And it has to balance that priority alongside other legislative battles.",
      "Funding the government",
      "Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, the top GOP appropriators in the Senate and House, announced an agreement on top-line spending for the remaining nine funding bills just before Christmas.",
      "\"This pathway forward aligns with President Trump's clear direction to rein in runaway, beltway-driven spending,\" Cole said in a statement, noting that the total funding falls below the current levels. \"We will now begin expeditiously drafting the remaining nine full-year bills to ensure we are ready to complete our work in January.\"",
      "House and Senate negotiators released the text of an initial package of three bills on Monday, known as a \"minibus.\" The legislation would provide funding related to science and the Departments of Commerce and Justice; energy and water development; and the Department of Interior and the EPA.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said that \"passing these bills will help ensure that Congress, not President Trump and Russ Vought, decides how taxpayer dollars are spent-by once again providing hundreds of detailed spending directives and reasserting congressional control over these incredibly important spending decisions.\"",
      "The progress inches Congress one step closer to avoiding a shutdown, though potential roadblocks remain. Buy-in from Democrats is necessary in the Senate for passage and may be needed in the House if conservatives withhold their support \u2014 a move they regularly threaten with funding bills.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, is also facing a dwindling majority. GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia is vacating her seat on Monday, retiring a year before her term ends after a bitter feud with President Trump. Her departure will leave Johnson with a two-vote margin.",
      "After weeks of debate among Senate Republicans, the upper chamber had hoped to move forward with another \"minibus\" ahead of the winter recess, but two Democratic senators stood in the way.",
      "Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper of Colorado held up the package to object to the Trump administration's dismantling of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, which is located in Boulder. The senators pledged to use \"every lever available to do what is right for Colorado.\" The duo may be even less inclined to allow the funding bills to move forward after Mr. Trump vetoed a bipartisan bill designed to make it easier to build a water pipeline in Colorado.",
      "Should the process to pass the long-term measures stall, leaders could opt to pursue another short-term continuing resolution and again punt the funding issue down the line.",
      "Still, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said on ABC's \"This Week\" Sunday that Congress isn't headed toward a shutdown at the end of the month. He said Democrats want to work on a bipartisan, bicameral basis to fund the government through September, and \"the good news is our Republican appropriators are working with us and we're making good progress in that regard.\"",
      "Health care",
      "Democrats' demand to extend the Affordable Care Act's enhanced premium tax credits was at the center of last year's shutdown. Their effort to extend the tax credits as part of the agreement to reopen the government fell short and the subsidies expired last week, raising premiums for millions of Americans who purchase health insurance through the exchanges.",
      "But the fight isn't over yet.",
      "After a vote on a Democratic measure to extend the tax credits for three years without reforms fell short in the Senate, four moderate House Republicans joined all Democrats to back a discharge petition to force a vote in the lower chamber.",
      "The moderates had criticized a straight extension without any reforms such as income caps, but argued that Democrats' proposal to extend the tax credits without any changes was better than allowing them to expire.",
      "The House is expected to vote on the motion to discharge the bill for a vote in the coming days. Johnson said it was \"inevitable\" that it would be considered on the floor when lawmakers returned after the holidays.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that \"we've got to make sure that a straightforward extension of the Affordable Care Act tax credits passes out of the House upon our return next week so we can protect the health care of tens of millions of Americans who are about to experience dramatically increased health insurance premiums, copays and deductibles.\"",
      "\"That's completely and totally unacceptable, and Republicans have a responsibility to partner with us as Democrats to stop it,\" Jeffries added.",
      "Ahead of the winter break, the discharge petition seemed to add momentum to a bipartisan effort to reach a health care compromise. A number of moderate Democrats and Republicans in both chambers have been seeking a solution on health care costs, and were expected to continue their conversations over the holidays. The discharge petition could serve as a vehicle for an extension of the tax credits with some reforms, should the lawmakers reach a compromise.",
      "Lawmakers to apply pressure on Epstein files release",
      "Congress' return is also expected to be marked by new pressure on the Justice Department over its piecemeal approach to releasing the files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "The Epstein Files Transparency Act \u2014 which Congress passed and Mr. Trump signed into law in November \u2014 dictated that the Justice Department release the files by Dec. 19. However, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the Justice Department will release them on a rolling basis due to the volume of materials and the need to redact some information.",
      "Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, and Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, spearheaded the legislation and the effort to force a vote on the issue. They have both criticized the Justice Department's handling of the release.",
      "So far, the Justice Department has released thousands of documents that are believed to represent only a small fraction of the Epstein files. The first release came on Dec. 19, followed by the release of additional materials a day later, along with a massive tranche of files on Dec. 23. The Justice Department also said on Dec. 24 that \"over a million more documents potentially related to the Jeffrey Epstein case\" had been uncovered, adding that the process of releasing the files may take \"a few more weeks.\"",
      "Khanna and Massie said last month that they are drafting a resolution to hold Attorney General Pam Bondi in \"inherent contempt\" of Congress over the release of the files. The lawmakers said they were building support for the resolution, which would likely be offered as a privileged motion, requiring leadership to schedule a vote within two legislative days.",
      "Schumer also announced last month that he had introduced a resolution that would direct the upper chamber to \"initiate legal actions\" against the Justice Department to demand that it comply with the law. The New York Democrat is expected to force a vote on the measure when the Senate reconvenes this week.",
      "A group of senators, including one Republican, has also requested that the Justice Department's inspector general conduct an audit of the department's compliance with the new law. The senators said the investigation is \"essential\" given the Trump administration's \"historic hostility to releasing the files\" and \"politicization of the Epstein case more broadly.\"",
      "Conflict with Venezuela",
      "Another war powers vote is also on the horizon after Mr. Trump announced early Saturday that the U.S. had carried out a \"large scale strike against Venezuela\" and captured President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife. Mr. Trump also said the U.S. will \"run the country\" and threatened a \"much larger attack\" if needed. The development marks a major escalation in the monthslong military campaign against the South American nation.",
      "Congress has not authorized military force against Venezuela, and the Trump administration did not notify lawmakers of the plan ahead of time.",
      "Most Democrats and a few Republicans have sought to limit Mr. Trump's authority to strike Venezuela and suspected drug-trafficking boats in the region as the U.S. leader says the South American country's role in drug smuggling poses a threat to national security. But the Senate and House have each failed twice to limit Mr. Trump's authority to continue the military campaign.",
      "Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said the Senate will vote this week on his latest war powers resolution. He introduced the measure in early December, days after the revelation that the U.S. killed two people who survived the initial blast of a Sept. 2 strike in the Caribbean Sea.",
      "Kaine's measure would require \"the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities within or against Venezuela that have not been authorized by Congress.\"",
      "In a call with reporters on Saturday he called the military action in Venezuela \"an illegal war.\"",
      "\"There is no legal justification in the Constitution, in the history of the Constitution, or an American law that would authorize the president to wage war, to depose President Maduro and seize its oil and run the country of Venezuela without coming to Congress,\" Kaine said. \"It's time for Congress to get its ass off the couch and do what the Constitution mandates that we do.\"",
      "Besides the war powers resolution, Kaine said he's also looking at the defense appropriations process as a mechanism to prohibit military action in Venezuela.",
      "Before they left for the year, House Democrats forced votes on two war powers resolutions as Mr. Trump warned that land strikes against Venezuela could commence \"soon.\" Since then, the U.S. carried out several more boat strikes and, according to Mr. Trump, \"knocked out\" a \"big facility\" linked to the alleged drug smuggling operations.",

      "The two-term Democrat and former vice presidential candidate has faced scrutiny in the last several months over his handling of Medicaid fraud, which has cost the state as much as $9 billion, according to a top prosecutor. Walz has stated that his administration is taking aggressive measures to prevent future fraud.",
      "\"All across the state, Minnesotans are hard at work on this problem. Advocates, administrators, investigators are on the front lines defending the integrity of our state's programs, and I want to thank them for their efforts,\" Walz said. \"There's more to do. A single taxpayer dollar wasted on fraud is a dollar too much to tolerate. And while there's a role to play for everyone \u2013 from the legislature to prosecutors to insurance companies to local and county government \u2013 the buck stops with me. My administration is taking fast, decisive action to solve this crisis. And we will win the fight against the fraudsters.",
      "Walz has also been the target of attacks by President Trump. On Thanksgiving, Mr. Trump used a slur for people with intellectual disabilities to describe Walz on his Truth Social platform. During a media availability Sunday, Trump called Walz \"a very stupid, low-IQ governor.\"",
      "Over the weekend, Mr. Trump reposted a conspiracy theory video alleging Walz was behind the political assassination of Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman.",
      "Hortman, Walz's close friend and political ally, was slain in her home alongside her husband on June 14. The man accused of killing the two of them, as well as injuring state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette, faces several federal charges, including two counts of murder.",
      "Walz decried the president's post, calling it \"dangerous, depraved behavior.\"",
      "Walz, a former Congressman and teacher, was first elected governor in 2018. During his tenure, he made several progressive victories, spurred in part by a once-in-a-decade DFL trifecta in the legislature. In the months of the 2023 legislative session, he was able to pass universal free school meals, legalize the use of recreational marijuana, and create a state program for paid family and medical leave.",
      "\"I'm confident that a DFLer will hold this seat come November. I'm confident that I will find ways to contribute to the state I love even after I've left office next January. But there will be time to worry about all that later,\" he said.",
      "A source close to Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar says she is considering running for governor, but has not made a decision.",

      "As national attention focuses on the growing fraud scandal in Minnesota, which federal prosecutors estimate could top $9 billion, the state's Democratic Governor Tim Walz has announced he is dropping his reelection campaign.",
      "Right before New Year's, a viral social media video by YouTuber Nick Shirley, which was amplified by Elon Musk, Vice President J.D. Vance and Attorney General Pam Bondi,\u00a0pushed the fraud story\u00a0into the center of the national conversation, stoking a scandal that has been brewing in state politics for years.",
      "In the wake of the video, the Trump administration announced it is pausing federal funding to child care in Minnesota, with President Trump calling Minnesota a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.\" The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services also announced sweeping changes to how all states must submit claims for Medicaid-supported daycares, including requiring \"a justification and a receipt or photo evidence before we send money to a state.\"",
      "Even before the video spread far across the internet, however, scandal plagued Minnesota. In 2021, federal law enforcement first probed a series of multimillion dollar fraud schemes. Those fraud schemes have led to federal charges against 92 people with 62 convicted \u2014 and counting.",
      "President Trump and other Republican lawmakers have focused attention on the state's large Somali community, as most of the fraud defendants are of Somali descent, drawing stiff criticism from local officials, including Walz, who denounced Mr. Trump's criticism as \"vile, racist lies and slander towards our fellow Minnesotans.\"",
      "Walz, meanwhile, has faced intense scrutiny from both inside and outside Minnesota over his administration's handling of the crisis. The governor has acknowledged in recent weeks that the fraud problem could stretch into the billions, but disputed the $9 billion figure cited by prosecutors.",
      "While Shirley's video focused on allegations of fraud in daycares in Minneapolis, federal investigators told CBS News child care is only \"vaguely\" a priority for prosecutors, and attention and resources are instead focused on more than a dozen other social services programs in Minnesota, including nutrition, housing and behavioral health.",

    "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 07:55:43 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump said \"we're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be\" after the surprise U.S. attack. Here's what to know about Venezuela's oil sector.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. strike on Venezuela\u00a0has renewed focus on the country's oil sector, which includes some of the richest crude reserves in the world.",
      "\"We're going to rebuild the oil infrastructure, which will cost billions of dollars, it will be paid for by the oil companies directly. And we're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be,\" President Trump said in a public address on Saturday following the attack, in which the U.S. captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife.",
      "Here's what to know about Venezuela's oil industry.",
      "How much oil does Venezuela produce?",
      "Venezuela, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, produces relatively little crude compared with other leading oil-producing nations. The country produces roughly 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, less than 1% of global output, according to OPEC data.",
      "Venezuela's oil production topped 3 million barrels per day in the early 2000s, but it has fallen sharply in recent decades due to declining investment and the impact of U.S. sanctions. Because of U.S. political pressure, Venezuela today exports most of its oil to China, according to Reuters.",
      "By comparison, the U.S. \u2014 the world's largest oil producer \u2014 churns out 13.5 million barrels per day, according to the Energy Information Administration. Saudi Arabia, the world's No. 2 oil exporter and leading OPEC producer, pumps an estimated 10 million to 12 million barrels, while No. 3 Russia produces 9.4 million.",
      "Francisco J. Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University, predicted it would take at least a decade \u2014 and investments of more than $100 billion \u2014 to rebuild Venezuela's oil infrastructure and lift production to 4 million barrels per day, which is well above its historical production levels.",
      "\"Venezuela's oil infrastructure has also been heavily degraded by decades of underinvestment and much of Venezuela's oil is extremely heavy, making it relatively costly to extract and process,\" Neal Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, noted in a report.",
      "But doesn't Venezuela have more oil in the ground?",
      "Yes, Venezuela is estimated to have the world's largest proven oil reserves, with more than 303 billion barrels \u2014 that represents roughly 17% of the total global oil supply, OPEC data shows.",
      "\"The bottom line is that the size of the reserves is only paralleled by the ones in the Middle East, in the Persian Gulf and Canada's reserves,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Venezuela's reserves top second-ranked Saudi Arabia's 267 billion barrels, and are more than six times the U.S.'s reserves. Most of Venezuela's untapped oil is located in what is known as the Orinoco Belt, a roughly 21,000-square-mile area that stretches across the country's northeastern region.",
      "Are American oil companies already operating in Venezuela, and does the U.S. restrict the country's oil industry?",
      "Only one U.S. oil company operates in Venezuela today: Houston-based Chevron, which now accounts for 25% of Venezuelan oil production.",
      "\"No other major Western player produces any significant amount,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Other American energy giants, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, withdrew from Venezuela after former President Hugo Chavez nationalized private foreign oil interests starting in 2006.",
      "Since 2005, successive U.S. presidents have imposed a range of sanctions on Venezuela, including its oil sector, for what American officials have said is the country's failure to crack down on drug trafficking and terrorism, along with alleged human rights abuses.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. in 2019 also froze the assets of Venezuela's state-owned oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), and barred Americans from doing business with the enterprise.",
      "Most recently, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on four companies and associated oil tankers that it said have ties to Venezuela's oil sector.",
      "Earlier in December, Mr. Trump called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or leave Venezuela, and the U.S.\u00a0seized two sanctioned vessels.",
      "Chevron can maintain its presence in Venezuela under a waiver granted by the Biden administration in 2022, when the U.S. faced soaring inflation and energy prices. President Trump extended that special license last year.",
      "How could regime change in Venezuela affect oil prices?",
      "Any significant disruption to global oil supplies could drive up energy prices around the world. Yet Venezuela's limited crude production is likely to mute any immediate impact on oil prices, which fell modestly in afternoon trading on Saturday, according to FactSet.",
      "Prices for U.S. oil saw a steep decrease in 2025, dropping roughly 20% and extending a decline over the previous two years. In trading on Friday, the price of West Texas Crude (the U.S. standard) fell to $57.32 a barrel, down from nearly $80 in January.",
      "Other factors could limit any short-term impact on domestic energy prices. U.S. production of crude has surged in recent years, helping lower gas prices. The U.S. has also beefed up its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, according to the Energy Information Administration, another potential cushion for consumers and businesses from volatility in global oil markets.",
      "\"Global supply remains ample, Venezuelan production represents a small share of worldwide output and there's no clear evidence yet of sustained disruption to physical flows,\" Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, said in an email.",
      "Wall Street analysts expect relatively little impact when U.S. financial markets reopen on Monday.",
      "\"Investors have dealt with a series of ostensibly seismic geopolitical events for the last several years (Ukraine, Gaza, Iran, Libya, etc.), but none had a sustained impact on markets, and it's unlikely the events in Venezuela will be any different,\" said Adam Crisafulli, head of investment adviser VitalKnowledge.",
      "Meanwhile, major economies around the world are growing at a rate expected to keep oil prices in check, given the current surplus in crude supplies and sufficient production capacity among key producers, experts note.",
      "In the short term, an end to the U.S. blockade could even reduce oil prices, Monaldi said. \"Venezuela was exporting about 800,000 barrels before the blockade. If those go back to the market, that eases pressures.\"",
      "However, a prolonged slump in Venezuelan oil production could affect some energy costs. For example, the country produces a form of crude suitable for making diesel, which is widely used in many industries.",
      "As a result, removing Venezuela's oil input from global markets could push up diesel costs in the U.S. and boost inflation, according to a recent analysis by the Atlantic Council, a nonpartisan group focused on global political and economic affairs.",
      "\"Limited price impact reflects where the barrels go and how much spare capacity exists. It doesn't mean the risk is negligible,\" Green said.",
      "Will U.S. companies want to restart operations in Venezuela?",
      "To boost its oil production, Venezuela will need to rely on private investors because its state-run oil company, PDVSA, is in financial ruin, Monaldi told CBS News. That could open the door for U.S. companies to reenter the market. With new investment, Venezuela's existing infrastructure would allow the country to ramp up oil production relatively quickly, he added.",
      "To be sure, any such investment is likely to hinge on political developments following the U.S. strikes and Maduro's removal, said Monaldi, noting that Venezuela would need to offer commercial, fiscal and contractual incentives to lure American energy producers.",
      "\"Venezuela doesn't have limits in terms of the resources,\" he said. \"It's about the politics.\"",
      "In the near term, Chevron stands to benefit the most, given its existing footprint in Venezuela, according to Monaldi. Other U.S. companies that might bring business back to Venezuela include ConocoPhillips and Exxon, he added.",

    "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 06:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Democrats are trying to win back the House from the GOP after losing control in the 2022 midterms.",
    "story": [
      "If the hope among Democrats for a decisive blue wave in the 2026 midterms has a chance of coming to pass, the party would likely have to win difficult House contests in redder parts of the country.",
      "Montana's 1st Congressional District may prove to be the test case for whether that can happen.",
      "Smokejumper Sam Forstag is set to announce on Monday a run for the seat, giving the left a new candidate in the race after two Democratic candidates already filed federal paperwork in the contest.",
      "The wildland firefighter and local federal employee union leader, who also had a stint in legislative lobbying for the Montana chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, gained attention in 2025 when he spoke at a rally in Missoula held by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. While Montana is a reliably Republican state in national elections, only a few years ago, Montana had a Democratic governor and, until last year, a Democratic U.S. senator. Yet the last Democrat to represent Montana in the U.S. House left office almost 30 years ago.",
      "\"The way you win an election in this state, and I actually think the way you actually have some path to victory for the national party, is A: you win back working people, right?\" Forstag said in an interview.\u00a0 \"We've got to win back union members like me, who have felt like both parties have abandoned them. And we need to win back young people who feel like in a place like Western Montana, you've got a generation, or two generations of people that can't even conceive of ever owning a home in this state.\"",
      "Democrats may only end up needing to win a handful of seats to flip control of the House away from Republicans this coming fall, and more traditional opportunities exist in states like Pennsylvania, Arizona and Iowa to help them do that.",
      "But races like Montana's 1st District could prove pivotal in whether the party can overcome more urgent challenges that have emerged, namely the high unfavorability mark Democrats carried late last year and the view shown in polling around the country that the party is weak.",
      "The seat is held by Republican Ryan Zinke, who has had two tenures in Congress and was secretary of the interior for part of President Trump's first term before leaving the post amid federal watchdog investigations. He now has a notable role in Washington as part of the main House committee dealing with federal funding, giving the Montana Republican tangible influence.",
      "Zinke's campaign website says that \"Ryan's decisions are based on upholding the Constitution and doing what is right for Montana and America. He believes and lives the truth of American Exceptionalism and recognizes the unique role that we play in global prosperity and security. Ryan knows that the problem is not that there's too much Montana in D.C.; the problem is that there's too much D.C. in Montana.\"",
      "In recent cycles, control of the House has been decided by a narrow number of seats after a wave of wins helped Democrats during the midpoint of Mr. Trump's first term as president. Back in 2018, Democrats took back control of the House by netting around 40 seats. Since that recent high point, the majorities for both parties have been far more narrow in the House.",
      "Zinke faced close races during his second House tenure however, winning his seat in the 2022 midterms by around three points before defeating the same opponent during the 2024 presidential election by more than seven points. Late last year, he touted Mr. Trump's endorsement for another term in Congress.",
      "House midterm cycles have tended to be difficult for the party of the incumbent president during the modern political era. But this fall's election comes as Democrats contend with messaging struggles and clear concerns about the party's brand after its losses during the 2024 presidential election. The leader of the Democratic National Committee also announced late last year that he would not release a full report of the last national election in a move that prompted criticism from some party faithful who questioned the decision.",
      "National Republicans for months have been looking to take advantage of the left's lackluster standing with voters while also attempting to tie Democrats in competitive races with more liberal figures on the left around the country. And in Montana's first congressional district, a Democratic candidate would likely need to win a fair amount of voters who have sided with President Trump in the past to be able to realistically flip the seat.",
      "That's a dynamic Forstag told CBS News he's prepared to embrace as he also contends with the difficulties of running as a Democrat in a red state at a time when the national party brand carries its own issues.",
      "\"If the Democratic Party can't win working-class people, it's not going to be the sort of party that I would want to be a part of for much longer,\" Forstag said. \"So on a fundamental level, I think the Democratic Party, for all the conversations that we've had about representation over the last 10 or 15 years, seems to have forgotten about what I see as the most fundamentally important kind of representation, which is economic representation.\"",

      "\"We'll worry about Greenland in about two months,\" Mr. Trump added. \"Let's talk about Greenland in 20 days.\"",
      "His comments came a day after the U.S. military captured former Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife during an overnight raid in Caracas. This raised concern in Denmark that the same could happen in Greenland, a Danish territory.",

      "\"The U.S. has no right to annex any of the three nations in the Danish kingdom,\" she said, adding: \"I would therefore strongly urge the U.S. stop the threats against a historically close ally and against another country and another people, who have very clearly said that they are not for sale.\"",

      "\"We are close allies and should continue to work together as such,\" Soerensen said of Denmark's relationship with the U.S. He added that both countries \"work together to ensure security in the Arctic\" and his \"significantly boosted its Arctic security efforts\" in 2025, an example of how it takes their \"joint security seriously.\"",
      "Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen also\u00a0responded\u00a0on social media, calling Miller's post \"disrespectful\" but adding that it \"doesn't change anything\" about his country's independence.",

      "Monday's arraignment starts the clock for prosecutors to turn over evidence against Maduro and those indicted, criminal defense attorney and CBS News Legal Analyst Caroline Polisi told \"CBS Evening News.\"",
      "\"There are lots of nuanced arguments to be made about where the trial goes domestically,\" Polisi said.",

      "The charges appear to be the same as those that were filed in a 2020 indictment of Maduro and several key aides.",
      "The indictment, prepared by New York U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton, says: \"For over 25 years, leaders of Venezuela have abused their positions of public trust and corrupted once-legitimate institutions to import tons of cocaine into the United States,\" before alleging that Maduro \"is at the forefront of that corruption and has partnered with his co-conspirators to use his illegally obtained authority and the institutions he corroded to transport thousands of tons of cocaine to the United States.\"",
      "The U.S. government also claimed that Flores is involved in her husband's alleged crimes.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's announcement Saturday that the United States will \"run\" Venezuela\u00a0after the U.S. captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife is raising new questions about the extent of U.S. involvement in the South American country.",
      "Mr. Trump did not offer many details about his administration's plans for the U.S. role in Venezuela as he spoke about the overnight mission from his South Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago. The president had announced on social media hours earlier that Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were \"captured and flown out of the country.\" Officials told CBS News that the operation was carried out by the U.S. Army's Delta Force, an elite special operations unit.",
      "Maduro and his wife were brought to the U.S. to face criminal charges stemming from what prosecutors have alleged is their participation in a conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism and to import \"thousands of tons\" of cocaine to the U.S. Maduro and his wife arrived at Stewart Airport just north of New York City on Saturday afternoon, hours after their capture.",
      "With Maduro's ouster, it's unclear who is in charge in Venezuela or could lead the nation in the future. Mr. Trump said it would be \"very tough\" for Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado to take over because she \"doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country.\"",
      "The president said Secretary of State Marco Rubio also had a conversation with Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, who Mr. Trump said has been \"sworn in\" and is \"essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.\"",
      "But in remarks on state television, Rodriguez said Maduro is the \"only president of Venezuela\" and demanded his release. She was later granted full presidential power by the Venezuelan supreme court on Saturday and recognized by the military as the country's acting leader on Sunday.",
      "Venezuela held its last presidential election in July 2024, but election authorities did not provide detailed vote counts, and the U.S. and many European countries rejected Maduro's claim of victory. The U.S., under the Biden administration,\u00a0recognized opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as the president-elect. Gonz\u00e1lez fled into exile in Spain in September 2024 after a warrant was issued for his arrest.",
      "Trump says U.S. will \"run it properly,\" but provides few details",
      "Mr. Trump said the U.S. is \"going to run the country\" until there is a \"safe, proper and judicious transition\" in power in Venezuela.",
      "\"We can't take a chance that somebody else takes over Venezuela that doesn't have the good of the Venezuelan people in mind. We've had decades of that. We're not going to let that happen,\" the president said. \"We're there now. And what people don't understand, but they understand as I say this, we're there now, but we're going to stay until such time as the proper transition can take place.\"",
      "He did not provide any additional details about how the U.S. would oversee Venezuela, under what authority, or whether the U.S. would play a role in picking a new leader.",
      "Mr. Trump did indicate that top administration officials \u2014 including Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who appeared alongside Mr. Trump on Saturday \u2014 would work with a \"team\" working with the Venezuelan people. He did not, however, say who would be included in that group.",
      "When asked about plans to run the country, Rubio on Sunday signaled\u00a0on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\u00a0that the U.S. doesn't plan to directly govern Venezuela, but would influence its policy by, among other things, enforcing an \"oil quarantine.\"",
      "\"That's the sort of control the president is pointing to when he says that,\" Rubio said. \"We continue with that quarantine, and we expect to see that there will be changes, not just in the way the oil industry is run for the benefit of the people, but also so that they stop the drug trafficking, so that we no longer have these gang problems, so that they kick the FARC and the ELN out, and that they no longer cozy up to Hezbollah and Iran in our own hemisphere.\"",
      "Rubio said people have an \"obsession\" over whether the U.S. will occupy Venezuela with \"boots [on the ground] and this or that,\" adding Mr. Trump would not rule that out, \"even though that's not what you're seeing right now. What you're seeing right now is an oil quarantine that allows us to exert tremendous leverage over what happens next.\"",
      "In an interview Saturday evening, \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil asked Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth what the U.S. running Venezuela may look like.",
      "\"It means we set the terms. President Trump sets the terms. And ultimately, he'll decide what the iterations are of that,\" Hegseth said. \"But, it means the drugs stop flowing, it means the oil that was taken from us is returned, ultimately, and that criminals are not sent to the United States.\"",
      "Role of the oil industry",
      "When asked about a timeframe for U.S. involvement, Mr. Trump said Venezuela's \"whole infrastructure\" has to be rebuilt. He focused in particular on the prospect of rebuilding the oil industry in a nation with one of the world's largest petroleum reserves.",
      "\"If we just left, it [Venezuela] has zero chance of ever coming back,\" he said. \"We'll run it properly. We'll run it professionally. We'll have the greatest oil companies in the world going in and invest billions and billions of dollars and take out money, use that money in Venezuela, and the biggest beneficiary is going to be the people of Venezuela.\"",
      "When asked about the\u00a0blockade of sanctioned oil\u00a0from Venezuela imposed by Mr. Trump last month, Hegseth said no oil is going in or out of the country, and the U.S. military is still poised in the Caribbean.",
      "\"[Mr. Trump] said it clearly at the podium today. We are going to get American companies in there. We are going to get investment in there. These oil depots have been operating at 20% capacity. That's going to change,\" Hegseth told CBS News.",
      "Maduro regime figures remain in place",
      "While the Trump administration has removed Maduro, top members of his government remain in place. Among them are Rodr\u00edguez, who Maduro selected as his vice president, as well as Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino and Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello.",
      "Cabello is named as a defendant alongside Maduro and his wife in the superseding indictment returned by a federal grand jury in New York as allegedly part of the narco-terrorism conspiracy.",
      "Seemingly in a warning to Venezuelan officials who remain in place, Mr. Trump said the U.S. is \"ready to stage a second and much larger attack\" in Venezuela if needed, and that his administration is \"not afraid of boots on the ground.\"",
      "Rubio expanded on the comment on Sunday\u00a0on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" saying that Mr. Trump \"does not feel like he is going to publicly, you know, rule out options that are available for the United States, even though that's not what you're seeing right now.\"",
      "Asked to clarify that there is no plan for U.S. occupation of Venezuela, Rubio said \"the president always retains optionality on anything and on all of these matters.\"",

    "story": [
      "The children of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman are asking President Trump to remove a video he reposted on social media Saturday alleging Gov. Tim Walz is behind their mother's\u00a0assassination.",
      "Walz responded to the president's Truth Social post, saying it is \"dangerous, depraved behavior from the sitting president of the United States.\"",
      "\"In covering for an actual serial killer, he is going to get more innocent people killed. America is better than this,\" Walz said.",
      "Hortman was shot and killed alongside her husband, Mark, and their dog, Gilbert, on June 14, 2025, inside the family's Brooklyn Park home. State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were shot and wounded in their Champlin home 90 minutes earlier.",
      "Vance Boelter, 58, faces\u00a0federal charges\u00a0for the shootings, including two counts of murder. He allegedly dressed as a police officer and managed to evade arrest for nearly 40 hours.\u00a0 According to prosecutors, Boelter had a hit list of lawmakers and other public officials, including staffers at Planned Parenthood. He pleaded\u00a0not guilty\u00a0in August.",
      "Mr. Trump first reshared the video that states Boelter made the claim Walz ordered him to kill Hortman in a letter authorities say they found in his vehicle. Then-acting U.S. attorney Joe Thompson called the letter a \"delusion\" that seemed \"designed to conceal his crimes.\"",
      "The Hortmans' children, Sophie and Colin, on Sunday afternoon asked Mr. Trump to remove the post, saying it promotes a \"false narrative.\"",
      "\"The video being shared by the president is another hurdle our family must overcome in grieving the loss of my parents, Mark and Melissa, and their beloved Gilbert,\" Sophie Hortman said. \"I ask President Trump to please consider the pain and sadness we have faced, and to honor the spirit of the holidays we have just spent without our parents by taking down the post on Truth Social.\"",
      "Colin Hortman also debunked one of the claims made in the video shared by Mr. Trump regarding a vote his mother made shortly before her death to remove undocumented immigrant adults from the state's health care coverage program. Hortman was the sole Democrat to vote for it in the tied House chamber, clearing the way for its passage.",
      "\"When I called her after the legislative session ended, I asked why she voted for the bill mentioned in the video shared by President Trump, and she wept. That bill and her vote had nothing to do with fraud. She voted for that bill because it was the only way to avoid a government shutdown,\" Colin Hortman said. \"She had never really voted against her conscience like that. It was emotional and extremely difficult.\"",
      "The White House had not responded to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "In a statement, House DFL Leader\u00a0Zack Stephenson\u00a0called out Mr. Trump, saying the claims about Hortman's death are \"untruthful\" and \"outrageous.\"",
      "\"Tonight, Donald Trump, who couldn't be bothered to lower the flags to half staff or even say Melissa Hortman's name until now, is spreading outrageous lies about her death,\" Stephenson said. \"Here is the truth: Melissa was murdered by a right-wing, anti-abortion extremist who believed conspiracy theories about COVID. Melissa Hortman and Tim Walz were friends and allies. Anyone who claims otherwise is lying.\"",
      "Stephenson went on to say that any political leader in the state who does not condemn the president's post \"isn't fit to hold office.\"",
      "Republican state Sen. Julia Coleman also encouraged lawmakers to \"call for an end to baseless conspiracy theories\" above a post mentioning Mr. Trump's online endorsement of the accusation.",
      "\"We must all reject this behavior outright and refuse to tolerate it. The American people, grieving families, and the legacies of those lost deserve far better,\" Coleman said. \"Debate policies fiercely. Fight for what you believe in. But do not speculate, guess, or spread stories that are plainly false and deeply harmful. It's time to restore dignity to our political discourse.\"",
      "Several Democratic lawmakers, including Reps. Angie Craig and Betty McCollum, called for Republican legislators to specifically condemn Mr. Trump's post.",
      "However, Republican state Rep. Walter Hudson disagreed.",
      "\"I'm not condemning anything, even if I disagree with it, after watching the abhorrent reaction to the death of Charlie Kirk from Democrats of every strata, and the indifference toward and election of Jay Jones.  I'm not playing this stupid game,\" Hudson said on X about Mr. Trump's Truth Social post.",
      "Republican Rep. Lisa Demuth, the speaker of the Minnesota House, did not condemn Trump's post. She did say in a statement to WCCO\u00a0that Hortman was \"a friend an colleague, and her life was cut short far too soon in an unspeakable act of evil by a deranged killer.\"",
      "\"She should still be here, and the man who took her life should spend the rest of his life in prison,\" she said.",
      "McCollum also demanded that the president apologize to the Hortman family, Walz and Minnesotans.",

    "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 15:00:28 -0500",
    "summary": "The physical damage from the Capitol riot has been repaired \u2014 and President Trump has pardoned almost every defendant. What remains is a battle over the basic facts.",
    "story": [
      "Five years after the historic and damaging attack on the U.S. Capitol, millions of dollars in damages have been repaired and clean-up has long been completed. Many of the physical injuries have healed. And President Trump's pardons ended the largest criminal prosecution in American history, while freeing more than 1,500 defendants from criminal liability.",
      "What remains is a poisonous and lingering resentment over the riot and an ongoing battle to preserve the basic facts of what transpired on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "The president and some of his supporters have accused the Biden administration of weaponizing the Department of Justice against Jan. 6 defendants. In the process, Mr. Trump and surrogates have espoused arguments that are inconsistent with the facts of the cases, the timeline of events and public statistics from the Capitol siege prosecutions.",
      "In a letter to colleagues last week, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries announced a public meeting, with witness testimony, will be held on Tuesday to rebut claims about Jan. 6. Jeffries's letter said the meeting would \"expose the election deniers who hold high-level positions of significance in the executive branch and detail the threats to public safety posed by the hundreds of violent felons who were pardoned on the President's first day in office.\"",
      "Dan Hodges, a local Washington, D.C., police officer who was injured by the attack of the mob, said he is frustrated by an ongoing \"rewriting\" of the history of Jan. 6.",
      "\"Five years ago I thought: This has to be the most videotaped crime in American history. It's just so much evidence. There's no way anyone can possibly deny what occurred here,\" Hodges said in an interview. \"But that's exactly what's happening.\"",
      "Hodges, who spoke with CBS News as a citizen, separate from his ongoing role as a police officer, also said, \"The attack was everything it appeared to be on television.\"",
      "Mr. Trump himself \u2014 who has referred to Jan. 6 defendants as \"hostages\" for years \u2014 attempted to reframe or rewrite some of the key issues of the Jan. 6 prosecutions in the hours and days after issuing the pardons. He has claimed many defendants were actually innocent, were only responsible for \"minor\" infractions or were held in unfairly harsh conditions.",
      "At a January 2025 news conference, Mr. Trump said: \"These people have already served years in prison, and they've served them viciously.\" He also claimed Jan 6 rioters had \"served years in jail,\" then added that \"murderers don't even go to jail in this country.\"",
      "His statements excluded the more than 1,000 Jan 6 riot defendants who did not serve years in custody, and the hundreds of pardoned Capitol riot defendants who had not yet gone on trial or who served prison terms for cases in which they pleaded guilty.",
      "Mr. Trump also defended his acts of clemency during the same press conference by saying: \"It's a disgusting prison. It's been horrible. It's inhumane. It's been a terrible, terrible thing.\"",
      "The president did not specify which prison to which he was referring. The imprisoned Jan. 6 riot defendants served time in a wide range of federal prison facilities nationwide, all of which are operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Those include prisons in Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, California, Arizona, Ohio, Michigan and Florida, none of which has been singled out as \"inhumane\" by the prison bureau, which Trump now oversees.",
      "Although the local Washington, D.C., jail received criticism for its conditions in 2021 and 2022, when some Jan. 6 defendants were temporarily held there, the jail is not a prison. Nor was the jail used for those who were sentenced to federal prison terms.",
      "In a Fox News interview just days after returning to office, Mr. Trump justified his pardons by arguing, \"most of the people were absolutely innocent,\" which runs counter to many defendants' decision to plead guilty and admit to crimes. His statement is also belied by the perfect trial record secured by prosecutors, who obtained convictions in 100% of the jury trials held for Jan. 6 defendants who pleaded not guilty.",
      "During that interview, Mr. Trump also defended his pardoning of violent rioters who assaulted police, saying: \"They were very minor incidents.\"",
      "According to court records reviewed by CBS News, the injuries to police included violent assaults with a series of makeshift weapons, including bats, poles, bear spray, sticks, chemicals and fists. Around 140 police officers were injured, with some facing cracked ribs, smashed spinal disks and brain injuries, according to the union representing Capitol Police officers. Multiple police officers also died by suicide in the weeks after the siege.",
      "In an October 2025 social media post, Mr. Trump claimed the Biden administration had placed 274 FBI agents among the crowd at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, even though Biden had not yet been sworn in as president. Baseless claims that the riot was orchestrated by the FBI have circulated for years, though Trump-nominated FBI Director Kash Patel has said the 274 agents were deployed to the Capitol for \"crowd control.\"",
      "Some riot defendants have characterized the prosecutions as \"weaponization\" of the federal government by the Justice Department. Others have used the term \"staged,\" \"fake\" or \"fed-surrection\" to allege that the violent riot did not happen as it appeared to on live television across America.",
      "\"Are we not supposed to believe what we saw with our own eyes?,\" asked Rep. Bennie Thompson, a longtime House Democrat from Mississippi who chaired the former House January 6th Select Committee, which aimed to dispel myths and fake claims about the riot. \"We have to keep repeating it, because these individuals with larger microphones keep calling it 'fake news.'\"",
      "The White House declined to comment on remarks Mr. Trump has made about Jan. 6 or those involved, but spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement:\u00a0 \"The media's continued obsession with January 6 is one of the many reasons trust in the press is at historic lows \u2014 they aren't covering issues that the American people actually care about. President Trump was resoundingly reelected to enact an agenda based on securing the border, driving down crime, and restarting our economy \u2014 the President is delivering.\"",
      "House Democrats are expected to call a number of the police victims of the siege as public witnesses at their Tuesday public meeting. Several congressional staffers familiar with the matter told CBS News they expect Democrats to issue public statements Monday and Tuesday to reinforce the facts of the Jan. 6 siege, amid Mr. Trump's claims minimizing the riot.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson's office did not respond to requests for comment about Democrats' planned public meeting or about plans for any formal events to mark the siege.",
      "Sen. Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat, called Hodges to testify at an October 2025 hearing on political violence. Welch said he wanted the officer's testimony to be public to dispel false narratives about Jan. 6. Several conservatives also testified at the hearing, during which Republican lawmakers highlighted acts of political violence and threats against Mr. Trump and other right-leaning public figures.",
      "\"There's a process to rewrite what happened on January 6 and essentially erase it,\" Welch told CBS News. \"And that's wrong. They're literally in the process of re-writing it.\"",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who previously chaired a Senate committee that conducted a bipartisan investigation into security failures on Jan. 6, told CBS News, \"Congress and Vice President Pence did our job that day: democracy prevailed.\"",
      "\"While we have come together on a bipartisan basis to strengthen our electoral process, the President's pardons and attempts to rewrite history are an insult to law enforcement and undermine our democracy,\" Klobuchar said.",

    "summary": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said President Trump always has options when it comes to what comes next in Venezuela, after a U.S. strike and capture of the country's president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
    "story": [
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that President Trump always has options around what comes next in Venezuela, after the U.S. carried out airstrikes and captured the country's president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Asked to clarify that there is no plan for U.S. occupation of Venezuela, Rubio said \"the president always retains optionality on anything and on all of these matters.\"",
      "\"He certainly has the ability and the right under the Constitution of the United States to act against imminent and urgent threats against the country,\" Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Maduro arrived Saturday night at a detention center in New York City and faces federal charges related to drug trafficking and working with gangs designated as terrorist organizations, which he denies. Mr. Trump said Saturday that the U.S. would \"run\" Venezuela on a temporary basis during the transition, sparking questions about what comes next.",
      "Mr. Trump said he is \"not afraid\" to have American military \"boots on the ground\" in Venezuela. Rubio expanded on this on Sunday, saying that Mr. Trump \"does not feel like he is going to publicly, you know, rule out options that are available for the United States, even though that's not what you're seeing right now.\"",
      "\"What you're seeing right now is an oil quarantine that allows us to exert tremendous leverage over what happens next,\" Rubio said.",
      "Rubio pointed to the U.S. naval deployment in the region, which has carried out a series of strikes on more than 30 boats, saying it's \"capable of stopping, not just drug boats, but stopping any of these sanctioned boats that come in and out\" and \"paralyzing that portion of how the regime, you know, generates revenue.\" The secretary of state added that it \"will continue to be in place.\"",
      "The secretary of state argued that \"the key to what that regime relies on is their economy fueled by oil,\" calling the country's oil industry \"backwards.\"",
      "\"None of the money from the money from the oil gets to the people, it's all stolen by the people that are on the top there,\" Rubio said. \"And so that's why we have a quarantine.\"",
      "The U.S. has seized multiple vessels in international waters, and the White House announced last month a \"blockade\" of all sanctioned oil tankers entering or leaving Venezuela. Rubio said the \"quarantine\" allows the U.S. to seize sanctioned oil shipments with a court order and offers \"a tremendous amount of leverage that will continue to be in place until we see changes that not just further the national interest of the United States, which is number one, but also that lead to a better future for the people of Venezuela.\"",
      "\"And so that's the sort of control the president is pointing to when he says that,\" Rubio said. \"We continue with that quarantine, and we expect to see that there will be changes not just in the way the oil industry is run for the benefit of the people, but also so that they stop the drug trafficking, so that we no longer have these gang problems, so that they kick the FARC and the ELN out, and that they no longer cozy up to Hezbollah and Iran in our own hemisphere.\"",
      "\"This is not the Middle East\"",
      "The secretary of state argued that the calculus is different for the U.S when it comes to Venezuela as opposed to other foreign policy matters.",
      "\"The whole, you know, foreign policy apparatus thinks everything is Libya, everything is Iraq, everything is Afghanistan. This is not the Middle East. And our mission here is very different,\" Rubio said.",
      "Rubio said that within the Western Hemisphere, Venezuela is a country that \"under the control of this regime, has cozied up to Iran, has cozied up to Hezbollah, has allowed narco-trafficking gangs to operate with impunity from their own territory, allows boats with drugs to traffic from their territory.\"",
      "\"That is what we're addressing now. We're not just addressing the regime, we are addressing the factors that are a threat to the national interest of the United States,\" he added.",
      "The secretary of state said \"our objectives when it comes to how Venezuela impacts the national interest of the United States have not changed, and we want those addressed.\"",
      "\"We want drug trafficking to stop, we want no more gang members to come our way, we don't want to see the Iranian and, by the way, Cuban presence in the past,\" Rubio said. \"We want the oil industry in that country not to go to the benefit of pirates and adversaries of the United States, but for the benefit of the people. We want to see all of that happen. We insist on seeing that happen, and we are going to work to continue to see that happen.\"",
      "Rubio says it's \"absurd\" to suggest an immediate election",
      "Rubio said the U.S. \"just could not work with\" Maduro, adding that \"we offered him, on multiple occasions, an opportunity to remove himself from the scene in a positive way. He chose not to do so.\"",
      "Asked whether Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, is someone the U.S. could work with, Rubio said \"we're going to find out.\"",
      "\"Everyone's asking why, 24 hours after Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was arrested, there isn't an election scheduled for tomorrow? That's absurd,\" Rubio said. \"These things take time. There's a process.\"",
      "The secretary of state said \"of course we want to see Venezuela transition to be a place completely different than what it looks like today. But obviously we don't have the expectation that's going to happen in the next 15 hours. What we do have an expectation is that it move in that direction. We think it's in our national interest, and frankly, in the interest of people of Venezuela.\"",
      "Asked about other indicted members of Maduro's Cabinet, Rubio responded, \"So you wanted us to land in five other military bases?\"",
      "\"The number one person on the list was the guy who claimed to be the president of the country that he was not, and he was arrested along with his wife, who was also indicted,\" Rubio said, calling Maduro the \"top target.\"",
      "Rubio has previously recognized Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as the winner of the 2024 election. Asked whether the U.S. is working on a transition to install the leader, Rubio said while he has \"admiration for Edmundo\" and opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, \"There's the mission we are on right now.\"",
      "Rubio said ultimately the goals in Venezuela are \"very simple.\"",
      "\"In the 21st century, under the Trump administration, we are not going to have a country like Venezuela in our own hemisphere, in the sphere of control, and the crossroads for Hezbollah, for Iran, and for every other malign influence in the world \u2014 that's just not going to exist,\" Rubio said.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: The Trump administration stages a dramatic top-secret mission in Venezuela and captures its leader, dictator Nicolas Maduro. But what's the U.S. role going forward?",
      "We will talk to Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "Nicolas Maduro is now in a Brooklyn jail, facing drug trafficking charges, after being captured by the Army's elite U.S. Delta Force as part of a massive U.S. military operation early Saturday that reportedly killed at least 40 Venezuelans.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): And it was an assault like people have not seen since World War II. No nation in the world could achieve what America achieved yesterday or, frankly, in just a short period of time.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The mission was months in the planning, but executed in just under three hours. What's next will take much longer, as questions about the legality and justification of the strikes continue, as well as how and who will rule Venezuela going forward.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In addition to Secretary of State Rubio, we will also hear from Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Tom Cotton and the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Congressman Jim Himes.",
      "Plus, Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen will also be here.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "Americans woke up yesterday to the shocking news that the U.S. had staged a massive air attack on the capital of Venezuela and captured Nicolas Maduro. Today, we will explore questions about what it means for the U.S. and why it's such a seismic development.",
      "We begin today with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who joins us this morning from Miami.",
      "Good morning to you, Mr. Secretary.",
      "MARCO RUBIO (U.S. Secretary of State): Good morning. Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump said that the United States will run the country and that Venezuela will be largely run by, he pointed to you and some of the other Cabinet members when he spoke to the public yesterday. He said, the U.S. retains all military options, including boots on the ground, until U.S. demands have been fully met.",
      "How do you plan to run the country?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, first of all, I think the important thing to point out is that the key to what that regime relies on and \u2013 is their economy fueled by oil.",
      "And, right now, it is an oil industry that is backwards and really needs a lot of help and work in terms of \u2013 not only that, but it doesn't help the people. None of the money from the oil gets to the people. It's all stolen by the people that are on the top there.",
      "And so that's why we have a quarantine. There's a quarantine right now in which sanctioned oil shipments \u2013 if there's a boat, and that boat is under US sanctions, we go get a court order. We will seize it. That remains in place, and that's a tremendous amount of leverage that will continue to be in place until we see changes that not just further the national interest of the United States, which is number one, but also that lead to a better future for the people of Venezuela.",
      "And so that's the sort of control the president is pointing to when he says that. We continue with that quarantine, and we expect to see that there will be changes, not just in the way the oil industry is run for the benefit of the people, but also so that they stop the drug trafficking, so that we no longer have these gang problems, so that they kick the FARC and the ELN out, and that they no longer cozy up to Hezbollah and Iran in our own hemisphere.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what you are talking about is more of a sanctions pressure, not boots on the ground. So just, to be clear, there is no plan for U.S. occupation of this country of nearly 30 million people?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think, first of all, the president always retains optionality on anything and on all these matters. He certainly has the ability and the right under the Constitution of the United States to act against imminent and urgent threats against the country.",
      "That said, and all of that said, as of right now, I think what you see as a force posture. It's one of the largest naval deployments in modern history\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 certainly in the Western Hemisphere, and it is capable of stopping not just drug boats, but stopping any of these sanctioned boats that come in and out, and really paralyzing that portion of how the regime, you know, generates revenue. So that will continue to be in place.",
      "What the president has said, obviously, is, you know, and I think what he's pointing to is that this obsession people have about boots and this or that, he \u2013 he does not feel like he is going to publicly, you know, rule out options that are available for the United States, even though that's not what you're seeing right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: What you're seeing right now is an oil quarantine that allows us to exert tremendous leverage over what happens next.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he also said the U.S. is ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so.",
      "But I'm curious, because you just described the regime as still in place, essentially. I mean, I'm curious why the Trump administration decided to leave it intact and only arrest Nicolas Maduro and his wife. the person who controls the police, the chief thug, Diosdado Cabello, he's the interior minister. He's been indicted by the United States. He was in that indictment the administration released.",
      "He's a narco-terrorist. There's a $25 million price on his head. He's still in place. The defense minister, who has deep ties to Russia, $15 million price on his head, he is still in place. I'm confused. Are they still wanted by the United States? Why didn't you arrest them if you are taking out the narco-terrorist regime?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: You're confused? I don't know why that's confusing to you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They're still in power.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I mean, it's very simple. You're not going to go in and wrap up \u2013 you're going to \u2013 you're \u2013 but, yes, but you can't go in - - you're going to in and suck up five people? They're already complaining about this one operation.",
      "Imagine the howls we would have from everybody else if we actually had to go and stay there four days to capture four other people. We got the top priority. The number one person on the list was the guy who claimed to be the president of the country that he was not, and he was arrested, along with his wife, who is also indicted. And that was a pretty sophisticated and, frankly, complicated operation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It is not easy to land helicopters in the middle of the largest military base in the country. The guy lived on a military base. Land within three minutes, kick down his door, grab him, put him in handcuffs, read him his rights, put him in a helicopter and leave the country without losing any American or any American assets.",
      "That's not an easy mission. And you're asking me, why didn't we do that in five other places at the same time? I mean, that's absurd. I \u2013 I do think this is one of the most, you know, daring, you know, complicated, sophisticated missions this country has carried out in a very long time.",
      "Tremendous credit to the U.S. military personnel who did it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It was unbelievable, and a tremendous success.",
      "And, today, an indicted drug trafficker who was not the legitimate president of Venezuela\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 who we don't recognize, the Biden administration didn't recognize, 60-something countries don't recognize, the European Union doesn't recognize, and many countries in Latin America don't recognize \u2013 he was a convicted \u2013 he was a indicted drug trafficker.",
      "He was arrested. His wife was arrested, also indicted.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. But the others who are also indicted are still\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And they are now facing justice in the American system of courts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The others who are also indicted are still in place. So that's the point of my questioning there.",
      "But you talked about not being the legitimate president.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: So you wanted us to land in five other military bases?",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, I'm asking why you chose that this was the limit of the military operation.",
      "But to your point that you just made that Maduro was not the legitimate president\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, because he was the \u2013 he was the guy was claiming to be the president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well, the opposition\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: He was the top target.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "The opposition leader, Maria Corina Machado, and Edmundo Gonzalez won that 2024 election, by your own account. They were some of the first people you called when you were secretary of State. You said Edmundo Gonzalez is the rightful president of Venezuela. Is that still the U.S. policy? And if so, are you working on a transition to have those elected leaders run the country?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think a couple things.",
      "I have tremendous admiration Maria Corina Machado. I have admiration for Edmundo. We have all those views about what \u2013 the election that happened the last time, and not only us, but many other countries around the world. There's that.",
      "And there's \u2013 and then \u2013 but there's the mission we are on right now. We have been very clear from the beginning, because I still think that a lot of people analyze everything that happens in foreign policy through the lens of what happened from 2001 through 2015 or '16. The whole, you know, foreign policy apparatus thinks everything is Libya, everything is Iraq, everything is Afghanistan.",
      "This is not the Middle East. And our mission here is very different. This is the Western Hemisphere. Within the Western Hemisphere, we have a country, potentially a very rich country, that has cozied itself up \u2013 under the control of this regime, has cozied up to Iran, has cozied up to Hezbollah has cozied \u2013 has allowed\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 narco-trafficking gangs to operate with impunity from their own territory, allows boats with drugs to traffic from their territory. And we are addressing that.",
      "And, by the way, eight, nine million people in the largest mass migration event in modern history have left that country since 2014\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Right, but that regime is still in place.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 also having an impact on us. That is what we are addressing now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did \u2013 when you spoke yesterday, when\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, again, that \u2013 but we're not just addressing the regime. We are addressing the factors that are a threat to the national interest of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "You spoke with Delcy Rodriguez, who is now, according to President Trump, sworn in as the president, as the leader of Venezuela. Did she promise you that she is expelling all those American adversaries from Venezuelan territory? What exactly did she agree to do when she spoke to you?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: We \u2013 we are going to \u2013 our objectives when it comes to how Venezuela impacts the national interest of the United States have not changed, and we want those addressed.",
      "We want drug trafficking to stop. We want no more gang members to come our way. We don't want to see the Iranian and, by the way, Cuban presence in the past. We want the oil industry in that country not to go to the benefit of pirates and adversaries of the United States, but for the benefit of the people.",
      "We want to see all of that happen. We insist on seeing that happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did she promise that?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And we are going to work to continue to see that happen.",
      "Well, right now, the United \u2013 we are going to see what happens moving forward. Let me just say that. I'm not obviously going to have these conversations in the media. These are delicate and complicated things that require mature statesmanship, and that's what we intend to do.",
      "But our goals remain the same. The difference is that the person who was in charge, even though not legitimately, in the past was someone you could not work with. We just could not work with him. He is not a person that had ever kept any of the deals he made, broke every deal he ever made\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 made a fool out of the Biden administration on the deal they made with him.",
      "And we offered him on multiple occasions an opportunity to remove himself\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 from the scene in a positive way. He chose not to do so. And now he's in New York, a resident of the Southern District.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But his number two is now running the country. His number two is someone you can work with? And you \u2013 is that what you're implying here? And did she tell you that she will transition to democracy and the woman who won the election, along with her partner there, Maria Corina Machado?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: We are going to make \u2013 we are going to make our assessments of people. You're asking me to make an assessment. We're going to make an assessment on the basis of what they do, not what they say publicly in the interim, not what, you know, some \u2013 what they've done in the past in many cases, but what they do moving forward.",
      "So we're going to find out. You're asking me how do \u2013 do I know what decisions people are going to make? I don't. I do know this, that if they don't make the right decisions, that the United States will retain multiple levers of leverage\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 to ensure that our interests are protected.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And that includes the oil quarantine that's in place, among other things.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And so we \u2013 but we are going to judge \u2013 moving forward, we're going to judge everything by what they do, and we're going to see what they do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, because, yesterday, President Trump said Maria Corina Machado doesn't have the support or respect within the country. And, by your own admission, she walloped Nicolas Maduro in the last election. So it does sound like a decision was made, but today it\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: She wasn't on the ballot in the last election.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but her \u2013 her party was.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Edmundo was, correct, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. So, is there an agreement to\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It was an illegitimate election, and that's why he's not a legitimate president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. But is there an agreement to transition to democracy? It sounds like there's not.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I think what the president pointed out is the obvious.",
      "Well, I think what the point \u2013 but there has to be a little realism here, OK?A transition to democracy \u2013 they've had this regime, they've had this system of Chavismo in place for 15 or 16 years, and everyone's asking why 24 hours after Nicolas Maduro was arrested there isn't an election scheduled for tomorrow? That's absurd.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no, I'm asking what you talked about with her.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: These things take time. There's a process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And you are\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I'm not going to have \u2013 I'm not going to publicly get into details about any of those things, other than to tell you that our expectations remain the same, and we are going to judge whoever we're interacting with moving forward by whether or not those conditions are met.",
      "We want \u2013 of course we want to see Venezuela transition to be a place completely different than what it looks like today. But, obviously, we don't have the expectation that's going to happen in the next 15 hours. What we do have an expectation is that \u2013 that it move in that direction.",
      "We think it's in our national interest, and frankly, in the interest of people of Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president used the word oil 20 times in his press conference. You talked about these tremendous oil assets that Venezuela have \u2013 has.",
      "But the president's last envoy to Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, is publicly arguing that you know better than the policy you're backing. He said \u2013 quote \u2013 \"Venezuelan plutocrats or U.S. oil executives seem to be coming to Mar-a-Lago and whispering about how easy life would be if we just made a deal with the regime once Maduro was gone.\"",
      "Is that what happened here?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, that's not what happened here.",
      "What happened here is that we arrested a narcotrafficker who's now going to stand trial in the United States for the crimes he's committed against our people for 15 years. And the person who helped him, of course, his wife, who was colocated with him, so she was arrested as well. That's what happened here.",
      "As far as oil, look, oil is critical, not just to fueling economies all over the world. It's critical to Venezuela's future. Their oil industry is completely destroyed. It's destroyed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: All those oil fields that used to produce a lot and wealth for their country and their people, those things are decrepit. They're bankrupt. They need to be reinvested in. It's obvious.",
      "You \u2013 they do not have the capability to bring up that industry again. They need investment from private companies, who are only going to invest under certain guarantees and conditions. That has to go to the benefit of the Venezuelan people. Right now, all of that wealth is stolen.",
      "It's stolen, and it goes into the hands of oligarchs around the world and the oligarchs inside of Venezuela. A handful of people benefit from it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: The people don't benefit from it.",
      "On top of that, it's very simple, OK? In the 21st Century, under the Trump administration\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 we are not going to have a country like Venezuela in our own hemisphere in the sphere of control and the crossroads\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 for Hezbollah, for Iran and for every other malign influence in the country \u2013 in the world. That's just not going to exist.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Marco Rubio, Secretary of State, we would love to keep talking to you, but I'm told you are out of time. I have to leave it there.",
      "MARCO RUBIO: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Late yesterday, CBS Evening News anchor Tony Dokoupil exclusively with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and asked what the president's comments about the U.S. running Venezuela meant and asked if the secretary was prepared to have troops on the ground there.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "PETE HEGSETH (U.S. Defense Secretary): Well, it means we set the terms. President Trump sets the terms. And, ultimately, he will decide what the iterations are of that.",
      "But it means the drugs stop flowing. It means the oil that was taken from us is returned ultimately and that criminals are not sent to the United States. It means that foreign countries don't have a lodgement inside our hemisphere.",
      "So, ultimately, we're going to control what happens next because of this brave decision. President Trump has shown American leadership and he will be able to dictate where we go next.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Arkansas Republican Tom Cotton.",
      "Good to have you here. Senator.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON (R-Arkansas): Thanks, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have oversight of the intelligence community, which was deeply involved in this operation to go into Venezuela militarily and extract Nicolas Maduro and his wife.",
      "Does the U.S. still assess that the regime in Venezuela is made up of narco-terrorists with ties to Iran, Russia, China and Cuba?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, first off, let me commend not only our military. As President Trump said, this was an excellent operation. Only the United States military could have pulled it off, but they couldn't have pulled it off with the support \u2013 without the support of the professionals in the intelligence community, especially at the Central Intelligence Agency.",
      "And I'm glad that we have a director, John Ratcliffe, that has restored confidence in the CIA. And the president \u2013 the president has \u2013 I think the president respects the CIA as much as he ever has. It's a great day, not just for our military, for our CIA.",
      "There's no question that the people in Venezuela who are still in charge of the apparatus of the government are sanctioned and indicted officials, and they've been in league with Nicolas Maduro until just yesterday.",
      "I think President Trump wants to give them a chance to turn a new page. Now, that's happened in the past. If you look at what's happened in Syria, as you know, Ahmed al-Sharaa used to be an Islamic terrorist. He's now effectively a pro-American leader of Syria.",
      "Moammar Gadhafi, the same way, had much blood on his hands. After the Iraq War, he turned over a new page and came out of the cold. Now, the difference in those two cases is,they made concrete concessions to the United States and our policy goals and interests or they had a longer history of turning the corner, like Ahmed al-Sharaa has.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Or it's an entirely new government.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: We've \u2013 we've \u2013 we've got \u2013 we've got to make sure that the people who are now in charge of the apparatus of the Venezuelan government are not going to continue Nicolas Maduro's ways, and I think that's what the president made clear yesterday.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it sounds like you think that's actually possible for these individuals to cut all ties to the cartels?",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: The president \u2013 the president wants to give them a chance to turn the page in Venezuela and to help America achieve our policy goals there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How much time would you allow for that?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I wouldn't allow much, personally, but I know those conversations are ongoing. As Secretary Rubio said earlier on the show in your interview, we want them to stop the drug and the weapons trafficking. We want them to take the refugees back. We want them to kick out the Iranians, the Cubans, the Islamic radicals like Hezbollah, and just return to being a normal nation that will help build stability, order and prosperity, not just in Venezuela, but in our backyard.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Should a free and democratic Venezuela still be a goal of the United States of America? And, if so, do you hear from the administration a plan to transition to that?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I think it should\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because Secretary Rubio wasn't clear.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I think it should be a goal. The opposition leaders, Ms. Machado, Mr. Gonzalez, have said they think there need to be new elections.",
      "I hope the government that's right now in place in Venezuela will allow them to return, along with many other exiles who have left, political exiles who have left Venezuela, and that, in some period of time \u2013 probably is not going to be days or weeks, maybe a number of months \u2013 that you can have new elections in Venezuela that are free and fair.",
      "The Venezuelan people have made clear now under Nicolas Maduro that they do not want a Chavista regime governing them. They want a say in their own future. Venezuela has a long history of stable, orderly government that was friendly to the United States. We are their number one customer for oil, and we have worked together to help build prosper \u2013 prosperity and stability in our own backyard.",
      "I hope that we can do that again with the future government of Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The CIA \u2013 or CBS is reporting that the CIA source inside the Venezuelan government helped the U.S. track Maduro's location leading up to this capture by the Army's Delta Force.",
      "The president said yesterday the U.S. should not pay out that $50 million bounty that was on the head of Maduro. Does that mean that the CIA asset inside still works for us?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, I have no comment on CIA sources or methods in Venezuela or elsewhere.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But they won't be receiving the $50 million reward?",
      "SEN. TOM COTTON: I will simply say that the CIA's amazing work here that has instilled such confidence in the president is a reminder not just to Nicolas Maduro's cronies in Venezuela, but other bad guys all around the world, that we have very good insights into what they're doing and what they're up to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when the president says we will run Venezuela, you are confident that there are actual American assets helping to do that? Is that how I should interpret that?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I'm confident that we have very good insight into Venezuela and other adversaries, foreign nations, and terrorist groups around the world. That's why the president\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why was China there?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: That's why the president has such confidence in John Ratcliffe and the CIA.",
      "Well, China was trying to provide support to Venezuela during a U.S. pressure campaign. But where were they when Delta Force went in and got Nicolas Maduro? They were nowhere to be found. And, frankly, that's the same thing you saw in June with China and Russia in Iran. We struck Iran. China and Russia did nothing. They stood idly by.",
      "That's a reminder that the United States is still the world's dominant superpower. Our friends are very happy today. Our enemies are very worried.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the person running the country, Delcy Rodriguez, spoke yesterday with Russia's top diplomat. They are in contact with Russia. The defense minister has deep, deep ties to Russia.",
      "Is there a U.S.-Russia agreement here? Because there has been speculation, based on testimony to Congress back in 2019 by one of Trump's top Russia advisers, Fiona Hill, that Russia has been floating a Venezuela-for-Ukraine deal here.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: No, this was \u2013 no, this was\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 for some time. Is there any such deal?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: No, this was a U.S. operation that was designed to remove Nicolas Maduro because he was a U.S.-indicted drug trafficker.",
      "And you don't get immunity from American justice when you're indicted by our courts just because you're the illegitimate communist dictator of another country. And\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, to be clear, that's not what I'm saying here.",
      "Is there an implication that, if Russia doesn't meddle in America's backyard, South America, the United States will do something less in Ukraine\u2026",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: No, there's\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 which Russia calls its backyard?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: No, there's no such implication. And, obviously, Russia doesn't need any kind of pretext to do so. It's invaded Ukraine twice over the last 11 years.",
      "There's no such implication here at all. And this was an operation the United States conducted on our own, without any coordination or cooperation from other countries, to advance our national interest, which is to stop the drug trafficking and stop Venezuela from cooperating with countries like Russia and China and Cuba and Iran.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. I want to ask you about authorities here on the other side of the commercial break that we are going to take. So, let me do that and come back.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, stay with us, Senator Tom Cotton.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with more from Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Tom Cotton, plus the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Jim Himes, and Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We return now to our conversation with Senate Intelligence Chairman Tom Cotton.",
      "Senator Cotton, the president said Saturday that a second wave military attack had been planned, wasn't necessary, but it could still be carried out. What would necessitate it? And what would you support?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON (D-AR, Senate Intelligence Chairman): Well, what I took the president to mean that what we just did with Nicolas Maduro could be done again to other Venezuelan leaders. Several of them are indicted in U.S. courts, they're sanctioned by the United States and Canada and European Union and other nations. And if they continue down the path that Maduro took the nation of Venezuela, then we could conduct the same kind of operation as him. I took that as the president urging them to change their ways or face the same consequences.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And would you support a stabilization force with U.S. boots on the ground, as the president said he wouldn't rule out?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: We already had boots on the ground, as Nicolas Maduro learned the hard way. It's always the president's option to use the American military protect American citizens and interests. And, obviously, we have many American citizens inside of Venezuela and we have many interests in (ph) property as well. I don't think the president \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know combat and stabilization forces are there.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: But I don't think he \u2013 I don't think he plans to do that. And I think we've seen, too, the president \u2013 the president's way of war over the last \u2013 or over five years in office. If you look at four major operations, the killing of the ISIS leader in Syria, the drone strike against the Iranian terrorist mastermind in Iraq, the strike against Iran's nuclear facilities, and now this capture of Nicolas Maduro. When our vital national interests are implicated, the president takes bold, audacious, direct action. He accomplishes the mission, and then the mission is over.",
      "In some ways, this is the greatest mission of them all. I mean as impressive as our military was in Iran in June or in his first term in Iraq and Syria against those terrorist masterminds, it's probably harder to capture someone and get out with no American loss of life than it is to kill a target or to blow up nuclear facilities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you are drawing a distinct there in terms of authorities and use of the military. The War Powers Act requires the president to notify Congress of the reason for committing troops within 48 hours of their deployment and requires they be removed within 60 to 90 days unless Congress authorizes it. You OK with this open-ended commitment to keep forces as they are?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, I think he has removed troops. They were only there for a couple of hours to nab Nicholas Maduro.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the Delta Force operators who are on the ground.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But there is a significant military buildup all around South America right now.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're comfortable with that? Does Congress need any authority?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I strongly \u2013 no, I strongly support it. I mean part of \u2013 part of that deployment was to collect intelligence, to conduct this operation, to quarantine the oil trade that Venezuela was sending to Cuba or sending to our adversaries around the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's not mission accomplished.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I won't \u2013 we won't have accomplished our mission until Venezuela starts acting like a normal nation. It stops the drug trafficking and human trafficking and kicks out Islamic radicals and Iranians and Cubans and helps the United States build a more stable, prosperous western hemisphere. That's the ultimate goal, and that's what President Trump laid out yesterday.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, last month the chief of staff to the president, Susie Wiles, told \"Vanity Fair\" that attacking targets on Venezuela's mainland, sovereign territory, would force Trump to get congressional approval. Quote, \"if he were to authorize some activity on land, then it's war, then we'd need Congress.\"",
      "You are a co-equal branch of government. Why doesn't the president need you or your authority or your consultation?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, I consult routinely with the president and his senior advisers. And, in fact \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You, personally, sure.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Yes, like \u2013 well, as the chairman of the Intelligence",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Congress.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: As the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, they keep me apprised of what their plans are and what's going on.",
      "I mean I spoke, in the last 24 hours, not just with the president, but with his senior team. Every man that was on that stage with him yesterday, Marco Rubio, John Ratcliffe, Pete Hegseth, Dan Caine, Stephen Miller, the core architects of the president's policy here, I've spoken with every single one of them in the last 24 hours.",
      "Congress has acted to provide the president with resources and authority that he needs to protect the vital interests of the United States. Whether it's taking out this drug trafficker, Nicolas Maduro, who had contributed to the death of hundreds of Arkansans and hundreds of thousands of Americans, or striking Iran's nuclear facilities, he has the inherent authority, under our Constitution, to protect these American national interests. And as the chief law enforcement officer, to make sure that indicted drug traffickers face justice, whether they're indicted in Venezuela or indicted in the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But by his own admission, the DEA administrator said that cocaine prices have gone up nearly 45 percent, drug traffickers have only changed routes. Venezuela is not a fentanyl producer, not a cocaine producer. Do you really think that this has ended the drug problem?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Venezuela is unique in Latin America, though, because the Maduro regime is itself in league with the drug trafficking cartels. It doesn't just tolerate them or it doesn't just fail to control its territory. It is in league and profits from drug-trafficking cartels. That's the distinction between Venezuela and other nations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Cotton, thank you for your time today.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.",
      "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Connecticut Congressman Jim Himes. He is the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, and he joins us this morning from Greenwich.",
      "Congressman Himes, you are a part of that Gang of Eight, which means that information about these secret operations is statutorily intended to be shared with you as part of this very small group. Given that and what you should know, can you clearly explain what the United States is doing?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES (D-CT, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE): Yes. By the way, I was delighted to hear that Tom Cotton, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has been in regular contact with the administration. I've had zero outreach. And no Democrat that I'm aware of has had any outreach whatsoever. So, apparently we're now in a world where the legal obligation to keep the Congress informed only applies to your party, which is really something.",
      "But, yes, no, look, I know exactly where we are, Margaret. We're in the euphoria period of acknowledging across the board that Maduro was a bad guy and that our military is absolutely incredible. This is exactly the euphoria we felt in 2002 when our military took down the Taliban in Afghanistan, in 2003 when our military took out Saddam Hussein, and in 2011 when we helped removed Muammar Gaddafi from power in Libya. These were very, very bad people. By the way, much, much worse than Maduro in Venezuela, which was never a significant (AUDIO GAP) national security threat to the United States.",
      "But we're in that euphoria phase. And what we learned the day after the euphoria phase, that it's an awful lot easier to break a country than it is to actually do what the president promised to do, which is to run it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: And so, again, let's let \u2013 let's let my Republican colleagues enjoy their day of euphoria. But they're going to wake up tomorrow morning knowing, my God, there is no plan here, any more than there was in Afghanistan, Iraq, or in Libya.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you heard the secretary of state say, well, this is not the Middle East. There are conflicting statements from cabinet members. Hegseth told CBS, you know, the president of the United States will absolutely be in charge here and leaned into the idea of military options. President Trump said there will be an option of boots on the ground. Secretary Rubio, though, really just leaned into an oil quarantine here.",
      "What exactly is the point of leverage here? When do you expect to get answers? Do your Republican colleagues promise you that they will get some of the answers to the questions you have?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Of course not, Margaret. I mean, look, you're seeing it on television today, right? Two-thirds of my Republican (AUDIO GAP) wake up every single morning and the only question they have is, what can I do to prove my loyalty to the president today?",
      "And we see this because the president has completely shifted who he was. I mean as I watched that news conference yesterday I thought, oh my God, this is Dick Cheney and the neocons. Not only are they taking out a \u2013 they're doing a regime change in a country \u2013 by the way, not a tier one threat to the United States but that they just don't like. They're warning the other dictators, this is Dick Cheney in 2002 saying, we're taking down Saddam Hussein. And by the way, Syria and Iran better watch out.",
      "And the fascinating thing about that and why it's really hard to answer the question of where the hell they're going to go from here is that the president won by promising MAGA and his own people that this kind of stuff was done, that the neocons were over. And here we are, that was Dick Cheney in the conference yesterday, you know, deciding that the United States was going to, you know, militarily change regimes and threaten other ones just because we don't like them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, but then the secretary of state was talking about working with the regime and working with Maduro's number two, who's now running the place, and other indicted criminals according to the Southern District of New York, who are continuing to run Venezuela. So, can you really say that's regime change if they're working with the regime?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: As you pointed out, it's not (AUDIO GAP) right? And you (AUDIO GAP) to explain any consistency here. I mean as you pointed out (AUDIO GAP) was a very bad guy and indicted (AUDIO GAP) trafficker (AUDIO GAP). Couple of weeks ago the (AUDIO GAP) pardoned that (AUDIO GAP) indicted drug trafficker (AUDIO GAP) these guys get a pardon (AUDIO GAP) get the full (AUDIO GAP). I (AUDIO GAP) that. There is no (AUDIO GAP) \u2013 maybe (AUDIO GAP) believes that (AUDIO GAP) work with the \u2013 but, I mean, look, again, go back to (AUDIO GAP) and it is liberated \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Himes, I'm sorry to cut you off here. I'm having a terrible time audio-wise. I'm going to take a break because hopefully our technicians can fix it in those two minutes. So, please stay with us.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to \"FACE THE NATION.\"",
      "I just want to apologize to our viewers there. Congressman Himes did not have a bad case of the hiccups. We have technical problems. That's why he was getting interrupted there. It's called Live View. That's the technology being used. And it wasn't working. So, apologies for cutting that short.",
      "You're back with me now in studio. And we're going to talk to Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, who is here in person.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD): Good to be with you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And will not have those problems, we hope.",
      "But let's pick up on that very same point that we were discussing with Congressman Himes there. He says that no information was being shared with the top people who have oversight, like himself. What leverage do Democrats have to force the administration to treat Congress as a coequal branch of government?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, Margaret, it's hard when the Republicans in Congress are totally awol, right? When they want to give Donald Trump essentially a blank check because they continue to have majorities, of course, in the House and the Senate. Obviously in 2026, if Democrats regain control of either house, we will have the gavel. But in the meantime, we need to go directly to the American people and just make it very clear that in this case, it's my view that the Trump administration's been lying to the American people. This has never been about stopping drugs from coming to the United States. We all support stopping drugs. This from the beginning has been about getting rid of Maduro, grabbing Venezuela's oil for American oil companies and Trump's billionaire buddies. That's what this is about. That's why Donald Trump spent so much time yesterday talking about oil.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Twenty times the word \"oil\" was used in those remarks. The defense secretary spoke to my colleague, Tony Dokoupil, and used the word \"oil\" about six times. There is a lot of focus on those natural resources.",
      "But, arguably, isn't that what China, Russia, Iran, and others are also trying to do, which is to extract their own benefit from this country? You know, what is the counter to that point that the administration would argue?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, the counter is, you don't invade a country to grab their natural resources, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you \u2013 do you consider this an invasion even though \u2013 although it's unclear because Senator Cotton both said there were boots on the ground and that there aren't.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, let's put it this way \u2013 well, they took \u2013 they had boots on the ground, right? They took \u2013 they took out the leader. And now they're demanding access to Venezuela's oil. That's what this has been about. I mean Donald Trump, you know, claimed that he'd been against the war in Iraq from the beginning. That wasn't true. But what we do know is he said, well, having gone into Iraq, we should have gotten their oil.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: This is what drives Donald Trump. And our service men and women performed magnificently. But I think it's outrageous that the president of the United States puts American lives at risk so big American oil companies and his billionaire buddies can profit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, arguably, there are also critical minerals there. There are all sorts of natural resources in Venezuela that the drug cartels even were getting in the business of, that the Chinese were there trying to get. How do you do both things, both corner the market on the things that are of vital national security interest, those kind of minerals, and still actually maintain the principles that you're arguing should be upheld?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, the United States is working, and under the previous administration also worked to secure, you know, critical mineral supply chains. Unfortunately, in many of these areas, the Trump administration actually has surrendered to China. I mean if you look at, for example, clean energy and all those issues, and batteries, we have essentially surrendered that market to China.",
      "What you don't do, Margaret, is you don't put American lives at risk to go in and grab oil resources to benefit the billionaires that support Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Chevron, an American oil company, has been operating in Venezuela throughout. And they told CBS yesterday that they continue to work there. My understanding is there are hundreds of Americans working and living in Venezuela still. Reportedly there are at least four who had been detained by the regime. The regime that remains in power here.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are on Senate Foreign Relations. What do you know about the detained Americans? What can you find out about how they're doing?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I've not gotten an update from the administration on those detained Americans. Months ago I did work to secure the release of an American, a Marylander who we now have back in Baltimore, Maryland.",
      "I think the administration is looking at those detentions that are currently ongoing in Venezuela and determining how many of them are wrongful detentions, how many that they don't think are wrongful detentions. But certainly my view is, we should work to bring back every American who is wrongfully detained overseas. I think this is going to complicate that effort, what the Trump administration just did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because they could designate Venezuela as a state sponsor of hostage taking? Is that where you're going with that?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: No. My view is that the administration should designate as wrongfully detained any Americans that the \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: You know Venezuelan government has seized wrongfully. And then there are ways to continue to put pressure on. Now, normally that pressure would be through sanctions. Here the administration obviously has, you know, taken military action. As you've been pointing out, we're still left with the regime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I mean the vice president's part of the regime. Donald Trump says he's running Venezuela. This is not going to end well. Iraq did not end well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Other efforts to try to get rid of bad people, and we're glad to get rid of Maduro. I'd like to get rid of leaders in other countries, but you don't do it through force. That just doesn't work out well in our experience.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And even on that point though, Secretary of State Rubio challenged me in saying, oh, we couldn't grab all those people at once, but the attorney general \u2013 former Attorney General Bill Barr was on Fox News this morning, the man who put together that first indictment of Maduro, and he said, \"the intention was to clean the place out of this criminal organization so there's going to have to be follow-up operations.\"",
      "To be clear, do you oppose all snatch and grab operations of indicted people?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, I don't think we should be putting American men and women at risk in a situation like this. I mean, I'd have to look at every situation. But again, the motivation here is about grabbing Venezuela's oil for American oil companies. You already see folks on Wall Street lining up. So, let's just be real as to what is really behind this operation. I mean Donald Trump said he was going to focus on the United States. We have people's health care costs going through the roof because they refuse to extend the Affordable Care tax credits. Meanwhile, he bails out Argentina and wants to run Venezuela for the benefit of American oil companies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to have to talk about all the things you just raised as we \u2013 in a future episode of \"FACE THE NATION.\" But clearly on the question of war powers, does the president have the legal authority to do what he's doing?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: No, he does not. I mean this is \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're on the Appropriations Committee. You've got power. What can you do about it?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, I \u2013 I worked with Senator Merkley already to offer a resolution in the United States Senate to cut off any U.S. taxpayer dollars to fund an attack against Venezuela. Republicans blocked us from doing it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: So, yes, we will continue to push. In fact, I'm sure we're going to have a vote on a war powers resolution probably as early as this week, if not next. Last time we offered those, Margaret, Republicans voted no. All but one or two. Senator Paul voted with us. Maybe one other. But for the most part, Republicans are happy to give Donald Trump a blank check and surrender their constitutional responsibilities to Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Van Hollen, a lot more to talk to you about. Thank you very much for joining us here today.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We have to leave it there.",
      "We turn now back to our conversation with Connecticut Democratic Congressman Jim Himes, who I think can be heard now.",
      "Congressman, I'm glad we got the link back up.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: OK.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For those viewers who lost you there, can you explain to us \u2013 the administration is arguing that what they did is legal and that the snatch and grab operation of taking an indicted criminal, Nicolas Maduro, to the United States, through military force, has precedent, and they point back to what happened in the late '80s with Noriega in Panama. What's your challenge to that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Yes. Well, first it's clearly illegal under international law, right? No \u2013 full stop. U.N. charter. No question there.",
      "Now, you may not care about international law. But if you don't care about international law, remember you're going to be making an appeal to international law to try to get restitution for the seizure of Chevron's oil stuff. So, maybe you want to rethink how much disdain you show for international law.",
      "Clearly not legal under the Constitution because though presidents of both parties have argued against this, the Constitution is really pretty clear that the representatives of the people get to be consulted and ultimately approve military activity. That has not happened here at all. And so, again, there's nothing legal about this.",
      "And more to the point, again, under the international law point, think of what Russia and China just learned. Russia and China just learned that all you need to do if you want to go into Estonia is to say that the leader of Estonia is a bad person. You don't even need to make a particularly good case.",
      "Look, there is no national security expert saying that Venezuela was a mortal threat to the United States three weeks ago. So, what China and Russia just learned is that the beacon of liberty and rule of law in the world has now green-lighted snatch and grab operations in Estonia, in Taiwan, wherever Xi and Putin decide they want to go next.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I take your point on the precedent there. Do you think that China or Russia would have the ability to carry out that kind of lightning operation the United States did?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, no. But that doesn't mean \u2013 well, China, yes. China, yes. China very soon. And, you know, their leader has said, we will develop this capability. We know that their intent is to do precisely this in Taiwan. Russia's a more complicated case. It's \u2013 you know, Russia loses 10,000 people to get, you know, three acres of land in eastern Ukraine. But that may not be true five years from now.",
      "And, by the way, back to the Noriega case, because you do ask a good question there. Panama is a terrible precedent. Why do I say that? Because when we went to Panama, the Panamanian Congress had declared war on the United States of America, right? They had killed a United States Marine and wounded two others, and the Congress had been consulted. The Congress, in the Noriega mission, had authorized regime change. So, it's a terrible precedent that the administration is using to say that this is legal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, as we understand it, because we looked this up, Noriega claimed head of state immunity, and the court said that that immunity was meant to protect official state functions and private profiting off the drug trade. Basically the courts ruled on his actions as a leader and not on the legality of the snatch and grab operation itself.",
      "So, we're going to continue to track all of this. Thank you, Congressman Himes. Thank you, Senator Van Hollen.",
      "We will be right back.",

    "summary": "Rep. Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, pointed to the broader implications of the operation to remove former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
    "story": [
      "Rep. Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday that the operation to capture former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was \"clearly illegal under international law,\" while pointing to broader implications.",
      "\"Think of what Russia and China just learned,\" Himes said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"Russia and China just learned that all you need to do if you want to go into Estonia is to say that the leader of Estonia is a bad person. You don't even need to make a particularly good case.\"",
      "The U.S. carried out airstrikes in Venezuela and captured Maduro early Saturday morning. He arrived Saturday night at a detention center in New York City, where he is set to be arraigned Monday on federal charges related to drug trafficking and working with gangs designated as terrorist organizations. Maduro has denied the charges.",
      "President Trump and his administration have lauded the operation to bring the \"outlaw dictator\" to justice. But Himes said \"there's no national security expert saying that Venezuela was a mortal threat to the United States.\"",
      "\"So what China and Russia just learned is that the beacon of liberty and rule of law in the world has now green lighted snatch-and-grab operations in Estonia, in Taiwan, wherever Xi and Putin decide they want to go next,\" Himes said.",
      "The Connecticut Democrat added that it's also \"clearly not legal under the Constitution, because though presidents of both parties have argued against this, the Constitution is really pretty clear that the representatives of the people get to be consulted and ultimately approve military activity.\"",
      "\"That has not happened here at all,\" Himes said.",
      "Himes said he was \"delighted to hear that Tom Cotton, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has been in regular contact with the administration,\" saying he's had \"zero outreach\" and isn't aware of any other Democrats who have received outreach either.",
      "\"So apparently, we're now in a world where the legal obligation to keep the Congress informed only applies to your party, which is really something,\" he added.",
      "The administration has defended the strikes and capture of Maduro, citing the indictment brought against him by U.S. federal prosecutors in 2020 on charges related to drug trafficking and working with gangs designated as terrorist organizations.",
      "Himes pointed to the reaction from Republican lawmakers and other officials so far, saying \"we're in the euphoria period of acknowledging across the board that Maduro was a bad guy and that our military is absolutely incredible.\"",
      "\"This is exactly the euphoria we felt in 2002 when our military took down the Taliban in Afghanistan,\" Himes said. \"In 2003 when our military took out Saddam Hussein, and in 2011 when we helped remove Muammar Qaddafi from power in Libya.\"",
      "Himes said \"what we learned the day after the euphoria phase is it's an awful lot easier to break a country than it is to actually do what the president promised to do, which is to run it.\"",
      "The president said during a news conference Saturday that the U.S. will \"run\" Venezuela \"until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.\"",
      "Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, also criticized the operation on \"Face the Nation,\" accusing the Trump administration of \"lying to the American people.\"",
      "\"This has never been about stopping drugs from coming to the United States,\" Van Hollen said. \"We all support stopping drugs. This, from the beginning, has been about getting rid of Maduro, grabbing Venezuela's oil for American oil companies and Trump's billionaire buddies. That's what this is about. That's why Donald Trump spent so much time yesterday talking about oil.\"",
      "During a news conference on Saturday, Mr. Trump repeatedly mentioned Venezuela's oil reserves. Venezuela has the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world. The president said U.S. oil companies would go into Venezuela and \"spend billions of dollars\" to fix the country's oil infrastructure.",
      "Van Hollen said the administration \"took out the leader, and now they're demanding access to Venezuela's oil. That's what this has been about.\"",
      "\"This is what drives Donald Trump,\" he added.",

      "Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were seized during an overnight U.S. raid on their home in Caracas after it had conducted airstrikes in Venezuela in support of what the administration says was a law enforcement operation to enforce an indictment charging him with narco-terrorism. They arrived in the U.S. on Saturday night, and Maduro was transported to the\u00a0Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal facility in Brooklyn.",
      "Mr. Trump said Saturday that Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, had been sworn in to replace him. Many from Maduro's regime who have alleged ties to narco-terrorists as well as U.S. adversaries remain in power in Venezuela, and\u00a0Mr. Trump said Saturday\u00a0that opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado \"doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country\" to lead.",
      "In a separate appearance on \"Face the Nation,\"\u00a0Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u00a0deflected when asked about other indicted members of Maduro's Cabinet who are still in place.",
      "\"So you wanted us to land in five other military bases?\" Rubio said, adding that Maduro was the \"top target.\"",
      "\"But we're not just addressing the regime,\" Rubio said. \"We are addressing the factors that are a threat to the national interest of the United States.\"",
      "Although Rubio \u2014 like the Biden administration\u00a0\u2014 has recognized Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as the winner of the 2024 election, Rubio did not answer whether he believes Gonz\u00e1lez should be the leader of the country. Rubio instead said, \"There's the mission we are on right now.\"",
      "Cotton on Sunday reiterated some of Rubio's points about what the Trump administration wants to see in Venezuela's government, which is still composed of Maduro's allies.",
      "\"We want them to stop the drug and weapons trafficking,\" Cotton said. \"We want them to kick out the Iranians, the Cubans, the Islamic radicals like Hezbollah and just return to being a normal nation that will help build stability, order and prosperity, not just in Venezuela but in our backyard.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Rep. Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Jan. 4, 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Connecticut Congressman Jim Himes. He is the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, and he joins us this morning from Greenwich. Congressman Himes, you are part of that \"Gang of Eight,\" which means that information about these secret operations is statutorily intended to be shared with you as part of this very small group, given that and what you should know, can you clearly explain what the United States is doing?",
      "REP. JIM HIMES: Yeah, by the way, I was delighted to hear that Tom Cotton, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has been in regular contact with the administration. I've had zero outreach. And no Democrat that I'm aware of has had any outreach whatsoever. So apparently, we're now in a world where the legal obligation to keep the Congress informed only applies to, to your party, which is really something. But yeah, no, look, I know exactly where we are, Margaret. We're in the euphoria period of acknowledging across the board that Maduro was a bad guy and that our military is absolutely incredible. This is exactly the euphoria we felt in 2002 when our military took down the Taliban in Afghanistan. In 2003 when our military took out Saddam Hussein, and in 2011 when we helped remove Muammar Gaddafi from power in Libya. These were very, very bad people, by the way, much, much worse than Maduro in Venezuela, which was never a significant national security threat to the United States. But we're in that euphoria phase, and what we learned the day after the euphoria phase is that it's an awful lot easier to break a country than it is to actually do what the president promised to do, which is to run it. And so again, let's, let- let's let my Republican colleagues enjoy their day of euphoria, but they're going to wake up tomorrow morning, knowing, oh my God, there is no plan here any more than there was in Afghanistan, Iraq or in Libya.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you heard the secretary of state say, well, this is not the Middle East. There are conflicting statements from cabinet members. Hegseth told CBS, you know, the president of the United States will absolutely be in charge here, and leaned into the idea of military options. President Trump said there will be an option of boots on the ground. Secretary Rubio, though, really just leaned into an oil quarantine here. What- what exactly is the point of leverage here? When do you expect to get answers? Do your Republican colleagues promise you that they will get some of these answers to the questions you have?",
      "REP. HIMES: Of course, not Margaret. I mean, look, you're seeing it on television today, right? Two thirds of my Republicans [audio gap] wake up every single morning, and the only question they have is, what can I do to prove my loyalty to the president today? And we see this because the president has completely shifted who he was. I mean, as I watched that news conference yesterday, I thought, oh my god, this is Dick Cheney and the neocons. Not only are they taking out a- they're doing a regime change in a country, by the way, not a Tier 1 threat to the United States, but that they just don't like. They're warning the other dictators. This is Dick Cheney in 2002 saying we're taking down Saddam Hussein and, by the way, Syria and Iran better watch out. And the fascinating thing about that, and why it's really hard to answer the question of where the hell they're going to go from here, is that the president won by promising MAGA and his own people that this kind of stuff was done, that the neocons were over, and here we are. That was Dick Cheney in the conference yesterday, you know, deciding that the United States was going to, you know, militarily change regimes and threaten other ones, just because we don't like them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, but then the secretary of state was talking about working with the regime and working with Maduro's number two, who is now running the place, and other indicted criminals, according to the Southern District of New York who are continuing to run Venezuela. So can you really say that's regime change if they're working with the regime?",
      "REP. HIMES: As you pointed out, it's [audio gap] right and [audio gap] a loss to explain any consistency here. I mean, as you pointed out Maduro was a very bad guy and indicted Trump. Weeks ago, the pardoned bad and indicted [audio gap]. Weeks ago [audio gap] pardoned [audio gap] indicted drug-\u00a0 [audio gap]. These guys get a pardon [audio gap] full [audio gap] them [audio] New York. I [audio gap] that. There is no law [audio gap] maybe, maybe [audio gap] believes that [audio gap] work with the [audio gap] but, I mean, look again, go back [audio gap]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Himes, I'm sorry to cut you off here. I'm having a terrible time, audio-wise. I'm going to take a break because hopefully our technicians can fix it in those two minutes. So please stay with us. We'll be right back.",
      "[COMMERCIAL BREAK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Back to our conversation with Connecticut Democratic Congressman Jim Himes, who I think can be heard now. Congressman, I'm glad we got the link back up. For those viewers who lost you there, can you explain to us? The administration is arguing that what they did is legal, and that the snatch and grab operation of taking an indicted criminal, Nicolas Maduro, to the United States through military force has precedent, and they point back to what happened in the late 80s with Noriega in Panama. What's your challenge to that?",
      "REP. HIMES: Yeah, well, first, it's clearly illegal under international law, right? No full stop, UN Charter. No question there. Now you may not care about international law, but if you don't care about international law, remember, you're going to be making an appeal to international law to try to get restitution for the seizure of Chevron's oil stuff. So maybe you want to rethink how much disdain you show for international law. Clearly, not legal under the Constitution because though Presidents of both parties have argued against this, the Constitution is really pretty clear that the representatives of the people get to be consulted and ultimately approve military activity. That has not happened here at all. And, so again, there's nothing legal about this. And, more to the point, again, under the international law point, think of what Russia and China just learned. Russia and China just learned that all you need to do if you want to go into Estonia is to say that the leader of Estonia is a bad person. You don't even need to make a particularly good case. Look, there's no national security expert saying that Venezuela was a mortal threat to the United States three weeks ago. So what China and Russia just learned is that the beacon of liberty and rule of law in the world has now green lighted snatch and grab operations in Estonia, in Taiwan, wherever Xi and Putin decide they want to go next.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I take your point on the precedent there. Do you think that China or Russia would have the ability to carry out that kind of lightning operation the United States did?",
      "REP. HIMES: Well, no, but that doesn't mean, well, China, yes. China, yes. China, very soon. And you know, their leader has said, we will develop this capability. We know that their intent is to do precisely this in Taiwan. Russia is a more complicated case. It's, you know, Russia loses 10,000 people to get in, you know, three acres of land in eastern Ukraine. But that may not be true five years from now, and by the way, back to the Noriega case. Because you do ask a good question there, Panama is a terrible precedent. Why do I say that? Because when we went into Panama, the Panamanian Congress had declared war on the United States of America, right? They had killed a United States Marine and wounded two others, and the Congress had been consultant. The Congress in the Noriega mission had, had authorized regime change. So it's a terrible precedent that the administration is using to say that this is legal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, as we understand it, because we looked this up, Noriega claimed head of state immunity, and the court said that that immunity was meant to protect official state functions and private profiting off the drug trade. Basically, the courts ruled on his actions as a leader and not on the legality of the snatch-and-grab operation itself. So we're going to continue to track all of this. Thank you Congressman Himes, thank you Senator Van Hollen. We will be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Jan. 4, 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee Arkansas Republican Tom Cotton. Good to have you here. Senator.",
      "SEN. TOM COTTON: Thanks, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have oversight of the intelligence community which was deeply involved in this operation to go into Venezuela militarily and extract Nicholas Maduro and his wife. Does the US still assess that the regime in Venezuela is made up of Narco terrorists with ties to Iran, Russia, China and Cuba?",
      "SEN. COTTON: Well, first off, let me commend not only our military; as President Trump said this was an excellent operation, only the United States military could have pulled it off, but they couldn't have pulled it off with the support -- without the support of the professionals in the intelligence community, especially at the Central Intelligence Agency, and I'm glad that we have a director, John Ratcliffe, that has restored confidence in the CIA and the president - the president has, I think the President respects the CIA as much as he ever has. It's a great day, not just for our military, for our CIA. There's no question that the people in Venezuela who are still in charge of the apparatus of the government are sanctioned and indicted officials, and they've been in league with Nicolas Maduro until just yesterday. I think President Trump wants to give them a chance to turn a new page. Now, that's happened in the past. If you look at what's happened in Syria, as you know, Ahmed al-Sharaa, used to be an Islamic terrorist. He's now effectively a pro-American leader of Syria. Muammar Gaddafi, the same way, had much blood on his hands after the Iraq War, he turned over a new page and came out of the cold. Now, the difference in those two cases is they made concrete concessions to the United States and our policy goals and interests, or they had a longer history of turning the corner like Ahmed al-Sharaa has--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- Or it's an entirely new government.",
      "SEN. COTTON: We've got, we've got to make sure that the people who are now in charge of the apparatus of the Venezuelan Government are not going to continue Nicholas Maduro's ways, and I think that's what the President made clear yesterday.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it sounds like you think that's actually possible? For these individuals to cut all ties to the cartels?",
      "SEN. COTTON: The president, the president wants to give them a chance to turn the page in Venezuela and to help America achieve our policy goals there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How much time would you allow for that?",
      "SEN. COTTON: I wouldn't allow much personally, but I know those conversations are ongoing. As Secretary Rubio said earlier on the show in your interview, we want them to stop the drug and the weapons trafficking. We want them to take the refugees back. We want them to kick out the Iranians, the Cubans, the Islamic radicals, like Hezbollah, and just return to being a normal nation that will help build stability, order and prosperity, not just in Venezuela, but in our backyard.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Should a free and democratic Venezuela still be a goal of the United States of America? And if so, do you hear from the administration a plan to transition to that?",
      "SEN. COTTON:I think it should--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because Secretary Rubio wasn't--",
      "SEN. COTTON: I think it should be a goal. The opposition leaders, Miss Machado, Mr. Gonzalez, have said they think there need to be new elections. I hope the government that's right now in place in Venezuela will allow them to return, along with many other exiles who have left, political exiles who have left Venezuela, and that in some period of time, probably is not going to be days or weeks, maybe a number of months, you can have new elections in Venezuela that are free and fair. The Venezuelan people have made clear now under Nicholas Maduro, that they do not want a Chavista regime governing them. They want to say in their own future, Venezuela has a long history of stable, orderly government that was friendly to the United States. We are their number one customer for oil, and we work together to help build prosper- prosperity and stability in our own backyard. I hope that we can do that again with the future government of Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The CIA -- or CBS is reporting that the CIA source inside the Venezuelan government helped the US track Maduro's location leading up to this capture by the Army's Delta Force. The president said yesterday, the US should not pay out that $50 million bounty that was on the head of Maduro. Does that mean that the CIA asset inside still works for us?",
      "SEN. COTTON: Well, I have no comment on CIA sources or methods in Venezuela or elsewhere--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But they won't be receiving the $50 million reward?",
      "SEN. TOM COTTON: I'll simply say that the CIA's amazing work here, that has instilled such confidence in the president, is a reminder not just to Nicolas Maduro's cronies in Venezuela, but other bad guys all around the world, that we have very good insights into what they're doing and what they're up to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So when the President says we will run Venezuela, you are confident that there are actual American assets helping to do that. Is that how I should --",
      "SEN. COTTON: I'm confident that we have very good insight into Venezuela and other adversaries, foreign nations, and terrorist groups around the world. That's why--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why was China there?",
      "SEN. COTTON: -- the President-- that's why the President has such confidence in John Ratcliffe and the CIA. Well, China was trying to provide support to Venezuela during a US pressure campaign. But where were they when Delta Force went in and got Nicola Maduro? They were nowhere to be found. And frankly, that's the same thing you saw in June with China and Russia in Iran. We struck Iran. China and Russia did nothing. They stood idly by. That's a reminder that the United States is still the world's dominant superpower. Our friends are very happy today. Our enemies are very worried.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the person running the country, Delsey Rodriguez, spoke yesterday with Russia's top diplomat. They are in contact with Russia. The defense minister has deep, deep ties to Russia. Is there a US, Russia agreement here? Because there has been speculation based on testimony to Congress back in 2019 by one of Trump's top Russia advisers, Fiona Hill, that Russia has been floating a Venezuela for Ukraine deal here-",
      "SEN. COTTON: No, this--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -for some time. Is there any such deal?",
      "SEN. COTTON: No, this was a US operation that was designed to remove Nicholas Maduro because he was a US indicted drug trafficker, and you don't get immunity from American justice when you're indicted by our courts, just because you're the illegitimate communist dictator of another country. And--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to be clear, that's not what I'm saying here. Is there an implication that if Russia doesn't meddle in America's backyard, South America, the United States, will do something less in Ukraine--",
      "SEN. COTTON: No, there's--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --which Russia calls its backyard?",
      "SEN. COTTON: No, there's no such implication. And obviously, Russia doesn't need any kind of pretext to do so. It's invaded Ukraine twice over the last eleven years. There's no such implication here at all. And this is an operation the United States conducted on our own, without any coordination or cooperation from other countries to advance our national interest, which is to stop the drug trafficking and stop Venezuela from cooperating with countries like Russia and China and Cuba and Iran.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, I want to ask you about authorities here on the other side of the commercial break that we are going to take. So let me do that and come back. All right, stay with us. Senator Tom Cotton.",
      "***COMMERCIAL***",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN\u00a0 We return now to our conversation with Senate Intelligence chairman Tom Cotton, Senator Cotton, the president said Saturday that a second wave military attack had been planned. It wasn't necessary, but it could still be carried out. What would necessitate it? And what would you support?",
      "SEN. COTTON\u00a0 Well, what I took the president to mean is that what we just did with Nicholas Maduro could be done again to other Venezuelan leaders. Several of them are indicted in US courts. They're sanctioned by the United States and Canada and European Union and other nations. And if they continue down the path that Maduro took, the took the nation of Venezuela, then we could conduct the same kind of operation as him. I took that as the president, urging them to change their ways or face the same consequences.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN And would you support a stabilization force-- US boots on the ground, as the President said he wouldn't rule out?",
      "SEN. COTTON\u00a0 We already had boots on the ground, as Nicholas Maduro learned the hard way, it's always the President's option to use the American military to protect American citizens and interests. And obviously, we have many American citizens inside of Venezuela, and we have many interests and property as well. I think the president--",
      "MARGARET\u00a0 BRENNAN: But you know that combat and stabilization forces are--",
      "SEN. COTTON: But I don't think he- I don't think he plans to do that. And I think we've seen too the presiden-\u00a0 the President's way of war over the last or over five years in office. If you look at four major operations, the killing of the ISIS leader in Syria, the drone strike against the Iranian terrorist mastermind in Iraq, the strike against Iran's nuclear facilities. And now this capture of Nicolas Maduro, when our vital national interests are implicated, the President takes bold, audacious direct action. He accomplishes the mission, and then the mission is over. In some ways, this is the greatest mission of them all. I mean, as impressive as our military was in Iran in June or in its first term in Iraq and Syria against those terrorist masterminds, it's probably harder--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.",
      "SEN. COTTON: --to capture someone and get out with no American loss of life than it is to kill a target or to blow up nuclear facilities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you are drawing a distinction there in terms of authorities and use of the military. The War Powers Act requires the president to notify Congress of the reason for committing troops within 48 hours of their deployment, and requires they be removed within 60 to 90 days, unless Congress authorizes it. You okay with this open ended commitment to keep forces as they are?",
      "SEN. TOM COTTON",
      "Well, I think he has removed the troops. They were only there for a couple hours to nab Nicolas--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the Delta Force operators who are on the ground.",
      "SEN. COTTON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But there is a significant military buildup all around South America right now.",
      "SEN. COTTON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're comfortable with that? Does Congress need any authority--",
      "**CROSSTALK**",
      "SEN. TOM COTTON: No, I strongly support it. I mean, part of, part of that, that deployment, was to collect intelligence to conduct this operation to quarantine the oil trade that Venezuela was sending to Cuba or sending to our adversaries around the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's not mission accomplished?",
      "SEN. COTTON: It won't- we won't have accomplished our mission until Venezuela starts acting like a normal nation. It stops the drug trafficking and human trafficking, it kicks out Islamic radicals and Iranians and Cubans and helps the United States build a more stable, prosperous Western Hemisphere. That's the ultimate goal, and that's what President Trump laid out yesterday.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN\u00a0 So last month, the Chief of Staff to the president, Susie Wiles, told Vanity Fair that attacking targets on Venezuela's mainland, sovereign territory, would force Trump to get congressional approval. Quote, If he were to authorize some activity on land, then it's war, then we'd need Congress. You are a coequal branch of government. Why doesn't the President need you or your authority or your consultation?",
      "SEN. TOM COTTON: Well, I consult routinely with the President and his senior advisors.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You, personally, sure. But",
      "SEN. COTTON: Yeah. Well, as the Chairman of the intelligence committee--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But as Congress--",
      "SEN. COTTON: As the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, they keep me apprised of what their plans are and what's going on. I mean, I spoke in the last 24 hours, not just with the President, but with his senior team, every man that was on that stage with him yesterday, Marco Rubio, John Ratcliffe, Pete Hegseth, Dan Caine, Stephen Miller. The core architect of the President's policy here, I've spoken with every single one of them in the last 24 hours. Congress has acted to provide the President the resources and authority that he needs to protect the vital interests of the United States, whether it's taking out this drug trafficker Nicolas Maduro who had contributed to the deaths of hundreds of Arkansans and hundreds of thousands of Americans, or striking Iran's nuclear facilities, he has the inherent authority under our constitution to protect these American national interests and as the chief law enforcement officer to make sure that indicted drug traffickers face justice, whether they're indicted in Venezuela or indicted in the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But by his own admission, the DEA administrator said that cocaine prices have gone up nearly 45% drug traffickers have only changed routes. Venezuela is not a fentanyl producer, not a cocaine producer. Do you really think that this has ended the drug problem?",
      "SEN. TOM COTTON \u00a0 Venezuela is unique in Latin America, though, because the Maduro regime is itself in league with the drug trafficking cartels. It doesn't just tolerate them, or it doesn't just fail to control its territory. It is in league and profits from drug trafficking cartels. That's the distinction between Venezuela and other nations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN\u00a0 Senator Cotton, thank you for your time today.",
      "SEN. COTTON: Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.",

    "summary": "The one-year delay comes as President Trump has rolled back some other import duties amid affordability concerns.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration\u00a0said\u00a0on Wednesday it is postponing tariff increases on imported upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and vanities by a year, citing ongoing negotiations with trading partners.",
      "Without the delay, the U.S. was set to double its tariff rate on kitchen cabinets and vanities produced outside the U.S. to 50% starting Jan. 1. The import duty on upholstered furniture \u2014 including sofas and armchairs \u2014 was set to rise to 30% from 25% on the first day of 2026.",
      "The postponement follows a November rollback by the Trump administration of tariffs on imported foods such as beef, coffee and bananas, as affordability concerns\u00a0have weighed on consumer sentiment about the U.S. economy. Furniture prices have been outpacing inflation, with living room, kitchen and dining room furniture rising 4.6% in November from a year earlier, compared with a 2.7% annual increase in the overall Consumer Price Index.",
      "According to the Dec. 31 White House announcement, the tariff rate on upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and vanities will remain at 25%.",
      "\"The United States continues to engage in productive negotiations with trade partners to address trade reciprocity and national security concerns with respect to imports of wood products,\" the White House said in its statement.",
      "\"The United States will therefore delay the increase in tariff rates for upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets, and vanities that was set to take place on January 1, 2026, under the September 29, 2025, Proclamation for an additional year,\" it added.",
      "When President Trump announced the furniture tariffs in September, he wrote on social media that his goal was to help revive U.S. furniture manufacturing in North Carolina.

    "story": [
      "Climate change worsened by human behavior made 2025 one of the three hottest years on record, scientists said.",
      "It was also the first time that the three-year temperature average broke through the threshold set in the 2015 Paris Agreement of limiting warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times. Experts say keeping the Earth below that limit could save lives and prevent catastrophic environmental destruction around the globe.",
      "The analysis from World Weather Attribution researchers, released Tuesday in Europe, came after a year when people around the world were slammed by the dangerous extremes brought on by a warming planet.",
      "Temperatures remained high despite the presence of a La Ni\u00f1a, the occasional natural cooling of Pacific Ocean waters that influences weather worldwide. Researchers cited the continued burning of fossil fuels \u2014 oil, gas and coal \u2014 that send planet-warming greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.",
      "\"If we don't stop burning fossil fuels very, very, quickly, very soon, it will be very hard to keep that goal\" of warming, Friederike Otto, co-founder of World Weather Attribution and an Imperial College London climate scientist, told The Associated Press. \"The science is increasingly clear.\"",
      "Extreme weather events kill thousands of people and cost billions of dollars in damage annually.",
      "Scientists stress humans' contributions to climate change",
      "WWA scientists identified 157 extreme weather events as most severe in 2025, meaning they met criteria such as causing more than 100 deaths, affecting more than half an area's population or having a state of emergency declared. Of those, they closely analyzed 22.",
      "That included dangerous heat waves, which the WWA said were the world's deadliest extreme weather events in 2025. The researchers said some of the heat waves they studied in 2025 were 10 times more likely than they would have been a decade ago due to climate change.",
      "\"The heat waves we have observed this year are quite common events in our climate today, but they would have been almost impossible to occur without human-induced climate change,\" Otto said. \"It makes a huge difference.\"",
      "Meanwhile, prolonged drought contributed to wildfires that scorched Greece and Turkey. Torrential rains and flooding in Mexico killed dozens of people and left many more missing. Super Typhoon Fung-wong slammed the Philippines, forcing more than a million people to evacuate. Monsoon rains battered India with floods and landslides.",
      "Warning times shortened",
      "The WWA said the increasingly frequent and severe extremes threatened the ability of millions of people across the globe to respond and adapt to those events with enough warning, time and resources \u2014 what the scientists call \"limits of adaptation.\" The report pointed to Hurricane Melissa as an example: The storm intensified so quickly that it made forecasting and planning more difficult, and pummeled Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti so severely that it left the small island nations unable to respond to and handle its extreme losses and damage.",
      "This year's United Nations climate talks in Brazil in November ended without any explicit plan to transition away from fossil fuels, and though more money was pledged to help countries adapt to climate change, they will take more time to do it.",
      "Officials, scientists, and analysts have conceded that Earth's warming will overshoot 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit), though some say reversing that trend remains possible.",
      "Mixed bag in climate change fight",
      "Yet different nations are seeing varying levels of progress.",
      "China is rapidly deploying renewable energies including solar and wind power \u2014 but is also continuing to invest in coal. Though increasingly frequent extreme weather has spurred calls for climate action across Europe, some nations say that limits economic growth. Meanwhile, in the U.S., the Trump administration has steered the nation away from clean-energy policy in favor of measures that support coal, oil and gas.",
      "\"The geopolitical weather is very cloudy this year, with a lot of policymakers very clearly making policies for the interest of the fossil fuel industry rather than for the populations of their countries,\" Otto said. \"And we have a huge amount of mis- and disinformation that people have to deal with.\"",
      "Andrew Kruczkiewicz, a senior researcher at the Columbia University Climate School who wasn't involved in the WWA work, said places are seeing disasters they aren't used to, extreme events are intensifying faster and they are becoming more complex. That requires earlier warnings and new approaches to response and recovery, he said.",
      "\"On a global scale, progress is being made,\" he added, \"but we must do more.\"",

In some cases, CBS News ran images through AI detection tools, which can be inconsistent or inaccurate but can still help flag possibly manipulated content.",
      "Checking the source of the content, as well as the date, location, and other news sources are all ways to suss out whether an image is accurate, according to experts.",
      "AI-generated images of Maduro flood social media",
      "After President Trump announced Maduro's capture in a social media post early Saturday morning, questions brewed about the logistics of the mission, where Maduro would be flown and the future of Venezuela. Meanwhile, images of Maduro that were likely manipulated or generated with AI tools circulated on social media, garnering millions of views and thousands of likes across platforms.",
      "One photo purporting to show Maduro after his capture was shared widely, including by the mayor of Coral Gables Florida, Vince Lago, and in a joint Instagram post by two popular conservative content accounts with over 6 million combined followers. Using Google's SynthID tool, CBS News Confirmed team found the photo was likely edited or generated using Google AI.",
      "CBS News also found a video generated from the photo, showing military personnel escorting Maduro from an aircraft. It was posted around 6:30 a.m. \u2014 12 hours before CBS News reported that a person in shackles was seen disembarking the plane carrying Maduro and confirmed his eventual arrival Saturday evening at Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal facility in Brooklyn.",
      "Another unverified photo that made the rounds on social media depicts Maduro in an aircraft with U.S. soldiers. While two different AI detection tools gave inconsistent results as to its authenticity, CBS was not able to confirm its legitimacy.",
      "Trump posts photo of Maduro in U.S. custody",
      "On Saturday, Mr. Trump posted an image captioned \"Nicolas Maduro on board the USS Iwo Jima\" after the South American leader's capture. Later that evening, the White House Rapid Response account shared a video that appeared to show Maduro being escorted down a hallway by federal agents.",
      "Old images recirculate",
      "Old videos and images from past events recirculated, purporting to show reactions to Maduro's capture and strikes in Caracas. One video showing people tearing down a billboard image of Maduro dates as far back as July 2024. Another video purporting to show a strike in Venezuela had circulated on social media as far back as June 2025.",
      "Another image showing a man with a sack over his head while sitting in the back of a car circulated widely, sparking online speculation as to whether the photo showed Maduro's capture. Many users flagged that the photo was probably not of Maduro, but as of this afternoon the post had 30,000 likes and over a thousand reposts. A Daily Mail article from 2023 reported that the photo shows Saddam Hussein after his capture, sitting with a Delta Force member, but CBS has not independently confirmed this.",
      "CBS News reached out to X and Meta regarding the companies' policies on AI-generated images, but has not received a response. X's rules page says it may label posts containing synthetic and manipulated media and Meta says it prohibits AI that contributes to misinformation or disinformation.",

      "Elon Musk's Grok, the chatbot developed by his company xAI, acknowledged \"lapses in safeguards\" on the AI platform that allowed users to generate digitally altered, sexualized photos of minors.",
      "The admission comes after multiple users alleged on social media that people are using Grok to generate suggestive images of minors, in some cases stripping them of clothing they were wearing in original photos.",
      "In a post on Friday responding to one person on Musk-owned social media site X, Grok stated it was \"urgently fixing\" the holes in its system. Grok also included a link to CyberTipline, a website where people can report child sexual exploitation.",
      "\"There are isolated cases where users prompted for and received AI images depicting minors in minimal clothing, like the example you referenced,\" Grok said in a separate\u00a0post\u00a0on X on Thursday. \"xAI has safeguards, but improvements are ongoing to block such requests entirely.\"",
      "In another social media post, a user posted side-by-side photos of herself wearing a dress and another that appears to be a digitally altered version of the same photo of her in a bikini. \"How is this not illegal?\" she\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "On Friday, French officials reported the sexually explicit content generated by Grok to prosecutors, referring to it as \"manifestly illegal\" in a statement, according to Reuters.",
      "xAI, the company that developed the AI chatbot Grok, said \"Legacy Media Lies\" in a response to a request for comment.",
      "Grok has independently taken some responsibility for the content. In one\u00a0instance\u00a0earlier this week, the chatbot apologized for generating an AI image of two female minors, adding that the artificial photo violated ethical standards and potentially U.S. law on child pornography.",
      "\"I deeply regret an incident on Dec 28, 2025, where I generated and shared an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire based on a user's prompt,\" the chatbot posted.",

Every notification ding on your phone and message asking 'Is this you? perpetuates the abuse.\"",
      "Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content detection tool, told CBS News on Wednesday that it had detected thousands of sexually explicit images created by Grok this week alone.",
      "\"As generative AI tools become more powerful and more accessible, the Grok situation highlights how increasingly common AI safety failures are becoming.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Lawmakers return to Washington this week, staring down an end-of-month deadline to avert another government shutdown. The next funding fight comes fresh off a revolt from moderate Republicans over rising health care costs, and as the conflict with Venezuela and frustration with the Justice Department's handling of the rollout of the Epstein files come to a head.",
      "Funding the government is at the top of Congress' to-do list after a bruising 43-day shutdown that stretched from October through the first half of November. To end the longest shutdown in history, lawmakers approved a measure to fund parts of the government through the end of the fiscal year in September. Funding for the vast majority of agencies and programs, however, was temporarily extended until Jan. 30.",
      "Congress risks a partial shutdown if it does not approve new funding or another short-term patch for the remaining portions of the government before the end of the month. And it has to balance that priority alongside other legislative battles.",
      "Funding the government",
      "Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, the top GOP appropriators in the Senate and House, announced an agreement on top-line spending for the remaining nine funding bills just before Christmas.",
      "\"This pathway forward aligns with President Trump's clear direction to rein in runaway, beltway-driven spending,\" Cole said in a statement, noting that the total funding falls below the current levels. \"We will now begin expeditiously drafting the remaining nine full-year bills to ensure we are ready to complete our work in January.\"",
      "House and Senate negotiators released the text of an initial package of three bills on Monday, known as a \"minibus.\" The legislation would provide funding related to science and the Departments of Commerce and Justice; energy and water development; and the Department of Interior and the EPA.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said that \"passing these bills will help ensure that Congress, not President Trump and Russ Vought, decides how taxpayer dollars are spent-by once again providing hundreds of detailed spending directives and reasserting congressional control over these incredibly important spending decisions.\"",
      "The progress inches Congress one step closer to avoiding a shutdown, though potential roadblocks remain. Buy-in from Democrats is necessary in the Senate for passage and may be needed in the House if conservatives withhold their support \u2014 a move they regularly threaten with funding bills.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, is also facing a dwindling majority. GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia is vacating her seat on Monday, retiring a year before her term ends after a bitter feud with President Trump. Her departure will leave Johnson with a two-vote margin.",
      "After weeks of debate among Senate Republicans, the upper chamber had hoped to move forward with another \"minibus\" ahead of the winter recess, but two Democratic senators stood in the way.",
      "Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper of Colorado held up the package to object to the Trump administration's dismantling of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, which is located in Boulder. The senators pledged to use \"every lever available to do what is right for Colorado.\" The duo may be even less inclined to allow the funding bills to move forward after Mr. Trump vetoed a bipartisan bill designed to make it easier to build a water pipeline in Colorado.",
      "Should the process to pass the long-term measures stall, leaders could opt to pursue another short-term continuing resolution and again punt the funding issue down the line.",
      "Still, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said on ABC's \"This Week\" Sunday that Congress isn't headed toward a shutdown at the end of the month. He said Democrats want to work on a bipartisan, bicameral basis to fund the government through September, and \"the good news is our Republican appropriators are working with us and we're making good progress in that regard.\"",
      "Health care",
      "Democrats' demand to extend the Affordable Care Act's enhanced premium tax credits was at the center of last year's shutdown. Their effort to extend the tax credits as part of the agreement to reopen the government fell short and the subsidies expired last week, raising premiums for millions of Americans who purchase health insurance through the exchanges.",
      "But the fight isn't over yet.",
      "After a vote on a Democratic measure to extend the tax credits for three years without reforms fell short in the Senate, four moderate House Republicans joined all Democrats to back a discharge petition to force a vote in the lower chamber.",
      "The moderates had criticized a straight extension without any reforms such as income caps, but argued that Democrats' proposal to extend the tax credits without any changes was better than allowing them to expire.",
      "The House is expected to vote on the motion to discharge the bill for a vote in the coming days. Johnson said it was \"inevitable\" that it would be considered on the floor when lawmakers returned after the holidays.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that \"we've got to make sure that a straightforward extension of the Affordable Care Act tax credits passes out of the House upon our return next week so we can protect the health care of tens of millions of Americans who are about to experience dramatically increased health insurance premiums, copays and deductibles.\"",
      "\"That's completely and totally unacceptable, and Republicans have a responsibility to partner with us as Democrats to stop it,\" Jeffries added.",
      "Ahead of the winter break, the discharge petition seemed to add momentum to a bipartisan effort to reach a health care compromise. A number of moderate Democrats and Republicans in both chambers have been seeking a solution on health care costs, and were expected to continue their conversations over the holidays. The discharge petition could serve as a vehicle for an extension of the tax credits with some reforms, should the lawmakers reach a compromise.",
      "Lawmakers to apply pressure on Epstein files release",
      "Congress' return is also expected to be marked by new pressure on the Justice Department over its piecemeal approach to releasing the files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "The Epstein Files Transparency Act \u2014 which Congress passed and Mr. Trump signed into law in November \u2014 dictated that the Justice Department release the files by Dec. 19. However, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the Justice Department will release them on a rolling basis due to the volume of materials and the need to redact some information.",
      "Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, and Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, spearheaded the legislation and the effort to force a vote on the issue. They have both criticized the Justice Department's handling of the release.",
      "So far, the Justice Department has released thousands of documents that are believed to represent only a small fraction of the Epstein files. The first release came on Dec. 19, followed by the release of additional materials a day later, along with a massive tranche of files on Dec. 23. The Justice Department also said on Dec. 24 that \"over a million more documents potentially related to the Jeffrey Epstein case\" had been uncovered, adding that the process of releasing the files may take \"a few more weeks.\"",
      "Khanna and Massie said last month that they are drafting a resolution to hold Attorney General Pam Bondi in \"inherent contempt\" of Congress over the release of the files. The lawmakers said they were building support for the resolution, which would likely be offered as a privileged motion, requiring leadership to schedule a vote within two legislative days.",
      "Schumer also announced last month that he had introduced a resolution that would direct the upper chamber to \"initiate legal actions\" against the Justice Department to demand that it comply with the law. The New York Democrat is expected to force a vote on the measure when the Senate reconvenes this week.",
      "A group of senators, including one Republican, has also requested that the Justice Department's inspector general conduct an audit of the department's compliance with the new law. The senators said the investigation is \"essential\" given the Trump administration's \"historic hostility to releasing the files\" and \"politicization of the Epstein case more broadly.\"",
      "Conflict with Venezuela",
      "Another war powers vote is also on the horizon after Mr. Trump announced early Saturday that the U.S. had carried out a \"large scale strike against Venezuela\" and captured President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife. Mr. Trump also said the U.S. will \"run the country\" and threatened a \"much larger attack\" if needed. The development marks a major escalation in the monthslong military campaign against the South American nation.",
      "Congress has not authorized military force against Venezuela, and the Trump administration did not notify lawmakers of the plan ahead of time.",
      "Most Democrats and a few Republicans have sought to limit Mr. Trump's authority to strike Venezuela and suspected drug-trafficking boats in the region as the U.S. leader says the South American country's role in drug smuggling poses a threat to national security. But the Senate and House have each failed twice to limit Mr. Trump's authority to continue the military campaign.",
      "Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said the Senate will vote this week on his latest war powers resolution. He introduced the measure in early December, days after the revelation that the U.S. killed two people who survived the initial blast of a Sept. 2 strike in the Caribbean Sea.",
      "Kaine's measure would require \"the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities within or against Venezuela that have not been authorized by Congress.\"",
      "In a call with reporters on Saturday he called the military action in Venezuela \"an illegal war.\"",
      "\"There is no legal justification in the Constitution, in the history of the Constitution, or an American law that would authorize the president to wage war, to depose President Maduro and seize its oil and run the country of Venezuela without coming to Congress,\" Kaine said. \"It's time for Congress to get its ass off the couch and do what the Constitution mandates that we do.\"",
      "Besides the war powers resolution, Kaine said he's also looking at the defense appropriations process as a mechanism to prohibit military action in Venezuela.",
      "Before they left for the year, House Democrats forced votes on two war powers resolutions as Mr. Trump warned that land strikes against Venezuela could commence \"soon.\" Since then, the U.S. carried out several more boat strikes and, according to Mr. Trump, \"knocked out\" a \"big facility\" linked to the alleged drug smuggling operations.",

    "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 10:10:00 -0500",
    "summary": "FDA-approved semaglutide drug is the first GLP-1 pill for weight loss available in the U.S., according to drugmaker Novo Nordisk.",
    "story": [
      "A pill form of weight-loss drug Wegovy, manufactured by Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk, is now available in the U.S., giving Americans access to an oral medication to treat obesity.",
      "The starting dose of the daily Wegovy pill, at 1.5 milligrams, is now available for $149 per month for self-paying patients,\u00a0Novo Nordisk announced on Monday. A 4 mg dose of the medication is available for the same price through April 15, after which the cost will rise to $199.",
      "Ed Cinca, senior vice president of marketing and patient solutions at Novo Nordisk, said in a statement that the new drug represents a \"significant innovation,\" describing it as the \"first and only\" GLP-1 pill for weight loss.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the pill version\u00a0of Wegovy in December. Competitor Eli Lilly's obesity pill,\u00a0orforglipron, is still being reviewed by the FDA.",
      "The Novo Nordisk pill contains 25 milligrams of semaglutide, the same ingredient in injectables Wegovy and Ozempic. It also has similar side effects as the injectable version of the medication, including nausea and diarrhea, according to Novo Nordisk.",
      "The new Wegovy pill provides Americans an alternative, and more convenient, option than injectable treatments, which have dominated the weight-loss market since they were introduced. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans has used an injectable GLP-1 drug for weight loss or another condition, according to a recent\u00a0survey\u00a0from nonprofit group KFF.",
      "Like the injectable version of Wegovy, the pill is intended to help patients shed body weight when coupled with diet and exercise. Novo Nordisk said that people who used the oral medication during phase 3 of clinical trials lost about 14% of their body weight, while those who stayed on the treatment lost about 17%.",

Meanwhile, images of Maduro that were likely manipulated or generated with AI tools circulated on social media, garnering millions of views and thousands of likes across platforms.",
      "One photo purporting to show Maduro after his capture was shared widely, including by the mayor of Coral Gables Florida, Vince Lago, and in a joint Instagram post by two popular conservative content accounts with over 6 million combined followers. Using Google's SynthID tool, CBS News Confirmed team found the photo was likely edited or generated using Google AI.",
      "CBS News also found a video generated from the photo, showing military personnel escorting Maduro from an aircraft. It was posted around 6:30 a.m. \u2014 12 hours before CBS News reported that a person in shackles was seen disembarking the plane carrying Maduro and confirmed his eventual arrival Saturday evening at Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal facility in Brooklyn.",

Another video purporting to show a strike in Venezuela had circulated on social media as far back as June 2025.",
      "Another image showing a man with a sack over his head while sitting in the back of a car circulated widely, sparking online speculation as to whether the photo showed Maduro's capture. Many users flagged that the photo was probably not of Maduro, but as of this afternoon the post had 30,000 likes and over a thousand reposts.

    "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 22:55:18 -0500",
    "summary": "Abel, 63, takes the helm of Berkshire Hathaway after a six-decade run by Buffett.",
    "story": [
      "Warren Buffett officially stepped down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway on Thursday, handing the reins of the multinational conglomerate to his hand-picked successor, Greg Abel.",
      "Abel, 63, is taking the helm of Berkshire after Buffett, 95, spent six decades transforming a struggling textile manufacturer into one of the world's most successful companies. As the new CEO, Abel will be tasked with upholding Berkshire's decentralized model \u2014 one of the company's hallmarks \u2014 while guiding it into a new era of growth.",
      "In recent years, that growth has slowed as the company has ballooned in size, making it harder to find large, meaningful acquisition targets.",
      "Buffett tapped Abel as his successor in May, saying at the time that he planned to step down as CEO. The move surprised many investors, as it was widely assumed Abel would not take over until after Buffett's death. While Buffett will no longer run the company, he will remain chairman and continue coming into the office five days a week, giving Abel regular access to his longtime mentor.",
      "Here's what to know about Abel, the new leader of Berkshire Hathaway, and how his leadership approach could differ from Buffett's.",
      "Who is Greg Abel?",
      "Abel, a former amateur hockey player and avid golfer, joined Berkshire in 2000 after serving as CEO of MidAmerican, an Iowa-based utility company. Once at Berkshire, he helped transform the recently acquired MidAmerican into Berkshire Hathaway Energy, the largest producer of wind energy in the country.",
      "Before taking on his new role as CEO, the Canadian executive served as vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and oversaw Berkshire's non-insurance companies.",
      "What has Buffett said about Abel?",
      "Buffett has repeatedly expressed confidence in Abel's ability to lead Berkshire's operations, most recently during a CNBC interview, which partially aired on Friday.",
      "Buffet said Abel will be the \"decider,\" adding that he \"can't imagine how much more [Abel] can get accomplished in a week than I can in a month.\"",
      "\"I'd rather have Greg handling my money than any of the top investment advisors or any of the top CEOs in the United States,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"",
      "Buffett also reiterated his belief in Abel's leadership during the final letter he penned to shareholders in November 2025.",
      "\"Greg Abel has more than met the high expectations I had for him when I first thought he should be Berkshire's next CEO,\" he wrote. \"He understands many of our businesses and personnel far better than I now do, and he is a very fast learner about matters many CEOs don't even consider.\"",
      "What sort of changes might Abel make?",
      "CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said it would be natural for Abel to make some changes in the way Berkshire is run. Taking a more traditional approach to leadership with nearly 400,000 employees spread across dozens of subsidiaries makes a lot of sense, she said.",
      "The new CEO has already announced some leadership changes, including the appointment of NetJets CEO Adam Johnson as manager of all of Berkshire's consumer, service and retail businesses.",
      "He will also eventually face more pressure to start paying a dividend. Historically, Berkshire has favored reinvesting profits over making quarterly or annual payouts to shareholders.",
      "While Abel is viewed as more hands-on than Buffett, experts say he's not expected to initiate any major shake-ups at the decades-old company. He's exhibited a commitment to Berkshire's decentralized structure, which gives acquired companies a large degree of autonomy to run their operations.",

      "Maduro arrived at Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal facility in Brooklyn, at about 8:52 p.m. ET on Saturday. He was not slated to be housed in his own wing as of Saturday evening. His wife's confinement status as of Saturday night is unknown.",
      "MDC is one of the few detention centers in the U.S. with the capacity for high-security defendants. It is known for housing other high-profile defendants like Luigi Mangione, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs and Ghislaine Maxwell.",
      "Law enforcement sources tell CBS News that Maduro is being held on one of the top floors of MDC. They say that he is not being held in isolation, but is being held with other higher profile inmates.",
      "In a superseding indictment filed in the Southern District of New York against Maduro, members of his family and his cabinet, the U.S. is accusing the South American leader of conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism and to import cocaine. He is also accused of possession of and conspiracy to possess \"Machineguns and Destructive Devices,\" according to the indictment unsealed Saturday by Attorney General Pam Bondi.",
      "\"They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,\" Bondi said.",
      "Monday's arraignment starts the clock for prosecutors to turn over evidence against Maduro and those indicted, criminal defense attorney and CBS News Legal Analyst Caroline Polisi told \"CBS Evening News.\"",
      "\"There are lots of nuanced arguments to be made about where the trial goes domestically,\" Polisi said.",
      "Asked whether Maduro can get a fair trial in the U.S., Polisi said: \"The prosecution wants to make sure every element of this trial is above board, is not prejudicial, they just as much as the defense want this case to be fair and impartial.\"",
      "The charges appear to be the same as those that were filed in a 2020 indictment of Maduro and several key aides.",
      "The indictment, prepared by New York U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton, says: \"For over 25 years, leaders of Venezuela have abused their positions of public trust and corrupted once-legitimate institutions to import tons of cocaine into the United States,\" before alleging that Maduro \"is at the forefront of that corruption and has partnered with his co-conspirators to use his illegally obtained authority and the institutions he corroded to transport thousands of tons of cocaine to the United States.\"",
      "The U.S. government also claimed that Flores is involved in her husband's alleged crimes. According to the indictment, Flores allegedly brokered a meeting between a large-scale drug trafficker and the director of Venezuela's National Anti-Drug Office, Nestor Reverol Torres, and allegedly accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in 2007.",
      "The trafficker arranged a bribe to Reverol Torres \u2014 $100,000 per flight \u2014 to ship cocaine, prosecutors allege. Reverol Torres was\u00a0indicted in 2015 by U.S. prosecutors in New York.",
      "In the indictment filed against Maduro in 2020, federal prosecutors alleged that the Venezuelan leader and other senior Venezuelan government officials collaborated with the Colombian guerrilla group Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, or FARC, to traffic cocaine and weapons to the U.S.",
      "Maduro has in the past denied the accusations against him.",

    "summary": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said President Trump always has options when it comes to what comes next in Venezuela, after a U.S. strike and capture of the country's president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
    "story": [
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that President Trump always has options around what comes next in Venezuela, after the U.S. carried out airstrikes and captured the country's president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Asked to clarify that there is no plan for U.S. occupation of Venezuela, Rubio said \"the president always retains optionality on anything and on all of these matters.\"",
      "\"He certainly has the ability and the right under the Constitution of the United States to act against imminent and urgent threats against the country,\" Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Maduro arrived Saturday night at a detention center in New York City and faces federal charges related to drug trafficking and working with gangs designated as terrorist organizations, which he denies. Mr. Trump said Saturday that the U.S. would \"run\" Venezuela on a temporary basis during the transition, sparking questions about what comes next.",
      "Mr. Trump said he is \"not afraid\" to have American military \"boots on the ground\" in Venezuela. Rubio expanded on this on Sunday, saying that Mr. Trump \"does not feel like he is going to publicly, you know, rule out options that are available for the United States, even though that's not what you're seeing right now.\"",
      "\"What you're seeing right now is an oil quarantine that allows us to exert tremendous leverage over what happens next,\" Rubio said.",
      "Rubio pointed to the U.S. naval deployment in the region, which has carried out a series of strikes on more than 30 boats, saying it's \"capable of stopping, not just drug boats, but stopping any of these sanctioned boats that come in and out\" and \"paralyzing that portion of how the regime, you know, generates revenue.\" The secretary of state added that it \"will continue to be in place.\"",
      "The secretary of state argued that \"the key to what that regime relies on is their economy fueled by oil,\" calling the country's oil industry \"backwards.\"",
      "\"None of the money from the money from the oil gets to the people, it's all stolen by the people that are on the top there,\" Rubio said. \"And so that's why we have a quarantine.\"",
      "The U.S. has seized multiple vessels in international waters, and the White House announced last month a \"blockade\" of all sanctioned oil tankers entering or leaving Venezuela. Rubio said the \"quarantine\" allows the U.S. to seize sanctioned oil shipments with a court order and offers \"a tremendous amount of leverage that will continue to be in place until we see changes that not just further the national interest of the United States, which is number one, but also that lead to a better future for the people of Venezuela.\"",
      "\"And so that's the sort of control the president is pointing to when he says that,\" Rubio said. \"We continue with that quarantine, and we expect to see that there will be changes not just in the way the oil industry is run for the benefit of the people, but also so that they stop the drug trafficking, so that we no longer have these gang problems, so that they kick the FARC and the ELN out, and that they no longer cozy up to Hezbollah and Iran in our own hemisphere.\"",
      "\"This is not the Middle East\"",
      "The secretary of state argued that the calculus is different for the U.S when it comes to Venezuela as opposed to other foreign policy matters.",
      "\"The whole, you know, foreign policy apparatus thinks everything is Libya, everything is Iraq, everything is Afghanistan. This is not the Middle East. And our mission here is very different,\" Rubio said.",
      "Rubio said that within the Western Hemisphere, Venezuela is a country that \"under the control of this regime, has cozied up to Iran, has cozied up to Hezbollah, has allowed narco-trafficking gangs to operate with impunity from their own territory, allows boats with drugs to traffic from their territory.\"",
      "\"That is what we're addressing now. We're not just addressing the regime, we are addressing the factors that are a threat to the national interest of the United States,\" he added.",
      "The secretary of state said \"our objectives when it comes to how Venezuela impacts the national interest of the United States have not changed, and we want those addressed.\"",
      "\"We want drug trafficking to stop, we want no more gang members to come our way, we don't want to see the Iranian and, by the way, Cuban presence in the past,\" Rubio said. \"We want the oil industry in that country not to go to the benefit of pirates and adversaries of the United States, but for the benefit of the people. We want to see all of that happen. We insist on seeing that happen, and we are going to work to continue to see that happen.\"",
      "Rubio says it's \"absurd\" to suggest an immediate election",
      "Rubio said the U.S. \"just could not work with\" Maduro, adding that \"we offered him, on multiple occasions, an opportunity to remove himself from the scene in a positive way. He chose not to do so.\"",
      "Asked whether Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, is someone the U.S. could work with, Rubio said \"we're going to find out.\"",
      "\"Everyone's asking why, 24 hours after Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was arrested, there isn't an election scheduled for tomorrow? That's absurd,\" Rubio said. \"These things take time. There's a process.\"",
      "The secretary of state said \"of course we want to see Venezuela transition to be a place completely different than what it looks like today. But obviously we don't have the expectation that's going to happen in the next 15 hours. What we do have an expectation is that it move in that direction. We think it's in our national interest, and frankly, in the interest of people of Venezuela.\"",
      "Asked about other indicted members of Maduro's Cabinet, Rubio responded, \"So you wanted us to land in five other military bases?\"",
      "\"The number one person on the list was the guy who claimed to be the president of the country that he was not, and he was arrested along with his wife, who was also indicted,\" Rubio said, calling Maduro the \"top target.\"",
      "Rubio has previously recognized Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as the winner of the 2024 election. Asked whether the U.S. is working on a transition to install the leader, Rubio said while he has \"admiration for Edmundo\" and opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, \"There's the mission we are on right now.\"",
      "Rubio said ultimately the goals in Venezuela are \"very simple.\"",
      "\"In the 21st century, under the Trump administration, we are not going to have a country like Venezuela in our own hemisphere, in the sphere of control, and the crossroads for Hezbollah, for Iran, and for every other malign influence in the world \u2014 that's just not going to exist,\" Rubio said.",

      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "Americans woke up yesterday to the shocking news that the U.S. had staged a massive air attack on the capital of Venezuela and captured Nicolas Maduro. Today, we will explore questions about what it means for the U.S. and why it's such a seismic development.",
      "We begin today with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who joins us this morning from Miami.",
      "Good morning to you, Mr. Secretary.",
      "MARCO RUBIO (U.S. Secretary of State): Good morning. Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump said that the United States will run the country and that Venezuela will be largely run by, he pointed to you and some of the other Cabinet members when he spoke to the public yesterday. He said, the U.S. retains all military options, including boots on the ground, until U.S. demands have been fully met.",
      "How do you plan to run the country?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, first of all, I think the important thing to point out is that the key to what that regime relies on and \u2013 is their economy fueled by oil.",
      "And, right now, it is an oil industry that is backwards and really needs a lot of help and work in terms of \u2013 not only that, but it doesn't help the people. None of the money from the oil gets to the people. It's all stolen by the people that are on the top there.",
      "And so that's why we have a quarantine. There's a quarantine right now in which sanctioned oil shipments \u2013 if there's a boat, and that boat is under US sanctions, we go get a court order. We will seize it. That remains in place, and that's a tremendous amount of leverage that will continue to be in place until we see changes that not just further the national interest of the United States, which is number one, but also that lead to a better future for the people of Venezuela.",
      "And so that's the sort of control the president is pointing to when he says that. We continue with that quarantine, and we expect to see that there will be changes, not just in the way the oil industry is run for the benefit of the people, but also so that they stop the drug trafficking, so that we no longer have these gang problems, so that they kick the FARC and the ELN out, and that they no longer cozy up to Hezbollah and Iran in our own hemisphere.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what you are talking about is more of a sanctions pressure, not boots on the ground. So just, to be clear, there is no plan for U.S. occupation of this country of nearly 30 million people?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think, first of all, the president always retains optionality on anything and on all these matters. He certainly has the ability and the right under the Constitution of the United States to act against imminent and urgent threats against the country.",
      "That said, and all of that said, as of right now, I think what you see as a force posture. It's one of the largest naval deployments in modern history\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 certainly in the Western Hemisphere, and it is capable of stopping not just drug boats, but stopping any of these sanctioned boats that come in and out, and really paralyzing that portion of how the regime, you know, generates revenue. So that will continue to be in place.",
      "What the president has said, obviously, is, you know, and I think what he's pointing to is that this obsession people have about boots and this or that, he \u2013 he does not feel like he is going to publicly, you know, rule out options that are available for the United States, even though that's not what you're seeing right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: What you're seeing right now is an oil quarantine that allows us to exert tremendous leverage over what happens next.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he also said the U.S. is ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so.",
      "But I'm curious, because you just described the regime as still in place, essentially. I mean, I'm curious why the Trump administration decided to leave it intact and only arrest Nicolas Maduro and his wife. the person who controls the police, the chief thug, Diosdado Cabello, he's the interior minister. He's been indicted by the United States. He was in that indictment the administration released.",
      "He's a narco-terrorist. There's a $25 million price on his head. He's still in place. The defense minister, who has deep ties to Russia, $15 million price on his head, he is still in place. I'm confused. Are they still wanted by the United States? Why didn't you arrest them if you are taking out the narco-terrorist regime?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: You're confused? I don't know why that's confusing to you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They're still in power.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I mean, it's very simple. You're not going to go in and wrap up \u2013 you're going to \u2013 you're \u2013 but, yes, but you can't go in - - you're going to in and suck up five people? They're already complaining about this one operation.",
      "Imagine the howls we would have from everybody else if we actually had to go and stay there four days to capture four other people. We got the top priority. The number one person on the list was the guy who claimed to be the president of the country that he was not, and he was arrested, along with his wife, who is also indicted. And that was a pretty sophisticated and, frankly, complicated operation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It is not easy to land helicopters in the middle of the largest military base in the country. The guy lived on a military base. Land within three minutes, kick down his door, grab him, put him in handcuffs, read him his rights, put him in a helicopter and leave the country without losing any American or any American assets.",
      "That's not an easy mission. And you're asking me, why didn't we do that in five other places at the same time? I mean, that's absurd. I \u2013 I do think this is one of the most, you know, daring, you know, complicated, sophisticated missions this country has carried out in a very long time.",
      "Tremendous credit to the U.S. military personnel who did it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It was unbelievable, and a tremendous success.",
      "And, today, an indicted drug trafficker who was not the legitimate president of Venezuela\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 who we don't recognize, the Biden administration didn't recognize, 60-something countries don't recognize, the European Union doesn't recognize, and many countries in Latin America don't recognize \u2013 he was a convicted \u2013 he was a indicted drug trafficker.",
      "He was arrested. His wife was arrested, also indicted.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. But the others who are also indicted are still\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And they are now facing justice in the American system of courts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The others who are also indicted are still in place. So that's the point of my questioning there.",
      "But you talked about not being the legitimate president.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: So you wanted us to land in five other military bases?",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, I'm asking why you chose that this was the limit of the military operation.",
      "But to your point that you just made that Maduro was not the legitimate president\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, because he was the \u2013 he was the guy was claiming to be the president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well, the opposition\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: He was the top target.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "The opposition leader, Maria Corina Machado, and Edmundo Gonzalez won that 2024 election, by your own account. They were some of the first people you called when you were secretary of State. You said Edmundo Gonzalez is the rightful president of Venezuela. Is that still the U.S. policy? And if so, are you working on a transition to have those elected leaders run the country?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think a couple things.",
      "I have tremendous admiration Maria Corina Machado. I have admiration for Edmundo. We have all those views about what \u2013 the election that happened the last time, and not only us, but many other countries around the world. There's that.",
      "And there's \u2013 and then \u2013 but there's the mission we are on right now. We have been very clear from the beginning, because I still think that a lot of people analyze everything that happens in foreign policy through the lens of what happened from 2001 through 2015 or '16. The whole, you know, foreign policy apparatus thinks everything is Libya, everything is Iraq, everything is Afghanistan.",
      "This is not the Middle East. And our mission here is very different. This is the Western Hemisphere. Within the Western Hemisphere, we have a country, potentially a very rich country, that has cozied itself up \u2013 under the control of this regime, has cozied up to Iran, has cozied up to Hezbollah has cozied \u2013 has allowed\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 narco-trafficking gangs to operate with impunity from their own territory, allows boats with drugs to traffic from their territory. And we are addressing that.",
      "And, by the way, eight, nine million people in the largest mass migration event in modern history have left that country since 2014\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Right, but that regime is still in place.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 also having an impact on us. That is what we are addressing now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did \u2013 when you spoke yesterday, when\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, again, that \u2013 but we're not just addressing the regime. We are addressing the factors that are a threat to the national interest of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "You spoke with Delcy Rodriguez, who is now, according to President Trump, sworn in as the president, as the leader of Venezuela. Did she promise you that she is expelling all those American adversaries from Venezuelan territory? What exactly did she agree to do when she spoke to you?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: We \u2013 we are going to \u2013 our objectives when it comes to how Venezuela impacts the national interest of the United States have not changed, and we want those addressed.",
      "We want drug trafficking to stop. We want no more gang members to come our way. We don't want to see the Iranian and, by the way, Cuban presence in the past. We want the oil industry in that country not to go to the benefit of pirates and adversaries of the United States, but for the benefit of the people.",
      "We want to see all of that happen. We insist on seeing that happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did she promise that?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And we are going to work to continue to see that happen.",
      "Well, right now, the United \u2013 we are going to see what happens moving forward. Let me just say that. I'm not obviously going to have these conversations in the media. These are delicate and complicated things that require mature statesmanship, and that's what we intend to do.",
      "But our goals remain the same. The difference is that the person who was in charge, even though not legitimately, in the past was someone you could not work with. We just could not work with him. He is not a person that had ever kept any of the deals he made, broke every deal he ever made\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 made a fool out of the Biden administration on the deal they made with him.",
      "And we offered him on multiple occasions an opportunity to remove himself\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 from the scene in a positive way. He chose not to do so. And now he's in New York, a resident of the Southern District.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But his number two is now running the country. His number two is someone you can work with? And you \u2013 is that what you're implying here? And did she tell you that she will transition to democracy and the woman who won the election, along with her partner there, Maria Corina Machado?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: We are going to make \u2013 we are going to make our assessments of people. You're asking me to make an assessment. We're going to make an assessment on the basis of what they do, not what they say publicly in the interim, not what, you know, some \u2013 what they've done in the past in many cases, but what they do moving forward.",
      "So we're going to find out. You're asking me how do \u2013 do I know what decisions people are going to make? I don't. I do know this, that if they don't make the right decisions, that the United States will retain multiple levers of leverage\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 to ensure that our interests are protected.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And that includes the oil quarantine that's in place, among other things.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And so we \u2013 but we are going to judge \u2013 moving forward, we're going to judge everything by what they do, and we're going to see what they do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, because, yesterday, President Trump said Maria Corina Machado doesn't have the support or respect within the country. And, by your own admission, she walloped Nicolas Maduro in the last election. So it does sound like a decision was made, but today it\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: She wasn't on the ballot in the last election.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but her \u2013 her party was.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Edmundo was, correct, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. So, is there an agreement to\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It was an illegitimate election, and that's why he's not a legitimate president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. But is there an agreement to transition to democracy? It sounds like there's not.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I think what the president pointed out is the obvious.",
      "Well, I think what the point \u2013 but there has to be a little realism here, OK?A transition to democracy \u2013 they've had this regime, they've had this system of Chavismo in place for 15 or 16 years, and everyone's asking why 24 hours after Nicolas Maduro was arrested there isn't an election scheduled for tomorrow? That's absurd.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no, I'm asking what you talked about with her.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: These things take time. There's a process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And you are\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I'm not going to have \u2013 I'm not going to publicly get into details about any of those things, other than to tell you that our expectations remain the same, and we are going to judge whoever we're interacting with moving forward by whether or not those conditions are met.",
      "We want \u2013 of course we want to see Venezuela transition to be a place completely different than what it looks like today. But, obviously, we don't have the expectation that's going to happen in the next 15 hours. What we do have an expectation is that \u2013 that it move in that direction.",

      "But the president's last envoy to Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, is publicly arguing that you know better than the policy you're backing. He said \u2013 quote \u2013 \"Venezuelan plutocrats or U.S. oil executives seem to be coming to Mar-a-Lago and whispering about how easy life would be if we just made a deal with the regime once Maduro was gone.\"",

And the person who helped him, of course, his wife, who was colocated with him, so she was arrested as well. That's what happened here.",
      "As far as oil, look, oil is critical, not just to fueling economies all over the world. It's critical to Venezuela's future. Their oil industry is completely destroyed. It's destroyed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",

      "You \u2013 they do not have the capability to bring up that industry again. They need investment from private companies, who are only going to invest under certain guarantees and conditions. That has to go to the benefit of the Venezuelan people. Right now, all of that wealth is stolen.",

      "Does the U.S. still assess that the regime in Venezuela is made up of narco-terrorists with ties to Iran, Russia, China and Cuba?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, first off, let me commend not only our military. As President Trump said, this was an excellent operation. Only the United States military could have pulled it off, but they couldn't have pulled it off with the support \u2013 without the support of the professionals in the intelligence community, especially at the Central Intelligence Agency.",
      "And I'm glad that we have a director, John Ratcliffe, that has restored confidence in the CIA. And the president \u2013 the president has \u2013 I think the president respects the CIA as much as he ever has. It's a great day, not just for our military, for our CIA.",
      "There's no question that the people in Venezuela who are still in charge of the apparatus of the government are sanctioned and indicted officials, and they've been in league with Nicolas Maduro until just yesterday.",
      "I think President Trump wants to give them a chance to turn a new page. Now, that's happened in the past. If you look at what's happened in Syria, as you know, Ahmed al-Sharaa used to be an Islamic terrorist. He's now effectively a pro-American leader of Syria.",
      "Moammar Gadhafi, the same way, had much blood on his hands. After the Iraq War, he turned over a new page and came out of the cold. Now, the difference in those two cases is,they made concrete concessions to the United States and our policy goals and interests or they had a longer history of turning the corner, like Ahmed al-Sharaa has.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How much time would you allow for that?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I wouldn't allow much, personally, but I know those conversations are ongoing. As Secretary Rubio said earlier on the show in your interview, we want them to stop the drug and the weapons trafficking. We want them to take the refugees back. We want them to kick out the Iranians, the Cubans, the Islamic radicals like Hezbollah, and just return to being a normal nation that will help build stability, order and prosperity, not just in Venezuela, but in our backyard.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Should a free and democratic Venezuela still be a goal of the United States of America? And, if so, do you hear from the administration a plan to transition to that?",

      "The Venezuelan people have made clear now under Nicolas Maduro that they do not want a Chavista regime governing them. They want a say in their own future. Venezuela has a long history of stable, orderly government that was friendly to the United States. We are their number one customer for oil, and we have worked together to help build prosper \u2013 prosperity and stability in our own backyard.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But they won't be receiving the $50 million reward?",
      "SEN. TOM COTTON: I will simply say that the CIA's amazing work here that has instilled such confidence in the president is a reminder not just to Nicolas Maduro's cronies in Venezuela, but other bad guys all around the world, that we have very good insights into what they're doing and what they're up to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when the president says we will run Venezuela, you are confident that there are actual American assets helping to do that? Is that how I should interpret that?",

      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: That's why the president has such confidence in John Ratcliffe and the CIA.",
      "Well, China was trying to provide support to Venezuela during a U.S. pressure campaign. But where were they when Delta Force went in and got Nicolas Maduro? They were nowhere to be found. And, frankly, that's the same thing you saw in June with China and Russia in Iran. We struck Iran. China and Russia did nothing. They stood idly by.",
      "That's a reminder that the United States is still the world's dominant superpower. Our friends are very happy today. Our enemies are very worried.",

      "Is there a U.S.-Russia agreement here? Because there has been speculation, based on testimony to Congress back in 2019 by one of Trump's top Russia advisers, Fiona Hill, that Russia has been floating a Venezuela-for-Ukraine deal here.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 for some time. Is there any such deal?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: No, this was a U.S. operation that was designed to remove Nicolas Maduro because he was a U.S.-indicted drug trafficker.",
      "And you don't get immunity from American justice when you're indicted by our courts just because you're the illegitimate communist dictator of another country. And\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, to be clear, that's not what I'm saying here.",
      "Is there an implication that, if Russia doesn't meddle in America's backyard, South America, the United States will do something less in Ukraine\u2026",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: No, there's\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 which Russia calls its backyard?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: No, there's no such implication. And, obviously, Russia doesn't need any kind of pretext to do so. It's invaded Ukraine twice over the last 11 years.",
      "There's no such implication here at all. And this was an operation the United States conducted on our own, without any coordination or cooperation from other countries, to advance our national interest, which is to stop the drug trafficking and stop Venezuela from cooperating with countries like Russia and China and Cuba and Iran.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. I want to ask you about authorities here on the other side of the commercial break that we are going to take. So, let me do that and come back.",

      "Senator Cotton, the president said Saturday that a second wave military attack had been planned, wasn't necessary, but it could still be carried out. What would necessitate it? And what would you support?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON (D-AR, Senate Intelligence Chairman): Well, what I took the president to mean that what we just did with Nicolas Maduro could be done again to other Venezuelan leaders. Several of them are indicted in U.S. courts, they're sanctioned by the United States and Canada and European Union and other nations. And if they continue down the path that Maduro took the nation of Venezuela, then we could conduct the same kind of operation as him. I took that as the president urging them to change their ways or face the same consequences.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And would you support a stabilization force with U.S. boots on the ground, as the president said he wouldn't rule out?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: We already had boots on the ground, as Nicolas Maduro learned the hard way. It's always the president's option to use the American military protect American citizens and interests. And, obviously, we have many American citizens inside of Venezuela and we have many interests in (ph) property as well. I don't think the president \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know combat and stabilization forces are there.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: But I don't think he \u2013 I don't think he plans to do that. And I think we've seen, too, the president \u2013 the president's way of war over the last \u2013 or over five years in office. If you look at four major operations, the killing of the ISIS leader in Syria, the drone strike against the Iranian terrorist mastermind in Iraq, the strike against Iran's nuclear facilities, and now this capture of Nicolas Maduro. When our vital national interests are implicated, the president takes bold, audacious, direct action. He accomplishes the mission, and then the mission is over.",
      "In some ways, this is the greatest mission of them all. I mean as impressive as our military was in Iran in June or in his first term in Iraq and Syria against those terrorist masterminds, it's probably harder to capture someone and get out with no American loss of life than it is to kill a target or to blow up nuclear facilities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you are drawing a distinct there in terms of authorities and use of the military. The War Powers Act requires the president to notify Congress of the reason for committing troops within 48 hours of their deployment and requires they be removed within 60 to 90 days unless Congress authorizes it. You OK with this open-ended commitment to keep forces as they are?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, I think he has removed troops. They were only there for a couple of hours to nab Nicholas Maduro.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the Delta Force operators who are on the ground.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But there is a significant military buildup all around South America right now.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're comfortable with that? Does Congress need any authority?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I strongly \u2013 no, I strongly support it. I mean part of \u2013 part of that deployment was to collect intelligence, to conduct this operation, to quarantine the oil trade that Venezuela was sending to Cuba or sending to our adversaries around the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's not mission accomplished.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I won't \u2013 we won't have accomplished our mission until Venezuela starts acting like a normal nation. It stops the drug trafficking and human trafficking and kicks out Islamic radicals and Iranians and Cubans and helps the United States build a more stable, prosperous western hemisphere. That's the ultimate goal, and that's what President Trump laid out yesterday.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, last month the chief of staff to the president, Susie Wiles, told \"Vanity Fair\" that attacking targets on Venezuela's mainland, sovereign territory, would force Trump to get congressional approval. Quote, \"if he were to authorize some activity on land, then it's war, then we'd need Congress.\"",
      "You are a co-equal branch of government. Why doesn't the president need you or your authority or your consultation?",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You, personally, sure.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Yes, like \u2013 well, as the chairman of the Intelligence",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Congress.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: As the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, they keep me apprised of what their plans are and what's going on.",
      "I mean I spoke, in the last 24 hours, not just with the president, but with his senior team. Every man that was on that stage with him yesterday, Marco Rubio, John Ratcliffe, Pete Hegseth, Dan Caine, Stephen Miller, the core architects of the president's policy here, I've spoken with every single one of them in the last 24 hours.",
      "Congress has acted to provide the president with resources and authority that he needs to protect the vital interests of the United States. Whether it's taking out this drug trafficker, Nicolas Maduro, who had contributed to the death of hundreds of Arkansans and hundreds of thousands of Americans, or striking Iran's nuclear facilities, he has the inherent authority, under our Constitution, to protect these American national interests. And as the chief law enforcement officer, to make sure that indicted drug traffickers face justice, whether they're indicted in Venezuela or indicted in the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But by his own admission, the DEA administrator said that cocaine prices have gone up nearly 45 percent, drug traffickers have only changed routes. Venezuela is not a fentanyl producer, not a cocaine producer. Do you really think that this has ended the drug problem?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Venezuela is unique in Latin America, though, because the Maduro regime is itself in league with the drug trafficking cartels. It doesn't just tolerate them or it doesn't just fail to control its territory. It is in league and profits from drug-trafficking cartels. That's the distinction between Venezuela and other nations.",

      "Congressman Himes, you are a part of that Gang of Eight, which means that information about these secret operations is statutorily intended to be shared with you as part of this very small group. Given that and what you should know, can you clearly explain what the United States is doing?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES (D-CT, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE): Yes. By the way, I was delighted to hear that Tom Cotton, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has been in regular contact with the administration. I've had zero outreach. And no Democrat that I'm aware of has had any outreach whatsoever. So, apparently we're now in a world where the legal obligation to keep the Congress informed only applies to your party, which is really something.",
      "But, yes, no, look, I know exactly where we are, Margaret. We're in the euphoria period of acknowledging across the board that Maduro was a bad guy and that our military is absolutely incredible. This is exactly the euphoria we felt in 2002 when our military took down the Taliban in Afghanistan, in 2003 when our military took out Saddam Hussein, and in 2011 when we helped removed Muammar Gaddafi from power in Libya. These were very, very bad people. By the way, much, much worse than Maduro in Venezuela, which was never a significant (AUDIO GAP) national security threat to the United States.",
      "But we're in that euphoria phase. And what we learned the day after the euphoria phase, that it's an awful lot easier to break a country than it is to actually do what the president promised to do, which is to run it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: And so, again, let's let \u2013 let's let my Republican colleagues enjoy their day of euphoria. But they're going to wake up tomorrow morning knowing, my God, there is no plan here, any more than there was in Afghanistan, Iraq, or in Libya.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you heard the secretary of state say, well, this is not the Middle East. There are conflicting statements from cabinet members. Hegseth told CBS, you know, the president of the United States will absolutely be in charge here and leaned into the idea of military options. President Trump said there will be an option of boots on the ground. Secretary Rubio, though, really just leaned into an oil quarantine here.",
      "What exactly is the point of leverage here? When do you expect to get answers? Do your Republican colleagues promise you that they will get some of the answers to the questions you have?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Of course not, Margaret. I mean, look, you're seeing it on television today, right? Two-thirds of my Republican (AUDIO GAP) wake up every single morning and the only question they have is, what can I do to prove my loyalty to the president today?",
      "And we see this because the president has completely shifted who he was. I mean as I watched that news conference yesterday I thought, oh my God, this is Dick Cheney and the neocons. Not only are they taking out a \u2013 they're doing a regime change in a country \u2013 by the way, not a tier one threat to the United States but that they just don't like. They're warning the other dictators, this is Dick Cheney in 2002 saying, we're taking down Saddam Hussein. And by the way, Syria and Iran better watch out.",
      "And the fascinating thing about that and why it's really hard to answer the question of where the hell they're going to go from here is that the president won by promising MAGA and his own people that this kind of stuff was done, that the neocons were over. And here we are, that was Dick Cheney in the conference yesterday, you know, deciding that the United States was going to, you know, militarily change regimes and threaten other ones just because we don't like them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, but then the secretary of state was talking about working with the regime and working with Maduro's number two, who's now running the place, and other indicted criminals according to the Southern District of New York, who are continuing to run Venezuela. So, can you really say that's regime change if they're working with the regime?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: As you pointed out, it's not (AUDIO GAP) right? And you (AUDIO GAP) to explain any consistency here. I mean as you pointed out (AUDIO GAP) was a very bad guy and indicted (AUDIO GAP) trafficker (AUDIO GAP). Couple of weeks ago the (AUDIO GAP) pardoned that (AUDIO GAP) indicted drug trafficker (AUDIO GAP) these guys get a pardon (AUDIO GAP) get the full (AUDIO GAP). I (AUDIO GAP) that. There is no (AUDIO GAP) \u2013 maybe (AUDIO GAP) believes that (AUDIO GAP) work with the \u2013 but, I mean, look, again, go back to (AUDIO GAP) and it is liberated \u2013",

It's called Live View. That's the technology being used. And it wasn't working. So, apologies for cutting that short.",
      "You're back with me now in studio. And we're going to talk to Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, who is here in person.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD): Good to be with you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And will not have those problems, we hope.",
      "But let's pick up on that very same point that we were discussing with Congressman Himes there. He says that no information was being shared with the top people who have oversight, like himself. What leverage do Democrats have to force the administration to treat Congress as a coequal branch of government?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, Margaret, it's hard when the Republicans in Congress are totally awol, right? When they want to give Donald Trump essentially a blank check because they continue to have majorities, of course, in the House and the Senate. Obviously in 2026, if Democrats regain control of either house, we will have the gavel. But in the meantime, we need to go directly to the American people and just make it very clear that in this case, it's my view that the Trump administration's been lying to the American people. This has never been about stopping drugs from coming to the United States. We all support stopping drugs. This from the beginning has been about getting rid of Maduro, grabbing Venezuela's oil for American oil companies and Trump's billionaire buddies. That's what this is about. That's why Donald Trump spent so much time yesterday talking about oil.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Twenty times the word \"oil\" was used in those remarks. The defense secretary spoke to my colleague, Tony Dokoupil, and used the word \"oil\" about six times. There is a lot of focus on those natural resources.",
      "But, arguably, isn't that what China, Russia, Iran, and others are also trying to do, which is to extract their own benefit from this country? You know, what is the counter to that point that the administration would argue?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, the counter is, you don't invade a country to grab their natural resources, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you \u2013 do you consider this an invasion even though \u2013 although it's unclear because Senator Cotton both said there were boots on the ground and that there aren't.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, let's put it this way \u2013 well, they took \u2013 they had boots on the ground, right? They took \u2013 they took out the leader. And now they're demanding access to Venezuela's oil. That's what this has been about. I mean Donald Trump, you know, claimed that he'd been against the war in Iraq from the beginning. That wasn't true. But what we do know is he said, well, having gone into Iraq, we should have gotten their oil.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: This is what drives Donald Trump. And our service men and women performed magnificently. But I think it's outrageous that the president of the United States puts American lives at risk so big American oil companies and his billionaire buddies can profit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, arguably, there are also critical minerals there. There are all sorts of natural resources in Venezuela that the drug cartels even were getting in the business of, that the Chinese were there trying to get. How do you do both things, both corner the market on the things that are of vital national security interest, those kind of minerals, and still actually maintain the principles that you're arguing should be upheld?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, the United States is working, and under the previous administration also worked to secure, you know, critical mineral supply chains. Unfortunately, in many of these areas, the Trump administration actually has surrendered to China. I mean if you look at, for example, clean energy and all those issues, and batteries, we have essentially surrendered that market to China.",
      "What you don't do, Margaret, is you don't put American lives at risk to go in and grab oil resources to benefit the billionaires that support Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Chevron, an American oil company, has been operating in Venezuela throughout. And they told CBS yesterday that they continue to work there. My understanding is there are hundreds of Americans working and living in Venezuela still. Reportedly there are at least four who had been detained by the regime. The regime that remains in power here.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are on Senate Foreign Relations. What do you know about the detained Americans? What can you find out about how they're doing?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I've not gotten an update from the administration on those detained Americans. Months ago I did work to secure the release of an American, a Marylander who we now have back in Baltimore, Maryland.",
      "I think the administration is looking at those detentions that are currently ongoing in Venezuela and determining how many of them are wrongful detentions, how many that they don't think are wrongful detentions. But certainly my view is, we should work to bring back every American who is wrongfully detained overseas. I think this is going to complicate that effort, what the Trump administration just did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because they could designate Venezuela as a state sponsor of hostage taking? Is that where you're going with that?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: No. My view is that the administration should designate as wrongfully detained any Americans that the \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: You know Venezuelan government has seized wrongfully. And then there are ways to continue to put pressure on. Now, normally that pressure would be through sanctions. Here the administration obviously has, you know, taken military action. As you've been pointing out, we're still left with the regime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I mean the vice president's part of the regime. Donald Trump says he's running Venezuela. This is not going to end well. Iraq did not end well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Other efforts to try to get rid of bad people, and we're glad to get rid of Maduro. I'd like to get rid of leaders in other countries, but you don't do it through force. That just doesn't work out well in our experience.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And even on that point though, Secretary of State Rubio challenged me in saying, oh, we couldn't grab all those people at once, but the attorney general \u2013 former Attorney General Bill Barr was on Fox News this morning, the man who put together that first indictment of Maduro, and he said, \"the intention was to clean the place out of this criminal organization so there's going to have to be follow-up operations.\"",
      "To be clear, do you oppose all snatch and grab operations of indicted people?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, I don't think we should be putting American men and women at risk in a situation like this. I mean, I'd have to look at every situation. But again, the motivation here is about grabbing Venezuela's oil for American oil companies. You already see folks on Wall Street lining up. So, let's just be real as to what is really behind this operation. I mean Donald Trump said he was going to focus on the United States. We have people's health care costs going through the roof because they refuse to extend the Affordable Care tax credits. Meanwhile, he bails out Argentina and wants to run Venezuela for the benefit of American oil companies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to have to talk about all the things you just raised as we \u2013 in a future episode of \"FACE THE NATION.\" But clearly on the question of war powers, does the president have the legal authority to do what he's doing?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: No, he does not. I mean this is \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're on the Appropriations Committee. You've got power. What can you do about it?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, I \u2013 I worked with Senator Merkley already to offer a resolution in the United States Senate to cut off any U.S. taxpayer dollars to fund an attack against Venezuela. Republicans blocked us from doing it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: So, yes, we will continue to push. In fact, I'm sure we're going to have a vote on a war powers resolution probably as early as this week, if not next. Last time we offered those, Margaret, Republicans voted no. All but one or two. Senator Paul voted with us. Maybe one other. But for the most part, Republicans are happy to give Donald Trump a blank check and surrender their constitutional responsibilities to Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Van Hollen, a lot more to talk to you about. Thank you very much for joining us here today.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We have to leave it there.",
      "We turn now back to our conversation with Connecticut Democratic Congressman Jim Himes, who I think can be heard now.",
      "Congressman, I'm glad we got the link back up.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: OK.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For those viewers who lost you there, can you explain to us \u2013 the administration is arguing that what they did is legal and that the snatch and grab operation of taking an indicted criminal, Nicolas Maduro, to the United States, through military force, has precedent, and they point back to what happened in the late '80s with Noriega in Panama. What's your challenge to that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Yes. Well, first it's clearly illegal under international law, right? No \u2013 full stop. U.N. charter. No question there.",
      "Now, you may not care about international law. But if you don't care about international law, remember you're going to be making an appeal to international law to try to get restitution for the seizure of Chevron's oil stuff. So, maybe you want to rethink how much disdain you show for international law.",
      "Clearly not legal under the Constitution because though presidents of both parties have argued against this, the Constitution is really pretty clear that the representatives of the people get to be consulted and ultimately approve military activity. That has not happened here at all. And so, again, there's nothing legal about this.",
      "And more to the point, again, under the international law point, think of what Russia and China just learned. Russia and China just learned that all you need to do if you want to go into Estonia is to say that the leader of Estonia is a bad person. You don't even need to make a particularly good case.",
      "Look, there is no national security expert saying that Venezuela was a mortal threat to the United States three weeks ago. So, what China and Russia just learned is that the beacon of liberty and rule of law in the world has now green-lighted snatch and grab operations in Estonia, in Taiwan, wherever Xi and Putin decide they want to go next.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I take your point on the precedent there. Do you think that China or Russia would have the ability to carry out that kind of lightning operation the United States did?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, no. But that doesn't mean \u2013 well, China, yes. China, yes. China very soon. And, you know, their leader has said, we will develop this capability. We know that their intent is to do precisely this in Taiwan. Russia's a more complicated case. It's \u2013 you know, Russia loses 10,000 people to get, you know, three acres of land in eastern Ukraine. But that may not be true five years from now.",
      "And, by the way, back to the Noriega case, because you do ask a good question there. Panama is a terrible precedent. Why do I say that? Because when we went to Panama, the Panamanian Congress had declared war on the United States of America, right? They had killed a United States Marine and wounded two others, and the Congress had been consulted. The Congress, in the Noriega mission, had authorized regime change. So, it's a terrible precedent that the administration is using to say that this is legal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, as we understand it, because we looked this up, Noriega claimed head of state immunity, and the court said that that immunity was meant to protect official state functions and private profiting off the drug trade. Basically the courts ruled on his actions as a leader and not on the legality of the snatch and grab operation itself.",
      "So, we're going to continue to track all of this. Thank you, Congressman Himes. Thank you, Senator Van Hollen.",
      "We will be right back.",

    "story": [
      "Rep. Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday that the operation to capture former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was \"clearly illegal under international law,\" while pointing to broader implications.",
      "\"Think of what Russia and China just learned,\" Himes said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"Russia and China just learned that all you need to do if you want to go into Estonia is to say that the leader of Estonia is a bad person. You don't even need to make a particularly good case.\"",
      "The U.S. carried out airstrikes in Venezuela and captured Maduro early Saturday morning. He arrived Saturday night at a detention center in New York City, where he is set to be arraigned Monday on federal charges related to drug trafficking and working with gangs designated as terrorist organizations. Maduro has denied the charges.",
      "President Trump and his administration have lauded the operation to bring the \"outlaw dictator\" to justice. But Himes said \"there's no national security expert saying that Venezuela was a mortal threat to the United States.\"",
      "\"So what China and Russia just learned is that the beacon of liberty and rule of law in the world has now green lighted snatch-and-grab operations in Estonia, in Taiwan, wherever Xi and Putin decide they want to go next,\" Himes said.",
      "The Connecticut Democrat added that it's also \"clearly not legal under the Constitution, because though presidents of both parties have argued against this, the Constitution is really pretty clear that the representatives of the people get to be consulted and ultimately approve military activity.\"",
      "\"That has not happened here at all,\" Himes said.",
      "Himes said he was \"delighted to hear that Tom Cotton, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has been in regular contact with the administration,\" saying he's had \"zero outreach\" and isn't aware of any other Democrats who have received outreach either.",
      "\"So apparently, we're now in a world where the legal obligation to keep the Congress informed only applies to your party, which is really something,\" he added.",
      "The administration has defended the strikes and capture of Maduro, citing the indictment brought against him by U.S. federal prosecutors in 2020 on charges related to drug trafficking and working with gangs designated as terrorist organizations.",
      "Himes pointed to the reaction from Republican lawmakers and other officials so far, saying \"we're in the euphoria period of acknowledging across the board that Maduro was a bad guy and that our military is absolutely incredible.\"",
      "\"This is exactly the euphoria we felt in 2002 when our military took down the Taliban in Afghanistan,\" Himes said. \"In 2003 when our military took out Saddam Hussein, and in 2011 when we helped remove Muammar Qaddafi from power in Libya.\"",
      "Himes said \"what we learned the day after the euphoria phase is it's an awful lot easier to break a country than it is to actually do what the president promised to do, which is to run it.\"",
      "The president said during a news conference Saturday that the U.S. will \"run\" Venezuela \"until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.\"",
      "Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, also criticized the operation on \"Face the Nation,\" accusing the Trump administration of \"lying to the American people.\"",
      "\"This has never been about stopping drugs from coming to the United States,\" Van Hollen said. \"We all support stopping drugs. This, from the beginning, has been about getting rid of Maduro, grabbing Venezuela's oil for American oil companies and Trump's billionaire buddies. That's what this is about. That's why Donald Trump spent so much time yesterday talking about oil.\"",
      "During a news conference on Saturday, Mr. Trump repeatedly mentioned Venezuela's oil reserves. Venezuela has the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world. The president said U.S. oil companies would go into Venezuela and \"spend billions of dollars\" to fix the country's oil infrastructure.",
      "Van Hollen said the administration \"took out the leader, and now they're demanding access to Venezuela's oil. That's what this has been about.\"",

      "International leaders reacted swiftly on Saturday morning as President Trump confirmed U.S. military strikes in Venezuela and announced the capture of the country's leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, and his wife.",
      "Many U.S. adversaries, including some of Venezuela's nearest neighbors, condemned the strikes, while other governments around the world called for deescalation and voiced concern for their citizens in the Latin American nation.",
      "Latin American reaction",
      "Colombia, which shares a border with Venezuela, called for urgent deescalation. It said it had \"implemented steps to protect the civilian population, preserve stability on the Colombian-Venezuelan border, and promptly address any potential humanitarian or migration needs.\"",
      "Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel called the operation a \"criminal US attack.\" He said the country denounced the attack and called for an \"URGENT reaction from the international community.\"",
      "Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva called the U.S. actions a \"serious affront\" to Venezuela's sovereignty, the AFP news agency reported. He said the strikes and capture of Maduro \"cross an unacceptable line\" and threaten \"the preservation of the region as a zone of peace,\" according to\u00a0 AFP.",
      "China says it wants Maduro freed immediately",
      "The Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement Sunday that it \"calls on the U.S. to ensure the personal safety of President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, release them at once, (and) stop toppling the government of Venezuela,\" according to AFP.",

      "Early Saturday, China had said it \"strongly condemns\" the U.S. operation.",
      "Iran and Russia condemn U.S. action in Venezuela",
      "Iran also condemned the attack, calling it a \"flagrant violation of the national sovereignty and territorial integrity\" of Venezuela, AFP reported.\u00a0 Mr. Trump recently responded to reports that at least eight people have been killed amid nearly a week of escalating protests in Iran by warning the Middle Eastern country that the U.S. was \"locked and loaded and ready to go.\"",
      "Russia's foreign ministry accused the U.S. of \"an act of armed aggression against Venezuela. This is deeply concerning and condemnable\" in a statement, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "\"The pretexts used to justify such actions are unfounded. Ideological animosity has prevailed over business pragmatism and the willingness to build relationships based on trust and predictability,\" the statement said. \"In the current situation, it is important, first and foremost, to prevent further escalation and to focus on finding a way out of the situation through dialogue.\"",
      "The Russian government called for Venezuela to \"be guaranteed the right to determine its own destiny without any destructive, let alone military, interference from outside,\" and backed other calls for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council.",

      "European nations call for deescalation, voice concern over nationals in Venezuela",
      "Top European Union diplomat Kaja Kallas said that she had spoken to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the E.U.'s ambassador in Caracas. She said the E.U. is \"closely monitoring the situation\" and noted that it has \"repeatedly stated that Mr. Maduro lacks legitimacy.\"",
      "\"Under all circumstances, the principles of international law and the UN Charter must be respected,\" Kallas wrote. \"We call for restraint.\u00a0 The safety of EU citizens in the country is our top priority.\"",
      "European nations, including Italy and Belgium, said the safety of their citizens was their top priority, and that they were monitoring the situation.",
      "France's foreign minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot told the French television channel France 2 that Maduro's departure \"is good news for the Venezuelans\" and described him as \"an unscrupulous dictator who confiscated Venezuelans' freedom and stole their elections,\" the Associated Press reported.",
      "\"Then, yes, we pointed out that the method used infringes the principles of international law,\" Barrot said of the U.S. military operation, according to AP. He called for a peaceful and democratic transition of power in Venezuela.",
      "Spain's Foreign Ministry issued a statement calling for \"de-escalation and moderation, and for action to always be taken in accordance with international law and the principles of the U.N. Charter,\" according to Reuters.",

      "\"I want to speak to President Trump, I want to speak to allies,\" the British leader said in brief comments aired on U.K. television hours after the U.S. attack. \"I can be absolutely clear that we were not involved in that. And as you know, I always say and believe we should all uphold international law.\"",
      "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said in a statement Saturday that Maduro led Venezuela to disaster and noted that Germany, like many other countries, didn't recognize his presidency after the South American nation's last election.",
      "Merz said a legal classification of the U.S. intervention is \"complex\" and \"we will take time\" on the matter.",

      "The Trump administration\u00a0said\u00a0on Wednesday it is postponing tariff increases on imported upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and vanities by a year, citing ongoing negotiations with trading partners.",
      "Without the delay, the U.S. was set to double its tariff rate on kitchen cabinets and vanities produced outside the U.S. to 50% starting Jan. 1. The import duty on upholstered furniture \u2014 including sofas and armchairs \u2014 was set to rise to 30% from 25% on the first day of 2026.",
      "The postponement follows a November rollback by the Trump administration of tariffs on imported foods such as beef, coffee and bananas, as affordability concerns\u00a0have weighed on consumer sentiment about the U.S. economy. Furniture prices have been outpacing inflation, with living room, kitchen and dining room furniture rising 4.6% in November from a year earlier, compared with a 2.7% annual increase in the overall Consumer Price Index.",
      "According to the Dec. 31 White House announcement, the tariff rate on upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and vanities will remain at 25%.",
      "\"The United States continues to engage in productive negotiations with trade partners to address trade reciprocity and national security concerns with respect to imports of wood products,\" the White House said in its statement.",
      "\"The United States will therefore delay the increase in tariff rates for upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets, and vanities that was set to take place on January 1, 2026, under the September 29, 2025, Proclamation for an additional year,\" it added.",
      "When President Trump announced the furniture tariffs in September, he wrote on social media that his goal was to help revive U.S. furniture manufacturing in North Carolina. Between 1999 to 2009, North Carolina's furniture industry lost half of its jobs due to increased competition from Asia, according to a 2020 study from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.",

    "summary": "With Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in U.S. custody, who is Venezuela's new acting President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, and what are her chances of remaining in power?",
    "story": [
      "Delcy Rodr\u00edguez was sworn in early Monday as Venezuela's new interim president while her predecessor Nicol\u00e1s Maduro awaited arraignment in a federal U.S. court on drug smuggling charges, two days after he was captured in Caracas by American special forces.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez, 56, is a powerful figure and longtime confidant of Maduro, and she has been backed thus far as the nation's new leader by Venezuela's military. She served as Venezuela's vice president from 2018 until Sunday.",
      "Her brother also holds a senior role in the government as president of the National Assembly, Venezuela's legislature, which has long been controlled by the Maduro regime.",
      "She quickly denounced the U.S. operation as a violation of the United Nations founding charter and a unilateral attempt to force regime change on Saturday, but soon adopted a more conciliatory tone.",
      "In a\u00a0social media post following a Cabinet meeting on Sunday, Rodr\u00edguez called for \"respectful international relations\" between Caracas and Washington and extended an invite for \"the U.S. government to collaborate with us on an agenda of cooperation.\"",
      "Venezuela's roughly 30 million people face a deeply uncertain future in the wake of President Trump's actions. It was still unclear on Monday how much autonomy Washington will allow the country, given Mr. Trump's assertion that America will \"run\" Venezuela, at least for some time.",
      "Will the U.S. work with Rodr\u00edguez?",
      "Mr. Trump said Saturday that the U.S. had been in contact with Rodr\u00edguez and \"she's essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.\"",
      "But in an interview with\u00a0The Atlantic published on Sunday, he added a warning.",
      "\"If she doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated in a Sunday interview on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the U.S. was willing to give Rodr\u00edguez a chance.",
      "\"We are going to make our assessments of people,\" he said of the remaining Maduro regime figures still in place. \"We're going to make an assessment on the basis of what they do, not what they say publicly in the interim, not what, you know, some of what they've done in the past in many cases, but what they do moving forward.\"",
      "Speaking on ABC's \"This Week\" the same day, Rubio reiterated, however, that the Trump administration does not consider Rodr\u00edguez or any of her cohorts to have any legitimate claim to power in the country.",
      "\"This is not about the legitimate president. We don't believe that this regime in place is legitimate via an election,\" Rubio told ABC.",
      "\"Ultimately, legitimacy for their system of government will come about through a period of transition and real elections,\" he continued. \"It's the reason why Maduro is not just an indicted drug trafficker \u2014 he [was an] illegitimate president. He was not the head of state.\"",
      "Delcy Rodr\u00edguez's rise to power in Venezuela",
      "Rodr\u00edguez was born in Caracas. Her father was Jorge Antonio Rodr\u00edguez, a prominent leader of the country's socialist movement that would go on to take power under Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chavez. The new president's father, however, helped lead the movement before it seized power, and he was arrested for involvement in the kidnapping of American businessman William Niehous in 1976.",
      "He died in police custody, reportedly as he was tortured by the previous Venezuelan regime's security forces.",
      "His daughter Delcy would go on to study law at the Central University of Venezuela, in Caracas, with further periods of education in Britain and France.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez held a number of positions during Ch\u00e1vez's long reign, but she only rose to real prominence under Maduro. From 2013 to 2014, she served as Minister of Popular Power for Communication and Information before being appointed as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, a title she held from 2014 to 2017.",
      "She also presided over an assembly created in response to mass street protests in 2017, which was widely seen as an attempt to sideline the opposition-controlled National Assembly, Venezuela's legislature, to enable Maduro to consolidate his rule.",
      "In 2018, Maduro appointed her as Venezuela's vice president, and she remained in that post until stepping in to replace her former boss, as ordered by the country's supreme court following the dramatic events of the weekend.",
      "In 2020 Rodr\u00edguez was also appointed as her country's Minister of Economy and Finance, where she's credited with helping to achieve some progress toward stabilizing Venezuela's sanctions-wracked economy after years of soaring inflation.",
      "In 2024, the role of Minister of Petroleum was also added to her resume.",
      "Despite her very high profile role in the Maduro regime, however, Rodr\u00edguez has not been indicted on any criminal charges in the U.S., though she was hit with sanctions imposed during President Trump's first term, for her role in helping Maduro \"maintain power and solidify his authoritarian rule.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 10:12:43 -0500",
    "summary": "Eva Schloss was a tireless educator about the horrors of the Holocaust.",
    "story": [
      "Auschwitz survivor Eva Schloss, the stepsister of teenage diarist\u00a0Anne Frank\u00a0and a tireless educator about the horrors of\u00a0the Holocaust, has died. She was 96.",
      "The Anne Frank Trust UK, of which Schloss was an honorary president, said she died on Saturday in London, where she had lived.",
      "Schloss' family remembered her as \"a remarkable woman: an Auschwitz survivor, a devoted Holocaust educator, tireless in her work for remembrance, understanding and peace.\"",
      "\"We hope her legacy will continue to inspire through the books, films and resources she leaves behind,\" the family said in a statement.",
      "Born Eva Geiringer in Vienna in 1929, Schloss fled with her family to Amsterdam after Nazi Germany annexed Austria. She became friends with another Jewish girl of the same age, Anne Frank, whose diary would become one of the most famous chronicles of the Holocaust.",
      "Like the Franks, Eva's family spent two years in hiding to avoid capture after the Nazis occupied the Netherlands. They were eventually betrayed, arrested and sent to the Auschwitz death camp.",
      "\"Eighty people were pushed in there and there were two buckets -- one with water, one to use as toilets,\" Schloss recalled in 2019 to CBS Minnesota about Auschwitz. \"Once a day, they threw big chunks of bread in, like you would feed wild animals.\"",
      "\"It lives with me all the time. All the time,\" she added.",
      "Schloss and her mother, Fritzi, survived until the camp was liberated by Soviet troops in 1945. Her father, Erich, and brother Heinz died in Auschwitz.",
      "After the war, Eva moved to Britain, married German Jewish refugee Zvi Schloss and settled in London.",
      "In 1953, her mother married Frank's father, Otto, the only member of his immediate family to survive. Anne Frank died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp at the age of 15, months before the end of the war.",
      "Schloss did not speak publicly about her experiences for decades, later saying that wartime trauma had made her withdrawn and unable to connect with others.",
      "After she addressed the opening of an Anne Frank exhibition in London in 1986, Schloss made it her mission to educate younger generations about the Nazi genocide.",
      "\"We said, 'Never again, Auschwitz.' We have learned our lesson,\" Schloss told CBS Minnesota. \"The Germans were not all for Hitler, but they were bystanders and that is what I tell people they shouldn't be.\"",
      "Over the following decades, she spoke in schools and prisons, at international conferences and told her story in books, including \"Eva's Story: A Survivor's Tale by the Stepsister of Anne Frank.\"",
      "She kept campaigning into her 90s. In 2019, she traveled to Newport Beach, California to meet teenagers who were photographed making Nazi salutes at a high school party. The following year she was part of a campaign urging Facebook to remove Holocaust-denying material from the social networking site.",
      "\"People should never, ever forget what has happened and how it came about,\" Schloss told reporters after the closed-door meeting with students, according to CBS Los Angeles. \"I was shocked that in 2019 \u2013 in a well-educated town, in a very highly educated school \u2013 that incidents like this should still happen.\"",
      "Britain's King Charles III said he was \"privileged and proud\" to have known Schloss, who co-founded the charitable trust to help young people challenge prejudice.",
      "\"The horrors that she endured as a young woman are impossible to comprehend and yet she devoted the rest of her life to overcoming hatred and prejudice, promoting kindness, courage, understanding and resilience through her tireless work for the Anne Frank Trust UK and for Holocaust education across the world,\" the king said.",
      "Zvi Schloss died in 2016. Eva Schloss is survived by their three daughters, as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren.",

      "Three members of a family, including a child, were injured by a polar bear in a rare attack in the far north of Siberia, Russian officials said Monday.",
      "Local police \"received a report of a polar bear injuring people 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the village of Nosok\" at a fishing spot, the regional interior ministry said on Telegram.",

      "The family was evacuated to safety and given immediate assistance.",
      "The ministry did not say how serious their injuries were but said one person may require hospitalization.",
      "Polar bear attacks on humans are considered extremely rare but experts say shrinking sea ice caused by global warming is pushing them to approach inhabited areas in search of food.

      "In August 2024, a pair of polar bears attacked and killed a worker at a remote government radar site in the Canadian Arctic. Four months after that, a man was seriously injured as he tried to protect his wife from a polar bear attack in Northern Ontario, Canada.",
      "In 2023, a polar bear killed a woman and her young son\u00a0in Wales, Alaska, just below the Arctic Circle. That marked the first fatal polar bear attack in 30 years in Alaska, the only U.S. state that is home to the animals.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/venezuela-oil-reserves-us-strike-trump-what-to-know/",
    "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 07:55:43 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump said \"we're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be\" after the surprise U.S. attack. Here's what to know about Venezuela's oil sector.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. strike on Venezuela\u00a0has renewed focus on the country's oil sector, which includes some of the richest crude reserves in the world.",
      "\"We're going to rebuild the oil infrastructure, which will cost billions of dollars, it will be paid for by the oil companies directly. And we're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be,\" President Trump said in a public address on Saturday following the attack, in which the U.S. captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife.",
      "Here's what to know about Venezuela's oil industry.",
      "How much oil does Venezuela produce?",
      "Venezuela, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, produces relatively little crude compared with other leading oil-producing nations. The country produces roughly 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, less than 1% of global output, according to OPEC data.",
      "Venezuela's oil production topped 3 million barrels per day in the early 2000s, but it has fallen sharply in recent decades due to declining investment and the impact of U.S. sanctions. Because of U.S. political pressure, Venezuela today exports most of its oil to China, according to Reuters.",
      "By comparison, the U.S. \u2014 the world's largest oil producer \u2014 churns out 13.5 million barrels per day, according to the Energy Information Administration. Saudi Arabia, the world's No. 2 oil exporter and leading OPEC producer, pumps an estimated 10 million to 12 million barrels, while No. 3 Russia produces 9.4 million.",
      "Francisco J. Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University, predicted it would take at least a decade \u2014 and investments of more than $100 billion \u2014 to rebuild Venezuela's oil infrastructure and lift production to 4 million barrels per day, which is well above its historical production levels.",
      "\"Venezuela's oil infrastructure has also been heavily degraded by decades of underinvestment and much of Venezuela's oil is extremely heavy, making it relatively costly to extract and process,\" Neal Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, noted in a report.",
      "But doesn't Venezuela have more oil in the ground?",
      "Yes, Venezuela is estimated to have the world's largest proven oil reserves, with more than 303 billion barrels \u2014 that represents roughly 17% of the total global oil supply, OPEC data shows.",
      "\"The bottom line is that the size of the reserves is only paralleled by the ones in the Middle East, in the Persian Gulf and Canada's reserves,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Venezuela's reserves top second-ranked Saudi Arabia's 267 billion barrels, and are more than six times the U.S.'s reserves. Most of Venezuela's untapped oil is located in what is known as the Orinoco Belt, a roughly 21,000-square-mile area that stretches across the country's northeastern region.",
      "Are American oil companies already operating in Venezuela, and does the U.S. restrict the country's oil industry?",
      "Only one U.S. oil company operates in Venezuela today: Houston-based Chevron, which now accounts for 25% of Venezuelan oil production.",
      "\"No other major Western player produces any significant amount,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Other American energy giants, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, withdrew from Venezuela after former President Hugo Chavez nationalized private foreign oil interests starting in 2006.",
      "Since 2005, successive U.S. presidents have imposed a range of sanctions on Venezuela, including its oil sector, for what American officials have said is the country's failure to crack down on drug trafficking and terrorism, along with alleged human rights abuses.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. in 2019 also froze the assets of Venezuela's state-owned oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), and barred Americans from doing business with the enterprise.",
      "Most recently, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on four companies and associated oil tankers that it said have ties to Venezuela's oil sector.",
      "Earlier in December, Mr. Trump called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or leave Venezuela, and the U.S.\u00a0seized two sanctioned vessels.",
      "Chevron can maintain its presence in Venezuela under a waiver granted by the Biden administration in 2022, when the U.S. faced soaring inflation and energy prices. President Trump extended that special license last year.",
      "How could regime change in Venezuela affect oil prices?",
      "Any significant disruption to global oil supplies could drive up energy prices around the world. Yet Venezuela's limited crude production is likely to mute any immediate impact on oil prices, which fell modestly in afternoon trading on Saturday, according to FactSet.",
      "Prices for U.S. oil saw a steep decrease in 2025, dropping roughly 20% and extending a decline over the previous two years. In trading on Friday, the price of West Texas Crude (the U.S. standard) fell to $57.32 a barrel, down from nearly $80 in January.",
      "Other factors could limit any short-term impact on domestic energy prices. U.S. production of crude has surged in recent years, helping lower gas prices. The U.S. has also beefed up its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, according to the Energy Information Administration, another potential cushion for consumers and businesses from volatility in global oil markets.",
      "\"Global supply remains ample, Venezuelan production represents a small share of worldwide output and there's no clear evidence yet of sustained disruption to physical flows,\" Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, said in an email.",
      "Wall Street analysts expect relatively little impact when U.S. financial markets reopen on Monday.",
      "\"Investors have dealt with a series of ostensibly seismic geopolitical events for the last several years (Ukraine, Gaza, Iran, Libya, etc.), but none had a sustained impact on markets, and it's unlikely the events in Venezuela will be any different,\" said Adam Crisafulli, head of investment adviser VitalKnowledge.",
      "Meanwhile, major economies around the world are growing at a rate expected to keep oil prices in check, given the current surplus in crude supplies and sufficient production capacity among key producers, experts note.",
      "In the short term, an end to the U.S. blockade could even reduce oil prices, Monaldi said. \"Venezuela was exporting about 800,000 barrels before the blockade. If those go back to the market, that eases pressures.\"",
      "However, a prolonged slump in Venezuelan oil production could affect some energy costs. For example, the country produces a form of crude suitable for making diesel, which is widely used in many industries.",
      "As a result, removing Venezuela's oil input from global markets could push up diesel costs in the U.S. and boost inflation, according to a recent analysis by the Atlantic Council, a nonpartisan group focused on global political and economic affairs.",
      "\"Limited price impact reflects where the barrels go and how much spare capacity exists. It doesn't mean the risk is negligible,\" Green said.",
      "Will U.S. companies want to restart operations in Venezuela?",
      "To boost its oil production, Venezuela will need to rely on private investors because its state-run oil company, PDVSA, is in financial ruin, Monaldi told CBS News. That could open the door for U.S. companies to reenter the market. With new investment, Venezuela's existing infrastructure would allow the country to ramp up oil production relatively quickly, he added.",
      "To be sure, any such investment is likely to hinge on political developments following the U.S. strikes and Maduro's removal, said Monaldi, noting that Venezuela would need to offer commercial, fiscal and contractual incentives to lure American energy producers.",
      "\"Venezuela doesn't have limits in terms of the resources,\" he said. \"It's about the politics.\"",
      "In the near term, Chevron stands to benefit the most, given its existing footprint in Venezuela, according to Monaldi. Other U.S. companies that might bring business back to Venezuela include ConocoPhillips and Exxon, he added.",

      "The top bidder for the prized tuna at the predawn auction on Monday was Kiyomura Corp. whose owner, Kiyoshi Kimura, runs the popular Sushi Zanmai chain. Kimura, who has won the annual action many times in the past, broke the previous record of 334 million yen ($2.1 million) he set in 2019.",
      "Kimura later told reporters he was hoping to pay a bit less for it, but \"the price shot up before you knew it.\"",
      "The auction started when the bell rang, and the floor was filled with torpedo-shaped fish with their tails cut off so bidders could examine meat details such as color, texture and fattiness while walking around the rows of tuna.",
      "The pricey fish was caught off the coast of Oma in northern Japan, a region widely regarded for producing some of the country's finest tuna.",
      "\"It's in part for good luck,\" Kimura said. \"But when I see a good looking tuna, I cannot resist ... I haven't sampled it yet, but it's got to be delicious.\"",
      "Hundreds of tuna are sold daily at the early morning auction, but prices are significantly higher than usual for the Oma tuna, especially at the celebratory New Year auction.",
      "The enormous tuna was taken to Sushizanmai's headquarters, then sliced up and distributed to its eateries nationwide, the Reuters news agency reports. The tuna dishes will be sold to customers at their usual price, Kimura said.",

Meanwhile, images of Maduro that were likely manipulated or generated with AI tools circulated on social media, garnering millions of views and thousands of likes across platforms.",
      "One photo purporting to show Maduro after his capture was shared widely, including by the mayor of Coral Gables Florida, Vince Lago, and in a joint Instagram post by two popular conservative content accounts with over 6 million combined followers. Using Google's SynthID tool, CBS News Confirmed team found the photo was likely edited or generated using Google AI.",
      "CBS News also found a video generated from the photo, showing military personnel escorting Maduro from an aircraft. It was posted around 6:30 a.m. \u2014 12 hours before CBS News reported that a person in shackles was seen disembarking the plane carrying Maduro and confirmed his eventual arrival Saturday evening at Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal facility in Brooklyn.",

      "Another image showing a man with a sack over his head while sitting in the back of a car circulated widely, sparking online speculation as to whether the photo showed Maduro's capture. Many users flagged that the photo was probably not of Maduro, but as of this afternoon the post had 30,000 likes and over a thousand reposts.

    "story": [
      "A Paris court found Monday 10 people guilty of cyberbullying France's first lady, Brigitte Macron, by spreading false online claims about her gender and sexuality, including allegations she was born a man.",
      "One defendant was sentenced to six months in prison, while eight were handed suspended sentences between two and eight months. All 10 were mandated to attend cyberbullying awareness training.",
      "The court pointed to \"particularly degrading, insulting, and malicious\" comments referring to false claims regarding alleged trans identity and alleged pedo criminality targeting Brigitte Macron. \"Repeated publications have had cumulative harmful effects,\" the court said.",
      "The defendants, eight men and two women aged 41 to 65, were accused of posting \"numerous malicious comments\" falsely claiming that President Emmanuel Macron 's wife was born a man and linking the 24-year age gap with her husband to pedophilia. Some of the posts were viewed tens of thousands of times.",
      "Brigitte Macron didn't attend the two-day trial in October. Speaking on TF1 national television Sunday, she said she launched legal proceedings to \"set an example\" in the fight against harassment.",
      "Her lawyer, Jean Ennochi, said Monday \"what is important is that there are immediate cyberbullying awareness trainings, and for some of the defendants, a ban on using their social media accounts.\"",
      "Her daughter, Tiphaine Auzi\u00e8re, testified about what she described as the \"deterioration\" of her mother's life since the online harassment intensified. \"She cannot ignore the horrible things said about her,\" Auzi\u00e8re told the court. She said the impact has extended to the entire family, including Macron's grandchildren.",
      "One of the defendants, a property asset manager, received a six-month prison sentence. Under French law, the sentence may be served at home, possibly while wearing an ankle monitor or following other requirements set by a judge.",
      "Defendant Delphine Jegousse, 51, who is known as Amandine Roy and describes herself as a medium and author, is considered to have played a major role in spreading the rumor after she released a four-hour video on her YouTube channel in 2021. She was given a 6-month prison sentence.",
      "The X account of Aur\u00e9lien Poirson-Atlan, 41, known as Zo\u00e9 Sagan on social media, was suspended in 2024 after his name was cited in several judicial investigations. Poirson-Atlan was given an 8-month prison sentence, along with another defendant, a gallery owner.",
      "The one defendant not given a prison sentence was a teacher, who apologized during the trial. He will have to attend the cyberbullying awareness training.",
      "Several will see their online access suspended for six months on the social media where they made their posts.",
      "The sentences were proportional to the seriousness of the comments, the court stressed.",
      "French judicial authorities didn't disclose the names of the defendants, but some made their names public by speaking out",
      "During the trial, several defendants told the court their comments were intended as humor or satire and said they did not understand why they were being prosecuted.",
      "The case follows years of conspiracy theories falsely alleging that Brigitte Macron was born under the name Jean-Michel Trogneux, which is actually the name of her brother. The Macrons have also filed a defamation suit in the United States against conservative influencer Candace Owens.",
      "The Macrons, who have been married since 2007, first met at the high school where he was a student and she was a teacher. Brigitte Macron, 24 years her husband's senior, was then called Brigitte Auzi\u00e8re, a married mother of three.",

      "Elderly people are particularly vulnerable to the risks presented by the doughy cake, and Japan has one of the world's oldest populations. Over the past five years, 338 people have been rushed to the hospital after choking on mochi or other foods, and over 90% of them were aged 65 or older, according to statistics updated last month by the Tokyo Fire Department. More than half of those hospitalizations \u2014 177 \u2014 have occurred in January and December, when mochi is most often served.",
      "Authorities have offered tips for avoiding mochi-related incidents, including chewing slowly, cutting the cake into small pieces, and moistening your throat with tea or soup before eating it.",
      "Mochi is a staple of the Japanese New Year's holiday menu and is often eaten in a savory soup called ozoni. Emily Anderson, a curator at the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles,\u00a0told \"CBS Sunday Morning\"\u00a0that New Year's Day is the biggest holiday in Japan, and the rice cake is an integral part of celebrating.",

    "story": [
      "Crans-Montana, Switzerland \u2014 A Mass was held Sunday for victims of the New Year's Eve fire at a bar in the Swiss Alpine resort of Crans-Montana that left 40 dead and many severely injured, as distressed parents waited for news of their children or began the long process of mourning.",
      "By Sunday evening, Swiss authorities had identified all of the 40 fatalities. The dead include 18 Swiss citizens aged 14 to 31 years, two Italians aged 16, one dual citizen of Italy and the United Arab Emirates, also 16 years old, an 18-year-old Romanian, a 39-year-old French and a Turkish citizen, 18.",
      "In addition to the 40 who died, 119 were injured in the blaze that broke out around 1:30 a.m. on Thursday at Le Constellation bar. Police have said many of the victims were in their teens to mid-20s.",
      "Gray-haired parents, teenagers and members of the police were seen comforting one another during the service, which took place at the Chapelle Saint-Christophe in Crans-Montana. Mass was followed by a silent march to the site of the tragedy.",
      "In the crowded pews, a grieving woman listened intently, her hands clasped tightly and sometimes clasping rosary beads, as speakers delivered readings in German, French and Italian. Despite freezing weather, several hundred followed the Mass on the screen installed outside the church.",
      "The Rev. Gilles Cavin spoke of the \"terrible uncertainty\" for families unsure if their loved ones are among the dead or still alive, among the injured. \"We pray for their friends hard hit by misery on this day that was meant to be one of festivities and friendship,\" he said.",
      "One of the victims was 16-year old Arthur Brodard, whose mother had been frantically searching for him.",
      "\"Our Arthur has now left to party in paradise,\" a visibly shaken Laetitia Brodard said in a Facebook story posted on Saturday night, speaking to the camera. \"We can start our mourning, knowing that he is in peace and in the light.\"",
      "Brodard's frenzied search for her son reflected the desperation of families of the young people disappeared during the fire, who didn't know whether their loved ones were dead or in the hospital.",
      "Swiss authorities said the process of identifying victims was particularly hard because of the advanced degree of the burns, requiring the use of DNA samples. Brodard also had given her DNA sample to help in the identification process.",
      "In her Facebook post, Brodard thanked those who \"testified their compassion, their love\" and to those who shared information as she anxiously searched and waited for news of her son.",
      "Other parents and siblings are still waiting in anguish.",
      "Swiss authorities have opened a criminal investigation into the bar's managers. In a statement on Sunday, regional police said there were no legal grounds so far that would require the managers to be held pending the legal process. They have not been deemed to be a flight risk.",
      "The two are suspected of involuntary homicide, involuntary bodily harm and involuntarily causing a fire, the Valais region's chief prosecutor, Beatrice Pilloud, told reporters Saturday. The announcement of the investigation didn't name the managers.",
      "Investigators had said they believe sparkling candles atop Champagne bottles ignited the fire when they came too close to the ceiling of the crowded bar.",
      "\"Initial witness accounts cited a fire that spread quickly, generating a lot of smoke and a huge wave of heat,\" the police statement Sunday said. \"Everything happened very fast.\"\u00a0 Authorities planned to look into whether sound-dampening material on the ceiling conformed with regulations and whether the candles were permitted for use in the bar. Officials said they also would look at other safety measures on the premises, including fire extinguishers and escape routes.",
      "Swiss President Guy Parmelin announced a national day of mourning for the victims on Jan. 9.",
      "France's Health Minister St\u00e9phanie Rist said 17 patients have received care in France, out of a total of 35 transferred from Switzerland to five European countries. Other patients were planned to be transferred to Germany, Italy and Belgium.",

      "\"Out of career caution, diagnostic uncertainty, and being private about such things in general, I have been hiding my battle with this disease for over five years,\" he wrote. \"Time to stop.\"",
      "\"CMS is a genetic disease that disrupts the communication between the brain and the muscle at the \u2018nerve/muscle junction\u2019\u2026 or whatever doctors call it,\" Bailey explained. \"There are billions of these junction dodads in a body, and an increasing number of mine seem to be on the blink.

Once I started treating food like an addiction, it started changing everything for me. When I started really looking at the source of why I was eating. What was I eating for?\"",

I was the biggest, the loudest, the toughest, the meanest, the growliest, the fattest. There\u2019s normally deep inside of that a really, really small, insecure human. I was that, for sure. Then a by-product of that was I got fat as f---.\"",

      "\"These results suggest that in the short term, active monitoring is a reasonable approach to management of low-risk DCIS,\" the lead researcher said in a press release. \"If longer-term follow-up supports the safety of active management from a cancer outcome standpoint, this approach could be considered as an option for women with this condition.\"",
      "\"But it is also critical that we understand how women feel when they are living with this \u2018watch and wait\u2019 approach and how it impacts their overall quality of life.\"",
      "Other research has suggested that women with low-risk DCIS did not have a higher rate of invasive cancer after two years of active monitoring, although each patient should discuss their individual risk level with an oncologist.",

      "\"In a vaccinated individual, those anti-fentanyl antibodies are in the blood,\" Haile told Fox News Digital. \"So, if they consume fentanyl, the antibodies grab onto the drug and prevent it from getting into the brain.

      "In interviews over the years, the octogenarian has credited his onstage endurance to a combination of constant training and good genetics.",

      "The singer's workouts reportedly involve everything from swimming and kickboxing to cycling and ballet. He has described the routine as \"training for stamina,\" not just to \"go crazy.\"",

      "A \"Jagger-style\" routine is adaptable for most people when scaled to individual ability, lifestyle and fitness level, experts say. (Kevin Winter/Getty Images)",
      "\"I\u2019m a huge advocate of diversifying your workouts,\" said Marc Santa Maria, vice president of group fitness at Crunch Fitness in New York. \"Our bodies are meant to move in multi-directional ways and varying speeds, ranges of motion, positions and intensities.\"",
      "\"Sticking with the same workout in the same category each week won\u2019t hit the different ways our bodies need to be maintained and challenged,\" he added.",

      "Alissa Mosca, fitness trainer and regional operations manager at Planet Fitness in New York, told Fox News Digital that one of the biggest advantages of incorporating different training methods is that it creates \"muscle confusion.\"",
      "\"Varying movements, intensities and rhythms force the body to adapt, helping to activate all muscle groups more effectively,\" she said. \"It\u2019s a bit of a \u2018use it or lose it\u2019 philosophy \u2014 if we don\u2019t actively support flexibility and mobility, we risk losing them.\"",

      "Santa Maria said Jagger\u2019s mix of high-intensity cardio, strength training, dance, yoga and meditation is a well-rounded approach for endurance, muscle maintenance and mental health, while also keeping workouts engaging.",
      "Can anyone do this?",
      "\"Mick Jagger\u2019s workout plan is extensive, highly individualized and something he gradually worked up to over time,\" Mosca noted. \"His body responds well because it\u2019s been conditioned for that level of intensity.\"",

      "\"Think of this type of routine like a puzzle,\" Mosca advised. \"You need to find the pieces that work best for you.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "Santa Maria agreed that Jagger\u2019s approach may be more realistic than many assume. \"I\u2019m an average, everyday person who simply wants to move well, enjoy daily life and stay active for the people and activities I love,\" she said. \"If I can do it, so can anyone.\"",
      "But for those who don\u2019t feel capable of matching Jagger\u2019s intensity, Santa Maria recommends focusing on what feels manageable. \"Trust your instincts \u2014 you know what your body and mental health need,\" he said.",

      "Clinical guidelines from Mayo Clinic recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity per week for adults, along with muscle-strengthening activities at least twice weekly. Sports medicine studies suggest that people with long-term conditioning can safely exceed those minimums when training is progressive and closely managed.",

      "For those interested in adopting a similar approach, the expert recommends starting with structure. Deciding ahead of time which days are dedicated to which types of movement \u2014 and removing hesitation by laying out clothes, preparing equipment or booking classes in advance \u2014 can improve consistency, he advised.",
      "Experts say a diverse workout routine that includes cardio, strength, mobility and recovery helps prevent plateaus and supports long-term physical function. (iStock)",
      "Beyond physical benefits, Santa Maria said adding variety to workouts helps to prevent boredom, which can improve adherence over time.",

We will keep working to provide more options \u2014 expanding choices for delivery devices and creating new pathways for access \u2014 so more people can get the medicines they need.\"",
      "No. 2: Side effects",

      "Attorney Jay Edelson discusses the lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, alleging that ChatGPT exacerbated the mental illness and paranoid delusions of a man who killed his mother and then himself.",
      "Artificial intelligence chatbots are quickly becoming part of our daily lives. Many of us turn to them for ideas, advice or conversation. For most, that interaction feels harmless. However, mental health experts now warn that for a small group of vulnerable people, long and emotionally charged conversations with AI may worsen delusions or psychotic symptoms.",
      "Doctors stress this does not mean chatbots cause psychosis. Instead, growing evidence suggests that AI tools can reinforce distorted beliefs among individuals already at risk. That possibility has prompted new research and clinical warnings from psychiatrists. Some of those concerns have already surfaced in lawsuits alleging that chatbot interactions may have contributed to serious harm during emotionally sensitive situations.",

      "What psychiatrists are seeing in patients using AI chatbots",
      "Psychiatrists describe a repeating pattern. A person shares a belief that does not align with reality. The chatbot accepts that belief and responds as if it were true. Over time, repeated validation can strengthen the belief rather than challenge it.",

      "Mental health experts warn that emotionally intense conversations with AI chatbots may reinforce delusions in vulnerable users, even though the technology does not cause psychosis. (Philip Dulian/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Clinicians say this feedback loop can deepen delusions in susceptible individuals. In several documented cases, the chatbot became integrated into the person's distorted thinking rather than remaining a neutral tool. Doctors warn that this dynamic raises concern when AI conversations are frequent, emotionally engaging and left unchecked.",
      "Why AI chatbot conversations feel different from past technology",
      "Mental health experts note that chatbots differ from earlier technologies linked to delusional thinking. AI tools respond in real time, remember prior conversations and adopt supportive language. That experience can feel personal and validating.",
      "For individuals already struggling with reality testing, those qualities may increase fixation rather than encourage grounding. Clinicians caution that risk may rise during periods of sleep deprivation, emotional stress or existing mental health vulnerability.",
      "How AI chatbots can reinforce false or delusional beliefs",
      "Doctors say many reported cases center on delusions rather than hallucinations. These beliefs may involve perceived special insight, hidden truths or personal significance. Chatbots are designed to be cooperative and conversational. They often build on what someone types rather than challenge it. While that design improves engagement, clinicians warn it can be problematic when a belief is false and rigid.",
      "Mental health professionals say the timing of symptom escalation matters. When delusions intensify during prolonged chatbot use, AI interaction may represent a contributing risk factor rather than a coincidence.",

      "Psychiatrists say some patients report chatbot responses that validate false beliefs, creating a feedback loop that can worsen symptoms over time. (Nicolas Maeterlinck/Belga Mag/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "What research and case reports reveal about AI chatbots",
      "Peer-reviewed research and clinical case reports have documented people whose mental health declined during periods of intense chatbot engagement. In some instances, individuals with no prior history of psychosis required hospitalization after developing fixed false beliefs connected to AI conversations. International studies reviewing health records have also identified patients whose chatbot activity coincided with negative mental health outcomes. Researchers emphasize that these findings are early and require further investigation.",
      "A peer-reviewed Special Report published in Psychiatric News titled\u00a0\"AI-Induced Psychosis: A New Frontier in Mental Health\" examined emerging concerns around AI-induced psychosis and cautioned that existing evidence is largely based on isolated cases rather than population-level data. The report states:\u00a0\"To date, these are individual cases or media coverage reports; currently, there are no epidemiological studies or systematic population-level analyses of the potentially deleterious mental health effects of conversational AI.\"\u00a0The authors emphasize that while reported cases are serious and warrant further investigation, the current evidence base remains preliminary and heavily dependent on anecdotal and nonsystematic reporting.",
      "What AI companies say about mental health risks",
      "OpenAI says it continues working with mental health experts to improve how its systems respond to signs of emotional distress. The company says newer models aim to reduce excessive agreement and encourage real-world support when appropriate. OpenAI has also announced plans to hire a new Head of Preparedness, a role focused on identifying potential harms tied to its AI models and strengthening safeguards around issues ranging from mental health to cybersecurity as those systems grow more capable.",
      "Other chatbot developers have adjusted policies as well, particularly around access for younger audiences, after acknowledging mental health concerns. Companies emphasize that most interactions do not result in harm and that safeguards continue to evolve.",
      "What this means for everyday AI chatbot use",
      "Mental health experts urge caution, not alarm. The vast majority of people who interact with chatbots experience no psychological issues. Still, doctors advise against treating AI as a therapist or emotional authority. Those with a history of psychosis, severe anxiety or prolonged sleep disruption may benefit from limiting emotionally intense AI conversations. Family members and caregivers should also pay attention to behavioral changes tied to heavy chatbot engagement.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Cybercriminals don't always need malware or exploits to break into systems anymore. Sometimes, they just need the right words in the right place. OpenAI is now openly acknowledging that reality. The company says prompt injection attacks against artificial intelligence (AI)-powered browsers are not a bug that can be fully patched, but a long-term risk that comes with letting AI agents roam the open web. This raises uncomfortable questions about how safe these tools really are, especially as they gain more autonomy and access to your data.",

      "NEW MALWARE CAN READ YOUR CHATS AND STEAL YOUR MONEY",
      "AI-powered browsers can read and act on web content, which also makes them vulnerable to hidden instructions attackers can slip into pages or documents. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why prompt injection isn't going away",
      "In a recent blog post, OpenAI admitted that prompt injection attacks are unlikely to ever be completely eliminated. Prompt injection works by hiding instructions inside web pages, documents or emails in ways that humans don't notice, but AI agents do. Once the AI reads that content, it can be tricked into following malicious instructions.",
      "OpenAI compared this problem to scams and social engineering. You can reduce them, but you can't make them disappear. The company also acknowledged that \"agent mode\" in its ChatGPT Atlas browser increases risk because it expands the attack surface. The more an AI can do on your behalf, the more damage it can cause when something goes wrong.",
      "OpenAI launched the ChatGPT Atlas browser in October, and security researchers immediately started testing its limits. Within hours, demos appeared showing that a few carefully placed words inside a Google Doc could influence how the browser behaved. That same day, Brave published its own warning, explaining that indirect prompt injection is a structural problem for AI-powered browsers, including tools like Perplexity's Comet.",
      "This isn't just OpenAI's problem. Earlier this month, the National Cyber Security Centre in the U.K. warned that prompt injection attacks against generative AI systems may never be fully mitigated.",
      "FAKE AI CHAT RESULTS ARE SPREADING DANGEROUS MAC MALWARE",
      "Prompt injection attacks exploit trust at scale, allowing malicious instructions to influence what an AI agent does without the user ever seeing it. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The risk trade-off with AI browsers",
      "OpenAI says it views prompt injection as a long-term security challenge that requires constant pressure, not a one-time fix. Its approach relies on faster patch cycles, continuous testing and layered defenses. That puts it broadly in line with rivals like Anthropic and Google, which have both argued that agentic systems need architectural controls and ongoing stress testing.",
      "Where OpenAI is taking a different approach is with something it calls an \"LLM-based automated attacker.\" In simple terms, OpenAI trained an AI to act like a hacker. Using reinforcement learning, this attacker bot looks for ways to sneak malicious instructions into an AI agent's workflow.",
      "The bot runs attacks in simulation first. It predicts how the target AI would reason, what steps it would take and where it might fail. Based on that feedback, it refines the attack and tries again. Because this system has insight into the AI's internal decision-making, OpenAI believes it can surface weaknesses faster than real-world attackers.",
      "Even with these defenses, AI browsers aren't safe. They combine two things attackers love: autonomy and access. Unlike regular browsers, they don't just display information, but also read emails, scan documents, click links and take actions on your behalf. That means a single malicious prompt hidden in a webpage, document or message can influence what the AI does without you ever seeing it. Even when safeguards are in place, these agents operate by trusting content at scale, and that trust can be manipulated.",
      "THIRD-PARTY BREACH EXPOSES CHATGPT ACCOUNT DETAILS",
      "As AI browsers gain more autonomy and access to personal data, limiting permissions and keeping human confirmation in the loop becomes critical for safety. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps you can take to reduce risk with AI browsers",
      "You may not be able to eliminate prompt injection attacks, but you can significantly limit their impact by changing how you use AI tools.",
      "Only give an AI browser access to what it absolutely needs. Avoid connecting your primary email account, cloud storage or payment methods unless there's a clear reason. The more data an AI can see, the more valuable it becomes to attackers. Limiting access reduces the blast radius if something goes wrong.",
      "Never allow an AI browser to send emails, make purchases or modify account settings without asking you first. Confirmation breaks long attack chains and gives you a moment to spot suspicious behavior. Many prompt injection attacks rely on the AI acting quietly in the background without user review.",
      "A password manager ensures every account has a unique, strong password. If an AI browser or malicious page leaks one credential, attackers can't reuse it elsewhere. Many password managers also refuse to autofill on unfamiliar or suspicious sites, which can alert you that something isn't right before you manually enter anything.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Even if an attack starts inside the browser, antivirus software can still detect suspicious scripts, unauthorized system changes or malicious network activity. Strong antivirus software focuses on behavior, not just files, which is critical when dealing with AI-driven or script-based attacks.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Telling an AI browser to \"handle whatever is needed\" gives attackers room to manipulate it through hidden prompts. Be specific about what the AI is allowed to do and what it should never do. Narrow instructions make it harder for malicious content to influence the agent.",
      "When an AI browser scans emails, documents or web pages for you, remember that hidden instructions can live inside that content. Treat AI-generated actions as drafts or suggestions, not final decisions. Review anything the AI plans to act on before approving it.",
      "Security fixes for AI browsers evolve quickly as new attack techniques emerge. Delaying updates leaves known weaknesses open longer than necessary. Turning on automatic updates ensures you get protection as soon as they're available, even if you miss the announcement.",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "There's been a meteoric rise in AI browsers. We're now seeing them from major tech companies, including OpenAI's Atlas, The Browser Company's Dia and Perplexity's Comet. Even existing browsers like Chrome and Edge are pushing hard to add AI and agentic features into their current infrastructure. While these browsers can be useful, the technology is still early. It's best not to fall for the hype and to wait for it to mature.",

      "ELON MUSK TEASES A FUTURE RUN BY ROBOTS",
      "Researchers highlight the milestone that shows how a robot learned 1,000 real-world tasks in just one day. (Science Robotics)",
      "How robots learned 1,000 physical tasks in one day",
      "A new report published in Science Robotics caught our attention because the results feel genuinely meaningful, impressive and a little unsettling in the best way. The research comes from a team of academic scientists working in robotics and artificial intelligence, and it tackles one of the field's biggest limitations.",
      "The researchers taught a robot to learn 1,000 different physical tasks in a single day using just one demonstration per task. These were not small variations of the same movement. The tasks included placing, folding, inserting, gripping and manipulating everyday objects in the real world. For robotics, that is a big deal.",
      "Why robots have always been slow learners",
      "Until now, teaching robots physical tasks has been painfully inefficient. Even simple actions often require hundreds or thousands of demonstrations. Engineers must collect massive datasets and fine-tune systems behind the scenes. That is why most factory robots repeat one motion endlessly and fail as soon as conditions change. Humans learn differently. If someone shows you how to do something once or twice, you can usually figure it out. That gap between human learning and robot learning has held robotics back for decades. This research aims to close that gap.",
      "THE NEW ROBOT THAT COULD MAKE CHORES A THING OF THE PAST",
      "The research team behind the study focuses on teaching robots to learn physical tasks faster and with less data. (Science Robotics)",
      "How the robot learned 1,000 tasks so fast",
      "The breakthrough comes from a smarter way of teaching robots to learn from demonstrations. Instead of memorizing entire movements, the system breaks tasks into simpler phases. One phase focuses on aligning with the object, and the other handles the interaction itself. This method relies on artificial intelligence, specifically an AI technique called imitation learning that allows robots to learn physical tasks from human demonstrations.",
      "The robot then reuses knowledge from previous tasks and applies it to new ones. This retrieval-based approach allows the system to generalize rather than start from scratch each time. Using this method, called Multi-Task Trajectory Transfer, the researchers trained a real robot arm on 1,000 distinct everyday tasks in under 24 hours of human demonstration time.",
      "Importantly, this was not done in a simulation. It happened in the real world, with real objects, real mistakes and real constraints. That detail matters.",
      "Why this research feels different",
      "Many robotics papers look impressive on paper but fall apart outside perfect lab conditions. This one stands out because it tested the system through thousands of real-world rollouts. The robot also showed it could handle new object instances it had never seen before. That ability to generalize is what robots have been missing. It is the difference between a machine that repeats and one that adapts.",
      "AI VIDEO TECH FAST-TRACKS HUMANOID ROBOT TRAINING",
      "The robot arm practices everyday movements like gripping, folding and placing objects using a single human demonstration. (Science Robotics)",
      "A long-standing robotics problem may finally be cracking",
      "This research addresses one of the biggest bottlenecks in robotics: inefficient learning from demonstrations. By decomposing tasks and reusing knowledge, the system achieved an order of magnitude improvement in data efficiency compared to traditional approaches. That kind of leap rarely happens overnight. It suggests that the robot-filled future we have talked about for years may be nearer than it looked even a few years ago.",
      "What this means for you",
      "Faster learning changes everything. If robots need less data and less programming, they become cheaper and more flexible. That opens the door to robots working outside tightly controlled environments.",
      "In the long run, this could enable home robots to learn new tasks from simple demonstrations instead of specialist code. It also has major implications for healthcare, logistics and manufacturing.",

      "According to the university, hackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Oracle E-Business Suite. This application handles financial operations and contains highly sensitive data.",
      "Based on the technical details shared so far, security researchers believe the attack aligns with tactics used by the Clop ransomware gang. Clop has a long track record of stealing data through zero-day flaws rather than encrypting systems.",

A data removal service can help remove your personal information from data broker sites, which lowers the risk of targeted phishing or fraud tied to the stolen University of Phoenix records.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Expect more scam emails and phone calls. Criminals may reference the breach to sound legitimate.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "7) Secure your devices",
      "Keep your operating systems and apps up to date, as attackers often exploit outdated software to gain access. In addition, enable automatic updates and review app permissions to prevent stolen personal data from being combined with device-level access and causing further harm.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The University of Phoenix data breach highlights a growing problem in higher education. When attackers exploit trusted enterprise software, the fallout spreads fast and wide. While free identity protection helps, long-term vigilance matters most. Staying alert can limit damage long after the headlines fade.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out whats clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Cybercriminals have always chased whatever people trust the most. First, it was email. Then search results. Now it's AI chat answers. Researchers are warning about a new campaign where fake AI conversations are showing up in Google search results and quietly pushing Mac users to install dangerous malware. What makes this especially risky is that everything looks helpful, legitimate and step-by-step, right up until your system is compromised.",
      "The malware being spread is Atomic macOS Stealer, often called AMOS, and the attacks abuse conversations generated by tools people increasingly rely on for everyday help. Investigators have confirmed that both ChatGPT and Grok were misused as part of this campaign.",

      "THIRD-PARTY BREACH EXPOSES CHATGPT ACCOUNT DETAILS",
      "One copied terminal command is all it takes for malware like AMOS to quietly install itself on a Mac. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How fake AI chat results lead to malware",
      "Researchers traced one infection back to a simple Google search: \"clear disk space on macOS.\" Instead of landing on a normal help article, the user was shown what looked like an AI conversation result embedded directly in search. That conversation offered clear, confident instructions and ended by telling the user to run a command in the macOS Terminal. That command installed AMOS.",
      "When researchers followed the same trail, they found multiple poisoned AI conversations appearing for similar searches. That consistency strongly suggests this was a deliberate operation aimed at Mac users searching for routine maintenance help.",
      "If this feels familiar, it should. A previous campaign used sponsored search results and SEO-poisoned links that pointed to fake macOS software hosted on GitHub. In that case, attackers impersonated legitimate apps and walked users through terminal commands that installed the same AMOS infostealer.",
      "According to researchers, once the terminal command is executed, the infection chain kicks off immediately. The base64 string in the command decodes into a URL that hosts a malicious bash script. That script is designed to harvest credentials, escalate privileges and establish persistence, all without triggering a visible security warning.",
      "The danger here is how clean the process looks. There's no installer window, obvious permission prompt or any option for you to review what's about to run. Because everything happens through the command line, normal download protections are sidestepped and the attacker gets to execute whatever they want.",
      "MICROSOFT TYPOSQUATTING SCAM SWAPS LETTERS TO STEAL LOGINS",
      "Fake AI chat results can look polished and trustworthy, even when they are designed to trick you into running harmful commands. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why is this attack so effective?",
      "This campaign combines two powerful ideas. Trust in AI answers and trust in search results. Most major chat tools, including Grok on X, let users delete parts of conversations or share only selected snippets. That means an attacker can carefully curate a short, polished exchange that looks genuinely helpful while hiding the manipulative prompts that produced it.",
      "Using prompt engineering, attackers get ChatGPT to generate a step-by-step cleanup or installation guide that actually installs malware. ChatGPT's sharing feature then creates a public link that lives inside the attacker's account. From there, criminals either pay for sponsored search placement or use SEO tactics to push that shared conversation high in the results.",
      "Some ads are designed to look almost identical to legitimate links. Unless you check who the advertiser actually is, it's easy to assume it's safe. One example documented by researchers showed a sponsored result advertising a fake \"Atlas\" browser for macOS, complete with professional branding.",
      "Once those links are live, attackers don't need to do much else. They wait for users to search, click, trust the AI output and follow the instructions exactly as written.",
      "REAL APPLE SUPPORT EMAILS USED IN NEW PHISHING SCAM",
      "Attackers rely on trust in search results and AI answers, knowing most people will not question step-by-step instructions. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "8 steps you can take to stay safe from fake AI chat malware",
      "AI tools are useful, but attackers are now shaping answers that lead you straight into trouble. These steps help you stay protected without giving up search or AI entirely.",
      "This is the most important rule. If an AI response or webpage tells you to open Terminal and paste a command, stop. Legitimate macOS fixes almost never require you to blindly run scripts copied from the internet. Once you press Enter, you lose visibility into what happens next. Malware like AMOS relies on this moment of trust to bypass normal security checks.",
      "AI chats are not authoritative sources. They can be manipulated through prompt engineering to produce dangerous step-by-step guides that look clean and confident. Before acting on any AI-generated fix, cross-check it with Apple's official documentation or a trusted developer site. If you cannot verify it easily, do not run it.",
      "A password manager creates strong, unique passwords for every account you use. If malware steals one password, it cannot unlock everything else. Many password managers also refuse to autofill credentials on fake or unfamiliar sites, which can alert you that something is wrong before you type anything manually. This single tool dramatically reduces the impact of credential-stealing malware.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com",
      "AMOS and similar malware often rely on known weaknesses after the initial infection. Updates patch these holes. Delaying updates gives attackers more room to escalate privileges or maintain persistence. Turn on automatic updates so you are protected even if you forget.",
      "Modern macOS malware often runs through scripts and memory-only techniques. A strong antivirus software doesn't just scan files. It monitors behavior, flags suspicious scripts, and can stop malicious activity even when nothing obvious is downloaded. This is especially important when malware is delivered through Terminal commands.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Paid search ads can look almost identical to legitimate results. Always check who the advertiser is before clicking. If a sponsored result leads to an AI conversation, a download or instructions to run commands, close it immediately.",
      "Search results promising quick fixes, disk cleanup or performance boosts are common malware entry points. If a guide is not hosted by Apple or a well-known developer, assume it could be risky, especially if it pushes command-line solutions.",
      "Attackers spend time making fake AI conversations look helpful and professional. Clear formatting and confident language are not signs of safety. They are often part of the deception. Slowing down and questioning the source is usually enough to break the attack chain.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "This campaign shows how attackers are shifting from breaking systems to manipulating trust. Fake AI conversations work because they sound calm, helpful and authoritative. When those conversations are boosted through search results, they inherit credibility they don't deserve. The technical tricks behind AMOS are complex, but the entry point is simple. Someone follows instructions without questioning where they came from.",

    "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 07:02:37 -0500",
    "summary": "States require AI disclosure in healthcare as California, Colorado and Utah implement laws mandating transparency when artificial intelligence influences patient care decisions.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel takes a look at how artificial intelligence could vastly improve the healthcare system but points out human doctors are still needed in the equation on The Story.",
      "Artificial intelligence is quickly reshaping healthcare. It now supports diagnostic imaging, clinical decision tools, patient messages and back office workflows. According to the World Economic Forum, 4.5 billion people still lack access to essential care, and the global health worker shortage could reach 11 million by 2030. AI could help close that gap.",
      "However, as AI becomes more embedded in care, regulators are zeroing in on a simple question. Should patients be told when AI plays a role in their care?",
      "In the United States, no single federal law requires broad AI disclosure in healthcare. Instead, a growing patchwork of state laws is filling that gap. Some states require clear disclosure. Others mandate transparency indirectly through limits on how AI can be used.",

      "STATE-LEVEL AI RULES SURVIVE \u2014 FOR NOW \u2014 AS SENATE SINKS MORATORIUM DESPITE WHITE HOUSE PRESSURE",
      "AI now supports many healthcare decisions, from patient communications to coverage reviews, making transparency more important than ever for trust and accountability. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why AI disclosure matters for trust",
      "Transparency is not a technical detail, it is a trust issue. Research across industries shows people expect to be informed when AI affects decisions that matter to them. In healthcare, that expectation is even stronger. An analysis published by CX Today found that when AI use is hidden, trust erodes quickly, even when outcomes are accurate.",
      "Healthcare depends on trust. Patients follow treatment plans, share sensitive information and stay engaged when they believe care decisions are ethical and accountable.",
      "How AI disclosure connects to HIPAA and informed consent",
      "While HIPAA does not directly regulate artificial intelligence, its principles still apply. Covered entities must clearly explain how protected health information is used and safeguarded.",
      "When AI systems analyze or generate clinical information using patient data, nondisclosure can undermine that goal. Patients may not fully understand how their information shapes care decisions.",
      "Disclosure also supports informed consent. Patients have the right to understand material factors influencing diagnosis, treatment, or care communications. Just as clinicians disclose new procedures or medical devices, meaningful AI use should be explained, so patients can ask questions and stay involved in their care.",
      "AI TOOLS COULD WEAKEN DOCTORS' SKILLS IN DETECTING COLON CANCER, STUDY SUGGESTS",
      "States are stepping in where federal rules fall short, creating new disclosure requirements when AI influences care access, claims, or treatment decisions. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What does AI disclosure mean in healthcare?",
      "AI disclosure means informing patients or members when artificial intelligence systems are used in healthcare-related decisions. This can include clinical messages, diagnostic support tools, utilization review, claims processing or coverage determinations. The goal is transparency, accountability and patient trust.",
      "Healthcare activities most likely to trigger disclosure",
      "According to analysis from Morgan Lewis, disclosure requirements most often apply when AI is used for:",
      "Patient-facing clinical communicationsUtilization review and utilization managementClaims processing and coverage decisionsMental health or therapeutic interactions",
      "Patient-facing clinical communications",
      "Utilization review and utilization management",
      "Claims processing and coverage decisions",
      "Mental health or therapeutic interactions",
      "These areas are considered high impact because they directly affect access to care and understanding of health information.",
      "Risks of failing to disclose AI use",
      "Healthcare organizations that fail to disclose AI use face real consequences. These include increased litigation risk, reputational damage and erosion of patient trust. Ethical concerns around autonomy and transparency can also trigger regulatory scrutiny.",
      "MORE AMERICANS ARE TURNING TO AI FOR HEALTH ADVICE",
      "Clear AI disclosure helps patients stay informed and involved, reinforcing that licensed healthcare professionals remain responsible for every medical decision. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How states are shaping AI disclosure rules",
      "States are taking different paths to regulate healthcare AI, but most are starting with one common goal: greater transparency when technology influences care.",
      "California has taken one of the most comprehensive approaches.",
      "AB 3030 requires clinics and physician offices that use generative AI for patient communications to include a clear disclaimer. Patients must also be told how to reach a human healthcare professional.",
      "SB 1120 applies to health plans and disability insurers. It requires safeguards when AI is used for utilization review. It also mandates disclosure and confirms that licensed professionals make medical necessity decisions.",
      "Colorado's SB24 205 targets AI systems considered high risk. These are tools that materially influence decisions like approval or denial of healthcare services.",
      "Entities must implement safeguards against algorithmic discrimination and disclose AI use. While broader than clinical care alone, the law directly affects patient access decisions.",
      "Utah has layered disclosure rules that intersect with healthcare.",
      "HB 452 requires mental health chatbots to clearly disclose AI use. SB 149 and SB 226 extend disclosure requirements to regulated occupations, including healthcare professionals.",
      "This approach ensures transparency in therapeutic interactions and clinical services.",
      "Other states that are expanding AI transparency",
      "Several other states are moving in the same direction. Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Tennessee and New York are all considering or enforcing rules that require disclosure and human review when AI influences utilization review or claims outcomes. Even when clinical diagnosis is not covered, these laws push accountability where AI affects care access.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you are a patient, expect more transparency. You may see disclosures in messages, coverage notices or digital interactions. If you work in healthcare, AI governance is no longer optional. Disclosure practices must align across clinical, administrative, and digital systems. Training staff and updating patient notices will matter as much as the technology itself. Trust will increasingly depend on how openly AI is introduced into care.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "AI can improve efficiency, expand access, and support clinicians. Yet its value depends on trust. Disclosure does not slow innovation. It strengthens confidence in both the technology and the professionals who use it. As states continue to act, transparency will likely become the norm rather than the exception in healthcare AI.",

      "What's in your \"digital file\" and why it's a problem in 2026",
      "Data brokers work like factories. They pull information from the apps you use, websites you visit, loyalty cards you scan, public records and even location data from your phone. Then they combine it into a shockingly detailed picture of your life, including:",

They use broker data to tailor scams, impersonate companies you interact with and even mimic family members.Deepfake phone scams are exploding: When a scammer knows your relatives' names, phone numbers, travel dates and habits, a deepfake call becomes dangerously believable.Data breaches are more frequent than ever: Your info doesn't get leaked once; it gets leaked again and again because brokers constantly resell it.The more data you leave exposed, the easier identity theft becomes: One exposed address or phone number is annoying.

      "If you want 2026 to be your safest year yet, the best thing you can do is reduce the amount of personal data available about you online, starting with data brokers.",
      "Why data brokers make it so hard to delete your information",
      "Technically, data brokers have to delete your data if you request it. But here's the part they don't advertise: They want you to give up. Some brokers hide their opt-out pages behind dozens of clicks. Others require you to fax forms, upload IDs, or repeat the request every 30\u201390 days because they\u00a0reactivate your profile without warning. Now multiply that by 180\u2013500+ data brokers, depending on your location. This is why most people never delete their information: it's just too time-consuming.",
      "The simplest fix: automate the removals",
      "This is where a data removal service helps. These services automatically request the removal of your personal information from hundreds of data brokers on your behalf. That includes people-search websites, marketing databases, background-check services and similar data marketplaces. Instead of tracking down each site yourself, automation handles the process for you. Here's what it does:",

      "The holiday season creates a surge in data sharing. Retailers, loyalty programs, airlines, travel sites and apps collect huge amounts of personal information in November and December. Shoppers often share email addresses, phone numbers and location data to unlock discounts and faster checkout.",
      "Holiday spending continues to rise year over year. More spending means more data. As a result, your personal information spreads across more databases than at any other time of the year.",
      "After the holiday rush, data brokers update and expand their profiles using newly collected information. January is when many of these companies organize, repackage and resell their datasets.",
      "Starting the removal process early helps limit how widely your information gets shared. Since removals can take days or even weeks, acting now reduces exposure before that data circulates further.",
      "From January through April, scammers ramp up activity tied to tax season. Common threats include\u00a0IRS impersonation scams, fake refund messages and W-2 fraud. Many of these attacks rely on data pulled from broker databases.",
      "When scammers have accurate personal details, their messages feel more convincing. Reducing your data exposure now lowers the risk. Removing your information from major data broker sites is a strong first step. It also helps to check smaller, lesser-known sites that may still list your details.",

      "Using a reputable data removal service can simplify the entire process. These services automate requests to remove your personal information from data brokers, including many sites that are difficult to handle on your own.",
      "Start by searching for your name on Google. Look for results that show your address, date of birth, phone number, or email address. Sites that display this information often belong to data brokers or businesses that sell personal data for profit.",
      "Make a short list of the pages where your information appears.",
      "Instead of spending weeks contacting each site manually, a data removal service can handle the work for you. You submit the links you found, and the service requests removals on your behalf across hundreds of databases.",

      "Data brokers do not stop collecting information. Even after removals, your data can reappear months later. Ongoing monitoring helps catch new listings and remove them before they spread further.",
      "That long-term protection is what keeps your data footprint smaller throughout the year.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "We could not let 2025 end without one last reminder about digital safety. Cybercriminals never slow down. In fact, the holidays and the start of a new year often bring a surge in scams, account takeovers and data theft. The good news is that cybersecurity need not feel overwhelming.

      "AMERICA'S MOST-USED PASSWORD IN 2025 REVEALED",
      "Strong passwords and two-factor authentication stop most account takeovers before they start. (Peter Steffen/picture alliance)",
      "1) Start the year with strong passwords",
      "Passwords remain your first line of defense. Weak or reused passwords make it easy for attackers to break into multiple accounts at once. Use a unique password for every account. Longer passphrases work better than short, complex strings. A reputable password manager can generate and securely store passwords, so you do not have to memorize them. One rule matters most. Never reuse passwords.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) everywhere",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds a second step after your password. This usually includes a code from an app or a physical security key. Even if someone steals your password, 2FA can block access. App-based authenticators provide stronger protection than text messages. Turn it on for email, banking, social media and shopping accounts first.",
      "3) Audit your digital presence",
      "Old accounts create new risks. Take time to review shopping sites, forums, apps and subscriptions you no longer use. Delete what you do not need. Update privacy settings on what you keep. Share less personal information whenever possible, especially birthdays, locations and phone numbers. A smaller digital footprint limits abuse.",
      "5 SOCIAL MEDIA SAFETY TIPS TO PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY ONLINE",
      "Simple habits like updating software and thinking before you click block common scams. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "4) Keep software and devices up to date",
      "Security updates fix real vulnerabilities that attackers actively exploit. Skipping updates leaves doors open. Enable automatic updates for operating systems, browsers, apps, routers and smart devices. This habit blocks many common attacks without extra effort. Outdated software remains one of the top causes of successful hacks.",
      "5) Use a personal data removal service",
      "Your personal information appears on hundreds of data broker sites. These sites collect names, addresses, phone numbers and relatives, then sell access to anyone willing to pay. A personal data removal service helps locate and remove that information. This step reduces scam attempts, phishing messages and identity fraud risks throughout the year. Less exposed data means fewer threats.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: Cyberguy.com",
      "6) Consider identity theft protection",
      "Identity theft often starts quietly. A breach happens. Data leaks. Fraud follows months later. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Many services can also scan for accounts tied to multiple email addresses, making cleanup easier. Early alerts help you act before damage spreads.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at Cyberguy.com.",
      "PROTECT YOURSELF FROM SNEAKY WEB INJECTION SCAMS",
      "Backups, secure Wi-Fi and identity monitoring help limit damage when breaches happen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7) Think before you click and use strong antivirus protection",
      "Most cyberattacks still begin with a click. Fake shipping notices, refund alerts and urgent messages push people to act fast. Pause before clicking links or opening attachments. Many scams now use AI to generate realistic messages, fake voices and convincing images, making it even more important to pause before you click. Verify messages through official websites or apps instead. Strong antivirus software adds another layer of protection by blocking malware, ransomware and malicious downloads across your devices, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "8) Secure your home Wi-Fi network",
      "Your Wi-Fi network connects everything. That makes it a valuable target. Change the default router password right away. Enable WPA3 encryption if your router supports it. Keep router firmware up to date and avoid sharing your network with unknown devices. A secure network protects every connected device.",
      "9) Back up your data regularly",
      "Backups protect you from ransomware, hardware failure and accidental deletion. Many people still skip them. Use cloud backups, an external hard drive or both. Automate the process so it runs without reminders. If something goes wrong, backups let you recover quickly.",
      "10) Freeze your credit if you do not need it",
      "A credit freeze prevents new accounts from opening in your name. It remains one of the strongest defenses against identity fraud heading into 2026. Freezing credit is free and reversible. You can temporarily lift it when applying for loans or credit cards. This single step blocks many identity crimes outright. To learn more about how to do this, go to Cyberguy.com and search \"How to freeze your credit.\"",
      "Pro tip: Lock down your email and use aliases",
      "Your email account controls password resets, alerts and account recovery. If attackers get in, they can reach nearly everything else. Secure your primary email with a long, unique password and two-factor authentication. Then create email aliases for shopping, subscriptions and sign-ups. Aliases limit exposure when a company suffers a data breach and make phishing easier to spot. Protecting email this way strengthens every other cybersecurity resolution.",
      "By creating email aliases, you can protect your information and reduce spam. These aliases forward messages to your primary address, making it easier to manage incoming communications and avoid data breaches.",
      "For recommendations on private and secure email providers that offer alias addresses, visit Cyberguy.com.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "A safer digital life starts with small, consistent decisions. Strong passwords, updates, backups and awareness go a long way. By committing to these cybersecurity resolutions, you set yourself up for a more secure 2026. You also make it harder for criminals to profit from stolen data. There is no better time to start than now.",

Attackers are using the domain rnicrosoft.com to impersonate Microsoft and steal login credentials. The trick is simple. Instead of the letter m, scammers place r and n side by side. In many fonts, those letters blur together and look almost identical to an m at a quick glance.",

      "Why your brain falls for the rn trick",
      "This attack relies on how people read. Your brain predicts words instead of scanning each letter. When something looks familiar, you fill in the gaps automatically. On a large desktop monitor, a careful reader might spot the flaw. On a phone, the risk jumps. The address bar often shortens URLs, and the screen leaves little room for close inspection. That is exactly where attackers want you. Once trust is established, you are more likely to enter passwords, approve fake invoices or download harmful attachments.",

The faster you act, the less likely you are to notice the mistake.",
      "Why these fake domains keep working",
      "Most people do not slow down to read URLs character by character. Familiar logos and language reinforce trust, especially during a busy workday. Mobile use makes this worse. Smaller screens, shortened links and constant notifications create perfect conditions for mistakes. This is not a Microsoft-only problem. Banks, retailers, healthcare portals and government services all face the same risk.",
      "How to stay safe from typosquatting attacks",
      "Typosquatting scams work because they rush you into trusting what looks familiar. These steps slow that moment down and help you spot fake domains before damage is done.",
      "Before clicking anything, open the full sender address in the email header. Display names and logos are easy to fake, but domains tell the real story. Look closely for swapped letters like rn in place of m, added hyphens or strange domain endings. If the address feels even slightly off, treat the message as hostile.",

      "On a desktop, hover your mouse over links to reveal the real destination. On a phone, long-press the link to preview the URL. This simple pause often exposes lookalike domains designed to steal logins. If the link does not match the exact site you expect, do not proceed.",
      "When an email claims your account needs urgent action, do not use its links. Instead, open a new browser tab and manually go to the official website using a saved bookmark. Legitimate companies do not require you to act through surprise links, and this habit cuts off most typosquatting attempts instantly.",
      "Strong antivirus software can block known phishing domains, flag malicious downloads and warn you before you enter credentials on risky sites. While it cannot catch every new typo trick, it adds an important safety net when human attention slips.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

Recently, the company updated its behavior guidelines for users under 18 and released new AI literacy tools for parents and teens. The move comes as pressure mounts across the tech industry. Lawmakers, educators and child safety advocates want proof that AI companies can protect young users.

      "OpenAI announced tougher safety rules for teen users as pressure grows on tech companies to prove AI can protect young people online. (Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "What OpenAI's new teen rules actually say",
      "OpenAI's updated Model Spec builds on existing safety limits and applies to teen users ages 13 to 17. It continues to block sexual content involving minors and discourages self-harm, delusions and manic behavior. For teens, the rules go further. The models must avoid immersive romantic roleplay, first-person intimacy, and violent or sexual roleplay, even when non-graphic. They must use extra caution when discussing body image and eating behaviors. When safety risks appear, the chatbot should prioritize protection over user autonomy. It should also avoid giving advice that helps teens hide risky behavior from caregivers. These limits apply even if a prompt is framed as fictional, historical, or educational.",
      "The four principles OpenAI says it uses to protect teens",
      "OpenAI says its approach to teen users follows four core principles:",

      "Teens are driving the AI safety debate",
      "Gen Z users are among the most active chatbot users today. Many rely on AI for homework help, creative projects and emotional support. OpenAI's recent deal with Disney could draw even more young users to the platform. That growing popularity has also brought scrutiny. Recently, attorneys general from 42 states urged major tech companies to add stronger safeguards for children and vulnerable users. At the federal level, proposed legislation could go even further. Some lawmakers want to block minors from using AI chatbots entirely.",
      "Why experts question whether AI safety rules work",
      "Despite the updates, many experts remain cautious. One major concern is engagement. Advocates argue chatbots often encourage prolonged interaction, which can become addictive for teens. Refusing certain requests could help break that cycle. Still, critics warn that examples in policy documents are not proof of consistent behavior. Past versions of the Model Spec banned excessive agreeableness, yet models continued mirroring users in harmful ways. Some experts link this behavior to what they call AI psychosis, where chatbots reinforce distorted thinking instead of challenging it.",
      "In one widely reported case, a teenager who later died by suicide spent months interacting with a chatbot. Conversation logs showed repeated mirroring and validation of distress. Internal systems flagged hundreds of messages related to self-harm. Yet the interactions continued. Former safety researchers later explained that earlier moderation systems reviewed content after the fact rather than in real time. That allowed harmful conversations to continue unchecked. OpenAI says it now uses real-time classifiers across text, images, and audio. When systems detect serious risk, trained reviewers may step in, and parents may be notified.",
      "Some advocates praise OpenAI for publicly sharing its under-18 guidelines. Many tech companies do not offer that level of transparency. Still, experts stress that written rules are not enough. What matters is how the system behaves during real conversations with vulnerable users. Without independent measurement and clear enforcement data, critics say these updates remain promises rather than proof.",
      "How parents can help teens use AI safely",
      "OpenAI says parents play a key role in helping teens use AI responsibly. The company stresses that tools alone are not enough. Active guidance matters most.",
      "OpenAI encourages regular conversations between parents and teens about how AI fits into daily life. These discussions should focus on responsible use and critical thinking. Parents are urged to remind teens that AI responses are not facts and can be wrong.",
      "OpenAI provides parental controls that let adults manage how teens interact with AI tools. These tools can limit features and add oversight. The company says safeguards are designed to reduce exposure to higher-risk topics and unsafe interactions. Here are the steps OpenAI recommends parents take.",
      "Confirm your teen's account statusParents should make sure their teen's account reflects the correct age.

      "Parents are encouraged to ask what teens use AI for, when they use it and how it makes them feel. These conversations can reveal unhealthy patterns early.",
      "Experts advise parents to look for increased isolation, emotional reliance on AI or treating chatbot responses as authority. These can signal unhealthy dependence.",

Enabling multi-factor authentication adds an extra layer of protection beyond a password and helps reduce the risk of unauthorized access to teen accounts.",
      "Also, consider adding a strong antivirus software that can help block malicious links, fake downloads, and other threats teens may encounter while using AI tools.

Still, policies on paper are not the same as behavior in real conversations. For teens who rely on AI every day, what matters most is how these systems respond in moments of stress, confusion, or vulnerability. That is where trust is built or lost. For parents, this moment calls for balance. AI tools can be helpful and creative. They also require guidance, boundaries, and supervision. No set of controls can replace real conversations or human support. As AI becomes more embedded in our everyday lives, the focus must stay on outcomes, not intentions.

But we are a nation of people, so what we want to talk about is collective reparations. Reparations to communities and reparations to the African American people, as well as individual payments.\"",
      "Simmons-Thorne, who studies philosophy at UIUC, discussed the \"three species of justice,\" one of them being \"rectificatory justice.\"",
      "\"It is this type of justice that is at the heart of the reparations movement, but it is also the type of justice that has been least thought about in the history of philosophy,\" she said.",

      "In 2019, Evanston, Illinois, became the first locality to implement reparations in the form of cash payments. Eligible African Americans could receive up to $25,000 in cash payments. As of June, about $6.3 million in reparations had been paid, according to the Evanston RoundTable.",

      "Ted Maher was convicted of setting the 1999 Monaco penthouse fire that killed billionaire Edmond Safra, but his criminal story didn\u2019t end there.",
      "From staged heroics and shifting identities to a later murder-for-hire plot against his wife, a crime expert says Maher\u2019s long arc offers rare insight into how certain offenders escalate rather than reform.",
      "According to former FBI special agent Jason Pack, Maher\u2019s behavior reflects a recognizable pattern among offenders who manufacture crises, seek control and continue deceiving long after their first crime is exposed.",
      "Maher, an American who said he had been a Green Beret, was a private nurse hired to care for Safra when a fire broke out inside Safra\u2019s heavily secured Monaco penthouse in the early hours of Dec. 3, 1999. Safra and another nurse, Vivian Torrente, died of smoke inhalation after locking themselves inside a bathroom believed to double as a safe room.",

      "Maher survived and initially told authorities that two hooded intruders armed with knives had broken into the apartment \u2014 a claim Monaco officials later said could not be corroborated, according to The New York Times.",
      "After days of conflicting accounts, Maher admitted to police that he had set the fire himself by igniting a wastepaper basket, Monaco\u2019s chief prosecutor Daniel Serdet said at the time, The Times reported. Maher told investigators he did not intend to kill anyone and said he had fabricated the intruder story to \"draw attention to himself,\" Serdet said.",
      "Serdet told reporters Maher was jealous of Safra\u2019s seven other nurses and hoped to win his employer\u2019s approval by staging a rescue. \"He wanted to be a hero,\" Serdet said, according to The Times.",
      "Public Prosecutor Daniel Serdet spoke to journalists on Jan. 22, 2003, at the Palace of Justice in Monaco, following the escape of Ted Maher and his Italian cellmate, Luigi Ciardelli.

      "Investigators said Maher slashed himself twice with his own knife \u2014 once in the thigh and once in the stomach \u2014 before seeking help from the building\u2019s concierge, The Times reported. Officials said Safra and Torrente could have escaped the fire but remained inside the locked bathroom because Safra feared attackers were still inside the apartment.",
      "Safra\u2019s death stunned the world of international banking and sparked widespread speculation about whether he had been targeted because of his business dealings. Newspapers around the world theorized that Safra, a Lebanese-born banker, may have been killed because of his financial relationships, including dealings involving Russian investors, The Times reported.",
      "Investigators ultimately rejected those theories. Serdet said Maher acted alone and that there was \"no complicated intrigue\" behind the fire, according to The Times.",
      "The fire came at a pivotal moment in Safra's life. According to The Times, he suffered from Parkinson\u2019s disease and was preparing to retire as a deal to sell his banking empire, including Republic National Bank of New York, neared completion.",

      "His death marked the loss of far more than a banking titan. He was not only one of the world\u2019s wealthiest bankers, but a major global philanthropist whose foundation has funded education, medical research, humanitarian aid and religious institutions across more than 40 countries \u2014 a legacy that continues decades after his death.",
      "According to The Times, Safra believed he had powerful enemies, a concern fueled by his banking career and cooperation with U.S. authorities, which contributed to the intense security measures inside the Monaco penthouse.",
      "Safra\u2019s security concerns were rooted in real events, according to Vanity Fair. Dominick Dunne, who wrote extensively about the case, said Safra had alerted U.S. authorities to Russian organized crime activity tied to his banking business \u2014 a move that left him deeply fearful.",
      "\"He turned in the Russian mafia to the FBI,\" Dunne told \"48 Hours.\" \"He became very paranoid about his safety.\"",
      "Pack said that environment is critical to understanding how Maher\u2019s original story took hold. In his view, Maher tailored his intruder narrative to fit Safra\u2019s fears, making the account initially plausible to investigators and the public.",
      "\"When a man spends decades trying to sell a \u2018hero\u2019 story,\" Pack said, \"you eventually have to stop listening to the music and start looking at the math.\"",
      "A new Netflix documentary, \"Murder in Monaco,\" has revived interest in the case and Maher\u2019s claims of innocence. But Pack said the most revealing evidence lies not in revisiting that night in 1999, but in the decades of conduct that followed.",
      "Pack said Maher\u2019s conduct since the Monaco case further undermines his claims of being a coerced or misunderstood figure.",
      "In 2002, Maher was convicted of arson causing death and sentenced to 10 years in prison. After serving roughly eight years in prison, he returned to the United States, changed his name and later became entangled in additional crimes.",

      "Pack described what he called a pattern of staged crises and deception. In Monaco, he said, Maher manufactured a fire to engineer a heroic rescue. Decades later, prosecutors said he plotted another staged event, this time with lethal intent to gain financially.",
      "Pack also pointed to Maher\u2019s decision to reinvent himself under a new name after prison as further evidence of deception rather than rehabilitation.",

(Pascal Guyot/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "\"When someone changes his identity to escape his past, that conduct defines his character,\" Pack said.",
      "Maher has claimed for years that his confession in Monaco was coerced. But Pack said Maher\u2019s later actions severely undercut that narrative.",
      "\"It\u2019s easy to blame a foreign police force when you\u2019re the only one talking,\" Pack said. \"But when you\u2019re caught orchestrating a murder from a jail cell in New Mexico, the victim story is finished.\"",

      "Trump\u2019s use of the U.S. military to oust Venezuela\u2019s president and his threats of potentially similar operations to come elsewhere are a dramatic shift from his past \u201cAmerica First\u201d rhetoric, underscoring his pursuit of a more interventionist foreign policy in his second term. His remarks Saturday outlined a new foreign policy doctrine for a president who has demonstrated an increasing willingness to wield military force on multiple fronts.",
      "It\u2019s an approach that could carry risk for a president who said in his inaugural address last January that he hoped to be remembered as a \u201cpeacemaker.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will measure our success not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars that we end and, perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into,\u201d Trump said at the time.",
      "Former Defense Department official Seth Jones, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Trump and his national security team will own the results of whatever follows in Venezuela.",
      "\u201cThis is theirs,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIf this goes south, there is no one else you can blame.\u201d",
      "As a candidate in 2016, Trump blasted fellow Republicans and previous presidents for backing troubled military interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya. \u201cOur current strategy of nation-building and regime change is a proven, absolute failure,\u201d he said.",
      "In the 2024 presidential campaign, he pledged to fire \u201cwarmongers\u201d serving in the government and chose a running mate, JD Vance, who championed his skepticism of waging wars in foreign countries.",
      "Yet in his first year back in office, Trump has ordered military strikes on targets in Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Somalia, Nigeria, Iran \u2014 and now in Venezuela to capture Maduro and bring him to the U.S. to face drug trafficking charges.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Trump is fulfilling his campaign promises by going after Maduro and that the operation was in keeping with his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is a decisive and strong leader who does EXACTLY what he says he\u2019s going to do,\u201d Leavitt wrote on X.",
      "\u201cDuring his historic campaign in 2024, President Trump explicitly promised that he would work to \u2018demolish foreign drug cartels\u2019 to keep our citizens safe and that\u2019s exactly what he did today through an unprecedented display of speed, precision, and power,\u201d Leavitt wrote.",
      "White House officials also have cited Trump\u2019s role in brokering an elusive ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas as proof that his tough approach can defuse conflicts.",
      "The operation in Caracas early Saturday followed a U.S. air campaign that began in September against dozens of alleged drug smuggling boats in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific.",
      "Those strikes, which, like the operation against Maduro, have not been authorized by Congress, have killed at least 114 people, according to the Pentagon. They have received both support from Trump\u2019s allies in Congress and criticism from lawmakers, former military lawyers and allied governments that the attacks violate U.S. and international law.",
      "U.S. airstrikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear sites in June, which featured the first use of a massive bunker-busting bomb, prompted criticism and concern among some of Trump\u2019s supporters and political allies that he was straying from his original anti-interventionist vision.",
      "Trump is now threatening to attack Iran again unless the regime\u2019s leaders comply with his latest warning that they must not kill protesters massing in Tehran\u2019s streets over economic conditions.",
      "\u201cWe are locked and loaded and ready to go,\u201d Trump wrote Friday in a social media post pledging to come to the protesters\u2019 rescue if needed.",
      "After Trump announced the capture of Maduro, most Republican lawmakers publicly endorsed the move, while Democrats and a handful of GOP members expressed doubts about the legal basis for the operation and the potential for an open-ended, risky U.S. commitment in Venezuela.",
      "Outgoing Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor-Greene of Georgia, a staunch supporter of Trump-turned-critic, said on X that Trump\u2019s Make America Great Again supporters shared a \u201cdisgust\u201d with \u201cnever ending\u201d military adventures abroad.",
      "\u201cThis is what many in MAGA thought they voted to end. Boy were we wrong,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Trump\u2019s focus on foreign policy, either as a commander in chief presiding over airstrikes or as a \u201cpeacemaker\u201d pushing for diplomatic deals, poses a potential political risk. His approval ratings have slipped as voters who hoped to see economic conditions brighten on his watch struggle to pay their bills.",
      "Mark Mitchell, head pollster at Rasmussen Reports, who briefed Trump and senior White House officials privately in November, said that when voters are asked whether the government\u2019s focus needs to be on domestic or foreign policy, \u201ceveryone says domestic.\u201d",
      "Mitchell said he told Trump that \u201cthe optics of spending too much time on foreign policy were hurting him.\u201d",
      "In his remarks Saturday, Trump repeatedly referred to Venezuela\u2019s oil as a prize Americans gained in the operation against Maduro. Dissatisfied with the quantity of oil that Venezuela is pumping, he said, U.S. companies will now go in, boost supplies and sell the product.",
      "A U.S. official elaborated later in the day, saying the administration will work with oil executives to begin expanding the country\u2019s oil output.",
      "Trump did not rule out additional military strikes in Venezuela if he determines they are needed.",
      "In 2002, as President George W. Bush weighed a possible U.S. invasion of Iraq, his secretary of state, Colin Powell, warned him of the potential risks of regime change.",
      "\u201cOnce you break it, you are going to own it,\u201d Powell told him, \u201cand we\u2019re going to be responsible for 26 million people standing there looking at us.\u201d",
      "Bush eventually opted to go ahead with the invasion and soon learned the harsh lessons of what was dubbed the \u201cPottery Barn rule.\u201d",
      "Trump suggested Saturday that Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Dan Caine will manage Venezuela\u2019s government transition.",
      "Jones, the former Defense Department official, said the biggest problem Trump will face is creating the conditions for a government that has the support of the people of Venezuela.",
      "\u201cThe entire success of the mission will hinge on whether the population views its government as legitimate,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThis was the fundamental problem the U.S. faced in Iraq.\u201d"

      "By capturing Venezuela\u2019s president, Washington sent shock waves felt far beyond Caracas.",
      "The United States stunned the world on Saturday by launching military strikes in Venezuela and seizing President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, swiftly ending his 13-year rule in an operation the Trump administration framed as a demonstration of American power, as President Donald Trump boasted that the U.S. possessed \u201ccapabilities and skills our enemies can scarcely imagine.\u201d",
      "America\u2019s adversaries heard him loudest.",
      "Follow live updates",
      "Russia and China swiftly condemned the strikes and called for the release of Maduro, who has been brought to the U.S. to face criminal charges. Iran and Cuba denounced what they called a violation of international law, their objections carrying an edge of unease that they, too, could find themselves in Washington\u2019s sights.",
      "Even major European allies, more cautious and measured in tone, carefully signaled concern about the operation\u2019s legality while largely aligning with the U.S. on policy.",
      "Taken together, these responses suggest the revival of old fears of American interventionism, prompting allies and adversaries alike to ponder where Washington might act next.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump is fulfilling his campaign promise to \"demolish foreign drug cartels\" by going after Maduro. She said on X that the operation would \"keep our citizens safe\" in keeping with Trump's \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda.",
      "For Tehran, the fall of a close ally comes as it grapples with internal unrest of its own, just a day after Trump warned Iran it could face U.S. action if protesters were harmed.",
      "\u201cThe American military attack on Venezuela is a clear violation of the basic principles of the United Nations Charter and the fundamental rules of international law,\u201d it said in a statement published on Telegram by Iran\u2019s semiofficial news agency.",
      "In Havana, Cuba\u2019s leadership labeled the attack \u201cstate terrorism,\u201d acutely aware that both Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have openly questioned how long the Cuban government itself should remain untouched.",
      "Rubio\u2019s \u201cprimary interest is in Cuba, not in Venezuela,\u201d said Michael Paarlberg, a senior nonresident fellow at the Center for International Policy, noting that Rubio sees Venezuela \u201cas the chief patron of the Cuban regime.\u201d",
      "Asked Sunday during an interview with NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d whether the Trump administration\u2019s next target is the Cuban government, Rubio said, \u201cThe Cuban government is a huge problem.\u201d",
      "He said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to talk to you about what our future steps are going to be and our policies are going to be right now in this regard. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any mystery that we are not big fans of the Cuban regime.\u201d",

      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "\u201cWe are at war against drug trafficking organizations, it's not a war against Venezuela,\u201d Rubio said of the intervention. \u201cWe are enforcing American laws with regards to oil sanctions.\u201d",
      "While past U.S. regime-change efforts in Cuba have failed, dating back decades, Paarlberg told NBC News the Cuban government was still likely to be \u201cworried about something like a direct parallel.\u201d",
      "The United States\u2019 traditional adversaries were not alone in their condemnation, with several left-leaning governments in Latin America warning the move risked destabilizing the region.",
      "Brazil said the U.S. had crossed an \u201cunacceptable line,\u201d warning the attack set an \u201cextremely dangerous precedent for the international community.\u201d Other democratic leaders in the region, including Colombia\u2019s Gustavo Petro, Mexico\u2019s Claudia Sheinbaum and Chile\u2019s Gabriel Boric, joined in denouncing the U.S. intervention.",
      "Legal experts also questioned the operation\u2019s legality.",
      "The use of military force to remove Venezuela\u2019s president is effectively a \u201ckidnapping\u201d and violates core principles of the United Nations Charter, said Mary Ellen O\u2019Connell, a professor at Notre Dame Law School.",
      "\u201cIf you detain someone unlawfully, if you take someone into your custody and you do not have the legal right to do that, then what else would you call it?\u201d she told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThe U.N. Charter makes it very clear that there are very few times when a country has the right to carry out military force on the territory of another country,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd it never has the right to do that in order to bring an individual out to stand trial before their courts.\u201d",
      "Many European allies struck a careful balance, nodding to international law but without dissent in an effort to avoid upsetting the U.S.",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his country would \u201cshed no tears\u201d about the end of Maduro\u2019s regime before reiterating his \u201csupport for international law,\u201d without saying what that support entails.",
      "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz called the operation \u201ccomplex,\u201d and said his country \u201cwill take our time,\u201d to evaluate it, while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she supported a peaceful and democratic transition of power, and that \u201cany solution must respect international law and the U.N. Charter.\u201d",
      "French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot said the military operation in Venezuela \u201ccontravenes the principle of non-use of force, which underpins international law,\u201d while Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said it violated international law.",
      "But as reactions to the Venezuela strike fell largely along predictable lines, the precedent it sets has left others wondering how vulnerable they might be, said H.A. Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a defense and security think tank in London.",
      "\u201cEuropean countries were counting on the U.S. and certain types of U.S. behavior that perhaps they can\u2019t do anymore,\u201d he said, noting that Denmark had been careful in its response because \u201cthey know that Greenland is in the firing line.\u201d",
      "Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of buying or taking Greenland, treating the Danish territory as a strategic asset for the U.S. in the Arctic.",
      "Denmark\u2019s ambassador to Washington, Jesper M\u00f8ller S\u00f8rensen, on Saturday shared what he said was a \u201cfriendly reminder\u201d on X that \u201cwe expect full respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark,\u201d pushing back at Trump-aligned figures who had raised the issue in the wake of the Venezuela strike.",
      "Many of the reactions to the Venezuela strike, Hellyer noted, \u201chave very little to do with Maduro and have everything to do with, you know, lining up with the U.S. on a particular issue.\u201d Europe, he said, was \u201cexpressing support for international law, but without wanting to be identified as opposing the U.S.,\u201d raising the question: \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of invoking a system that isn\u2019t backed by the strongest power in the world?\u201d",
      "But recent history shows that even as the rules-based order struggles, the U.S. has frequently acted unilaterally, with the Venezuela strike reflecting enduring patterns of intervention in Latin America, according to retired Col. Gregory A. Daddis.",
      "\u201cIn many ways, U.S. actions in Venezuela follow a long history of American interventionism in the Western Hemisphere,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere we have argued that the Western Hemisphere, in its entirety, falls within our jurisdiction to protect U.S. interests.\u201d"

      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been here eight years, eight years already,\u201d Yajaira said, referring to how long she\u2019s been in the U.S. \u201cThey killed my older brother. It was so tough. They kidnapped my brothers. That was tough. I thank God for all of this because it\u2019s been tough,\u201d she said, her voice breaking as she looked up at the sky.",
      "Throughout the morning, the growing crowds in Doral were chanting in Spanish, \u201cThe government is over, the government has fallen,\u201d amid the blasting car horns and music.",
      "Venezuelans started coming to Florida and the U.S. in large numbers in the early 2000s after socialist Hugo Ch\u00e1vez rose to power. The situation deteriorated drastically when Maduro took over in 2013. Under Maduro, the country\u2019s oil-driven economy has faced a decadelong collapse and an estimated 80% of residents live in poverty. Around 8 million Venezuelans have fled under his rule.",
      "President Donald Trump said the U.S. is \u201cgoing to run\u201d Venezuela following Maduro\u2019s capture \u201cuntil such time as a safe, proper and judicious transition can take place.\u201d He said Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez has been sworn is as president; she has called for Maduro\u2019s release.",
      "Diana Monert, also celebrating in Doral, was asked what the recent events mean for Venezuelans. \u201cFreedom,\u201d she said.",
      "The relief and jubilation stretched across other parts of the country. In Cincinnati, Rossaly Nava, 43, a property manager, said, \u201cMy heart is racing \u2014 this is the biggest miracle that has happened in my lifetime. ... I have spent so many hours awake and I really want to contribute to recovering my country.\u201d",

      "\"This is epic,\" she said. \"We are very happy for this.\"",
      "Another woman, a Venezuelan migrant who relocated to Colombia when she was 18, said she was shocked by the news.",
      "\"People who claim the United States shouldn\u2019t have done that because it\u2019s about sovereignty, but it turns out that Venezuela hasn\u2019t had sovereignty for over 20 years because we don\u2019t have control of our oil, we don\u2019t have control of our natural resources, and we\u2019ve been robbed for many, many years,\" she said in Spanish.",
      "\"Without sovereignty, we have nothing to protect us because the government is itself,\" she said.",
      "Questions over what happens next",
      "Amid the relief among some Venezuelan Americans that Maduro was no longer in power, there were questions and concerns about what happens next, with several noting that other top officials in Venezuela had not been captured.",
      "A young man celebrating in front of El Arepazo who did not want to give his name because he was worried about his family in Venezuela said it was \u201cthe biggest day we were waiting for. ... I\u2019m really happy. We were waiting for the end of that dictatorship.\u201d",
      "When asked how his family in Venezuela was doing, he said, \u201cThey\u2019re excited, but at the same time they have fear, they\u2019re waiting for what\u2019s going to happen \u2014 what\u2019s going to be the next step.\u201d",
      "Patricia Andrade, who helps newly arrived migrants through her Miami nonprofit Raices Venezolanas, said she has mixed feelings.",
      "\u201cI spent years waiting for the Chavez-Maduro regime to fall,\u201d she said.",
      "While it has given her great happiness to see Maduro in U.S. custody, there are still many more Venezuelan officials to be arrested, she said.",

      "Ferro added that she hopes \u201cTrump understands Venezuelans here in the U.S. also fled and need protection. It\u2019s no time for more attacks and persecution of Venezuelan immigrants. Those people fled a dictatorship and they\u2019re not Tren de Aragua.\u201d",
      "Ferro noted more than 6 in 10 Venezuelans in the U.S. came through temporary protected status, which the Trump administration has rescinded. She also urged Trump to recognize that there\u2019s a need for bipartisan support for Venezuelans. \u201cWhat we need is support in this critical moment,\u201d she said.",
      "'Something was coming'",
      "In Venezuela, a resident who didn\u2019t want to be named for their own safety said, \u201cWe had different tips that something was coming, Trump had already announced something,\u201d adding the events reminded them of the late writer Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s novel \u201cChronicle of a Death Foretold.\u201d",
      "Speaking hours after the attack, the Venezuelan resident said \u201cnobody is in support of the invasion, the violence, but we aren\u2019t also in support of the people who didn\u2019t win the election,\u201d referring to Maduro, who remained in power despite credible evidence that his opponent won the 2024 election.",
      "\u201cWe are humble citizens \u2014 we\u2019re caught. How is it possible that they took they took the president and his wife? Was it someone who betrayed him? There is so much uncertainty and so much fear,\u201d the resident said. \u201cI\u2019m very impressed that they just took him.\u201d",
      "Yanire Lucas, a Caracas resident, told The Associated Press she was scared to even leave the house. \u201cWhat is happening is unprecedented,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cWe\u2019re still on edge, and now we\u2019re uncertain about what to do. Stay safe at home, go out to look for food? I don\u2019t know.\u201d",

      "\"On our third date, we went out to dinner downtown, and Chris didn\u2019t get down on a knee, but he said, 'I want to marry you,'\" she told Willie Geist.",
      "\"I said, 'You do?' He said, 'Yes.' He goes, 'I\u2019m going to spend the rest of my life with you.' And I said, 'I\u2019m going to spend the rest of my life with you. We\u2019re getting married!' I said, 'Let\u2019s do it!'\" she recalled.",
      "The author of \"The Let Them Theory\" said her husband didn't waste any time after that.",
      "\"When Chris finally had the ring, he just all of a sudden was like, 'What am I waiting for?'\" she said.",
      "However, getting the ring wasn't easy. Mel Robbins said that Christopher Robbins ran into a little issue once he tried to get her a \"little diamond eternity band\" from a place inside the Empire State Building. Upon checking out, she said he realized that his credit card wasn't working, so he had to ask his brother for money.",
      "Then, there was the challenge of getting in touch with her father to ask for her hand.",
      "\"He can\u2019t reach my dad,\" Mel Robbins said with a laugh. \"And so he leaves a message on the home answering machine.\"",
      "\"Oh my gosh,\" Willie responded.",
      "\u201c'Bob, I hope you don\u2019t mind, but I\u2019m going to ask Mel. I have to do it. I don\u2019t know why,'\" she said, imitating the awkward message.",
      "Once the ring was secured, Mel Robbins said her husband surprised her with a sweet proposal on the roof.",
      "\"I\u2019m sitting here inside. It\u2019s just, like, a random Wednesday. And he walks in, and he said, 'I just got a call from the landlord and there\u2019s something on the roof,'\" she recalled. \"And I\u2019m like, 'OK,' but he said, 'There\u2019s something we\u2019re supposed to go up and look at.' And I\u2019m like, 'Why do I have to?'\"",
      "But once they got to the roof, she was shocked by what her then-future husband did next.",
      "\"He gets down on this disgusting tar, dirty, pigeon-pooped roof and I\u2019m looking around like, 'Why are we up here?' And I\u2019m like, 'What are you doing?' And he\u2019s like, 'Will you marry me?'\" she said. \"And I\u2019m like, 'I thought we were \u2014 Yes!'\"",
      "\"And he had a ring. And that was that,\" she added.",
      "The couple ended up getting married in 1996 in Michigan. They share their three kids, Sawyer, 26, Kendall, 25, and Oakley, 20, together.",
      "Mel Robbins posted a tribute to her husband for their 29th anniversary in August 2025 and shared what they've learned since getting married.",
      "One of her lessons came directly from the theory that sparked her viral hit book: Let them.",
      "\"Stop trying to change people and learn how to love them as they are,\" she said. \"Most fights, resentment and frustration comes from wishing people were different. The more you let people be themselves, the better your relationships will be.\""

      "\u201cIt\u2019s very fresh and very new, but yes, it will answer some of the loose threads that are remaining,\u201d he added.",

      "\u201cI like the creative part. I like making it,\u201d he said.",
      "'Stranger Things' Already Have a Spinoff \u2014\u00a0Kind Of",

      "It first opened in London\u2019s West End in December 2023, before making its way to Broadway on April 22, 2025. The play tells the origin story of how Henry Creel became Vecna.",
      "The play begins with a high school Henry, who meets high school age Joyce, Hopper and Bob Newby. Henry also strikes up a romance with Bob\u2019s sister, Patty.",
      "However, after an incident in a cave (yes, the one from Season 5), he goes into another dimension. Known as the Black Void, a young Henry faces Demogorgons and the Mind Flayer.",
      "As viewers know, Henry develops telekinetic abilities that intrigue Dr. Brenner. Henry goes on to become the doctor\u2019s test subject One, compared to Millie Bobby Brown\u2019s Eleven.",
      "The Duffer brothers previously told TODAY.com that fans didn\u2019t need to watch the play to understand Vecna/Henry. Matt Duffer noted that Season 5, Vol. 2 explained \u201chalf of Henry\u2019s core memory\u201d that he had been \u201ctrying to hide from, where he discovered the scientist in the cave when he was a child.\u201d",
      "People would then see the second half of that memory in the finale.",
      "\u201cThe play is really about what occurs after that. So in a way, the play is a sequel to that moment,\u201d Matt Duffer said, with Ross Duffer adding, \u201cSo it\u2019s really about Henry and his connection to the Mind Flayer. But again, the goal of it was that it would work as a standalone story, but also works as a companion piece in a way.\u201d"

      "\"Marty Supreme\" co-writer and director Josh Safdie told the Hollywood Reporter the movie is an \"homage\" to table tennis pro Reisman rather than a biography.",
      "In the movie, Chalamet's character is a New York City shoe salesman in the 1950s whose flashy skills with a ping-pong paddle \u2014 and his sheer bravado \u2014 take the small and gritty table tennis world by storm.",

      "The real-life Marty Reisman, whose slim physique earned him the nickname \"The Needle,\" was known for his swaggering style and for bringing a bit of razzle-dazzle to an often, at least at the time, overlooked sport.",

      "Read on to learn more about Marty Reisman, the real-life man who inspired \"Marty Supreme.\"",
      "Marty Reisman Was a Superstar Table Tennis Player",
      "Reisman was born in February 1930 in New York City, according to his 1974 memoir, \"The Money Player: The Confessions of America's Greatest Table Tennis Champion and Hustler.\"",
      "\"I was a cocky gregarious kid, a bit of a showman and a showoff even then,\" he wrote in his memoir \u2014 qualities he'd have the rest of his life.",
      "His bold personality and undeniably athletic skills helped him to become a legend in the table tennis world. In his biography, he talks about his love for gambling and betting \u2014 on himself.",
      "He won his first championship in 1946, becoming the United States Junior National Champion, a feat he repeated the next year.  He went on to win multiple others, including a United States Doubles Championship in 1949 and a Singles Championship in 1958.",
      "In 1997, when he was 67, he became the oldest person to win a national championship in a racket sport, per his obituary.",
      "He Started Playing the Game As a Child to Deal with Anxiety",

      "\u201cI had a nervous breakdown when I was 9 years old and ended up in Bellevue Hospital. Ping-Pong was the ultimate escape. My racket became a sensuous connection between the ball and my brain,\" he told Forbes for an interview published in 2005.",
      "By 13, Reisman had become a city junior champion, often hustling other players for money at Lawrence\u2019s Broadway Table Tennis Club in New York City, reported Forbes. When he was 16, he did a tour of England with a three-man exhibition team, wowing audiences with their paddle skills.",
      "As \"Marty Supreme\" depicts, Reisman worked briefly as a shoe salesman, his only foray into the 9-5 world. For the rest of his life, he relied on his ping-pong skills to make money, he told Forbes.",
      "\"No one has ever been less suited for regular employment than I was,\" he quipped.",
      "He Was Famous for Performing Flashy Tricks",
      "After Reisman learned audiences would pay to see him do tricks while playing ping-pong, he began appearing in special exhibitions.",
      "He and U.S. teammate Doug Cartland accepted an offer to be the opening act for three years for the basketball trickster the Harlem Globetrotters, delighting audiences by playing \u201cMary Had a Little Lamb\u201d using frying pans, according to his biography.",
      "Reisman's signature trick, which he showed off during a visit to \"The Late Night Show with David Letterman\" in 2008, was snapping a cigarette in half with a slam.",
      "\"No other player was willing to try it before a large audience. It can be embarrassing to miss four or five times in a row. It is impossible to explain the shot. It involves a communion between the racket, the ball, and the cigarette, and takes a great deal of confidence,\" he wrote in his memoir.",
      "He Was Obsessed with Being the Best at His Sport",
      "Reisman's goal was to be the best ping-pong player in the world. He talked about his passion for the sport in in his memoir.",
      "His earnings were enough to make him a three-time millionaire, fortunes he repeatedly lost, according to The New York Times.",
      "\u201cI took on people in the gladiatorial spirit,\u201d he told the Times in March 2012, just months before his death.",
      "He Was As Impish As Chalamet's Character",
      "Like Chalamet's character in \"Marty Supreme,\" Reisman was also a the bad boy of his sport.",
      "In 1949, Reisman traveled to the English Open where he and fellow American player Dick Miles traded their modest London hotel for swankier accommodations. The pair ran up a tab on room service and other luxuries, charging it all to the English Table Tennis Association, according to his memoir.",
      "When the English officials balked, refusing to pay the bill, Reisman and Miles said they wouldn't participate in their sold-out exhibition matches.",
      "The English officials ended up covering the costs but fined the men $200 and suspended them from sanctioned table tennis worldwide. Reisman wrote the sanction was lifted in 1950.",
      "Reisman Died in 2012",
      "Reisman died in December 2012 of complications of heart and lung ailments at the age of 82, according to The New York Times.",

    "story": [
      "New year, new literary adventures.",
      "Authors Isaac Fitzgerald and Adriana Trigiani stopped by TODAY on the last day of 2025 to talk through the books they're looking forward to in the coming year.",
      "Their picks include two different WWII-set novels, a tale of a spontaneous road trip and a children's book written by a rising star in music.",
      "Keep an eye on these books and set your new year off in literary style.",
      "Isaac Fitzgerald's picks",
      "\"The Rest of Our Lives\" by Ben Markovits",
      "Isaac says: \"'The Rest of Our Lives' is a brilliantly humane and wildly absorbing story. Benjamin Markovits\u2019s magnetic prose feels both effortless and precise, as we follow Tom Layward who \u2014 after dropping his daughter off at college \u2014 just keeps driving. Here is a book that will find its home amongst the other great American road trip novels. An absolute triumph.\"",
      "\"On Morrison\" by Namwali Serpell",
      "Isaac says: \"'On Morrison' is a dazzling work of criticism. Namwali Serpell uses intellectual rigor alongside inventive flair to tackle Toni Morrison\u2019s writing in ways that feel both fresh and deeply expanding. This book is an illuminating guide to understanding how best to read, understand, and admire one of American literature\u2019s greatest voices.\"",
      "\"Lost Lambs\" by Madeline Cash",
      "Isaac says: \"'Lost Lambs' is an incredibly tender \u2014 yet also hilarious \u2014 debut. Madeline Cash explores adolescence, faith, family, and power through the lens of a tightly controlled religious community, where devotion and vulnerability exist side by side. With wildly inventive writing, Lost Lambs captures moral uncertainty and emotional awakening with remarkable precision. This novel marks the emergence of an incredible new talent in Madeline Cash.\"",
      "\"Mei Mei The Bunny\" by Laufey",
      "Isaac says: \"'Mei Mei the Bunny' is a gentle, charming children\u2019s book about a shy but curious bunny learning how to be brave, kind, and true to herself. Alongside beautiful illustrations by Lauren O\u2019Hara, Laufey\u2019s tender story offers a comforting message about growth, empathy, and finding joy in small moments. A great read aloud to return to again and again with the young ones in your life.\"",
      "Adriana Trigiani's picks",
      "\"Skylark\" by Paula McLain",
      "Adriana says: \"Paula McLain returns to Paris in this page-turning tale that goes between Alouette Voland\u2019s quest for artistic freedom in 1664 and Dr. Kristof Larson\u2019s dangerous mission during German occupation in 1939. Paula is one of our great American novelists, and 'Skylark' might be her best yet.\"",
      "\"Work in Progress\" by James Martin, SJ",
      "Adriana says: \"In Father James Martin\u2019s forthcoming memoir, 'Work in Progress,' we really get to know the beloved priest and his journey to becoming a leader in the Catholic Church. This is a coming-of-age story perfect for all readers of all faiths: relatable, readable, and full of wisdom.\"",
      "\"Keeper of Lost Children\" by Sadeqa Johnson",
      "Adriana says: \"Sadeqa Johnson is the master of historical fiction and 'Keeper of the Lost Children' does not disappoint. Set in post-WWII Germany, this novel visits an orphanage filled with the abandoned mixed-race children of German women and Black American GI\u2019s. This is an unknown history about love, resilience and identity.\"",
      "\"One Whole Hippopotamus\" by Carter Higgins",
      "Adriana says: \"'One Whole Hippopotamus' is an adorable introduction to early learning for our smallest readers. Acclaimed author Carter Higgins gives us an interactive and vibrant book perfect for teachers, librarians and parents to share with their little ones.\""

      "Trump and his team have for months said they want to take over the vast semi-autonomous Danish territory, citing its strategic importance and mineral wealth. After Maduro\u2019s capture, he doubled down on the idea, telling reporters aboard Air Force One late Sunday, \u201cWe need Greenland, from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it, I can tell you.\u201d",
      "He mocked local efforts to defend the sparsely populated island, saying \u201cthey added one more dog sled\u201d that would be no match for the \u201cRussian and Chinese ships\u201d he claimed were \u201call over the place\u201d around the territory.",

      "BEIJING \u2014 An attack on a country after a military buildup and embargo at sea. A leader deposed by a superpower that views them as illegitimate.",
      "While some are drawing parallels between the United States\u2019 dramatic action in Venezuela and China\u2019s ambitions for Taiwan, experts say Beijing is less concerned about the self-ruled island\u2019s sovereignty and instead views the attack as an opportunity to undermine America\u2019s global leadership.",
      "As the Trump administration withdraws from global institutions and upends long-standing norms, Beijing has sought to cast itself as the true champion of the rules-based international order. Chinese state media commentaries on the Venezuela attack argue that the U.S. is now one of the biggest threats to that order, and that its actions have undermined its credibility in Latin America.",
      "\u201cThis is a country which just behaved like a hegemon, right?\u201d said Wu Xinbo, dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. \u201cHow can you trust a country that would deal with its weak neighbors this way?\u201d",
      "China has strongly condemned the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, saying it violated international law and threatens peace and security in Latin America. It said the U.S. should immediately release Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who are set to appear Monday in a New York court on drug trafficking and other charges.",
      "On Monday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping appeared to refer to the  attack on one of his country\u2019s main South American allies, saying the world was experiencing turbulence and that \u201cunilateral bullying seriously impacts the international order.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll countries should respect the development path independently chosen by other peoples, abide by international law and the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, and major countries should take the lead,\u201d he said during a meeting in Beijing with Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin, without mentioning the U.S. by name.",
      "His comments came a day after Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said no country \u201ccan play the role of world policeman, nor do we agree that any country can claim itself to be an international judge.\u201d",
      "China has long served as an economic lifeline for the heavily sanctioned Venezuela, accounting for the majority of its crude oil exports. It has expressed support for Venezuela in recent months amid President Donald Trump\u2019s military buildup, though it has no security commitments to the country and experts say it has avoided more concrete action in part to preserve the U.S.-China trade truce.",
      "Maduro was seized hours after he met in Caracas with Qiu Xiaoqi, Beijing\u2019s special envoy for Latin American affairs, in his last publicly reported official meeting.",
      "It is unclear whether Qiu and the rest of his delegation are still in Venezuela. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Monday that there were \u201cno reports of Chinese personnel in Venezuela being affected by U.S. airstrikes.\u201d",
      "In a caption accompanying photos and videos posted on his Instagram account, Maduro described the meeting as \u201ca fraternal encounter that reaffirms the strong ties of brotherhood and friendship between China and Venezuela.\u201d",
      "China, which is already South America\u2019s top trading partner, is seeking to expand its influence in the region, even as Trump has put it at the center of his national security agenda. Though Beijing has emphasized economic ties and nonintervention in its approach to Latin America, there was a greater focus on military and law enforcement cooperation in the policy paper it released last month.",
      "\u201cAll the countries in the region have more or less healthy relations with China,\u201d said B\u00e1rbara Fern\u00e1ndez Melleda, an assistant professor of Latin American studies at the University of Hong Kong. \u201cAnd if the United States becomes hostile against China through Latin American countries, that\u2019s a new scenario.\u201d",
      "The U.S. attack on Venezuela, where Chinese companies have invested billions, has raised alarm in China, Wu said.",
      "Latin American countries may feel pressured \u201cto be more cautious in dealing with China on the economic front in the future,\u201d he told NBC News in an interview. \u201cAnd also for the Chinese business community, they see not just uncertainty but rising risk from this region.\u201d",
      "'Two different issues'",
      "The U.S. attack on Venezuela has also raised fears that it could embolden China to move against Taiwan, the self-ruling island democracy that Beijing claims as its territory and has vowed to bring under its control, by force if necessary.",
      "And for some users on China\u2019s heavily censored social media, Trump\u2019s assertion that the U.S. was \u201cin charge\u201d after Maduro was captured was a source of inspiration.",
      "\u201cThe arrest of the Venezuelan president set a good example for us. Taiwan\u2019s William Lai must be trembling in fear now!\u201d read one comment on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, referring to Lai Ching-te, the president of Taiwan.",
      "But Venezuela and Taiwan are \u201ctwo different issues,\u201d according to Wu at Fudan University. \u201cVenezuela is an independent sovereign state, and Taiwan is part of China,\u201d he said, adding that China prefers \u201ca peaceful solution to the Taiwan issue.\u201d",
      "The events in Venezuela will not \u201cdramatically alter Beijing\u2019s calculus on Taiwan,\u201d said Ryan Hass, director of Brookings\u2019 John L. Thornton China Center, adding that China will focus on protecting its interests in Latin America.",
      "\u201cPrivately,\u201d he said on X, \u201cI expect Beijing will emphasize to Washington it expects to be given the same latitude for great power exemptions to international law that the U.S. takes for itself\u201d \u2014 particularly in the South China Sea, a strategically vital shipping route that China claims virtually in its entirety.",

      "The Taiwanese government has yet to comment publicly on Maduro\u2019s capture.",
      "The island has been under growing pressure from Beijing, which encircled it last week in a large-scale military exercise that simulated a blockade. The live-fire drills followed the announcement of an $11.1 billion arms package for Taiwan by the U.S., the island\u2019s biggest weapons supplier.",
      "The U.S. strike in Venezuela could slow down China\u2019s timetable for an attack on Taiwan, \u201cbut may give ammunition to U.S. skeptics\u201d on the island who worry that Washington won\u2019t come to its defense, said Wen-Ti Sung, a nonresident fellow with the Atlantic Council\u2019s Global China Hub who is based in Taiwan's capital, Taipei.",
      "The U.S. military\u2019s ability to carry out a Maduro-style \u201cdecapitation strike,\u201d especially against Venezuela\u2019s largely Chinese defense systems, could make Beijing think twice about testing its military against Washington\u2019s, Sung said via a messaging app.",
      "But the strike also reinforces the view that the U.S. is \u201cpreoccupied with the Western Hemisphere, and skeptics will wonder in whose sphere of influence Taiwan falls within this Monroe Doctrine 2.0,\u201d he said, referring to Trump\u2019s twist on the 19th-century U.S. foreign policy.",
      "Others say China has refrained from attacking Taiwan not because it lacks global permission, but because it is simply not ready.",
      "\u201cChina has never lacked hostile intent toward Taiwan; what it truly lacks is the ability to carry it out,\u201d Wang Ting-yu, a senior lawmaker from Taiwan\u2019s governing Democratic Progressive Party, said Sunday in a post on Facebook.",
      "\u201cChina is not the United States, and Taiwan is certainly not Venezuela. If China could really do it, it would have acted long ago!\u201d",

In September, the Trump administration began sinking boats in the Caribbean that it alleged were sending drugs to the U.S. Experts said, however, that the boats were shipping cocaine to Europe. All told, the administration has struck at least 35 alleged drug vessels so far, killing 114 people.",
      "The rationale for the boat strikes shifted over time. Was it drugs Trump wanted to destroy, or the Maduro regime? In an interview she gave Vanity Fair in November, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said the purpose was to attack the boats until Maduro \u201ccries uncle.\u201d",
      "She also said in the interview that an attack on the Venezuela mainland would require congressional approval \u2014 something the White House hasn\u2019t gotten.",
      "\u201cIf he were to authorize some activity on land, then it\u2019s war, then [we\u2019d need] Congress,\u201d Wiles told the author, Chris Whipple.",
      "The same month, America\u2019s most advanced aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, swept into the Caribbean, part of a military buildup that Trump believed got the attention of Maduro.",
      "\u201cA lot of ships out there,\u201d Trump said at the news conference.",
      "Trump left the White House for the holidays on Dec. 19, with Mar-a-Lago serving as his headquarters for the final planning. He approved the operation before Christmas, though the exact day was uncertain, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the planning.",
      "Venezuela wasn\u2019t his only worry. On Christmas Day, he announced he had ordered strikes on militants in Nigeria in response to alleged persecution of Christians.",
      "At a New Year\u2019s Eve party at his home, dressed in a tuxedo with first lady Melania Trump at his side, Trump was asked by reporters about his resolution for 2026.",
      "\u201cPeace on Earth,\u201d he said.",
      "So secret was the Venezuela assault that even the precise timing wasn\u2019t widely known at the Pentagon until Friday night, two U.S. officials told NBC News. Typically, the timing of such a military operation would have wider coordination.",
      "Vice President JD Vance went to Trump\u2019s golf club in West Palm Beach and met with him during the day Friday to discuss the strikes. But he left before the attack started, in deference to concerns that a late-night motorcade movement might tip off the Venezuelans about the coming raid, a Vance spokesperson said.",
      "Wind and cloud cover in Caracas had delayed the attack for days, but Friday, the weather broke. The moon was full, and the skies had mostly cleared \u2014 acceptable conditions for the pilots and crews.",
      "The mission was on.",
      "\u201cGood luck and Godspeed,\u201d Trump told military leaders, words they transmitted down the chain, Caine said.",
      "Trump spent much of the night and early morning at his home watching the attack play out. A picture released by the White House shows him sitting at a table, fingers interlocked, wearing a jacket but not his customary tie, staring intently at what presumably was a video screen out of the frame. Standing to his left is Rubio; to his right, Ratcliffe. Miller is seated, arms crossed. Congress wouldn\u2019t be notified until the attack was underway. Trump said Saturday he didn\u2019t want lawmakers to leak details.",
      "At least 150 aircraft flew toward Caracas from 20 different bases on land and sea. The fleet included bombers, fighters and craft that specialized in intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance, Caine said. The crews ranged in age from 20 to 49.",
      "Darkness cloaked the Venezuelan capital. Trump suggested that the U.S. had cut the electricity in Caracas to gain an edge in the battle. Flying at 100 feet above the water, helicopters carried the special forces and law enforcement officials who plucked Maduro from his residence, Caine said. Other aircraft fired weapons to disable Venezuela\u2019s air defense systems and clear a path for the helicopters, he added.",
      "Flames were seen billowing from explosions at Fort Tiuna, a large military complex in Caracas.",
      "By 1 a.m. ET Saturday, U.S. soldiers had reached the compound in Caracas where Maduro was staying. \u201cA heavily fortified military fortress,\u201d Trump called it.",
      "When Delta Force breached Maduro\u2019s residence, he and his wife were taken \u201ccompletely by surprise,\u201d Caine said. Maduro tried to escape into what Trump described as a steel safe room but didn\u2019t make it in time. The forces took Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, into custody.",
      "A firefight broke out after Maduro was captured, Caine said, and a U.S. helicopter was hit. No Americans were killed, though there were several injuries to U.S. troops, all of whom are stable, according to a U.S. official and a White House official.",
      "By 3:30 a.m. ET, U.S. forces were safely out of the country, Caine said. At that time, the air in Caracas smelled of gunpowder and smoke. The U.S. Embassy in Venezuela cautioned American citizens there to shelter in place.",
      "Less than an hour later, Trump broke the news to the world on social media.",
      "\u201cThe United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country,\u201d he wrote.",
      "A picture the White House posted Saturday morning showed Maduro aboard the USS Iwo Jima assault ship in a sweatsuit, handcuffed and blindfolded.",
      "By 4:30 p.m. ET, Maduro was in New York. He arrived at Stewart Airport in New Windsor north of New York City. Dozens of law enforcement officers flanked Maduro as he shuffled to the hangar. He and his wife were to be transported to a jail in New York City later in the day. On Monday, Maduro is expected to make his first court appearance.",
      "He and his alleged co-conspirators face prosecution for a scheme in which a \u201ccycle of narcotics-based corruption lines the pockets of Venezuelan officials and their families while also benefiting violent narco-terrorists who operate with impunity on Venezuelan soil and who help produce, protect, and transport tons of cocaine to the United States,\" the indictment alleges.",
      "Following the strike, Trump made it clear that \u201cOperation Absolute Resolve\u201d wasn\u2019t a one-off. Nor was it solely about apprehending someone the U.S. considers a fugitive. The military campaign amounts to a dramatic escalation of presidential authority, with Trump attempting to mold the hemisphere to a revised version of \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy.",
      "In a twist on the 19th century Monroe Doctrine, which asserted a distinct sphere of influence for the young American nation, Trump is demonstrating that he\u2019ll use hard power to promote U.S. interests and create advantageous conditions for business.",
      "\u201cThe Donroe Doctrine,\u201d Trump called it.",
      "The U.S. isn\u2019t leaving Venezuela soon, he said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to run it essentially until such time as a proper transition can take place.\u201d",
      "Looking back at his fateful phone call with Maduro, Trump suggested at the news conference that Maduro had chosen poorly in not heeding his command.",
      "\u201cNow,\u201d Trump said, \u201che wished he did.\u201d"

      "Mehari said a thick smoke enveloped the venue and the crowd, blinding him. He fell to the ground as people rushed to escape the bar, he said, but a man pulled him away to safety.",
      "His friends were not so lucky, he says. \u201cI have four friends who died,\u201d he said, still struggling to process the loss. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s not real.\u201d",
      "Mehari, who has lived in the area for 15 years, said he saw someone he knew from school disfigured and burning, and others whose hair and clothes had burned off.",
      "\u201cSomebody was dying in front of me and I couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he said. \u201cHer face was so burned it was red.\u201d",

      "Mehari was among survivors taken to a hospital ward in Sion, where he was offered mental health assistance. \u201cI tried to sleep, but I can\u2019t,\u201d he said.",
      "Mehari\u2019s was among the harrowing witness accounts emerging Friday as investigators searched for answers. At least 40 people are dead and 119 injured, officials said, many of them with serious burns that a senior doctor treating them said will require \u201cmonths of rehabilitation\u201d and even have \u201clifelong consequences.\u201d",
      "Axel Clavier, 16, from Paris, told The Associated Press that he lost his jacket, shoes and phone while fleeing, though he was grateful to have made it out. \u201cI am still alive and it\u2019s just stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still in shock.\u201d",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s the small door where everyone was pushing, and so we all fell, we were piled on top of each other, some people were burning, and some were dead next to us,\u201d she told Reuters. \u201cI was so scared \u2014 scared for myself, scared for my friends, scared for everyone inside.\u201d",

      "Eric Bonvin, the general director of the regional hospital in Sion that took in several dozen injured people, said those with severe burns face months of treatment.",
      "The injured were teenagers and young adults, roughly 20 years old on average, he told The Associated Press inside the hospital.",
      "Injured survivors suffered burns to varying degrees, not just to their skin but also to their airways.",
      "\u201cThere were inhalations of both smoke and also of heat that for some probably led to internal burns. That\u2019s a really catastrophic situation, as you can imagine,\u201d Bonvin said.",

Also probably because everyone was asking themselves, \u2018Was my child, my cousin, someone from the region at this party?\u2019 This place was very well known as somewhere to celebrate the new year,\u201d Bonvin said. \u201cAlso, seeing young people arrive \u2014 that\u2019s always traumatic.\u201d",

      "\"The country is a mess. It's been horribly run. The oil is just flowing at a very low level,\" Trump said. \"So we're going to have the big oil companies go in, and they're going to fix the infrastructure. They're going to invest money. We're not going to invest anything. We're going to just take care of the country. We're going to cherish the country. We're going to take care, more importantly, of the people, including Venezuelans.\"",
      "And asked if he had reversed his previous opposition to nation-building, he added, \"We're in the business of having countries around us that are viable and successful, and where the oil is allowed to freely come out, because that's good, it gets the prices down. That's good for our country.\"",
      "He also hinted at the possibility of future strikes, saying the U.S. is \u201cready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to.\u201d",
      "In a Spanish-language statement, Rodr\u00edguez wrote, \"President Donald Trump: Our people and our region deserve peace and dialogue, not war. That has always been President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s position, and it is the position of all of Venezuela at this moment.\"",
      "\"That is the Venezuela I believe in and have dedicated my life to. My dream is for Venezuela to be a great power where all good Venezuelans can come together,\" she added.",

      "Widespread protests have rocked Iran for nearly a week and led to increasing violent clashes with security forces, prompting President Donald Trump to threaten intervention if a crackdown continues.",
      "The protests, which started with economic grievances by shopkeepers in Tehran and quickly spread to remote cities in provinces like Fars and Lorestan, where protesters chanted slogans against the ruling clerics, have raised pointed questions for the country\u2019s leaders about how much support they really enjoy.",
      "Ali Larijani, who serves as the secretary of Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council, alleged Friday without providing evidence that Israel and the U.S. were stoking the escalating demonstrations. And Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf said in a post on X that Trump\u2019s threat of intervention makes U.S. bases in the region \u201clegitimate targets.\u201d",
      "In a post on Truth Social, Trump had said that if Iran \u201cviolently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\u201d He did not specify what this would mean.",
      "Iranian officials attempted to project a united front with ordinary citizens in June, when the Israeli military battered the country in a 12-day war, partly joined by the U.S. military. The war killed more than 1,000 people including top military leaders and nuclear scientists, according to state media, and wreaked havoc on its nuclear facilities.",
      "On Monday, after a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump issued a fresh threat to \u201cknock the hell out of\u201d Iran if the Islamic Republic attempts to rebuild its nuclear program or expand its ballistic missile program.",
      "Saturday\u2019s capture of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who enjoyed a warm relationship with Tehran, has also incensed Iran\u2019s political elites, who have decried the U.S. operation as \u201ca clear example of state terrorism.\u201d But as tensions with the U.S. escalate once again, Iran appears far from having the unity projected last year.",
      "\u201cIranians were facing bombardment by external powers and so they had no choice but to stick together. And I think that we should take that for what it was. Did [Iranians] coming together mean that they suddenly abandoned all of their contentious feelings towards the regime or its leadership? Absolutely not. They\u2019re not mutually exclusive feelings,\u201d Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House, told NBC News in a telephone interview.",
      "\u201cAnd I think that Iranians still feel quite united amidst the many challenges that they face, challenges from abroad, challenges from their governance system and their leadership that isn\u2019t willing to reform or change,\u201d Vakil said,",
      "Even before the joint Israeli and U.S. attack in June, Iran\u2019s economy was in a tailspin, battered by sanctions, rising inflation and the devaluation of the Iranian currency against the U.S. dollar, which led to families struggling hard to make ends meet as the value of their savings plunged, analysts say.",
      "The country\u2019s problems were compounded by a water and energy crisis last year that led to dry taps and electricity blackouts.",
      "President Masoud Pezeshkian has attempted to at least partly shoulder the blame for the country\u2019s woes and even suggested on Monday that the interior minister should meet with leaders among the protesters to address their concerns and try to solve their problems.",
      "\u201cIf the people are dissatisfied, we and you are to blame. Don\u2019t look for America or someone else to blame,\u201d Pezeshkian said on Thursday while visiting officials in the province of Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari in central Iran, according to state media. \u201cWe need to serve properly so the people are satisfied with us.\u201d",
      "The Hengaw Organization for Human Rights, a Norwegian-registered Kurdish watchdog that monitors rights violations across Iran, reported on Thursday that two protesters were killed by security forces in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, perhaps highlighting the limits of Pezeshkian\u2019s powers in dealing with the protests.",
      "\u201cHe is trying to limit, I think, the nature of the anger. He\u2019s trying to say it\u2019s all because of the currency collapse, because of inflation,\u201d Abbas Milani, the director of the Iranian studies program at Stanford University, told NBC News in a telephone interview.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that people see it that way. I think the people see the currency collapse and the inflation as the consequence of the regime\u2019s inherent corruption and incapacity,\u201d Milani said. \u201cThey want the regime changed.\u201d",
      "Hengaw reported the death of 10 people during six days of protests, including one man who was killed by security forces on Friday in Kermanshah province in northwest Iran.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Trump\u2019s threats of intervention will encourage the protesters or lead security forces to hold their fire.",
      "\u201cPeople could feel slightly more confident and emboldened thinking that the United States might actually be more than rhetorically supportive,\u201d said Vakil of Chatham House. \u201cBut I worry that they might be disappointed, not understanding that the United States is very much focused on outcomes and interests that benefit the United States and not really benevolent towards the Iranian people.\u201d",
      "Still, whether the protests expand and continue or are crushed by force like similar protests in 2022 and 2023 \u2014 when approximately 500 people were killed and thousands were arrested \u2014 will largely depend on the will of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in the Islamic Republic, analysts say. He has not spoken publicly about the protests in the past week.",
      "\u201cThey will have a scorched-earth policy,\u201d Milani from Stanford said."

      "Taken together, these responses suggest the revival of old fears of American interventionism, prompting allies and adversaries alike to ponder where Washington might act next.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump is fulfilling his campaign promise to \"demolish foreign drug cartels\" by going after Maduro. She said on X that the operation would \"keep our citizens safe\" in keeping with Trump's \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda.",

      "\u201cIf you detain someone unlawfully, if you take someone into your custody and you do not have the legal right to do that, then what else would you call it?\u201d she told NBC News.",

      "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz called the operation \u201ccomplex,\u201d and said his country \u201cwill take our time,\u201d to evaluate it, while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she supported a peaceful and democratic transition of power, and that \u201cany solution must respect international law and the U.N.

      "Many of the reactions to the Venezuela strike, Hellyer noted, \u201chave very little to do with Maduro and have everything to do with, you know, lining up with the U.S. on a particular issue.\u201d Europe, he said, was \u201cexpressing support for international law, but without wanting to be identified as opposing the U.S.,\u201d raising the question: \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of invoking a system that isn\u2019t backed by the strongest power in the world?\u201d",

      "KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Russia rang in the new year by launching more than 200 drones at Ukraine, while President Vladimir Putin used his year-end address to rally support for his troops and to assure his nation of victory.",
      "In Ukraine itself, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s Dec. 31 address was defiant but also optimistic about the frenetic shuttle diplomacy being brokered by the United States.",
      "Zelenskyy said that Russia, whose officials are also in talks with the Americans, remains the central barrier to peace, with Putin unyielding in his maximalist demands.",
      "\u201cI would give anything in the world if, in this address, I could say that peace will also come in just a few minutes,\u201d Zelenskyy said just before the clock struck midnight. \u201cUnfortunately, I cannot say that yet. But with a clear conscience, I \u2014 all of us \u2014 can say that Ukraine is truly doing everything for peace.\u201d",
      "The Ukrainian leader recently returned from a meeting with President Donald Trump in Florida on Sunday. Afterward, Zelenskyy said Trump had offered 15 years of the crucial \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d that he says are essential to stop Putin from attacking again. Ukraine had asked for 50 years, he said.",
      "Hours before the new year\u2019s bells chimed, Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff posted on X that he had held a call with Zelenskyy, Ukrainian national security secretary Rustem Umerov and the national security advisers of Britain, France and Germany.",

      "\u201cThose are the 10% that will determine the fate of peace, the fate of Ukraine and Europe, how people will live,\u201d he said. \u201cTen percent to save millions of lives. Ten percent of the determination needed for peace to work 100%. Ten percent of the unity and wisdom so desperately needed \u2014 Ukrainian, American, European, from the entire world. Ten percent to peace.\u201d",
      "The Ukrainian leader charted what has been a roller-coaster year trying to retain the goodwill of Trump, a pivotal and changeable figure in the peace process. Zelenskyy said \u201cit was not easy at all to achieve such a change in the tone of relations between Ukraine and the United States\u201d after he clashed with Trump and Vice President JD Vance in an extraordinary White House meeting in February.",
      "Trump has often shifted between appearing to favor Russia and then Ukraine during these negotiations, and has at various points been criticized for freezing Ukraine and Europe out of the process.",
      "\u201cWithout Ukraine, nothing will work. Ukraine has defended its right to have a voice,\u201d Zelenskyy said, adding later: \u201cUkraine is, in fact, the only shield that now separates Europe\u2019s comfortable way of life from the Russian world.\u201d",
      "Hours after Zelenskyy spoke, Russia launched 205 drones \u2014 mostly Iran-designed Shaheds along with some Russian Gerbera drones \u2014 into Ukraine, according to the country\u2019s military. Air defense systems downed 176 of these, but 24 strikes were recorded at 15 locations, it said. There was also shelling right along the line of contact between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "At least two people were killed and more than a dozen injured across the country, according to regional officials.",
      "For its part, Ukraine launched a strike against Russia\u2019s Rosrezerv oil depot in the Yaroslavl region, the Security Service of Ukraine, the SBU, said in a statement. The SBU said this was the latest strike designed to \u201ccut off the supply chains of Russian petroleum products with surgical precision, both abroad and for the troops attacking Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Russia claimed this week that Ukraine had attempted to assassinate Putin with a drone strike on his country residence, something that Ukraine denied and the CIA concluded was not true, a source with knowledge of the matter told NBC News.",
      "In his own New Year\u2019s address, Putin said his country was striving \u201cto bring joy and warmth\u201d to those in need, as well as the \u201cheroes\u201d fighting in Ukraine. \u201cI wish all our soldiers and commanders a happy new year! We believe in you and in our victory,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cThis alleged \u2018residence strike\u2019 story is a complete fabrication intended to justify additional attacks against Ukraine, including Kyiv, as well as Russia\u2019s own refusal to take necessary steps to end the war. Typical Russian lies,\u201d he added.",
      "Earlier, the Russian Ministry of Defense had described it as \u201ca terrorist attack using long-range unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) against the residence of the president of the Russian Federation.\u201d",
      "Since its full-scale invasion by Russia in February 2022, Ukraine has attempted to strike back at oil depots and other facilities it says fuel the Kremlin\u2019s war machine.",
      "While Russia has repeatedly said that it does not strike civilian targets, drones and missiles have regularly struck Ukrainian residential areas and civilian utility sites supplying the population with heat and light."

      "A firsthand account of an explosion along the Venezuelan coast on Dec. 18 is raising questions about who may have been responsible for the attack and whether it was connected to the U.S.\u2019 escalating pressure campaign against the South American country.",
      "The arid coastal strip in the northwest of Venezuela, known as Alta Guajira, is heavily controlled by the National Liberation Army, or Ej\u00e9rcito de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional (ELN) in Spanish, an armed guerilla group known for its history of drug trafficking that is also active in neighboring Colombia.",
      "Two members of Venezuela\u2019s Wayuu indigenous community in the area told NBC News that they witnessed an unexplained explosion on Dec. 18 that destroyed a hut that possibly was used for storage.",
      "President Donald Trump said in an interview with WABC radio in New York last week that the U.S. had \u201cknocked out\u201d a facility tied to Venezuela, a move that would be a major escalation in U.S. military strikes to counter alleged drug-trafficking by the South American country.",
      "NBC News reporting has not established a link between the explosion described by Trump and the explosion described by the eyewitnesses in northwest Venezuela.",
      "The apparent attack follows months of U.S. military pressure, including dozens of strikes on boats in international waters. The White House has claimed that the boats carried drugs, though officials have not provided evidence.",
      "In the short phone interview Friday, Trump responded to a comment about Venezuela by touting the administration\u2019s attacks on alleged drug boats before referring to a strike on a \u201cbig plant or big facility\u201d that he said took place two nights earlier.",
      "Pressed about the attack Monday at a media availability session at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, Trump said it was a \u201cmajor explosion\u201d in a dock area along Venezuela\u2019s shoreline where boats were loaded with drugs.",
      "The CIA has declined to comment on reports that it conducted a drone strike last week at a port facility in Venezuela. The White House has also declined to comment beyond Trump\u2019s remarks on anything related to possible land strikes in Venezuela.",
      "Ana, one of the witnesses who did not want her last name used for fear of reprisals, told NBC News by phone that the explosion she witnessed happened on the afternoon of Dec. 18, a few days after she heard a strange noise that she guessed might be a drone surveilling the area. She said she was fishing for dinner along with relatives when the explosion destroyed the hut.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it,\u201d Ana said, noting that the explosion was so loud that she and her relatives were unable to hear for hours. She suspects that some of her relatives suffered hearing damage and said her family\u2019s boat was destroyed along with their fishing nets.",
      "\u201cWe are humble people who fish to survive,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need help to recover what we lost.\u201d",
      "The other witness, who is also a member of the Wayuu indigenous community and did not want to provide his full name for fear of reprisals, corroborated Ana\u2019s story in a telephone interview.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if it was a missile or a rocket. The truth is, we don\u2019t know what it was,\u201d the second witness said. \u201cBut it was a big explosion.\u201d",
      "According to Ana, representatives from the Venezuelan government showed up the morning after she heard the blast \u2014 around 10 a.m. Dec. 19. She said local residents asked them for help, for a doctor to check on the hearing problems and for new fishing nets and hammocks, which had also been blown up.",
      "Ana said one of government representatives blamed the U.S. and said: \u201cThe gringos did this.\u201d",
      "NBC News asked the Venezuelan government for comment and did not immediately receive a response. It is not clear who was responsible for the Dec. 18 explosion.",
      "\u201cWe are grateful to be alive,\u201d Ana said. \u201cBut we\u2019re scared.\u201d",
      "On Monday, Trump declined to answer when he was asked whether it was the military or the CIA that conducted the strike inside Venezuela that he described last week.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to say that,\u201d he said. \u201cI know exactly who it was, but I don\u2019t want to say who it was. But you know, it was along the shore.\u201d",
      "With details so scarce, Trump\u2019s comments have touched off a wave of speculation inside Venezuela about the U.S.\u2019 target. For days, local news reports and videos on social media have circulated of a explosion last Wednesday in Maracaibo, a major port city.",
      "Primazol, a chemical production company, said one of its warehouses had caught fire. In a statement later, it \u201ccategorically rejected\u201d rumors on social media that the fire was connected to any U.S. strike.",
      "But in a lengthy post on X, Colombia President Gustavo Petro said \u201cTrump bombed a factory in Maracaibo\u201d where it was feared that the ELN was mixing coca paste to make cocaine and take advantage of the port\u2019s location by the sea.",
      "\u201cTrump has been led to believe that I am a front man for Maduro, hence his recent references to me,\u201d Petro wrote, referring to former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. \u201cI thought that American intelligence was more professional, or that even if it is, the U.S. president doesn\u2019t listen to it and surrounds himself with greedy far-right individuals who are not looking for the truth.\u201d"
