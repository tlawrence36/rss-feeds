      "Billy Joel's beloved motorcycle shop on Long Island, New York, is closing down after nearly 15 years of offering fans a free peek at his personal collection of dozens of bikes.",
      "The music icon will be shuttering 20th Century Cycles in Oyster Bay in late September and auctioning off his collection later this year because of a brain disorder he has been diagnosed with, according to a spokesperson, Claire Mercuri.",
      "In May, Joel announced that he was canceling upcoming concerts after learning he has Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus, a fluid buildup in his brain that can affect thinking, concentrating, memory, movement and more, according to the Cleveland Clinic. The 76-year-old singer, composer and pianist was having trouble with his balance but otherwise felt good, he said in an interview last month on Bill Maher's Club Random podcast.",
      "Joel, who grew up in nearby Hicksville, opened 20th Century Cycles in late 2010 as a place to maintain and repair his motorcycles, restore and customize ones he bought and showcase his collection for the public at no charge.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s basically promoting an aesthetic here,\" he said in a 2013 YouTube video filmed at the shop. \"I like older style. I like the automotive style from the \u201830s to the \u201960s. I wanted to collect a whole bunch of those kinds of bikes, put \u2019em in one place and let people see what that era of bike looked like. Because it\u2019s starting to be a lost aesthetic.\u201d",
      "He said he also wanted to bring foot traffic and business to downtown Oyster Bay \u2014 a ritzy waterfront community about 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of midtown Manhattan \u2014 where part of the street that includes 20th Century Cycles was renamed Billy Joel Way in 2023.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been living in this community for a long time,\u201d he said in the video. \u201cI actually grew up not far from here. And I\u2019d like to get a little interest going into the town and the village.\u201d",

      "Joel's nearby home in Centre Island is listed for $29.9 million, and he has been living in South Florida, while keeping a home in Sag Harbor on Long Island.",
      "The shop became a popular stop for motorcycle enthusiasts and tourists. It was home to Joel's collection of more than 75 bikes, dating back all the way to the 1940s and including Harley-Davidsons, Triumphs, Ducatis, Moto Guzzis, Indians and BMWs. One of the most valuable, he said, was a 1952 Vincent Rapide, which can sell for tens of thousands of dollars and sometimes more, according to auction sites.",
      "\u201cI think everybody in Oyster Bay would agree that it\u2019s a big loss,\" said Ted Bahr, who owns a vintage rock poster gallery next to 20th Century Cycles. \u201cBilly\u2019s place is visited on weekends by dozens and dozens of people, typically on motorcycles but also people in cars,. People come up and look at the window all the time. I mean it\u2019s a real destination. Billy Joel is a real superstar, and he is a hometown boy, so it\u2019s really unfortunate.\"",
      "The motorcycles that were in the shop have already been moved out. But it has been open on recent weekends selling new, used and vintage motorcycle parts that were still in stock there.",
      "Joel's enthusiasm for motorcycles dates back decades. In 1982, he was riding a motorcycle on Long Island when he was struck by a car that ran a red light, injuring his left thumb and dislocating his right wrist. He spent about a month in the hospital. He has also ridden motorcycles in various benefits for 9/11 first responders, breast cancer and other causes over the years.",
      "A date for the auction of his collection has not been set.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Harvey Weinstein faces sentencing and a possible retrial in his New York City sex crimes case, but when they\u2019ll happen \u2014 and whether he\u2019ll be back in front of another jury \u2014 is still up in the air.",
      "Manhattan Judge Curtis Farber said Wednesday he could sentence Weinstein on Sept. 30 \u2014 but only if there\u2019s no retrial on a rape charge that the last jury failed to reach a verdict on.",
      "Weinstein, 73, was convicted in June of forcing oral sex on TV and movie production assistant and producer Miriam Haley in 2006. The charge carries a possible sentence of up to 25 years in prison.",
      "At the same time, the jury acquitted him of forcing oral sex on another woman, one-time model Kaja Sokola, but couldn\u2019t decide a charge that he raped hairstylist and actor Jessica Mann in 2013.",
      "Manhattan prosecutors told Farber that they\u2019re ready to take Weinstein to trial for a third time on the rape charge, which is punishable by up to four years in prison. That\u2019s less time than Weinstein has already served.",
      "Mann is on board to testify again, they said.",
      "Prosecutors requested a January trial date, citing witness availability and their own caseload. Farber balked at that, saying a January date is too far away and conflicts with another, unrelated trial he\u2019s already scheduled. He proposed having the trial in the fall.",
      "\u201cThe case needs to be tried this year,\u201d Farber said.",
      "Weinstein lawyer Arthur Aidala agreed, telling Farber he\u2019d prefer a trial at \u201cthe earliest the court can accommodate us.\u201d",
      "Assistant District Attorney Nicole Blumberg said she would ask Mann and other witnesses about their availability for a trial in the fall.",
      "If a fall trial happens, it would likely put Weinstein\u2019s high-profile #MeToo case back in court as Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is in the final throes of his reelection bid.",

The \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d and \u201cShakespeare in Love\u201d producer is committed to fighting the rape charge at another trial, Aidala said, though the lawyer didn\u2019t rule out the possibility of reaching a deal with prosecutors to end the case.",

      "This spring, a new jury convicted him again of sexually assaulting Haley and acquitted him of doing the same to another woman who wasn\u2019t part of the first trial. But amid fractious deliberations, the majority-female jury got stuck on the charge related to Mann.",

She said he persevered with advances and demands until she \u201cjust gave up.\u201d",

She did not disclose the amount.",
      "In recent years, Swift has been rerecording and releasing her first six albums in an attempt to regain control of her music. The project was instigated by Hybe America CEO Scooter Braun\u2019s purchase and sale of her early catalog and represents Swift\u2019s effort to control her own songs and how they\u2019re used.

      "In a month that\u2019s long been known to let edgier movies thrive, Zach Cregger\u2019s highly anticipated horror film \u201cWeapons\u201d did not disappoint, topping the box office during its debut weekend with $42.5 million domestically from 3,202 theaters. It made $70 million internationally.",
      "The film\u2019s success also handed its distributor, Warner Bros. Pictures, the seventh No. 1 opening of the year, and became the studio\u2019s sixth film in a row to debut with over $40 million domestically.",
      "\u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d Disney\u2019s chaotic sequel to the 2003 classic, \u201cFreaky Friday,\u201d took the second spot during its premiere weekend, earning $29 million in 3,975 North American theaters. Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis return, this time for a double body-swapping between the mother-daughter duo and Lohan\u2019s teen daughter and soon-to-be stepdaughter.",
      "Viral marketing tactics, coupled with strong social media word-of-mouth, boded well for both films\u2019 success, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for the data firm Comscore.",
      "\u201cThe top two films could not be more different, and that\u2019s what makes this weekend so appealing for moviegoers,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cBoth are perfectly tailored for their audiences to react in real time over the weekend to these films and then post on social media.\u201d",
      "\u201cWeapons\u201d transports audiences to the small town of Maybrook, where 17 kids up and leave their homes at 2:17 a.m., leaving bewildered parents in their wake. The town is left to navigate the lingering effects of trauma through horror, paranoia and a touch of existential humor.",
      "The film is Cregger\u2019s follow-up to his solo directorial debut with the 2022 genre-bending horror, \u201cBarbarian.\u201d That critically-acclaimed film had a slower start and smaller budget, but still topped the charts during its premiere with $10 million domestically and made a splash in the genre.",
      "\u201cWeapons\u201d generated a lot of buzz for its strong reviews (95% on Rotten Tomatoes).",

You just see that people are having a great time with it,\u201d said Jeffrey Goldstein, president of global distribution for Warner Bros. \u201cIt starts with an exceptional movie, an exceptional marketing campaign, and the date was exceptional too.\u201d",
      "The success of the comedy-horror double premiere meant \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\u201d surrendered its two-week run in the top spot and landed in the third position, bringing in $15.5 million domestically. The superhero movie enjoyed a strong $118 million debut, but stumbled in its second weekend.",
      "\u201cThe Bad Guys 2,\u201d which got a healthy start at the No. 2 spot during its premiere weekend, came in fourth place, earning $10.4 million domestically. \u201cThe Naked Gun\u201d had a similar fate, reaching the fifth position with $8.4 million in North American theaters.",
      "\u201cJurassic World Rebirth,\u201d which came in seventh this week, is expected to hit $800 million globally by Monday, according to NBC Universal, following a successful run in theaters.",
      "Warner Bros. started off slow this year, but made a comeback with the box-office hit, \u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d which opened with $157 million domestically. Since then, movies like \u201cSinners,\u201d \u201cSuperman\u201d and now, \u201cWeapons,\u201d have found success.",

      "The Sunday streets of the borough of churches still vibrate with gospel chords, yet inside many of Brooklyn\u2019s storied Black sanctuaries, the choir lofts have thinned dramatically",
      "NEW YORK (RNS) \u2014 On Sunday mornings in Brooklyn, nicknamed the borough of churches, the muffled sounds of choir singers, hand\u2011claps and Hammond organs can be heard from the sidewalks. The borough still has a church on nearly every block, but over the years, the number of people in the pews has thinned.",
      "Many church choirs in the heart of Brooklyn, however, have kept singing \u2014 despite boasting fewer singers than in years past as neighborhoods face gentrification and organized religious affiliation decreases.",
      "Standing in front of the gospel choir at Concord Baptist Church of Christ in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, Jessica Howard, 25, led the gospel standard \u201cGod Is\u201d on a Sunday in July. Dressed in a powder-pink floral dress, she called out lines naming God as \u201cjoy in sorrow\u201d and \u201cstrength for tomorrow.\u201d Some choir members wiped away tears as the song stoked emotions from around the room.'",
      "As a Black Christian person, as a descendant of slaves, I think when I sing, I feel really connected to my ancestors,\u201d said Howard, who grew up in Virginia and now sings as a soloist at Concord, where she\u2019s been a congregant for six years. \u201cI really feel sometimes like it\u2019s not just me singing, it\u2019s my lineage singing.\u201d",

      "Founded in 1847, Concord Baptist Church is Brooklyn\u2019s oldest historically Black congregation. At the time, a nearby neighborhood known as Weeksville, now considered part of central Brooklyn, was the second-largest free Black community in the United States before the Civil War, said Amanda Henderson, collections historian at the Weeksville Heritage Center.",
      "Louise Nelson, a Brooklyn native and church historian of the Berean Baptist Church in Crown Heights, said music was the foundation of the early church, and that remains true for churches in the borough today.",
      "\"The songs that uplifted us and kept us going through the midst of our misery \u2014 music is who we are,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can have a church today without the music because it brings unity in that idea that we can all do it together.\u201d",
      "According to Pew Research Center data, between 2019 and 2023, Black Protestant monthly church attendance fell from 61% to 46% \u2014 the largest decline among major U.S. religious groups. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this trend, and its impact is visible in the thinning choir stands.",
      "Glenn McMillan, Concord\u2019s director of music ministry and a musicology teacher at the City University of New York, who has worked in New York City church choirs since 1994, recalls a time when historically Black churches in Brooklyn regularly had multiple choirs at each parish.",
      "\u201cIn the last 20 years, the members of church choirs started getting older because this generation does not see church as important as it was back in the day,\u201d McMillan said. The choir at Concord has shrunk from about 50 voices before the pandemic to 30 today, McMillan said. Back in 2006, the choir featured 100 voices.",
      "According to research published by covidreligionresearch.org in June, Black Protestants attended church on Zoom more than other denominations during the pandemic, and they have been the slowest to return to in\u2011person worship.",
      "\u201cThe internet has taken over and streaming has taken over,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t goin to the building as much as they are streaming it.\u201d",
      "McMillan said that when in-person services first resumed, it took a long time for the choir to rebuild because many members were still staying home for health reasons. Recently, though, he\u2019s seen more people showing up.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m begging people my age to come to Concord,\u201d said Howard, the youngest member of the gospel choir, adding that only a handful of people around her age attend the church.",
      "Gwen Davis, a senior member of Berean Baptist Church and a choir soloist for more than 40 years, recalled Easter services in the mid\u20111960s, when over 400 people filled the pews and four separate choirs led the congregation in song.",

      "A professional soloist who has been singing at different churches across Brooklyn throughout her adult life, Davis said she believes one reason for choirs thinning out is the decline of music education in New York City Public Schools.",
      "\u201cWhen I was in high school, I had music every day,\u201d said Davis, who attended high school in the 1970s in central Brooklyn. \u201cI don\u2019t think the children are learning notes and sharps and clefs. I mean, that was like general knowledge for us at the time.\u201d",
      "During the 1970s fiscal crisis, the city of New York eliminated thousands of teaching positions, including art and music teachers, and converted music rooms into other classrooms, narrowing arts access in schools in low-income and majority-Black neighborhoods.",
      "\u201cFor me, singing is not just singing, it\u2019s ministry,\u201d Davis said. \u201cSome of these old hymns were composed years and years ago, and those old hymns have sustained a people \u2014 many people.\u201d",
      "Gentrification is another force reshaping Brooklyn. Between 2010 and 2020, Crown Heights lost nearly 19,000 Black residents while gaining about 15,000 whites, according to 2020 Census data. More than 75% of Bedford-Stuyvesant residents in 2000 were Black, while in 2020, around 41% were Black.",
      "Those demographic shifts have hit historically Black Catholic parishes hard. St. Teresa of Avilain Crown Heights, which was the first church in the nation to hold Mass in Creole, will close by the end of the year. The anticipated closure demonstrates a wider pattern of Catholic churches that serve people of color closing, often attributed to declining attendance.",
      "For Mike Delouis, 38, St. Teresa\u2019s longtime cantor and a son of Haitian immigrants who was baptized at the church, the loss is personal.",
      "\u201cSinging for me is not about performance but about participation,\u201d said Delouis, who juggles three services most Sundays between St. Teresa and the Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph in Prospect Heights. \u201cSt. Augustine said singing is praying twice.\u201d",
      "Delouis is part of a group fighting to keep the parish open, hoping to preserve a piece of their history in a rapidly changing Brooklyn. \u201cEven through the process of gentrification, there are people that hear the music and they come in,\u201d he said.",
      "In June, from his place in the choir loft, Delouis heard the priest announce the church\u2019s closure. The words hit hard. \u201cIt was actually kind of hard to finish,\u201d he said. \u201cWe only had the closing hymn to do, and I thought, \u2018Oh my gosh, no \u2014 we can\u2019t let this happen.\u2019\u201d",
      "Jesteena Walters, 55, has been part of Bedford Central Presbyterian Church in Crown Heights since she was an infant. She began singing at age 6 in the junior choir, and when she turned 18, she transitioned to its Gratitude choir, which her older siblings also joined. \u201cIt was the young hip gospel choir of the church,\u201d Walters said.",
      "Today, Gratitude no longer exists in the same way. Its members are older and often reunite only for special occasions, such as singing at funerals. Over the decades, Walters has also watched the congregation itself shift demographics.",
      "\"When I first went to Bedford Central, it was primarily a white church, and so we were in the minority at the time,\u201d Walters said, referring to the early 1970s. \u201cIn the years that would come, itwas primarily a Black church.\u201d It later became home to a large West Indian population, and today includes many members of Guyanese heritage.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, I couldn\u2019t break down the history of Brooklyn in a way that says who came first,\u201d Walters said. \u201cAt the end of the day, I believe in people coming together, if we can truly connect, feel each other\u2019s pain and celebrate each other\u2019s joys.\u201d",
      "McMillan emphasized that choirs continue to play a central role in Black church life, even as congregations decline in membership. \u201cChoir singers are some of the most faithful churchgoers,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cA choir is a community within the church community, and whenever you have a really consistent and strong choir, they grow with one another.\u201d",
      "Howard said she hopes to become a choir director one day, and she credits McMillan and the gospel choir for encouraging her toward the role.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d like to follow in that tradition,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "Reusable menstrual products, including cups, discs and period underwear, have gained traction as a cost-effective, long-lasting, environmental alternative to single-use products",
      "It was six months ago that Selin Celikoyar bought her last tampon and switched to a reusable menstrual disc.",
      "\"I had already been wary of tampons from an environmental perspective and also from a biological perspective. I felt that they were very wasteful and expensive to consistently keep buying,\" she said.",
      "The flexible discs and other reusable menstrual products are gaining traction as alternatives to the billions of single-use pads and tampons that get tossed into landfills every year. Products such as the discs, silicone cups and period underwear can be reused for years, so they\u2019re cost-effective and long-lasting in addition to helping people reduce waste. The popularity of the reusable alternatives has grown since the pandemic, when it was easier to experiment with period products in the privacy of a home bathroom, according to women's health experts.",
      "Celikoyar said she used tampons and pads for years because those are the options she grew up knowing about. But when she saw her friend make the switch to a menstrual disc, she decided to try it too.",
      "\u201cThe experience has been such a game changer,\u201d she said.",
      "About 12 billion disposable pads and 7 billion tampons go into U.S. landfills every year, according to Dr. Luwam Semere, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Kaiser Permanente Santa Clara. Pads are mostly plastic. Once they're in the landfill, they take up to 800 years to degrade, according to the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Single-use pads and tampons are by far the most popular period products. Women's health expert Dr. Navya Mysore said that's not because they're better, they're just usually the first options kids are shown.",
      "\u201cIt was often like, \u2018What did your mom use? What did your grandma use?\u2019 And that\u2019s how you were introduced into period hygiene,\u201d said Mysore, a primary care physician based in New York City.",
      "The most popular is the menstrual cup, which gets inserted much like a tampon. The discs get inserted farther in, so they don't interrupt intercourse. Both can hold several times more than a tampon and can stay inserted for up to 12 hours, instead of the four to eight hours recommended for tampons. Semere also said the risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome commonly associated with tampons is much lower with menstrual cups and discs.",
      "The cons? The products require some technique to put them in right, and doing it wrong can get messy. The cups and discs also have to be cleaned regularly with soap and water.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to do that if you\u2019re at work and you\u2019re in a shared, public restroom. It\u2019s not the most convenient,\u201d said Mysore.",
      "Cups prevent leakage by creating a suction, so people who use intrauterine devices for contraception risk dislodging them if they pull out a menstrual cup without breaking the seal.",
      "The placement of discs, which don\u2019t use suction, can also take some getting used to.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s high up there, you don\u2019t feel it, but it can be sometimes harder for women to pull them out,\u201d said Dr. Annemieke van Eijk, an epidemiologist with the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.",

      "A reusable product can help save money over the long term. Celikoyar estimates that she was using three tampons every day for seven days, or about 20 per month. With tampons costing 20 to 25 cents each, someone who switched to a reusable product would likely break even after a few months.",
      "For people who prefer pads, the most common reusable option is period underwear, which is comparable to regular-looking underwear with an extra absorbent lining.",

Several have played prominent roles in defending their state's abortion restrictions in court and in cases that have had national impact, including on access to medication abortion.",
      "As President Donald Trump pushes the Senate to confirm his federal judicial nominees, a review by The Associated Press shows that roughly half of them have revealed anti-abortion views, been associated with anti-abortion groups or defended abortion restrictions.",
      "Trump has offered shifting positions on the issue while indicating he wants to leave questions of abortion access to the states. But his court nominees will have lifetime appointments and be in position to roll back abortion access long after the Republican president leaves the White House.",
      "Bernadette Meyler, a professor of constitutional law at Stanford University, said judicial nominations \u201care a way of federally shaping the abortion question without going through Congress or making a big, explicit statement.\u201d",

No such records could be found for the other nine, nor did the AP review find evidence that any of Trump's judicial nominees support increased access to abortion.",
      "\"Every nominee of the President represents his promises to the American people and aligns with the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s landmark ruling,\" a White House spokesman, Harrison Fields, said in a statement that referenced the 2022 decision overturning the constitutional right to abortion established in Roe v. Wade. \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 extreme position on abortion was rejected in November in favor of President Trump\u2019s commonsense approach, which allows states to decide, supports the sanctity of human life, and prevents taxpayer funding of abortion.\u201d",

      "In his second term, all but five of his 17 nominees are from states that went for Trump in 2024 and where Republicans have pushed severe abortion restrictions. Among them, four nominees are from Missouri and five are from Florida.",
      "Here is a look at the nominees who have tried to reduce abortion access or have advocated for restrictions. They did not respond to requests for comment:",
      "\u2014 Whitney Hermandorfer, who has been confirmed to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, has built much of her relatively short career as a lawyer around challenging former President Joe Biden\u2019s policies related to abortion and transgender rights. She challenged a federal law requiring employers to provide workers with reasonable accommodations to get abortion care, as well as Title X regulations that required providers who receive funding through the program to give information about abortions to patients if asked.",
      "Hermandorfer defended Tennessee\u2019s abortion ban, one of the strictest in the country, in court and tried to dismiss a lawsuit from doctors seeking clarification on exemptions to the ban. She said abortion deserves special scrutiny because \u201cthis is the only medical procedure that terminates a life.\u201d",
      "\u2014 Maria Lanahan, a district court nominee in Missouri, helped write the state's complaint in a lawsuit that had sweeping national implications for access to medication abortion. The case challenged the FDA approval of the abortion pill mifepristone despite decades of evidence showing the drug is safe and effective.",
      "The lawyer supported Missouri's effort to strip Planned Parenthood of state Medicaid funding and defended the state's abortion ban after a group of clergy sued, arguing it violated the state constitution\u2019s protections for religious freedom.",
      "\u2014 Jordan Pratt, a nominee for the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, called abortion a \u201cbarbaric practice\u201d and \u201cone of the most severe invasions of personal rights imaginable\u201d in an amicus brief supporting Florida's 15-week abortion ban. The state now bans the procedure at six weeks.",
      "In 2025, Pratt struck down a Florida law that created a judicial waiver program for minors seeking to have abortions without parental consent. The lawyer also worked for the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal organization that opposes abortion and has sued to reverse the FDA approval of mifepristone.",

      "Harada first learned about her grandfather\u2019s experience of both bombs when she interviewed him for an assignment in elementary school.",

      "A new study warns that rising sea levels could threaten Easter Island\u2019s iconic moai statues by the end of the century",
      "By the end of the century, rising sea levels could push powerful seasonal waves into Easter Island\u2019s 15 iconic moai statues, according to a new study published in the Journal of Cultural Heritage. About 50 other cultural sites in the area are also at risk from flooding.",
      "\u201cSea level rise is real,\u201d said Noah Paoa, lead author of the study and a doctoral student at the University of Hawaii at Manoa\u2019s School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology. \u201cIt\u2019s not a distant threat.\u201d",
      "Paoa, who is from Easter Island \u2014 known to its Indigenous people as Rapa Nui \u2014 and his colleagues built a high-resolution \u201cdigital twin\u201d of the island\u2019s eastern coastline and ran computer models to simulate future wave impacts under various sea level rise scenarios. They then overlaid the results with maps of cultural sites to pinpoint which places could be inundated in the coming decades.",
      "The findings show waves could reach Ahu Tongariki, the largest ceremonial platform on the island, as early as 2080. The site, home to the 15 towering moai, draws tens of thousands of visitors each year and is a cornerstone of the island\u2019s tourism economy.",
      "Beyond its economic value, the ahu is deeply woven into Rapa Nui\u2019s cultural identity. It lies within Rapa Nui National Park, which encompasses much of the island and is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site.",
      "The roughly 900 moai statues across the island were built by the Rapa Nui people between the 10th and 16th centuries to honor important ancestors and chiefs.",
      "The threat isn't unprecedented. In 1960, the largest earthquake ever recorded \u2014 a magnitude 9.5 off the coast of Chile \u2014 sent a tsunami surging across the Pacific. It struck Rapa Nui and swept the already-toppled moai further inland, which damaged some of their features. The monument was restored in the 1990s.",
      "While the study focuses on Rapa Nui, its conclusions echo a wider reality: cultural heritage sites worldwide are increasingly endangered by rising seas. A UNESCO report published last month found that about 50 World Heritage sites are highly exposed to coastal flooding.",
      "In an email to The Associated Press, a UNESCO spokesperson said climate change is the biggest threat to UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage marine sites. \u201cIn the Mediterranean and Africa, nearly three-quarters of coastal low-lying sites are now exposed to erosion and flooding due to accelerated sea level rise.\u201d",

The maximum penalty for the charge is 10 years of imprisonment.",

      "French Foreign Minister Jean-N\u00f6el Barrot posted the letter Wednesday to X. He co-signed it along with top diplomats from Germany and the United Kingdom.",
      "\u201cE3 have always committed to use all diplomatic tools at our disposal to ensure Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon,\u201d the letter said. \u201cWe have made clear that if Iran is not willing to reach a diplomatic solution before the end of August 2025, or does not seize the opportunity of an extension, E3 are prepared to trigger the snapback mechanism.\u201d",

      "\u201cTo the contrary, you should make sure your neighboring countries are prosperous and secure. If you try to destabilize these countries, if you take steps to that end, this could trigger other crises in the region.\u201d",

      "India\u2019s opposition parties have held a protest calling for the rollback of a controversial revision of the voter list in one of the country\u2019s poorest states, where key elections are scheduled in November",
      "NEW DELHI -- NEW DELHI (AP) \u2014 India \u2019s opposition parties held a protest Monday calling for the rollback of a controversial revision of the voter list in one of the country\u2019s poorest states, where key elections are scheduled in November, and warning it could lead to voter disenfranchisement.",
      "Hundreds of lawmakers and supporters began the protest from parliament and were confronted by police, who stopped them from marching towards the election commission office in the capital, New Delhi. Police briefly detained some lawmakers, including opposition leader Rahul Gandhi.",
      "India's opposition accuses the Election Commission of India of rushing through a mammoth electoral roll revision in eastern Bihar state, saying the exercise could render vast numbers of citizens unable to vote. The revision of nearly 80 million voters involves strict documentation requirements from citizens, triggering concerns it could lead to the exclusion of vulnerable groups, especially those who are unable to produce the paperwork required to prove their citizenship.",
      "Some of the documents required include birth certificates, passports and matriculation records. Critics and opposition leaders say they are hard to come by in Bihar, where the literacy rate is among the lowest in India. They say the exercise will impact minorities the most, including Muslims, and disallow them from voting.",
      "India does not have a unique national identity card. The widely used biometric-linked identity card, called \u201cAadhaar,\u201d is not among the documents listed by the poll body as acceptable proof for the electoral roll revision.",
      "The election agency has denied the allegations and said it has ensured no eligible voter is \u201cleft behind.\" It has also said the \u201cintensive revision\u201d is a routine update to ensure the accuracy of electoral rolls and is needed to avoid the \u201cinclusion of the names of foreign illegal immigrants.\"",
      "According to the commission, some 49.6 million voters whose names were included in a similar exercise in 2003 are not required to submit any further documents. But that still leaves almost 30 million other voters potentially vulnerable. A similar roll revision of voters is scheduled to be replicated across the nation of 1.4 billion people.",

      "Modi's BJP has backed the revision and said it is necessary to update new voters and delete the names of those who have either died or moved to other states. It has also claimed the exercise is essential to weed out undocumented Muslim immigrants from neighboring Bangladesh who have fraudulently entered India\u2019s electoral rolls.",
      "Critics and opposition leaders have warned that the exercise is similar to that of a controversial 2019 citizenship list in India's eastern Assam state, which left nearly 2 million people at risk of statelessness. Many of those left off the final citizenship list were Muslims. They have been declared \u201cforeigners\u201d and some of them faced long periods of detention.",
      "Gandhi, the opposition leader, made public last week his Congress Party's analysis from southern Karnataka state that alleged nearly 100,000 votes cast for an assembly seat in the 2024 general election were fraudulent. India's election commission dismissed his claims.",
      "\u201cA clean voter roll is imperative for free and fair elections,\u201d Gandhi said Sunday in a post on X.",

      "The video shows the heavily shattered bow of the Chinese coast guard ship, where at least two Chinese personnel were seen standing shortly before the crash. The Chinese navy ship sustained deep dents and what appeared to be linear cuts on its hull.",
      "BRP Suluan offered medical help by two-way radio to the Chinese coast guard, fearing the collision may have caused injuries to its personnel, but the Philippine coast guard said it received no response.",
      "Gan Yu, a spokesperson for the Chinese coast guard in Beijing, said Monday that the Philippine vessels intruded into Chinese territorial waters off the shoal, prompting its forces to take \u201cnecessary measures, including monitoring, forcing, intercepting and controlling the Philippine vessels to expel them.\u201d",

      "After years of being told that red wine was good for heart health, more Americans appear to be heeding warnings that even moderate alcohol consumption can be unhealthy",
      "WASHINGTON -- Fewer Americans are reporting that they drink alcohol amid a growing belief that even moderate alcohol consumption is a health risk, according to a Gallup poll released Wednesday.",
      "A record high percentage of U.S. adults, 53%, now say moderate drinking is bad for their health, up from 28% in 2015. The uptick in doubt about alcohol\u2019s benefits is largely driven by young adults \u2014 the age group that is most likely to believe drinking \u201cone or two drinks a day\u201d can cause health hazards \u2014 but older adults are also now increasingly likely to think moderate drinking carries risks.",
      "As concerns about health impacts rise, fewer Americans are reporting that they drink. The survey finds that 54% of U.S. adults say they drink alcoholic beverages such as liquor, wine or beer. That\u2019s lower than at any other point in the past three decades.",
      "The findings of the poll, which was conducted in July, indicate that after years of many believing that moderate drinking was harmless \u2014 or even beneficial \u2014 worries about alcohol consumption are taking hold. According to Gallup\u2019s data, even those who consume alcohol are drinking less.",
      "The federal government is updating new dietary guidelines, including those around alcohol. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, government data showed U.S. alcohol consumption was trending up. But other government surveys have shown a decline in certain types of drinking, particularly among teenagers and young adults.",
      "This comes alongside a new drumbeat of information about alcohol\u2019s risks. While moderate drinking was once thought to have benefits for heart health, health professionals in recent years have pointed to overwhelming evidence that alcohol consumption leads to negative health outcomes and is a leading cause of cancer.",
      "Younger adults have been quicker than older Americans to accept that drinking is harmful, but older adults are coming around to the same view.",
      "About two-thirds of 18- to 34-year-olds believe moderate drinking is unhealthy, according to the poll, up from about 4 in 10 in 2015. Older adults are less likely to see alcohol as harmful \u2014 about half of Americans age 55 or older believe this \u2014 but that\u2019s a substantial increase, too. In 2015, only about 2 in 10 adults age 55 or older thought alcohol was bad for their health.",
      "In the past, moderate drinking was thought to have some benefits. That idea came from imperfect studies that largely didn\u2019t include younger people and couldn\u2019t prove cause and effect. Now the scientific consensus has shifted, and several countries recently lowered their alcohol consumption recommendations. Earlier this year, the outgoing U.S. surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, recommended a label on bottles of beer, wine and liquor that would clearly outline the link between alcohol consumption and cancer.",
      "The federal government\u2019s current dietary guidelines recommend Americans not drink or, if they do consume alcohol, men should limit themselves to two drinks a day or fewer while women should stick to one or fewer.",
      "Gallup\u2019s director of U.S. social research, Lydia Saad, said shifting health advice throughout older Americans\u2019 lives may be a reason they have been more gradual than young adults to recognize alcohol as harmful.",
      "\u201cOlder folks may be a little more hardened in terms of the whiplash that they get with recommendations,\u201d Saad said. \u201cIt may take them a little longer to absorb or accept the information. Whereas, for young folks, this is the environment that they\u2019ve grown up in ... in many cases, it would be the first thing young adults would have heard as they were coming into adulthood.\u201d",

In sharp contrast with Gallup\u2019s findings two decades ago, when young adults were likeliest to report drinking, young adults' drinking rate is now slightly below middle-aged and older adults.",
      "Americans\u2019 reported drinking is among the lowest since the question was first asked in 1939. For most of the last few decades, at least 6 in 10 Americans have reported drinking alcoholic beverages, only dipping below that point a few times in the question\u2019s history.",
      "Even if concerns about health risks aren\u2019t causing some adults to give up alcohol entirely, these worries could be influencing how often they drink.",
      "The survey found that adults who think moderate drinking is bad for one\u2019s health are just as likely as people who don't share those concerns to report that they drink, but fewer of the people with health worries had consumed alcohol recently.",
      "About half of those who worry moderate drinking is unhealthy said they had a drink in the previous week, compared with about 7 in 10 who did not think drinking was bad for their health.",
      "Overall, only about one-quarter of Americans who drink said they had consumed alcohol in the prior 24 hours, a record low in the survey. Roughly 4 in 10 said that it had been more than a week since they had poured a drink.",

      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- GE Appliances plans to shift production of refrigerators, gas ranges and water heaters out of China and Mexico as part of a more than $3 billion investment to expand its U.S. operations in Kentucky, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and South Carolina.",
      "The investment \u2014 the second-largest in the Louisville-based company's history \u2014 is expected to add more than 1,000 jobs while ramping up domestic production and modernizing plants in the next five years.",
      "\u201cOur long-term strategy is about manufacturing close to our customers,\u201d said CEO Kevin Nolan. \u201cWith lean manufacturing, upskilling our workforce and automation, the math works for manufacturing in the United States.\u201d",
      "The majority of GE Appliances' production is already in the U.S. and the shift means only that the company will transfer more work to its domestic plants.",
      "GE Appliances will relocate production of gas ranges from Mexico to a plant in Georgia, while six refrigerator models now made in China will be manufactured at its Alabama plant, the company said.",
      "In June, the company said it would move production of clothes washers from China to its sprawling manufacturing complex in Louisville. The reshoring announcements come as President Donald Trump tries to lure factories back to the United States by imposing import taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on foreign goods.",
      "GE Appliances said Wednesday that the first phase of its new investment will begin at plants in five Southern states \u2014 Kentucky, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina.",

      "The multiyear plan includes ramping up production of gas ranges that have been made in Mexico but will shift to the company's plant in LaFayette, Georgia, the company said. Production of six refrigerators now made in China will move to its plant in Decatur, Alabama.",
      "The GE Appliances plant in Camden, South Carolina, will add production of electric and hybrid heat pump water heaters, doubling the factory's output and employment once the project is complete, the company said.

      "GE Appliances handles product design and engineering work at its Louisville headquarters but doesn't make all of its products in the U.S. It contracts with other manufacturers, including in China, for some of its production where it doesn't have capacity or needs access to a global supply chain. The company said its core business strategy is to base production in the United States, and investments announced in June and on Wednesday are another step toward achieving that goal.",

      "The U.S. has seen a record increase in tariff income, with a 273% rise in customs revenue from last year",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. budget deficit in July climbed 20% this fiscal year compared to the last despite the U.S. taking in record income from President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, according to Treasury Department data released Tuesday.",
      "The U.S. saw a 273% increase \u2014 or $21 billion \u2014 in customs revenue in July over the same period last year, the data showed.",
      "A Treasury official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the data said overall increased spending is in part due to a mix of expenditures, including growing interest payments on the public debt and cost-of-living increases to Social Security payouts, among other costs. This comes as the federal government\u2019s gross national debt creeps up to the $37 trillion mark.",
      "Even as Trump talks about America becoming rich because of his import tax hikes, federal spending keeps outpacing the revenues collected by the government. That financial picture might change as companies exhaust their pre-tariff inventories, forcing them to import more goods and generate even more in tax revenues that could whittle away at the deficit without meaningfully reducing it as promised.",
      "If tariffs fail to deliver on Trump's pledge to improve the government's balance sheet, the American public could be faced with fewer job options, more inflationary pressures and higher interest rates on mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. The budget deficit is the annual gap between what the U.S. government raises in taxes and what it spends, over time feeding into the overall national debt.",
      "While organizations like the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget say that tariff income can be a stream of meaningful revenue \u2014 estimated to generate about $1.3 trillion over the course of President Trump\u2019s four-year term in office; some economists like Kent Smetters of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Penn Wharton Budget Model say tariffs are likely to result \u201c in only modest reductions in federal debt.\u201d",
      "In June, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariff plan would cut deficits by $2.8 trillion over a 10-year period while shrinking the economy, raising the inflation rate and reducing the purchasing power of households overall. But revenue estimates are also difficult to predict as the president has changed his tariff rates repeatedly and the taxes declared as part of an economic emergency are currently under appeal in a U.S. court.",

Ford revealed in its release that the truck will have a targeted starting price of about $30,000.",
      "Ford said its investment in the Louisville plant will secure 2,200 hourly jobs.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s new President Lee Jae Myung will travel to Washington later this month to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump, Lee\u2019s office said Tuesday, for talks on trade and defense cooperation in the face of nuclear-armed North Korea and other threats.",
      "Their Aug. 25 summit will follow a July trade deal in which Washington agreed to cut its reciprocal tariff on South Korea to 15% from the initially proposed 25% and to apply the same reduced rate to South Korean cars, the country\u2019s top export to the United States.",
      "South Korea also agreed to purchase $100 billion in U.S. energy and invest $350 billion in the country, and Lee and Trump may discuss how the investment package will be structured and managed. The talks are expected to cover expanding cooperation in key industries such as semiconductors, batteries and shipbuilding, Lee\u2019s spokesperson Kang Yu-jung said.",
      "Lee, a liberal who won an early election in June to replace ousted conservative Yoon Suk Yeol, has made the economy his top priority, aiming to shield the trade-dependent nation from the shocks of Trump\u2019s tariff hikes and his demands that allies cut reliance on Washington and shoulder more of their own defense costs.",
      "Lee's meeting with Trump comes amid concerns in Seoul that the Trump administration could shake up the decades-old alliance by demanding higher payments for the U.S. troop presence in South Korea and possibly move to reduce it as Washington shifts more focus on China.",
      "Lee and Trump will discuss strengthening the allies\u2019 defense posture against growing North Korean threats, and also developing the partnership into a \u201cfuture-oriented, comprehensive strategic alliance\u201d to address the changing international security and economic environment, according to Kang, who didn\u2019t elaborate on the specific issues to be addressed.",
      "Dating back to his first term, Trump has regularly called for South Korea to pay more for the 28,500 American troops stationed on its soil. Recent comments by key Trump administration officials, including Undersecretary of Defense Elbridge Colby, have also suggested a desire to restructure the alliance, which some experts say could potentially affect the size and role of U.S. forces in South Korea.",
      "Under this approach, South Korea would take a greater role in countering North Korean threats while U.S. forces focus more on China, possibly leaving Seoul to face reduced benefits but increased costs and risks, experts say.",
      "In a meeting with South Korean reporters last week, Gen. Xavier Brunson, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, stressed the need to \u201cmodernize\u201d the alliance to address the evolving security environment, including North Korea\u2019s expanding nuclear program, its deepening alignment with Russia, and what he called Chinese threats to a \u201cfree and open Indo-Pacific.\u201d",

      "Saving for the future can be difficult because of a cognitive bias known as hyperbolic discounting: our tendency to place greater weight on immediate satisfaction, even if focusing on the long term will have a greater payoff. This bias is why, when you get a raise, you may consider getting a new car\u2014incurring a higher monthly payment\u2014instead of sacking away more money each month for retirement and perhaps getting to retire several years earlier.",

      "Then, consider how you might pair up your goals to boost your savings motivation. Research suggests the most motivating financial goals may be those relating to security (for example, retirement) or self-actualization (such as opening a business or contributing to charities). Consider how you may link some of your shorter-term goals to these bigger goals.",
      "For instance, you may decide to couple your \u201csavings for home repairs\u201d with your desire to \u201cdonate to charity\u201d by committing to donate the excess you saved for repairs to your favorite nonprofit. By ensuring your goals are well-articulated and meaningful, you can always come back to them for a dose of motivation when you feel yourself wavering.",

      "According to the lawsuit filed in Hawaii Circuit Court on Friday, Ohtani\u2019s agent, Nez Balelo, increasingly demanded concessions from developer Kevin J. Hayes Sr. and real estate broker Tomoko Matsumoto before demanding that their business partner, Kingsbarn Realty Capital, drop them from the deal.",
      "\u201cBalelo and Otani, who were brought into the venture solely for Otani\u2019s promotional and branding value, exploited their celebrity leverage to destabilize and ultimately dismantle Plaintiffs\u2019 role in the project \u2014 for no reason other than their own financial self-interest,\u201d the lawsuit claims.",
      "The suit accuses Ohtani and Balelo of tortious interference and unjust enrichment. Hayes, a developer with 40 years of experience, and Matsumoto, who was to be the listing agent for the houses averaging $17.3 million each, say that Ohtani and Balelo also tried to undermine their interests in a second, neighboring venture.",
      "A spokesman for Balelo's agency, CAA Baseball, declined comment. Attempts to reach Kingsbarn officials for comment were not immediately successful.",
      "\u201cThis case is about abuse of power,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cDefendants used threats and baseless legal claims to force a business partner to betray its contractual obligations and strip Plaintiffs of the very project they conceived and built.",
      "\u201cDefendants must be held accountable for their actions, not shielded by fame or behind-the-scenes agents acting with impunity. Plaintiffs bring this suit to expose Defendants\u2019 misconduct and to ensure that the rules of contract, fair dealing, and accountability apply equally to all \u2014 celebrity or not.\u201d",
      "Ohtani, 31, arrived from Japan in 2018 as perhaps the most heralded international star in baseball history, with an ability to both pitch and hit that made him doubly valuable to his team. A five-time All-Star and three-time Most Valuable Player, he signed a record 10-year, $700-million contract with the Dodgers before last season and helped the team win the 2024 World Series.",
      "Investment materials for The Vista at Mauna Kea Resort, which remained online on Monday night, listed Hayes and Matsumoto as part of the management team, along with Kingsbarn. It called Ohtani \u201cJapan's Babe Ruth\u201d and the \u201c1st Resident,\u201d giving him top billing ahead of the iconic Mauna Kea Resort, \u201cone of the most celebrated hotels in Hawaii,\u201d Hapuna Beach, \u201crated the #1 beach in America by Conde Nast Traveler\u201d and two golf courses \u2013 one designed by Arnold Palmer, the other by Robert Trent Jones Sr.",

      "The suit says the developers spent 11 years working on the deal and \u201cas part of a bold marketing strategy\u201d signed an endorsement deal in 2023 with Ohtani, \u201cone of the most high-profile endorsements imaginable.\"",

      "Bolivia's governing Movement Toward Socialism party won't have a big-name presidential candidate on the ballot for the first time in two decades",
      "LA PAZ, Bolivia -- For most of Renan Aliaga\u2019s adult life, a single name dominated the politics of Bolivia: Evo Morales.",
      "Morales, a former union leader for coca farmers, founded the Andean nation's most successful political party and transformed Bolivia over three consecutive terms marked by political stability and economic growth.",
      "But when Aliaga goes to the polls on Sunday to vote for Bolivia's next president, he won\u2019t see Morales' name on the ballot after electoral authorities excluded him.",
      "In fact, for the first time in two decades, Aliaga won\u2019t see any big name from the governing Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, party that Morales founded \u2014 not even President Luis Arce, Morales' protege-turned-rival, who withdrew from the race over his failure to halt an economic tailspin.",
      "Under MAS, Bolivia enjoyed years of a fixed exchange rate, low inflation and subsidized energy. Now, high inflation, a scarcity of imported goods and fuel shortages have beset the country.",
      "Arce handed the reins to a little-known minister, Eduardo Del Castillo.",
      "The main options remaining include a conservative businessman and right-wing former president \u2014 both of whom have run and lost three times before \u2014 and a young leftist Senate leader.",
      "Unsatisfied, Aliaga, a 39-year-old bus driver and former MAS voter, says he'll make a last-minute decision.",
      "\u201cThe right wing had its chance, and it was a disaster,\u201d he said, recalling the hardship of the 1990s, when Bolivia became a poster child for free-market economics and the two right-wing front-runners \u2014 businessman Samuel Doria Medina and ex-President Jorge \u201cTuto\u201d Quiroga \u2014 built their careers.",
      "\u201cBut the left wing has proven to be the same, or worse,\u201d Aliaga said, referring to how the MAS strategy of nationalizing resources and redistributing tax receipts sputtered out with the end of the commodities boom.",
      "The main issues in this hotly contested election are Bolivia's long-standing leftist economic model, its democratic integrity and the livelihoods of millions of people undergoing the country's worst financial crisis in four decades.",
      "\u201cThis seems the end of the cycle not only for MAS, but for an entire model of government,\u201d Bolivia political analyst Ver\u00f3nica Rocha said.",
      "Tensions within MAS can be traced to Morales' disputed 2019 reelection. Protests erupted and the leftist leader resigned under pressure from the military. He fled into exile and right-wing Senator Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez took office in what many view as a coup.",
      "Violent clashes between protesters and security forces killed at least 37 people.",
      "Morales returned to Bolivia following the 2020 election victory of his former finance minister, Arce.",
      "But their competing ambitions collided when Morales announced his intention to return to politics. Lawmakers loyal to Morales deprived Arce\u2019s government of its majority. Judges answering to Arce ordered Morales\u2019 arrest over his sexual relationship with a 15-year-old girl and barred his 2025 presidential candidacy on account of his past terms.",

      "A young vice president, Quiroga became interim leader in 2001 when then President Hugo Banzer, Bolivia\u2019s former military dictator, resigned because of terminal cancer with a year left in his term.",
      "Ever since, Quiroga has yearned for a term of his own. He ran three times \u2014 twice against Morales in 2005 and 2014. Now 65, he\u2019s hoping the fourth time\u2019s the charm.",

      "A 90-day pause on imposing higher tariffs on China is due to expire on Tuesday and it is unclear if it will be extended",
      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- A 90-day pause on imposing higher tariffs on China is due to expire on Tuesday and it is unclear if it will be extended.",
      "After the most recent round of China-U.S. trade talks, held late last month in Stockholm, Chinese and U.S. officials said they expected the deadline to be extended for another 90 days. The U.S. side said the decision was up to President Donald Trump. So far there has been no formal announcement about whether he will endorse an extension or push ahead with the higher tariffs.",
      "The uncertainty has left businesses in limbo and a decision to raise the import duties could jolt world markets.",
      "Trump has repeatedly shifted deadlines and tariff rates, and neither side has indicated what it plans for Tuesday. Extending the Aug. 12 deadline for reaching a trade agreement with China would forestall earlier threats of tariffs of up to 245%.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Trump was deciding about another 90-day delay to allow time to work out details of an agreement setting tariffs on most products at 50%, including extra import duties related to illicit trade in the powerful opiate fentanyl.",
      "Higher tariffs are aimed at offsetting the huge, chronic U.S. trade deficit with China, which hit a 21-year low in July as the threat of tariffs bit into Chinese exports.",
      "It's not unusual for the U.S. to give hints on where talks stand, but it's rare for China to make announcements until major decisions are set. So far, Beijing's refrained from commenting ahead of Tuesday's deadline.",
      "In an interview with Fox News taped on Thursday but aired on Sunday, U.S. Vice President JD Vance said Trump was considering additional tariffs on Beijing because of China's purchases of Russian oil. But he said Trump \u201chasn't made any firm decisions.\u201d",
      "Prohibitively high tariffs on Chinese exports to the United States would put huge pressure on Beijing at a time when the Chinese economy, the world's second largest, is still recovering from a prolonged downturn in its property market. Lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have left millions of people reliant on \u201cgig work,\u201d crimping the job market. Higher import taxes on small parcels from China have also hurt smaller factories and layoffs have accelerated,",

      "But the U.S. relies heavily on imports from China for all sorts of products, from household goods and clothing to wind turbines, basic computer chips, electric vehicle batteries and the rare earths needed to make them. That gives Beijing some powerful leverage in the negotiations with Washington.",
      "Even with higher tariffs, China remains competitive for many products. And its leaders are aware that the U.S. economy is only just beginning to feel the effects of higher prices from Trump's broad tariff hikes.",
      "For now, imports from China are subject to a 10% baseline tariff and a 20% extra tariff related to the fentanyl issue. Some products are taxed at higher rates. U.S. exports to China are subject to tariffs of around 30%. Before the two sides called a truce, Trump had threatened to impose 245% import duties on Chinese goods. China retaliated by saying it would hike its tariff on U.S. products to 125%.",
      "A trade war between the world's two largest economies has ramifications across the global economy, affecting industrial supply chains, demand for commodities like copper and oil and geopolitical issues such as the war in Ukraine.",
      "After a phone call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in June, Trump said he hoped to meet with Xi later this year. That's an incentive for striking a deal with Beijing.",
      "If the two sides fail to keep their truce, trade tensions could escalate and tariffs might rise to even higher levels, inflicting still more pain on both economies and rattling world markets. Businesses would refrain from making investment commitments and hiring, while inflation would surge higher.",

      "Beijing could have responded by raising retaliatory levies on U.S. exports to China but it issued a similar statement about the extension of the tariff pause.",
      "The reprieve makes room for a possible deal with Trump, but it also prolongs the uncertainty that has bedeviled companies since the president began escalating his trade war.",

      "In Monday's status report, attorneys for Hall noted the case received a final judgment in arbitration and they filed a proposed order for the judge, Nashville Chancellor Russell Perkins, to dismiss the case. In mid-July, Perkins ordered Hall's attorneys to offer an update in the case, which had last seen a public filing in December 2023.",

      "Just months after emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Spirit Airlines is warning about its future ability to stay in business",
      "NEW YORK -- Just months after emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Spirit Airlines is warning about its future ability to stay in business.",
      "Spirit Aviation Holdings, the budget carrier's parent company, says it has \u201csubstantial doubt\u201d about its ability to continue as a going concern within the next year \u2014 which is accounting-speak for having the resources needed to sustain operations. In a quarterly report issued on Monday, Spirit pointed to \u201cadverse market conditions\" that it's continued to face despite recent restructuring and other efforts to revamp offerings.",
      "That includes weak demand for domestic leisure travel, which Spirit said persisted in the second quarter of its fiscal year \u2014 among other challenges and \u201cuncertainties in its business operations\u201d that the Florida-based company expects to continue \u201cfor at least the remainder of 2025.\u201d",
      "Known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of bright yellow planes, Spirit has struggled to bounce back to profitability and boost resources to compete with rivals since the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising operation costs and mounting debt eventually led the company to seek bankruptcy protection in November. By the time of that Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.",
      "When Spirit emerged from bankruptcy protection in March, the company successfully restructured some of its looming debt obligations and secured new financing for future operations. Spirit has continued to make other cost-cutting efforts since \u2014 including plans to furlough about 270 pilots and downgrade some 140 captains to first officers in the coming months.",

They also follow previous furloughs and job cuts taken before the company's bankruptcy filing last year.",
      "Despite these and other cost-cutting efforts, Spirit on Monday stressed that it needs more liquidity. As a result, the company said it may also sell certain aircraft and real estate.",
      "Spirit's aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has made the airline an attractive takeover target over the years. But such buyout attempts from budget rivals like JetBlue and Frontier were unsuccessful both before and during the bankruptcy process.",

      "Workers were heating coal and preparing for routine maintenance when an explosion rocked a U.S. Steel plant outside Pittsburgh",
      "CLAIRTON, Pa. -- Moments after an explosion erupted at a U.S. Steel plant outside Pittsburgh, company firefighters, local responders and employees raced in to rescue people from the smoldering wreckage.",
      "They were able to free one injured worker who was whisked to a hospital. But one more was still missing, and the area was too unstable to continue working, according to Matthew Brown, chief of Allegheny County Emergency Services.",
      "A Pittsburgh-based crew from Pennsylvania Urban Search & Rescue was called in to help, some of whose members were already responding through their affiliations with local fire departments, Brown said. The team stabilized a wall at the plant and used an advanced camera to detect the missing employee. They pulled away the rubble and were able to extract the body of the worker, who died.",
      "Monday's explosion, which was powerful enough to shake nearby homes, killed two workers and injured more than 10 others. Five people ranging in age from 27 to 74 remained hospitalized Tuesday including the rescued worker, who was in critical but stable condition, according to the Allegheny County Police Department. Three were at UPMC Mercy, the region\u2019s only level-one trauma and burn center.",
      "The massive plant along the Monongahela River in Clairton converts coal to coke, a key component in the steelmaking process. The facility is considered the largest coking operation in North America and is one of four major U.S. Steel plants in Pennsylvania.",
      "To make coke, coal is baked in special ovens for hours at high temperatures to remove impurities that could otherwise weaken steel. The process creates what\u2019s known as coke gas \u2014 a lethal mix of methane, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.",
      "U.S. Steel\u2019s chief manufacturing officer, Scott Buckiso, said workers were conducting routine operations at the time of the accident.",
      "Two loud booms that followed the initial blast were initially thought to be subsequent explosions, but Buckiso said they were from the activation of two relief pressure valves \u2014 a safety mechanism that operated as expected.",
      "The cause of the explosion remained under investigation, and Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro told reporters Tuesday that workers deserve an \u201canswer for what happened.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe owe them the answers to their questions, and we owe them to never forget the sacrifices that occurred here yesterday,\u201d Shapiro said. Before arriving at a news conference, he met with family members of a worker who died.",
      "Allegheny County Executive Sara Innamorato told reporters she had assurances from U.S. Steel that it would continue to cooperate fully with investigators.",
      "\u201cWe all share a common goal. We want to get to the bottom of what happened, and we want to prevent it from happening ever again,\u201d Innamorato said.",
      "Shapiro also used the news conference to pay tribute to the workers who died. The county medical examiner\u2019s office identified one as Timothy Quinn, 39. and the other was not identified, with his family requesting privacy.",
      "Shapiro described Quinn as a devoted father of three known to his friends as \u201cTQ.\u201d He served as a mentor and leader to other workers and was known for cracking jokes. A second-generation steelworker, he followed in his father\u2019s footsteps and was a \u201cmama\u2019s boy\u201d who, after working long shifts, would take care of his mother and look after his children and his girlfriend\u2019s two children.",
      "\u201cHis life was cut too short because of what happened here at this plant,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cWe have a responsibly to remember his legacy, to make sure his memory lives on. ... We will make sure his children know his dad was a special man, a good man and a man who helped build this community with his hands the way his father did.\u201d",
      "CEO David Burritt called it an \u201cextraordinarily difficult day\u201d for a U.S. Steel family that has \u201csuffered heartbreaking losses.\u201d According to the company, the plant has approximately 1,400 workers.",

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- The Minnesota Twins are no longer for sale, executive chair Joe Pohlad announced Wednesday on behalf of his family.",
      "After exploring a variety of options since publicizing the sale 10 months ago, the Pohlad family will remain the principal owner of the club and add new investors instead. Carl Pohlad, a banking magnate and the late grandfather of Joe Pohlad, purchased the Twins in 1984 for $44 million.",
      "\u201cFor more than four decades, our family has had the privilege of owning the Minnesota Twins. This franchise has become part of our family story, as it has for our employees, our players, this community, and Twins fans everywhere,\" Joe Pohlad said in his announcement. \u201cOver the past several months, we explored a wide range of potential investment and ownership opportunities. Our focus throughout has been on what\u2019s best for the long-term future of the Twins. We have been fully open to all possibilities.\u201d",
      "Pohlad said the family was in the process of adding two \u201csignificant\u201d limited partnership groups to bring in fresh ideas, bolster critical partnerships and shape the long-term vision of the franchise that relocated to Minnesota in 1961 after originating as the Washington Senators. Details about the new investors were being kept private until Major League Baseball approval of the transactions, Pohlad said.",
      "Financial analysis earlier this year by Forbes valued the franchise at $1.5 billion, ranked 23rd in MLB. Sportico ($1.7 billion) and CNBC ($1.65 billion) pegged them higher.",
      "The Pohlads hired Allen & Company, a New York-based investment bank, to direct the sale and keep inquiries confidential. Multiple published reports identified Justin Ishbia, a part owner of the NBA's Phoenix Suns, as the front-runner. But the Chicago White Sox announced last month that Ishbia was becoming a limited partner in a deal that provides a runway for him to become controlling owner.",
      "MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred acknowledged during the All-Star break, without naming him directly, that Ishbia's decision sidetracked the process.",
      "\u201cThere will be a transaction,\" Manfred said. \"You just need to be patient while they rework.\u201d",
      "The Twins are on track for their lowest attendance total in 16 seasons at Target Field, and an ownership-mandated payroll reduction last year in light of decreased regional television revenue, among other factors, has contributed to a dissatisfied customer base. The Twins traded 10 players off their roster leading up to the July 31 deadline, furthering the frustration.",
      "Word that the Pohlads are staying put certainly won't help the morale of Minnesota baseball fans, who've been waiting for another World Series title since 1991 and saw the investment in the roster plunge right after an American League Central title in 2023. The Twins won a playoff series then, too, their first in 21 years.",
      "\u201cWe see and hear the passion from our partners, the community, and Twins fans. That passion inspires us,\" Pohlad said. \"This ownership group is committed to building a winning team and culture for this region, one that Twins fans are proud to cheer for.\u201d",

      "After going 6-0 with a 0.47 ERA in six starts since the start of July, Eovaldi was tagged for three home runs while allowing season highs of five runs and eight hits in five innings against the Arizona Diamondbacks on Monday night.",
      "The 35-year-old right-hander struck out three, walked one and hit two batters before exiting with Texas down 5-1. He got a no-decision because Rowdy Tellez homered in the bottom of the ninth for the Rangers to tie the game at 6 and force extra innings.",
      "Eovaldi had given up only six runs total over his previous seven starts, and half of those runs came in the same game. There had only been two long balls against him his past 14 games.",
      "When he pitched one-hit ball over eight innings in a 2-0 win over the New York Yankees last Tuesday, it was the 13th time in a 14-game span allowing one or zero runs.

Didn\u2019t speak the language; left my family. It\u2019s a very tough time. Then, obviously, becoming a great player, it\u2019s a reset, too, because the fame, money, the attention, changes (everything), and it\u2019s hard as a 16-year-old to deal with all that. Then obviously my stabbing \u2014 I had to do a huge reset,\" Seles said.",

      "The idea of cage fights at the White House would have seemed improbable when the Fertitta brothers purchased UFC for $2 million in 2001 and put White in charge of the fledging fight promotion.",
      "White helped steer the company into a $4 billion sale in 2016 and broadcast rights deals with Fox and ESPN before landing owner TKO Group's richest one yet \u2014 a seven-year deal with Paramount starting in 2026 worth an average of $1.1 billion a year, with all cards on its streaming platform Paramount+ and select numbered events also set to simulcast on CBS.",
      "ESPN, Amazon and Netflix and other traditional sports broadcast players seemed more in play for UFC rights \u2014 White had previously hinted fights could air across different platforms \u2014 but Paramount was a serious contender from the start of the negotiating window.",
      "The Paramount and UFC deal came just days after Skydance and Paramount officially closed their $8 billion merger \u2014 kicking off the reign of a new entertainment giant after a contentious endeavor to get the transaction over the finish line. White said he was impressed with the vision Skydance CEO David Ellison had for the the global MMA leader early in contract talks and how those plans should blossom now that Ellison is chairman and CEO of Paramount.",
      "\u201cWhen you talk about Paramount, you talk about David Ellison, they're brilliant businessmen, very aggressive, risk takers,\u201d White said. \u201cThey're right up my alley. These are the kind of guys that I like to be in business with.\u201d",
      "The $1.1 billion deals marks a notable jump from the roughly $550 million that ESPN paid each year for UFC coverage today. But UFC\u2019s new home on Paramount will simplify offerings for fans \u2014 with all content set to be available on Paramount+ (which currently costs between $7.99 and $12.99 a month), rather than various pay-per-view fees.",

      "UFC matchmakers were set to meet this week to shape what White said would be a loaded debut Paramount card. The UFC boss noted it was still too early to discuss a potential main event for the White House fight night.",
      "\u201cThis is a 1-of-1 event,\u201d White said.",
      "There are still some moving parts to UFC broadcasts and other television programming it has its hands in as the company moves into the Paramount era. White said there are still moving parts to the deal and that includes potentially finding new homes for \u201cThe Ultimate Fighter,\u201d \u201cRoad To UFC,\u201d and \u201cDana White\u2019s Contender Series.\u201d It's not necessarily a given the traditional 10 p.m. start time for what were the pay-per-view events would stand, especially on nights cards will also air on CBS.",

Again, most of those issues are to-be-determined as UFC and Paramount settle in to the new deal \u2014 with $1.1 billion headed the fight company's way.",
      "\u201cIt will affect fighter pay, big time,\u201d White said. \u201cFrom deal-to-deal, fighter pay has grown, too. Every time we win, everybody wins.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not run it\u2019s course,\u201d White said. \u201cThere were guys out there who were interested in pay-per-view and there were guys out there that weren\u2019t. Wherever we ended up, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to roll with.\u201d",
      "White said UFC archival footage \u201ckills it\u201d in repeat views and those classic bouts also needed a new home once the ESPN deal expires.",

      "\u201cYou have the NFL, the NBA, the UFC, and soccer globally,\u201d White said. \u201cWe\u2019re coming. We\u2019re coming for all of them.\u201d",

      "Shohei Ohtani has homered in his third straight game",
      "ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Shohei Ohtani's latest home run binge hasn't been enough to spark the Los Angeles Dodgers out of a summer malaise that's endangering their customary perch atop the NL West.",
      "Ohtani homered in his third straight game Monday night, hitting his 42nd of the season in the eighth inning of the Dodgers' 7-4 loss to the Los Angeles Angels.",
      "The Dodgers trailed 7-0 when Ohtani connected off Shaun Anderson with one out, driving his fourth homer in five games into the right field bleachers to tie Philadelphia's Kyle Schwarber for the NL lead. Seattle's Cal Raleigh leads the majors with 45 homers.",
      "Ohtani also started a rally: Mookie Betts and Will Smith then singled before Max Muncy brought them home with his 17th homer, trimming the Dodgers' deficit to three runs and inspiring thunderous roars from the Dodgers fans comprising more than half of the Angel Stadium crowd.",
      "But the Dodgers got no closer, with Connor Brogdon and longtime Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen calmly wrapping up the sub-.500 Angels' fifth consecutive win over their crosstown rivals.",
      "The loss shrunk the Dodgers' lead over San Diego in the NL West to just one game \u2014 the smallest cushion since June 14.",
      "\u201cI mean, it\u2019s a really bad loss for us,\u201d Muncy said. \u201cThere\u2019s not really any way of getting around that.\u201d",
      "Ohtani has a 10-game hitting streak in August, his longest of the season, and he has four homers among his nine hits in the Dodgers\u2019 last five games. The two-way superstar is the presumptive front-runner for his fourth MVP award.",
      "Despite his heroics, the Dodgers are 10-12 since the All-Star break.",
      "With meager production across their lineup and inconsistent relief pitching just when their problematic rotation finally started to click, they've only rarely looked like the juggernaut franchise that has won two of the past five World Series, four of the last eight NL pennants and 11 of the last 12 division crowns.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not going well for us right now,\u201d Muncy said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a way to snap out of it. No one is going to feel sorry for us. It\u2019s on us to find our way out of it, and we will.\u201d",
      "A day after the Dodgers' bullpen blew an eighth-inning lead in a 5-4 loss to Toronto, top starter Yoshinobu Yamamoto got raked by the Angels' largely average lineup for six runs on six hits and five walks, creating a hole the Dodgers couldn't escape. The Dodgers began the weekend with two solid performances against the AL-leading Blue Jays, only to fall back into another rut.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all looking for some traction here, and trying to stack some wins,\u201d manager Dave Roberts said. \u201cHate to say that yesterday\u2019s loss carried over to tonight. ... You win yesterday, and you feel even better about coming into today, but now you look at losing two games in a row. It\u2019s baseball, and we\u2019re good at resetting, coming back.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Outgoing USA Gymnastics president and CEO Li Li Leung is looking forward to a break",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- Li Li Leung repeats the question out loud, leans back, and then does something that\u2019s been all too rare during her transformative tenure as the president and CEO of USA Gymnastics.",
      "She stops.",
      "\u201cWhat have I learned?\u201d Leung says again.",
      "After a brief exchange to buy some time, she settles on an answer that, in typical Leung fashion, says a lot by saying only a little.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t had time (to think about it),\" Leung told The Associated Press. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the whole point, is like, I haven\u2019t had time to digest everything that has happened over the past six years.\u201d",
      "One of the many reasons \u2014 and perhaps the main reason \u2014 it's time to step away.",
      "From the day Leung walked into the organization's then dungeon-like Indianapolis office (it has since moved to one with far more natural light) in March 2019 at the height of the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal, through this weekend's U.S. Championships, she has been in perpetual motion.",
      "And while partial blame falls on Leung's inherent work ethic, the reality is the former Michigan gymnast knew she didn't really have a choice. One of the crown jewels of the U.S. Olympic movement was in tatters, fiscally \u2014 USA Gymnastics had all of six weeks of cash flow at the time Leung took over \u2014 and, far more pressingly, culturally.",
      "Trust, both internally and externally, had eroded. Restoring it would take time. It would also take the kind of compassion that Leung's immediate predecessors had been unable to muster.",
      "Before Leung accepted the job, one of her mentors told her to avoid trying to \u201cboil the ocean,\u201d that trying to become everything to everyone was a fool's errand.",
      "It might have been the one bit of advice she received that she didn't take.",
      "\u201cMy response to him was, 'Well, I\u2019m going to boil as much of it as I can,'\" Leung said.",
      "And while the former NBA executive began the process of trying to keep the organization financially viable, Leung knew early on that the most important aspect of her mission was to restore faith among the organization's hundreds of thousands of members, and just as vitally, the hundreds of women who were abused by Nassar under the guise of medical treatment.",
      "While Leung was limited in what she could say publicly as the lengthy mediation process between USA Gymnastics and the survivors played out, she and USAG board chair Kathryn Carson made it a point to attend dozens of hearings, listening to the experiences of the women abused by Nassar and using quiet moments when the tape recorder was off to reconnect.",
      "\u201c(We) had the opportunity to express personally how much we cared about trying to do the right thing and heard their stories directly,\u201d Carson said. \u201cThere were a lot of tears.\u201d",
      "And eventually, progress. While the record $380 million settlement offered a bit of closure, Leung understood it was merely one milepost in a process that she understands will never be over.",
      "When Leung told the organization's leadership group in early June that she was stepping down at the end of the year, her message wasn't to reflect on how far the organization has come, but how far there still is to go.",
      "\u201cI was like \u2018You guys got this,\u2019\u201d Leung said. \u201cAnd they have it. I mean, I think I have instilled in them that we\u2019re never done. There\u2019s always more that can be done, always challenge ourselves to be better. We talk about it in our meetings all the time. \u2018What else can we be doing better?\u2019 And I think they understand that.\u201d",
      "It's one of the reasons why Leung is hesitant to reflect. Growing up in New Jersey, her parents instilled in Leung and her twin sister May May a humbleness that even now, after steering USA Gymnastics out of the darkness, she is reluctant to turn the spotlight on herself.",
      "Leung would much rather deflect, pointing out that the work of the team she assembled is just as important as anything she has done.",
      "It's a trait that \u2014 along with her background in a sport that can be equal parts thrilling and unforgiving \u2014 helped her navigate those crucial early days when everything felt so tenuous.",

      "And do it quietly. Of the many things Leung is, the one thing she is not is performative. When she came on, the list of people critical of the organization was long, loud, distinguished, and, well, justified in its frustration and anger.",
      "While Leung had nothing to do with the systemic breakdowns that created a culture in which the balance of power tilted too far away from the athletes, she understood how important it was to let those most affected be heard and part of the solution.",
      "Leung had been on the job five months when Olympic champion Simone Biles, herself a Nassar survivor, called out USA Gymnastics ahead of the 2019 U.S. Championships for its repeated inability to protect its athletes. Five years later, Biles credited the organization for \u201c putting in the work \u201d to make the changes necessary to restore trust.",
      "Three decades ago, Dominique Moceanu became the youngest national champion in USA Gymnastics history. A year later, she was part of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d that earned Olympic gold at the 1996 Atlanta Games.",
      "Moceanu also \u2014 long before Nassar's crimes came to light \u2014 became an outspoken critic of coaches who were physically and emotionally abusive. She felt like a \u201cpariah\" and figured her relationship with USA Gymnastics was over.",
      "Yet there she was on Sunday night, waving to the crowd inside the Smoothie King Center on the 30th anniversary of her triumph, a full-circle moment that wouldn't have happened without Leung and the changes Moceanu \u2014 who now runs her eponymous gym with her husband Mike just outside Cleveland \u2014 sees in the sport at large.",
      "\u201cLi Li\u2019s been a constant and a stable leader, which has been very good, and I think there are things that are shifting,\u201d Moceanu said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a sign that USAG is starting to heal as well, in a sense, from the wounds and the damage and everything that had happened.\u201d",
      "The healing process, however, is far from over. And Leung is acutely aware that all the progress that's been made over the last six years can unravel quickly without constant vigilance.",
      "\u201cWe want to make our environment as unwelcome a place as possible for predators,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s kind of a philosophy that we use when we talk about how we try to mitigate (problems). How we try and have zero tolerance and create accountability.\u201d",
      "It's telling of how far USA Gymnastics has come on just about every front that a job nobody wanted six years ago \u2014 not even Leung, initially \u2014 is suddenly remarkably more attractive. It helps that membership has risen to more than 240,000 athletes, coaches and gym owners during Leung's watch. The corporate sponsors that fled after Nassar have returned. Just last week USA Gymnastics announced a partnership with NBC Sports that will run through the 2032 Olympics.",
      "Leung is serving as an advisor in the search for her successor. While she thinks it would be \u201cbeneficial\u201d if the next president was a gymnast, she strongly believes whoever it is must be a former athlete.",
      "\u201c(They need) someone who understands sports and understands high-pressure environments and high-pressure competition, in order for that person to be successful,\" she said.",
      "As for Leung, she says she wants a break. The last few months have been challenging in her personal life, reinforcing the need for her to step away and hit reset.",
      "How long that might take, she's not sure, pointing out that how she feels in early August might not be the way she feels on Dec. 31.",
      "Leung has received numerous overtures from other entities in recent years as USA Gymnastics found itself on increasingly firmer footing. She said no to them all. She might say no to them some more before moving on to what's next.",
      "The one thing she will do, however, is listen. If Leung has learned anything over the last six-plus years, it's that. Listening leads to growth, a personal philosophy that has also become one of USA Gymnastics' guiding principles.",
      "Yes, she could use the next three years in the run-up to the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics as a victory lap. That's simply not her way. Her goal when she arrived was to leave the gymnastics community at large in a better place than she found it. While she wouldn't trade a second of the journey it's taken to do just that, she's also aware of the toll it has taken personally.",
      "\u201cThe parallel or the analogy that I would draw to gymnastics is staying in competitive shape this entire time, with no rest,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s only sustainable for so long. So I\u2019m going to finally get my rest.\u201d",

      "DENVER -- A group of rabbits in Colorado with grotesque, horn-like growths may seem straight out of a low-budget horror film, but scientists say there's no reason to be spooked \u2014 the furry creatures merely have a relatively common virus.",

      "The virus likely influenced the centuries-old jackalope myth in North America, which told of a rabbit with antlers or horns, among other animal variations. The disease in rabbits also contributed to scientists' knowledge about the connection between viruses and cancer, such as the human papillomavirus that causes cervical cancer.",
      "The virus in rabbits was named after Dr. Richard E Shope, a professor at The Rockefeller University who discovered the disease in cottontails in the 1930s.",

      "It turns out many Americans misjudge which personal behaviors contribute most to climate change",
      "It turns out many Americans aren't great at identifying which personal decisions contribute most to climate change.",
      "A study recently published by the National Academy of Sciences found that when asked to rank actions, such as swapping a car that uses gasoline for an electric one, carpooling or reducing food waste, participants weren\u2019t very accurate when assessing how much those actions contributed to climate change, which is caused mostly by the release of greenhouse gases that happen when fuels like gasoline, oil and coal are burned.",
      "\"People over-assign impact to actually pretty low-impact actions such as recycling, and underestimate the actual carbon impact of behaviors much more carbon intensive, like flying or eating meat,\" said Madalina Vlasceanu, report co-author and professor of environmental social sciences at Stanford University.",
      "The top three individual actions that help the climate, including avoiding plane flights, choosing not to get a dog and using renewable electricity, were also the three that participants underestimated the most. Meanwhile, the lowest-impact actions were changing to more efficient appliances and swapping out light bulbs, recycling, and using less energy on washing clothes. Those were three of the top four overestimated actions in the report.",
      "Vlasceanu said marketing focuses more on recycling and using energy-efficient light bulbs than on why flights or dog adoption are relatively bad for the climate, so participants were more likely to give those actions more weight.",
      "How the human brain is wired also plays a role.",
      "\u201cYou can see the bottle being recycled. That\u2019s visible. Whereas carbon emissions, that\u2019s invisible to the human eye. So that\u2019s why we don\u2019t associate emissions with flying,\u201d said Jiaying Zhao, who teaches psychology and sustainability at the University of British Columbia.",
      "Zhao added it's easier to bring actions to mind that we do more often. \u201cRecycling is an almost daily action, whereas flying is less frequent. It\u2019s less discussed,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a result, people give a higher psychological weight to recycling.\u201d",
      "Of course, there is also a lot of misleading information. For example, some companies tout the recycling they do while not telling the public about pollution that comes from their overall operations.",
      "\u201cThere has been a lot of deliberate confusion out there to support policies that are really out of date,\" said Brenda Ekwurzel, a climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit.",
      "Dogs are big meat eaters, and meat is a significant contributor to climate change. That is because many of the farm animals, which will become food, release methane, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. Beef is especially impactful, in part because around the world cattle are often raised on land that was illegally deforested. Since trees absorb carbon dioxide, the most abundant greenhouse gas, cutting them to then raise cattle is a double whammy.",
      "\u201cPeople just don\u2019t associate pets with carbon emissions. That link is not clear in people\u2019s minds,\u201d Zhao said.",
      "Not all pets are the same, however. Zhao owns a dog and three rabbits.",

      "Switching to energy that comes from renewable sources, such as solar and wind, has a large positive impact because such sources don't emit greenhouse gases. Some of the biggest climate decisions individuals can make include how they heat and cool their homes and the types of transportation they use. Switching to renewable energy minimizes the impact of both.",
      "Recycling is effective at reducing waste headed for landfill, but its climate impact is relatively small because transporting, processing and repurposing recyclables typically relies on fossil fuels. Plus, less than 10% of plastics actually get recycled, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "Other decisions with overestimated impact, including washing clothes in cold water and switching to more efficient light bulbs, are relatively less important. That is because those appliances have a relatively small impact compared to other things, such plane flights and dogs, so improving on them, while beneficial, has a much more limited influence.",

      "BOSTON -- A manatee was recently spotted off the coast of Massachusetts for the first time in almost a decade and scientists want to monitor its condition to see if a rescue is necessary before it succumbs to the cold water or lack of food, they said Friday.",
      "The threatened species, which makes its habitat in warmer southern Gulf waters in places like Florida, was first seen July 26 off the southwestern coast of Cape Cod in the area of Nantucket Sound. Mashpee resident Jennifer Sullivan took a video of it swimming alongside paddle boarders in an inlet behind a marina surrounded by sea grass.",
      "She said on Monday that she found the manatee, which was as long and wide as her paddleboard, \u201cjust lazing around there in the grass going as slowly as possible.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was completely unfazed by us,\" said Sullivan, who went on to say she felt \u201cjust in awe of how graceful the creature was and to be so close in the wild to it.\u201d",
      "A few days later, the animal was seen stranded on the tidal flats in Mattapoisett. Bystanders who found the manatee beached on the flats around sunrise pushed it back into the water, said Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries Protected Species Program Manager Erin Burke.",
      "It hasn't been spotted since, Burke said, but a team with the International Fund for Animal Welfare is standing by to rescue the animal if it becomes necessary.",
      "The species prefers swimming in warmer waters, usually traveling only as far north as the Carolinas. If the manatee stays in water that is too cold for too long, it could suffer severe illness or death, said New England Aquarium Research Scientist Dr. Nadine Lysiak.",
      "Additionally, manatees are herbivores that sustain themselves on extensive seagrass beds and mangroves not typically found in New England.",
      "\u201cEven if it doesn\u2019t experience cold stunning, it may have some health declines associated with not having enough food, not having enough water,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it\u2019s important to intervene as soon as it's sighted again to prevent health declines.\u201d",
      "Lysiak said it's unclear how and why the manatee found its way so far north. It may have followed the warm water Gulf Stream current system from Florida up past the Carolinas and eventually found its way to New England, she said.",
      "\u201cWe have kind of an average understanding of what a wild population does in terms of their range, or their habitat range, and some individuals will go beyond that and maybe wander or seek out other habitats or other food sources,\" she said. \"It\u2019s hard to know exactly why this manatee came to Cape Cod.\u201d",

      "Scientists from a university are filtering Mexico City's waters for traces of the DNA of an endangered salamander, the axolotl",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Sixty years ago, residents of a canal-crossed borough in Mexico City could pluck axolotls \u2014 the large salamander reminiscent of a tiny dragon \u2014 out of the water with their hands because they were so plentiful. Now it\u2019s almost impossible to find them in the wild.",

      "\u201cWe all shed DNA along our path across the world and that can be captured by filtering air or water,\u201d said biologist Luis Zambrano, from the university's ecological restoration lab.",
      "As they try to monitor the axolotls\u2019 dwindling numbers, scientists increasingly rely on this technique as their nets come back empty during periodic surveys of the population, which is only found in Xochimilco.",
      "They sample water taken from the canals and filter it for environmental DNA, or the genetic particles left by animals and plants that have contact with the water. That\u2019s then compared to the profiles contained in a genetic library put together some years ago by British scientists, said Esther Quintero of Conservation International in Mexico, which has collaborated with Zambrano since 2023.",
      "Scientists collected water from 53 locations in Xochimilco: 10 inside refuges where water is filtered and the water is cleaner and 43 outside those areas. They found axolotl DNA inside the protected areas and in one site outside them.",
      "Referring to the one unprotected area, Zambrano said \u201cit\u2019s very little,\u201d but a sign that there is the possibility of resilience, even with continuing environmental degradation and pollution of the canals.",
      "So far, the researchers have only searched a third of Xochimilco with the environmental DNA technique and the manual work with nets, but they plan to continue the work and hopefully present an updated census early next year.",
      "The trend, however, is not good. From an estimated 6,000 axolotls per square kilometer in 1998, there were only 36 per square kilometer in the last census, in 2014.",

      "TAITA TAVETA, Kenya -- For farmers in the Taita hills in southern Kenya, elephants are a menace: they raid crops and will occasionally injure or even kill people.",
      "Farmer Richard Shika, 68, has had some close encounters. \u201cOne time, I was trying to chase away an elephant that was in my maize field, but it turned and charged me,\u201d Shika remembers. \u201cIt stopped when it was right in front of me, and I managed to jump out of the way.\u201d",
      "He feels lucky to be alive. Almost exactly two years ago, local media reported that a 3-year-old girl had been trampled to death by an elephant in Taita Taveta county, her mother injured.",
      "The area where Shika has his farm is almost surrounded by Kenya\u2019s biggest National Park. The border of Tsavo East National Park is less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) to the east, and Tsavo West curves around to the north, west and south. The parks have always been unfenced, allowing animals to migrate. Increasingly, that puts them in the path of humans.",
      "\u201cThe places and infrastructure that we humans develop hinder the migratory routes and paths which elephants used to take,\u201d explains Yuka Luvonga, who researches human-elephant coexistence for conservation organization Save The Elephants.",
      "Elephants eat about 150 kilograms (330 pounds) of vegetation a day, so keeping them off farms is tricky, especially if forage is scarce elsewhere. \u201cElephants are clever creatures,\u201d says Shika. \u201cThey will try touching a fence, and once they realize that it is not electrified, they charge through.\u201d",
      "If farmers try to chase them off, as Shika did, the elephants will sometimes turn and defend themselves. Kenya Wildlife Service and conservation organizations tracking human-elephant conflict estimate that 30-35 people are killed every year in elephant-related incidents across Kenya.",
      "Communities will sometimes retaliate by spearing or poisoning elephants, but there are other solutions, as farmers here have found.",
      "One of them is bees.",
      "\u201cElephants don\u2019t like getting stung by bees, so they keep away from areas where hives are,\u201d Shika says.",
      "With help from Save The Elephants, Shika is one of 50 farmers who have hung beehives from wires between poles around their farms. If an elephant touches the wire, the hives are rocked, disturbing the bees. It\u2019s an army of tiny security guards that keeps elephants well away from the farm.",
      "\u201cWith hives acting as a fence, I can continue crop-farming and also earn a livelihood from honey,\u201d Shika says. This year, he\u2019s made almost $250 selling honey.",

      "Delivery drones are supposed to be fast, yet the long-promised technology has been slow to take off in the United States",
      "Delivery drones are so fast they can zip a pint of ice cream to a customer\u2019s driveway before it melts.",
      "Yet the long-promised technology has been slow to take off in the United States. More than six years after the Federal Aviation Administration approved commercial home deliveries with drones, the service mostly has been confined to a few suburbs and rural areas.",
      "That could soon change. The FAA proposed a new rule last week that would make it easier for companies to fly drones outside of an operator's line of sight and therefore over longer distances. A handful of companies do that now, but they had to obtain waivers and certification as an air carrier to deliver packages.",
      "While the rule is intended to streamline the process, authorized retailers and drone companies that have tested fulfilling orders from the sky say they plan to make drone-based deliveries available to millions more U.S. households.",
      "Walmart and Wing, a drone company owned by Google parent Alphabet, currently provide deliveries from 18 Walmart stores in the Dallas area. By next summer, they expect to expand to 100 Walmart stores in Atlanta; Charlotte, North Carolina; Houston; and Orlando and Tampa, Florida.",
      "After launching its Prime Air delivery service in College Station, Texas, in late 2022, Amazon received FAA permission last year to operate autonomous drones that fly beyond a pilot's line of sight. The e-commerce company has since expand its drone delivery program to suburban Phoenix and has plans to offer the service in Dallas, San Antonio, Texas, and Kansas City.",
      "The concept of drone delivery has been around for well over a decade. Drone maker Zipline, which works with Walmart in Arkansas and the Dallas-Fort Worth area, began making deliveries to hospitals in Rwanda in 2016. Israel-based Flytrex, one of the drone companies DoorDash works with to carry out orders, launched drone delivery to households in Iceland in 2017.",
      "But Wing CEO Adam Woodworth said drone delivery has been in \u201ctreading water mode\u201d in the U.S. for years, with service providers afraid to scale up because the regulatory framework wasn\u2019t in place.",
      "\u201cYou want to be at the right moment where there\u2019s an overlap between the customer demand, the partner demand, the technical readiness and the regulatory readiness,\u201d Woodworth said. \u201cI think that we\u2019re reaching that planetary alignment right now.\u201d",
      "DoorDash, which works with both Wing and Flytrex, tested drone drop-offs in rural Virginia and greater Dallas before announcing an expansion into Charlotte. Getting takeout food this way may sound futuristic, but it's starting to feel normal in suburban Brisbane, Australia, where DoorDash has employed delivery drones for several years, said Harrison Shih, who leads the company's drone program.",
      "\u201cIt comes so fast and it's something flying into your neighborhood, but it really does seem like part of everyday life,\u201d Shih said.",
      "Even though delivery drones are still considered novel, the cargo they carry can be pretty mundane. Walmart said the top items from the more than 150,000 drone deliveries the nation's largest retailer has completed since 2021 include ice cream, eggs and Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups.",
      "Unlike traditional delivery, where one driver may have a truck full of packages, drones generally deliver one small order at a time. Wing\u2019s drones can carry packages weighing up to 2.5 pounds. They can travel up to 12 miles round trip. One pilot can oversee up to 32 drones.",
      "Zipline has a drone that can carry up to 4 pounds and fly 120 miles round trip. Some drones, like Amazon\u2019s, can carry heavier packages.",
      "Once an order is placed, it's packaged for flight and attached to a drone at a launch site. The drone automatically finds a route that avoids obstacles. A pilot observes as the aircraft flies to its destinations and lowers its cargo to the ground with retractable cords.",
      "Shakiba Enayati, an assistant professor of supply chain and analytics at the University of Missouri, St. Louis, researches ways that drones could speed the delivery of critical health supplies like donated organs and blood samples. The unmanned aircraft offer some advantages as a transport method, such as reduced emissions and improved access to goods for rural residents, Enayati said.",
      "But she also sees plenty of obstacles. Right now, it costs around $13.50 per delivery to carry a package by drone versus $2 for a traditional vehicle, Enayati said. Drones need well-trained employees to oversee them and can have a hard time in certain weather.",

She thinks the same thing could happen with drones, especially as improved technology reduces the chance for errors.",
      "Woodworth added that U.S. airspace is tightly controlled, and companies need to demonstrate to the FAA that their drones are safe and reliable before they are cleared to fly. Even under the proposed new rules, the FAA would set detailed requirements for drone operators.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why it takes so long to build a business in the space. But I think it leads to everybody fundamentally building higher quality things,\u201d Woodworth said.",
      "Others worry that drones may potentially replace human delivery drivers. Shih thinks that\u2019s unlikely. One of DoorDash's most popular items is 24-packs of water, Shih said, which aren't realistic for existing drones to ferry.",
      "\u201cI believe that drone delivery can be fairly ubiquitous and can cover a lot of things. We just don't think its probable today that it\u2019ll carry a 40-pound bag of dog food to you,\" Shih said.",
      "DoorDash said that in the areas where it offers drone deliveries, orders requiring the services of human delivery drivers also increase.",
      "That\u2019s been the experience of John Kim, the owner of PurePoke restaurant in Frisco, Texas. Kim signed on to offer drone deliveries through DoorDash last year. He doesn\u2019t know what percentage of his DoorDash customers are choosing the service instead of regular delivery, but his overall DoorDash orders are up 15% this year.",
      "Kim said he\u2019s heard no complaints from drone delivery customers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very stable, maybe even better than some of the drivers that toss it in the back with all the other orders,\u201d Kim said.",
      "For some, drones can simply be a nuisance. When the FAA asked for public comments on Amazon\u2019s request to expand deliveries in College Station, numerous residents expressed concern that drones with cameras violated their privacy. Amazon says its drones use cameras and sensors to navigate and avoid obstacles but may record overhead videos of people while completing a delivery.",
      "Other residents complained about noise.",
      "\u201cIt sounds like a giant nagging mosquito,\u201d one respondent wrote. Amazon has since released a quieter drone.",
      "But others love the service. Janet Toth of Frisco, Texas, said she saw drone deliveries in Korea years ago and wondered why the U.S. didn\u2019t have them. So she was thrilled when DoorDash began providing drone delivery in her neighborhood.",
      "Toth now orders drone delivery a few times a month. Her 9-year-old daughter Julep said friends often come over to watch the drone.",

      "The tests initially will only affect a sliver of YouTube's audience in the U.S., but it will likely become more pervasive if the system works as well at guessing viewers' ages as it does in other parts of the world. The system will only work when viewers are logged into their accounts, and it will make its age assessments regardless of the birth date a user might have entered upon signing up.",
      "If the system flags a logged-in viewer as being under 18, YouTube will impose the normal controls and restrictions that the site already uses as a way to prevent minors from watching videos and engaging in other behavior deemed inappropriate for that age.",
      "The safeguards include reminders to take a break from the screen, privacy warnings and restrictions on video recommendations. YouTube, which has been owned by Google for nearly 20 years, also doesn't show ads tailored to individual tastes if a viewer is under 18.",

      "Amid rising electric bills, states are under pressure to insulate regular household and business ratepayers from the costs of feeding Big Tech\u2019s energy-hungry data centers",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Amid rising electric bills, states are under pressure to insulate regular household and business ratepayers from the costs of feeding Big Tech's energy-hungry data centers.",
      "It's not clear that any state has a solution and the actual effect of data centers on electricity bills is difficult to pin down. Some critics question whether states have the spine to take a hard line against tech behemoths like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta.",
      "But more than a dozen states have begun taking steps as data centers drive a rapid build-out of power plants and transmission lines.",
      "That has meant pressuring the nation's biggest power grid operator to clamp down on price increases, studying the effect of data centers on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay a larger share of local transmission costs.",
      "Rising power bills are \u201csomething legislators have been hearing a lot about. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve been hearing a lot about. More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I\u2019ve ever seen before,\u201d said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens\u2019 Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. \u201cThere\u2019s a massive outcry.\u201d",
      "Some data centers could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans, and make huge factories look tiny by comparison. That's pushing policymakers to rethink a system that, historically, has spread transmission costs among classes of consumers that are proportional to electricity use.",
      "\u201cA lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,\u201d said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. \u201cI think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.\u201d",
      "A fix, Peskoe said, is a \u201ccan of worms\" that pits ratepayer classes against one another.",
      "Some officials downplay the role of data centers in pushing up electric bills.",
      "Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia\u2019s Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather.",
      "The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share.",
      "But growing evidence suggests that the electricity bills of some Americans are rising to subsidize the massive energy needs of Big Tech as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.",
      "Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren\u2019t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant.",
      "In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes \u2014 residential, commercial and industrial \u2014 are likely paying for data center power needs.",
      "Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% \u2014 or $9.3 billion \u2014 of last year's increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand.",
      "Last year, five governors led by Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro began pushing back against power prices set by the mid-Atlantic grid operator, PJM Interconnection, after that amount spiked nearly sevenfold. They warned of customers \u201cpaying billions more than is necessary.\u201d",

      "The Oregon Citizens\u2019 Utility Board says there is clear evidence that costs to serve data centers are being spread across all customers \u2014 at a time when some electric bills there are up 50% over the past four years and utilities are disconnecting more people than ever.",
      "New Jersey\u2019s governor signed legislation last month commissioning state utility regulators to study whether ratepayers are being hit with \u201cunreasonable rate increases\u201d to connect data centers and to develop a specialized rate to charge data centers.",
      "In some other states, like Texas and Utah, governors and lawmakers are trying to avoid a supply-and-demand crisis that leaves ratepayers on the hook \u2014 or in the dark.",
      "In Indiana, state utility regulators approved a settlement between Indiana Michigan Power Co., Amazon, Google, Microsoft and consumer advocates that set parameters for data center payments for service.",

      "But, he said, state law doesn't force large power users like data centers to publicly reveal their electric usage, so pinning down whether they're paying their fair share of transmission costs \"will be a challenge.\u201d",
      "In a March report, the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard University questioned the motivation of utilities and regulators to shield ratepayers from footing the cost of electricity for data centers.",
      "Both utilities and states have incentives to attract big customers like data centers, it said.",
      "To do it, utilities \u2014 which must get their rates approved by regulators \u2014 can offer \u201cspecial deals to favored customers\u201d like a data center and effectively shift the costs of those discounts to regular ratepayers, the authors wrote. Many state laws can shield disclosure of those rates, they said.",
      "In Pennsylvania, an emerging data center hot spot, the state utility commission is drafting a model rate structure for utilities to consider adopting. An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking about real transmission upgrades, potentially hundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d commission chairman Stephen DeFrank said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what you don\u2019t want the ratepayer to get stuck paying for.\"",

      "More than 70 million Americans have experienced the muggiest start to summer on record, with climate change increasing humidity in the Eastern U.S. An Associated Press analysis shows that parts of 20 states and Washington, D",
      "More than 70 million Americans sweated through the muggiest first two months of summer on record as climate change has noticeably dialed up the Eastern United States' humidity in recent decades, an Associated Press data analysis shows.",
      "And that meant uncomfortably warm and potentially dangerous nights in many cities the last several weeks, the National Weather Service said.",
      "Parts of 27 states and Washington, D.C., had a record amount of days that meteorologists call uncomfortable \u2014 with average daily dew points of 65 degrees Fahrenheit or higher \u2014 in June and July, according to data derived from the Copernicus Climate Service.",
      "And that's just the daily average. In much of the East, the mugginess kept rising to near tropical levels for a few humid hours. Philadelphia had 29 days, Washington had 27 days and Baltimore had 24 days where the highest dew point simmered to at least 75 degrees, which even the the weather service office in Tampa calls oppressive, according to weather service data.",
      "Dew point is a measure of moisture in the air expressed in degrees that many meteorologists call the most accurate way to describe humidity. The summer of 2025 so far has had dew points that average at least 6 degrees higher than the 1951-2020 normals in Washington, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Richmond, Columbus and St. Louis, the AP calculations show. The average June and July humidity for the entire country east of the Rockies rose to more than 66 degrees, higher than any year since measurements started in 1950.",
      "\u201cThis has been a very muggy summer. The humid heat has been way up,\u201d said Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at Climate Central.",
      "Twice this summer climate scientist and humidity expert Cameron Lee of Kent State University measured dew points of about 82 degrees at his home weather station in Ohio. That's off the various charts that the weather service uses to describe what dew points feel like.",
      "\u201cThere are parts of the United States that are experiencing not only greater average humidity, especially in the spring and summer, but also more extreme humid days,\u201d Lee said. He said super sticky days are now stretching out over more days and more land.",
      "High humidity doesn't allow the air to cool at night as much as it usually does, and the stickiness contributed to multiple nighttime temperature records from the Ohio Valley through the Mid-Atlantic and up and down coastal states, said Zack Taylor, forecast operations chief at the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center. Raleigh, Charlotte, Nashville, Virginia Beach, Va., and Wilmington, N.C., all reached records for the hottest overnight lows. New York City, Columbus, Atlanta, Richmond, Knoxville, Tennessee and Concord, New Hampshire came close, he said.",
      "\u201cWhat really impacts the body is that nighttime temperature,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cSo if there\u2019s no cooling at night or if there\u2019s a lack of cooling it doesn\u2019t allow your body to cool off and recover from what was probably a really hot afternoon. And so when you start seeing that over several days, that can really wear out the body, especially of course if you don\u2019t have access to cooling centers or air conditioning.\u201d",
      "An extra hot and rainy summer weather pattern is combining with climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, Woods Placky said.",
      "The area east of the Rockies has on average gained about 2.5 degrees in summer dew point since 1950, the AP analysis of Copernicus data shows. In the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and part of the 1990s, the eastern half of the country had an average dew point in the low 60s, what the weather service calls noticeable but OK. In four of the last six years that number has been near and even over the uncomfortable line of 65.",

      "Mountain resorts near Sarajevo are shifting from snow sports to summer tourism",
      "SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina -- A short drive from the Mediterranean coast, mid-altitude mountain resorts near Sarajevo \u2014 traditionally dependent on snow sports \u2014 are slowly but steadily pivoting to attract summertime tourists.",
      "Despite Bosnia\u2019s notoriously poor record-keeping, tourism officials in the mountainous Balkan country of 3.3 million say a clear trend is emerging.",
      "\u201cWe used to rely on snow, but there is no escaping the fact that snow is now likely to fall and accumulate at altitudes above 2,500 meters (8,000 feet) and our mountains are simply not that high,\u201d said Haris Fazlagic, the Sarajevo tourism board president.",
      "Fazlagic believes that by expanding their summer offerings, mountain resorts can lure tourists away from the scorching heat and high costs of traditional seaside vacations along the Adriatic coast of Croatia and Montenegro. He said increasing the area's year-round appeal is \u201cthe future of tourism,\u201d but acknowledged it\u2019s a long-term strategy.",
      "In 2017, after several winters with little snow, the Jahorina and Bjelasnica mountains near Sarajevo began to expand their summer offerings. These mountains, which hosted the 1984 Winter Olympics, have elevations of 1,906 meters (6,253 feet) and 2,067 meters (6,781 feet), respectively.",
      "They now operate ski lifts year-round for scenic views and are steadily adding new hiking, biking and ATV trails and tours.",
      "\u201cThe weather here is fantastic \u2014 it's not hot at all,\" said Dusko Kurtovic, a visitor from the Bosnian town of Doboj, while on a walk during a short vacation in Jahorina last week.",
      "Like other visitors exploring the forest trails and riding ski lifts around Sarajevo, Kurtovic was dressed for balmy summer weather. Temperatures here typically stay between 24 and 30 degrees Celsius (75-86 degrees Fahrenheit).",
      "The weather is a welcome change for tourists, as coastal regions in Central and Eastern Europe have experienced increasingly frequent and prolonged heat waves, with daily temperatures often reaching 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in the past few years.",

      "Business might be growing in the mountains of Sarajevo, but it remains far less profitable than seaside destinations in neighboring Croatia, where tourism accounts for up to 20% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product.",
      "Just a five-hour drive from Sarajevo, the ancient city of Dubrovnik is grappling with an abundance of tourists. Unlike their Bosnian counterparts who are trying to increase visitors, Dubrovnik\u2019s tourism authorities are focused on managing crowds, limiting the number of tourists from cruise ships in the city to 4,000 at any one time during the day and restricting traffic around the Old Town to local permit holders.",
      "Despite these restrictions and extreme summer heat, Dubrovnik recorded nearly two million overnight stays in the first seven months of 2025, almost double that of the Sarajevo region.",
      "While climate change is driving Bosnia and Croatia toward different tourism strategies, both countries share a common objective: to \u201cextend the season\u201d and become a \u201cyear-round tourist destination,\u201d in the words of Aida Hodzic of the Dubrovnik tourism board.",

      "The temporary order doesn\u2019t include any restrictions on law enforcement or immigration enforcement activity at the center, which is currently holding hundreds of detainees. The center, which was quickly built two months ago at a lightly used, single-runway training airport, is designed to eventually hold up to 3,000 detainees in temporary tent structures.",

      "The judge last week said the detention facility was, at a minimum, a joint partnership between the state and federal government.",
      "Witnesses for the environmental groups have testified that at least 20 acres (8 hectares) of asphalt have been added to the site since the Florida Division of Emergency Management began construction. They said additional paving could lead to an increase in water runoff to the adjacent wetlands, spread harmful chemicals into the Everglades and reduce the habitat for endangered Florida panthers.",
      "Amy Castaneda, the Miccosukee Tribe's water resource director, testified Tuesday that nutrient runoff from the detention center could flow into tribal lands, changing vegetation growth. That could lead to fish kills and block humans and wildlife from moving throughout certain areas, she said.",
      "Marcel Bozas, director of the Miccosukee Tribe's fish and wildlife department, said tribe members hunt and fish for subsistence and cultural reasons. Sustained human activity can drive away game animals, like whitetail deer, as well as protected species, like Florida panthers, wood storks, eastern black rails and bonneted bats, he said.",

      "Miami\u2019s Freedom Tower stood as a beacon of hope for Cubans fleeing communist rule at the height of the Cold War",
      "MIAMI -- For decades, its powerful lighthouse illuminated Miami\u2019s Biscayne Bay, and during the height of the Cold War, what was known as the Freedom Tower stood as a beacon of hope for hundreds of thousands of Cubans fleeing communist rule.",
      "The 14-story Spanish Revival skyscraper was where, from 1962 to 1974, the U.S. State Department welcomed Cuban refugees with medical services, English classes, and comfort kits containing essentials and something wholly exotic to the new arrivals: peanut butter.",
      "After decades of neglect, what was once Miami\u2019s tallest building is getting a well-deserved facelift. Next month, it will reopen as a museum honoring the history of Cuban exiles with immersive, state-of-the-art exhibits that explore the meaning of migration, freedom and homeland.",
      "The reopening of what\u2019s dubbed the Ellis Island of the South comes at a sensitive moment. Cuban Americans \u2014 who dominate politics in Miami \u2014 voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in the last presidential election. But the president\u2019s crackdown on migrants \u2014 including Cubans \u2014 is increasingly viewed as a betrayal and has left many second-guessing that support. Not surprisingly, recent protests against Trump have gathered outside the tower.",
      "The organizers of the museum, while tiptoeing around the present-day politics, are nonetheless unapologetic in their embrace of the American dream. In Miami, a thriving crossroads where 70% of residents speak Spanish as their first language and more than half are foreign-born, compassion for migrants runs deep.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s cyclical,\u201d said Rene Ramos, the head archivist at Miami Dade College, which spearheaded the $65 million renovation. \u201cThis country has had moments where it clearly saw the value of immigrants and other moments when it did not. What we\u2019re doing here is reminding people what immigrants can accomplish when they\u2019re given the opportunity.\u201d",
      "The iconic building opened in 1925 as the headquarters of the once-acclaimed Miami Daily News, which shuttered decades ago. It was designed, in the style of a Moorish bell tower from Seville, Spain, by the New York architectural firm Schultze & Weaver, which was behind some of the most glamorous hotels, theaters and office towers of the era.",
      "It was renamed the Freedom Tower when President John F. Kennedy launched the Cuban Refugee Assistance Program to resettle the streams of middle-class individuals and families fleeing Fidel Castro\u2019s revolution. It\u2019s estimated that nearly 400,000 Cubans relied on services provided at the tower by the U.S. government in coordination with the then-fledgling Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Miami. The total cost of the refugee assistance ran over $730 million by 1971 \u2014 almost $6 billion in today's dollars \u2014 a U.S. government report from that year found.",
      "Known to the Spanish-speaking migrants as \u201cEl Refugio,\u201d or \u201cThe Refuge,\u201d it was a safe place to get vaccines, fill out paperwork, and receive financial assistance of around $120 per month. In the Grand Hall, with its giant windows and Corinthian columns, the Pizarra de la Suerte \u2014 the Bulletin Board of Good Luck \u2014 carried job notices to help the Cubans adjust to their new life, according to a replica of the hall in the museum.",
      "At the time, metropolitan Miami was a tropical tourist town, with fewer than 1 million inhabitants. Most \u00e9migr\u00e9s fanned out across the United States.",
      "\u201cThey weren\u2019t staying in Miami because they didn\u2019t want warmth and sunshine. There were no jobs,\u201d said Madeline Pumariega, the president of Miami Dade College, whose own Cuban parents hightailed it to Amarillo, Texas, after arriving here.",

But he still wells up recalling the hardship of his departure \u2014 when Cuban customs officials ripped open his teddy bear looking for contraband jewelry \u2014 and arriving in Miami on a \u201cFreedom Flight\u201d paid for by the U.S. government and being immediately shuttled in a school bus from the tarmac to the Freedom Tower.",
      "\u201cThe memories never go away,\u201d said Malag\u00f3n, who recalls being welcomed with a bar of unfamiliar peanut butter and a block of government cheese. \u201cTo this day, a grilled cheese sandwich with cheap, Velveeta processed cheese is still comfort food to me.\u201d",
      "The Freedom Tower, a national historic landmark, was long ago overtaken by Miami\u2019s fast-growing steel and glass skyline. Abandoned for years, it was rescued in 1997 by Cuban American businessman Jorge Mas Canosa, a top exile opponent of Castro. He later sold it to a prominent Cuban American family and it was then donated to Miami Dade College.",
      "Even in a dilapidated state, the tower remained a mecca of the Cuban diaspora. In 2003, tens of thousands of salsa fans gathered here to show their respects to Cuban-born singer Celia Cruz. And Secretary of State Marco Rubio, whose parents migrated from Cuba, used it as the backdrop to announce his bid for the U.S. presidency in 2015.",

They include exhibits dedicated to Victims of Communism, the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion that the CIA organized against Castro, and the 14,000 unaccompanied minors sent by their parents as part of the U.S.-led Operation Peter Pan.",
      "Giant media screens project scenes of protest and acts of courage by newer residents of the Magic City fleeing persecution in Venezuela, Haiti and Nicaragua. There\u2019s also a makeshift recording studio for those who passed through the Freedom Tower to add their testimony to an archive of over 300 oral history interviews with exiles, including prominent voices like singer Gloria Estefan.",
      "Emerging from the dark galleries of often traumatic stories of dislocation and exile, the museum\u2019s final stop is a gallery flooded with all the sun, salsa and pastel hues that make modern-day Miami so beloved.",
      "\u201cMiami and the world would not be what it is today without them,\u201d said Pumariega. \u201cThat\u2019s important and so is the contributions that immigrants play in our country, and I think will continue to play beyond this moment.\u201d",

      "MANILA, Philippines -- The United States deployed two warships on Wednesday in a disputed South China Sea shoal, where two Chinese navy and coast guard ships collided two days ago while trying to drive away a smaller Philippine ship in a high-seas accident captured on video, alarming several Western and Asian countries.",
      "Both China and the Philippines claim Scarborough Shoal and other outcroppings in the South China Sea. Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also lay overlapping claims in the contested waters.",
      "The USS Higgins, a guided missile destroyer, and USS Cincinnati, a littoral combat ship, were shadowed by a Chinese navy ship while sailing about 30 nautical miles (55 kilometers) from the Scarborough Shoal. There were no reports of any untoward incident, Philippine coast guard Commodore Jay Tarriela said, citing information from U.S. officials and a Philippine surveillance flight.",
      "The U.S. Navy has staged what it calls freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea for years to challenge China\u2019s restrictions and demand for entry notifications in virtually the entire stretch of the disputed waters that it claims. That has angered China and its forces have had close runs-in with U.S. warships and aircraft on such patrols in international waters and airspace.",
      "The deployment happened after Washington\u2019s ambassador to Manila, MaryKay Carlson, condemned on Tuesday \u201cthe latest reckless action by China directed against a Philippine vessel\u201d in Scarborough. The rich fishing atoll off the northwestern Philippines has been the scene of increasingly tense confrontations between the Chinese and Philippine coast guard, fishing and other ships in recent years.",
      "The Philippines is the oldest treaty ally of the U.S. in Asia. Washington has repeatedly warned that it\u2019s obligated to defend the Philippines if Filipino forces come under an armed attack, including in the South China Sea.",
      "On Monday, a Chinese navy destroyer and a Chinese coast guard ship accidentally collided while trying to block and drive away a smaller Philippine coast guard ship, the BRP Suluan, about 10.5 nautical miles (19 kilometers) from Scarborough. Video footages made public by the Philippine coast guard show the Chinese coast guard ship blasting its powerful water cannon and a number of Chinese personnel standing at the bow shortly before that section was hit by the fast-turning Chinese navy ship.",
      "Shortly after the collision, the video shows the heavily shattered bow of the Chinese coast guard ship without the Chinese personnel, who were standing on deck before the crash. The Chinese navy ship sustained deep dents and what appeared to be linear gushes on its hull.",

In the future, the FWC foresees a bear hunt between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31, subject to more studies about the effect of hunting and the population of the animals.

      "School district officials have released text messages, personnel files and student records of the shooter from the 2022 attack at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, that killed 19 students and two teachers",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- The teenage gunman in the 2022 Robb Elementary School massacre entered school in Uvalde, Texas, as a bright learner before years of escalating academic and behavioral troubles that preceded him opening fire on a fourth-grade classroom, according to records released Monday.",
      "The school files reveal in greater detail 18-year-old Salvador Ramos\u2019 downward spiral that authorities have well documented since the attack that killed 19 children and two teachers. One assessment shows Ramos described as a \u201cmotivated thinker and learner\u201d in kindergarten, but by middle school, he was suspended or written up multiple times for harassment, bullying and failing to meet the minimum statewide testing standards.",
      "In October 2021 \u2014 seven months before the shooting \u2014 Ramos withdrew from high school because of \u201cpoor academic performance, lack of attendance\" and records showed he had failing grades in nearly all classes.",
      "The records are among thousands of pages released by the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District following a yearslong legal battle to withhold documents connected to one of the deadliest classroom attacks in U.S. history.",
      "Many of the documents offer scant new revelations surrounding the attack and the gunman, whose troubled history has been laid out in previous state and federal investigations. Nor do the records \u2014 which do not include any video from the day of the shooting \u2014 shed light on the hesitant and widely criticized police response.",
      "The documents include the personnel file of former Uvalde schools police chief Pete Arredondo, one of two officers facing criminal charges over the slow law enforcement response, and emails to and from school administrators in the days and weeks after the attack.",
      "At 11:40 a.m. on the day of the shooting, Arredondo received a text from a school district secretary noting that another employee reported hearing gunfire outside the school.",
      "\u201cThey went ahead and locked themselves down,\u201d the text to Arredondo read.",
      "Arredondo and Adrian Gonzales, another former Uvalde school district officer, are the only responding officers who face criminal charges for their actions that day. They both have pleaded not guilty to multiple counts of child endangerment and abandonment and are scheduled for trial later this year.",
      "Media organizations, including The Associated Press, sued the district and county in 2022 for the release of their records related to the mass shooting that killed 19 students and two teachers. A Texas appeals court in July upheld a lower court\u2019s ruling that the records must be released.",
      "The records are not the public\u2019s first glimpse inside one of the nation\u2019s deadliest mass shootings and the slow law enforcement response that has been widely condemned. Last year, city officials in Uvalde released police body cam videos and recordings of 911 calls.",
      "Salvador Ramos' academic records showed a student who as a kindergartener was described as \u201ca remarkable little boy\u201d who was a \u201cvery hard worker,\u201d but he went on to be suspended multiple times in junior high and withdrew from high school because of \u201cpoor academic performance.\u201d",
      "The records showed a student spiraling further into academic and behavioral problems, cut classes and confrontations with teachers through middle school. By ninth grade, he was classified as \u201cat risk.\u201d",

      "Arredondo has been the target of much of the blame for the law enforcement response that saw nearly 400 local, state and federal officers wait more than 70 minutes before confronting the gunman in a classroom filled with dead and wounded children and teachers as parents outside begged them to go in.",
      "The Arredondo emails after the shooting show a chief still being asked questions about security at district events, concerns about someone who liked Ramos' social media posts and a note from a district administrator 12 days after the attack that asked: \u201cHow are you today?\"",
      "The Uvalde district placed Arredondo on paid leave on June 22 in a letter that told him he was not to enter any district building, go on any campus or attend any school activity. The letter also directed Arredondo to cooperate with any investigation and not to discuss the investigation with district employees.",
      "Text messages between a group of Uvalde school staffers show in the days after the shooting, officials briefly noted criticisms of the response but avoided responding via text message. One exchange noted a law enforcement timeline that included a 77-minute delay. Another referenced a news article where a Texas Department of Public Safety spokesperson was pressed on the delayed response.",

      "U.S. lawmakers are urging the Trump administration to maintain a security partnership with Australia and the United Kingdom to supply nuclear-powered submarines",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. lawmakers from both parties are urging the Trump administration to maintain a three-way security partnership designed to supply Australia with nuclear-powered submarines \u2014 a plea that comes as the Pentagon reviews the agreement and considers the questions it has raised about the American industrial infrastructure's shipbuilding capabilities.",
      "Two weeks ago, the Defense Department announced it would review AUKUS, the 4-year-old pact signed by the Biden administration with Australia and the United Kingdom. The announcement means the Republican administration is looking closely at a partnership that many believe is critical to the U.S. strategy to push back China's influence in the Indo-Pacific. The review is expected to be completed in the fall.",
      "\u201cAUKUS is essential to strengthening deterrence in the Indo-Pacific and advancing the undersea capabilities that will be central to ensuring peace and stability,\" Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan and Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois wrote in a July 22 letter to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Moolenaar chairs the House panel on China and Krishnamoorthi is its top Democrat.",
      "The review comes as the Trump administration works to rebalance its global security concerns while struggling with a hollowed-out industrial base that has hamstrung U.S. capabilities to build enough warships. The review is being led by Elbridge Colby, the No. 3 Pentagon official, who has expressed skepticism about the partnership.",
      "\u201cIf we can produce the attack submarines in sufficient number and sufficient speed, then great. But if we can\u2019t, that becomes a very difficult problem,\" Colby said during his confirmation hearing in March. \u201cThis is getting back to restoring our defense industrial capacity so that we don\u2019t have to face these awful choices but rather can be in a position where we can produce not only for ourselves, but for our allies.\"",
      "As part of the $269 billion AUKUS partnership, the United States will sell three to five Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines to Australia, with the first delivery scheduled as soon as 2032. The U.S. and the U.K. would help Australia design and build another three to five attack submarines to form an eight-boat force for Australia.",
      "A March report by the Congressional Research Service warned that the lack of U.S. shipbuilding capacities, including workforce shortage and insufficient supply chains, is jeopardizing the much-celebrated partnership. If the U.S. should sell the vessels to Australia, the U.S. Navy would have a shortage of attack submarines for two decades, the report said.",
      "The Navy has been ordering two boats per year in the last decade, but U.S. shipyards have been only producing 1.2 Virginia-class subs a year since 2022, the report said.",
      "\u201cThe delivery pace is not where it needs to be\" to make good on the first pillar of AUKUS, Admiral Daryl Caudle, nominee for the Chief of Naval Operations, told the Senate Armed Services Committee last month.",
      "Australia has invested $1 billion in the U.S. submarine industrial base, with another $1 billion to be paid before the end of this year. It has agreed to contribute a total of $3 billion to uplift the U.S. submarine base, and it has sent both industry personnel to train at U.S. shipyards and naval personnel for submarine training in the United States.",
      "\"Australia was clear that we would make a proportionate contribution to the United States industrial base,\u201d an Australian defense spokesperson said in July. \u201cAustralia\u2019s contribution is about accelerating U.S. production rates and maintenance to enable the delivery of Australia\u2019s future Virginia-class submarines.\u201d",

      "Rudd expressed confidence that the two governments \u201cwill work our way through this stuff.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe right answer is not to be content with the current pace of submarine building. It\u2019s to increase the pace,\" Jones said.",
      "Jennifer Parker, who has served more than 20 years with the Royal Australian Navy and founded Barrier Strategic Advisory, said it should not be a zero-sum game. \u201cYou might sell one submarine to Australia, so you have one less submarine on paper. But in terms of the access, you have the theater of choice from operating from Australia, from being able to maintain your submarines from Australia,\" Parker said. \u201cThis is not a deal that just benefits Australia.\"",
      "Defense policy is one of the few areas where Republican lawmakers have pushed back against the Trump administration, but their resolve is being tested with the Pentagon\u2019s review of AUKUS. So far, they have joined their Democratic colleagues in voicing support for the partnership.",

      "FIFA is testing a new protocol for the 2026 World Cup in North America, requiring host committees to develop human rights action plans",
      "ATLANTA -- Human rights scandals have marred World Cup tournaments for years, but FIFA is testing a new protocol requiring all host committees to develop action plans to protect human rights for the 2026 games in North America.",
      "With the games less than a year away, though, FIFA\u2019s commitment to upholding human rights is still under scrutiny. Human rights advocates who wanted more enforceable standards and clearer directions for local officials say FIFA watered down a more robust model for the plans.",
      "\u201cEven though where we landed is very different than what we had consulted them on, the existence of the framework is in many ways unprecedented. Sports bodies have not had human rights frameworks that reflected the breadth of issues covered across so many jurisdictions. But the plan is just a plan. It's not self-executing,\u201d said Jennifer Li, director of the O'Neill Institute's Center for Community Health Innovation at Georgetown Law and national coordinator of the Dignity 2026 Coalition, which is working with FIFA on human rights.",
      "Adding to advocates' unease, several U.S. host committees said they couldn\u2019t meet a March deadline for an early draft of their plans. A FIFA spokesperson said the governing body has been working closely with host cities and counties, which they say are on track to develop final action plans by the Aug. 29 deadline. Sixteen North American sites will host games, including 11 in the U.S.",
      "Human rights concerns in North America look different from those in other countries where FIFA has come under fire, which had few protections for workers and massive stadium and transportation construction projects. Migrant workers labored in Qatar\u2019s scorching heat for more than a decade before the 2022 World Cup there, and human rights advocates worry migrant workers\u2019 lives are again at risk in Saudi Arabia, which will host the games in 2034.",
      "FIFA\u2019s suggestions for the 2026 plans include guidelines on nondiscrimination, security, preventing trafficking, protecting unhoused people and workers\u2019 rights, including for migrant workers.",
      "\u201cThe host communities are quite invested in their legacy, so they\u2019ve stepped up,\u201d said labor rights expert Deborah Greenfield, who is in an expert advisory group supporting FIFA\u2019s human rights work for 2026.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump has ramped up immigration enforcement across the country, stirring fears that federal law enforcement officers will arrest workers and even travelers during the games. Trump imposed a travel ban on 12 countries in June, and seven face restrictions.",
      "FIFA President Gianni Infantino has close ties to Trump. A FIFA spokesperson said it is working with a White House task force to \u201cbring millions of people from different nations and communities\u201d together in the U.S.",
      "Protesters in Miami-Dade County gathered outside FIFA\u2019s offices in June to demand that the governing body protect travelers and workers and speak out against Trump\u2019s immigration moves. That came after a Club World Cup event hosted in the area by Spanish-language TV network Telemundo was canceled after an unexpected Coast Guard inspection involving at least one Border Patrol agent, local outlets reported.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee that you might not have ICE posted up at the World Cup,\" South Florida AFL-CIO President Jeff Mitchell said.",
      "Local organizers don't seem to have their human rights plan ready and haven't agreed to meet with the union, Mitchell said. He noted that the region has a history of wage theft in a state with weak heat protection laws for workers.",
      "\u201cOrganizations like FIFA like to say that they have these human rights efforts, but they aren\u2019t pushing it,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cThey\u2019re leaving it up to the locals to do it. What tends to happen is everybody gets their bag and then they turn a blind eye to making sure people are getting paid properly or not being harassed.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Mexico sent 26 high-ranking cartel figures to the United States Tuesday in the latest major deal with the Trump administration as American authorities ratchet up pressure on criminal networks smuggling drugs across the border.",
      "Those handed over to U.S. custody include Abigael Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia, a leader of \u201cLos Cuinis,\u201d a group closely aligned with notorious cartel Jalisco New Generation or CJNG. Another defendant, Roberto Salazar, is wanted in connection to the 2008 killing of a Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s deputy. Other prominent figures have ties to the Sinaloa Cartel and other violent drug trafficking groups.",
      "The transfers are a milestone for the Trump administration, which is made dismantling dangerous drug cartels a key Justice Department priority. It\u2019s the second time in months that Mexico has expelled cartel figures accused of narcotics smuggling, murder and other crimes amid mounting pressure from the Trump administration to curb the flow of drugs onto American streets.",
      "\u201cThese 26 men have all played a role in bringing violence and drugs to American shores \u2014 under this Department of Justice, they will face severe consequences for their crimes against this country,\u201d Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. \u201cWe are grateful to Mexico\u2019s National Security team for their collaboration in this matter.\u201d",
      "The cartel figures were put on planes to the U.S. after the Justice Department agreed not to seek the death penalty against any of the defendants or against any cartel leaders and members sent to the U.S. in February. That transfer was of 29 cartel figures, including drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, who was behind the killing of a U.S. DEA agent in 1985.",
      "\u201cThis transfer is yet another example of what is possible when two governments stand united against violence and impunity,\u201d U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Ronald Johnson said in a statement. \u201cThese fugitives will now face justice in U.S. courts, and the citizens of both of our nations will be safer from these common enemies.\u201d",
      "The February transfers came as Mexican officials were trying to head off the Trump administration\u2019s threat of imposing tariffs on Mexican imports. Late last month, President Donald Trump spoke with Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum and agreed to put off threatened 30% tariffs for another 90 days to allow for negotiations.",
      "Sheinbaum has shown a willingness to cooperate more on security than her predecessor, specifically being more aggressive in pursuit of Mexico\u2019s cartels. But she has drawn a clear line when it comes to Mexico\u2019s sovereignty, rejecting suggestions by Trump and others of intervention by the U.S. military.",
      "Also included in the group expelled Tuesday was Servando G\u00f3mez Martinez, also known as \u201cLa Tuta,\u201d a former school teacher who became one of Mexico\u2019s most-wanted drug lords as head of the Knights Templar cartel.

I don't live by no code, you know? So I guess it's because I'm a rapper. People just threw that on me.

      "Fania Records announced Palmieri's death Wednesday evening. Palmieri's daughter, Gabriela,\u00a0told The New York Times that her father died earlier that day at his home in New Jersey after \"an extended illness.\"",
      "The pianist, composer and bandleader was the first Latino to win a Grammy Award and would win seven more over a career that spanned nearly 40 albums.",
      "Palmieri's family released the following statement:",
      "\"Eddie Palmieri, the legendary Puerto Rican pianist, composer, arranger, and bandleader, passed away on August 6, 2025, at the age of 88, leaving behind a transformative legacy in Latin jazz and salsa. A ten-time Grammy Award winner and the first-ever recipient of a Grammy for Latin music, Palmieri revolutionized the genre with his bold, percussive style and deep Afro-Caribbean roots, founding the groundbreaking band La Perfecta and mentoring generations of musicians over a remarkable seven-decade career. He was predeceased by his beloved wife of 60 years, Iraida, whom he lovingly called 'Mi Luz Mayor,' and is survived by his children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and a global community of friends and collaborators who felt his passion and generosity. Featured proudly in Spike Lee's upcoming film Highest 2 Lowest, Palmieri's influence transcended music -- his rhythm changed the world, and his spirit will live on in every beat he inspired.\"",
      "\"Being a piano player is one thing. Being a pianist is another.\"",
      "Palmieri was born in New York's Spanish Harlem on Dec. 15, 1936, at a time when music was seen as a way out of the ghetto. He began studying the piano at an early age, like his famous brother Charlie Palmieri, but at age 13 he began playing timbales in his uncle's orchestra, overcome with a desire for the drums.",
      "He eventually abandoned the instrument and went back to the playing piano.",
      "\"I'm a frustrated percussionist, so I take it out on the piano,\" the musician once said in his website biography.",
      "His first Grammy win came in 1975 for the album \"The Sun of Latin Music,\" and he kept releasing music into his 80s, performing through the coronavirus pandemic via livestreams.",
      "In a 2011 interview with The Associated Press, when asked if he had anything important left to do, he responded with his usual humility and good humor: \"Learning to play the piano well. ... Being a piano player is one thing. Being a pianist is another.\"",
      "Palmieri dabbled in tropical music as a pianist during the 1950s with the Eddie Forrester Orchestra. He later joined Johnny Segu\u00ed's band and Tito Rodr\u00edguez's before forming his own band in 1961, La Perfecta, alongside trombonist Barry Rogers and singer Ismael Quintana.",
      "La Perfecta was the first to feature a trombone section instead of trumpets, something rarely seen in Latin music. With its unique sound, the band quickly joined the ranks of Machito, Tito Rodr\u00edguez, and other Latin orchestras of the time.",
      "Pioneering Grammy winner's career spanned decades and genres",
      "Palmieri produced several albums on the Alegre and Tico Records labels, including the 1971 classic \"V\u00e1monos pa'l monte,\" with his brother, Charlie, as guest organist. Charlie Palmieri died in 1988.",
      "Eddie's unconventional approach would surprise critics and fans again that year with the release of \"Harlem River Drive,\" in which he fused Black and Latin styles to produce a sound that encompassed elements of salsa, funk, soul and jazz.",
      "Later, in 1974, he recorded \"The Sun of Latin Music\" with a young Lalo Rodr\u00edguez. The album became the first Latin production to win a Grammy.",
      "The following year he recorded the album \"Eddie Palmieri & Friends in Concert, Live at the University of Puerto Rico,\" considered by many fans to be a salsa gem.",
      "In the 1980s, he won two more Grammy Awards, for the albums \"Palo pa' rumba\" (1984) and \"Solito\" (1985). A few years later, he introduced the vocalist La India to the salsa world with the production \"Lleg\u00f3 La India v\u00eda Eddie Palmieri.\"",
      "Palmieri released the album \"Masterpiece\" in 2000, which teamed him with the legendary Tito Puente, who died that year. It was a hit with critics and won two Grammy Awards. The album was also chosen as the most outstanding production of the year by the National Foundation for Popular Culture of Puerto Rico.",
      "During his long career, he participated in concerts and recordings with the Fania All-Stars and Tico All-Stars, standing out as a composer, arranger, producer, and orchestra director.",
      "In 1988, the Smithsonian Institute recorded two of Palmieri's concerts for the catalog of the National Museum of American History in Washington.",
      "Yale University in 2002 awarded him the Chubb Fellowship Award, an award usually reserved for international heads of state, in recognition of his work in building communities through music.",
      "In 2005, he made his debut on National Public Radio as the host of the program \"Caliente,\" which was carried by more than 160 radio stations nationwide.",
      "He worked with renowned musicians such as timbalero Nicky Marrero, bassist Israel \"Cachao\" L\u00f3pez, trumpeter Alfredo \"Chocolate\" Armenteros, trombonist Lewis Khan, and Puerto Rican bassist Bobby Valent\u00edn.",
      "In 2010, Palmieri said he felt a bit lonely musically due to the deaths of many of the rumberos with whom he enjoyed playing with.",
      "As a musical ambassador, he brought salsa and Latin jazz to places as far afield as North Africa, Australia, Asia and Europe, among others.",

      "When astronaut James Lovell (March 25, 1928-Aug. 7, 2025) was launched aboard Apollo 8, just four days before Christmas 1968, NASA's flight director believed they only had a 50% chance of coming home safely. \"Some of the odds of trying to be successful in that mission are overwhelming, and perhaps at that time we didn't even understand what the odds were,\" Lovell told \"CBS Evening News\" in 2018.",
      "That Christmas Eve, they became the first human crew to circle the moon. \"We're like three schoolkids looking into a candy store window, watching those ancient old craters on the far side, slowly slip underneath us,\" Lovell told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2018.",
      "But the truly moving sight was when they viewed their home planet rise above the surface. \"I could put my thumb up to the window, and completely hide the Earth,\" Lovell said. \"You have to think about that \u2013 over five billion people, everything I ever knew, was behind my thumb!\"",
      "A U.S. Naval Academy graduate and test pilot, Lovell joined the space program in 1962, becoming one of NASA's most traveled astronauts during its first decade. Lovell flew into space four times: aboard Gemini 7, Gemini 12, Apollo 8 and Apollo 13.",
      "It was that last mission, in 1970, that proved the most harrowing. Apollo 13's service module, carrying Lovell, Jack Swigert and Fred Haise, experienced a sudden oxygen tank explosion on its way to the moon. \"Houston, we've had a problem,\" Swigert and Lovell radioed.",
      "With the landing mission scrapped, Lovell and his crewmates moved into the cramped lunar lander to use as a lifeboat, as hundreds of flight controllers and engineers worked to guide the damaged spacecraft back home. With the crew's life support dwindling, the world watched gripped in suspense over their four-day journey back to Earth.",
      "Lovell's calm demeanor during the mission (which was dramatized in the film \"Apollo 13,\" starring Tom Hanks) fixed his public image, underscoring the heroism of astronauts working in the deadly environment of space. Though disappointed he never got to walk on the moon, Lovell understood that, in some ways, the failed mission was a success. \"Going to the moon, if everything works right, it's like following a cookbook. It's not that big a deal,\" he told the AP in 2004. \"If something goes wrong, that's what separates the men from the boys.\""

      "Still, Olson says they got along famously on set, especially when director Wilder lined them up for their first-ever love scene in a crowded studio where some of the cast's family members happened to be present: \"And we got to the end, where Bill says to my character, 'What happened?' And I turn to him slowly and answer, 'You did.' Whereupon he takes me into his arms and gently starts to kiss me.",
      "\"Now, Billy said, 'Do not separate until I say cut.' And we both were enjoying this. And all of a sudden, there was a female voice saying, 'Cut, damn it! Cut!' It was Mrs. Holden! I never got over it. But I learned something.\"",
      "What was that? \"Bill and I loved to kiss!\"",
      "And moviegoers loved the film: \"Sunset Boulevard\" got 11 Academy Award nominations. \"I was shocked,\" Olsen said of the Oscar nods. \"Now, we didn't win. But we've outlasted everybody.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for the 75th anniversary release of \"Sunset Boulevard\" click on the video player below:",
      "\"Sunset Boulevard\" was later re-born as a musical from Andrew Lloyd Webber. Sir Andrew was intrigued by the story of Hollywood discarding aging stars, and got the blessing of Wilder, who by then was being gently phased out of Hollywood himself \u2013 in his own way getting the Norma Desmond treatment. Webber said, \"He does tell a wonderful story about him going to see some young movie executive who had just been there. And this young executive says to him, 'Um, well, Mr. Wilder, we're very impressed by this screenplay that you've done, but it would be really helpful if you could tell me what you have done in the past?'\"",
      "The director of such classics as \"Double Indemnity,\" \"The Lost Weekend,\" \"Ace in the Hole,\" \"Some Like It Hot,\" and \"The Apartment,\" turned to the young executive and said, \"You first.\"",
      "\"Sunset Boulevard,\" the musical, opened in London's West End in 1993, with Patti LuPone as Desmond; when they brought the show to Los Angeles and New York, Glenn Close played the lead.",
      "And in the latest, radically re-conceived version, Desmond was played by former pop star Nicole Scherzinger.",
      "Asked about seeing Scherzinger in the role of Norma Desmond, Webber said, \"I have always rated Nicole as one of the most astounding singers I've ever worked with. And I worked with a few. And I could say that Nicole is right up there with the very, very, very top ones, might even be the best.\"",
      "Scherzinger brought a new level of intensity to Norma Desmond, and took home a Tony Award this year.",
      "You can stream the Broadway cast album of \"Sunset Blvd.\" featuring Nicole Scherzinger by clicking on the embed below (Free Spotify registration required to hear the tracks in full):",
      "The show closed last month, and we took Scherzinger back to the St. James Theatre just before they took down all the signs. \"I can't believe that this is still up; I want to take it home!\" she laughed. \"I want to take it home and I want to put this in my garage.\"",
      "One sign was half-removed from the stage door. \"I think someone stole my face!\" she laughed.",
      "Asked what she thinks \"Sunset Boulevard\" says about the entertainment industry and its treatment of older women, Scherzinger said, \"It's difficult that the industry kind of puts an expiration date on you when you've actually lived a life and actually, finally, have something really meaningful to say.\"",
      "Hollywood has changed (and so has Paramount Pictures). But seventy-five years on, \"Sunset Boulevard\" still holds up. Isenberg said, \"For people who love movies \u2013 cinephiles and film geeks, whatever we want to call them today \u2013 you can just luxuriate in a movie like 'Sunset Boulevard.' It's like a warm bath.\"",
      "Gloria Swanson herself luxuriated in playing a faded movie queen. Even back then, she somehow knew that \"Sunset Boulevard\" would make her a legend.",
      "Asked if Swanson was anything like the character she portrayed, Nancy Olson replied, \"No. She was much more real and sensible. And she was the only person on the entire set that understood that this movie would live forever and that she would be remembered forever \u2013 that it was a story that had a truth to it that would never be forgotten.\"",

    "title": "Why is Instagram's new Map feature controversial, and should you disable it?",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/instagram-map-disable/",
    "published": "Fri, 08 Aug 2025 18:03:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Instagram rolled out a new Map feature that lets users see their friends' locations in real time. Here's why privacy experts are concerned.",
    "story": [
      "A new feature on Instagram that lets users share their real-time physical location with others on the app has privacy experts concerned over the amount of data exposed and potential safety risks to users.",
      "Called Instagram Map, the new feature was introduced on Thursday as part of an app update. On its blog, the company says the location-sharing tool makes it \"easier for you and your friends to stay in touch through the content you're enjoying on Instagram.\"",
      "\"You can opt into sharing your last active location with friends you pick, and you can turn it off anytime,\" Instagram said in a blog post announcing the new feature. \"You can also open the map to see content your friends and favorite creators are posting from cool spots. No matter how you use the map, you and your friends have a new, lightweight way to connect with each other.\"",
      "\"Off by default\"",
      "In a statement shared with CBS MoneyWatch Friday, Instagram's parent company, Meta, emphasized that Instagram Maps is not automatically active upon updating the app and that users must opt-in to the location-sharing feature in order to make their whereabouts visible to others.",
      "\"Instagram Map is off by default, and your live location is never shared unless you choose to turn it on. If you do, only people you follow back \u2014 or a private, custom list you select \u2014 can see your location,\" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Users can also choose not to share their locations when they are in particular places, or with particular people.",
      "Still, privacy experts say that social media users aren't always aware of how much information they're sharing with an app or its users, even if they have the ability to limit who sees what.",
      "\"The more these location features are rolled out on social media it carries out the assumption that as long as you give users the ability to toggle them on and off that they'll know exactly how to do that,\" Douglas Zytko, an app safety expert and associate professor at the College of Innovation & Technology at the University of Michigan-Flint, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But the average user isn't always aware of their privacy settings and if they match their preferences.\"",
      "When the Instagram Map feature is turned on, any content a user posts with a location tagged, including a reel, post or story, will show up on the app's map for 24 hours, according to the Instagram blog. While the feature remains on, the user's location is updated whenever they open the app or return to it. The feature can be turned off at any time.",
      "In an Instagram post discussing the feature, Instagram's head, Adam Mosseri, explains how he himself uses the map. \"Personally, I use the map to share what I'm up to with a handful of my closest friends, and I curate that list carefully,\" he said.",
      "User confusion over whether the feature is on or off",
      "On Threads, Meta's microblogging site, a number of Instagram account holders claimed that their locations were being pinned on friends' maps by default.",
      "Mosseri weighed in, saying the concerns prompted the company to re-examine how the feature works.",
      "\"We're double-checking everything, but so far it looks mostly like people are confused and assume that, because they can see themselves on the map when they open, other people can see them too,\" he said. \"We're still checking everything though to make sure nobody shares location without explicitly deciding to do so, which, by the way, requires a double consent by design (we ask you to confirm after you say you want to share).\"",
      "How to turn on Instagram Maps",
      "In the top right corner of the app, tap on the messaging function. There you will see a circular world map icon labeled \"map. If you click on the icon, you will see you're on location pinned on a map. Friends who are sharing their locations will also appear. Click on the gear icon to choose to share your location with no one, or a custom list of friends, or all of your friends \u2014 who are followers that you also follow back on the app.",
      "Social pressures, privacy and safety risks",
      "Zytko, however, said it can be complicated for social media users to manage privacy settings that let them share different kinds of content with different groups of people. \"This issue is called 'context collapse,'\" he said. \"Your co-workers see your social media posts, and your friends and family, and there is certain content you only want some groups to see but not others, and it can be hard to manage the visibility of content.\"",
      "Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which makes entertainment and technology recommendations for families, said location-sharing features can be particularly risky for younger app users.",
      "\"These features might feel fun and social, but they create unnecessary risks that teens and many adults don't necessarily understand,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "While parents who supervise their teens through controls built into the app can control their kids' location-sharing settings, he still has concerns about the kinds of social pressures such features expose teens, too.",
      "Torney said research at Common Sense Media shows that location-sharing also creates \"social pressures around where teens go and who they spend time with, and kids feel obligated to share location to show they are someplace cool.\"",
      "Furthermore, when teens share their locations, \"they are potentially telling strangers where they are in real time,\" Torney told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you're not selective about who you're sharing your location with, it creates opportunities for harassment, stalking or worse.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Aug 2025 14:16:53 -0400",
    "summary": "The Boar's Head deli meat plant at the heart of a deadly food-poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months, but recent reports point to ongoing sanitation problems.",
    "story": [
      "The Boar's Head deli meat plant at the heart of last year's deadly food poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months, company officials said.",
      "But recent inspections at Boar's Head sites in three states documented sanitation problems similar to those that led to the listeria contamination that killed 10 people and sickened dozens.",
      "The Jarratt, Virginia, plant was shut down in September when U.S. Agriculture Department officials suspended operations and withdrew the federal marks of inspection required to operate, saying the company \"failed to maintain sanitary conditions.\" Boar's Head permanently stopped making liverwurst and recalled more than 7 million pounds of deli products.",
      "Inspectors at the time found\u00a0dozens of violations, including leftover meat on equipment, mold and mildew buildup, insects in and around deli meats, and puddles of blood on the plant's floor.",
      "USDA officials this week said they had \"thoroughly reviewed\" the plant and lifted the forced suspension on July 18.",
      "\"The facility is in full compliance of the guidelines and protocols set for the safe handling and production of food and the serious issues that led to suspension have been fully rectified,\" officials with the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in an email Wednesday.",
      "Recent reports of similar sanitation issues",
      "And yet, documents obtained by The Associated Press through a freedom of information request show that Boar's Head plants in Arkansas, Indiana and elsewhere in Virginia were flagged for the same kinds of sanitation problems that led to the outbreak, with the most recent report in June.",
      "In the past seven months, government inspectors reported problems that include instances of meat and fat residue left on equipment and walls, drains blocked with meat products, beaded condensation on ceilings and floors, overflowing trash cans, and staff who didn't wear protective hairnets and plastic aprons \u2014 or wash their hands.",
      "The records, which included USDA noncompliance reports logged by inspectors from Jan. 1 through July 23, raise new questions about the company's promises to address systemic problems and about federal oversight of listeria contamination in plants that make ready-to-eat foods.",
      "\"If there is evidence that food safety problems are continuing, the government needs to make sure the company fixes them,\" said Sandra Eskin, a former USDA official who now heads STOP Foodborne Illness, a consumer group focused on food safety.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins last month announced plans to bolster efforts that combat foodborne germs, including listeria.",
      "Officials at Boar's Head, the 120-year-old company based in Sarasota, Florida, have posted job openings for two dozen positions, including a food safety quality analyst, at the Jarratt site.",
      "The company convened a panel of expert advisers last fall and hired a chief food safety officer in May. The advisers include Frank Yiannas, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration official, and Mindy Brashears, President Donald Trump's nominee for USDA's undersecretary for food safety.",
      "Boar's Head last year said they \"regret and deeply apologize\" for the contamination and that \"comprehensive measures are being implemented to prevent such an incident from ever happening again.\"",
      "But company officials refused to discuss the problems found this year. They canceled a scheduled AP interview with Natalie Dyenson, the new food safety officer. And they declined to allow Yiannas to detail the investigation he led into the contamination's cause.",
      "Brashears, who now directs a food safety center at Texas Tech University, did not respond to requests for comment about the Boar's Head problems. An automatic email reply said the USDA nominee was traveling out of the country until Aug. 25. She remains on the company's food safety board.",
      "\"Boar's Head has an unwavering commitment to food safety and quality. That commitment is reflected in recent enhancements to our practices and protocols\" described on the company's website, Boar's Head said in an emailed statement.",
      "\"We have also been working with the USDA in developing a plan to reopen our Jarratt facility in a measured, deliberate way in the coming months,\" the statement said.",
      "The 35 pages of new inspection findings cover Boar's Head sites in Forrest City, Arkansas; New Castle, Indiana; and Petersburg, Virginia.",
      "The findings surprised outside food safety advocates, who said that factory conditions should have improved in the year since the outbreak was first identified.",
      "\"You would have expected after all they went through that they would put themselves in a place where you could essentially eat deli meat off the factory floor,\" said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports, an advocacy group.",
      "Rep. Rosa DeLauro called the findings \"appalling.\"",
      "\"This is a pattern of negligence \u2014 cutting corners to protect the company's bottom line at the expense of consumers and these conditions show a complete disregard for food safety and for the public health of the American people,\" the Connecticut Democrat said in a statement.",
      "The findings echo the \"inadequate sanitation practices\" that USDA officials said contributed to the outbreak. Key factors included product residue, condensation and structural problems in the buildings, a January report concluded.",
      "At the Jarratt plant, state inspectors working in partnership with USDA had documented mold, insects, liquid dripping from ceilings, and meat and fat residue on walls, floors and equipment, the AP previously reported.",
      "While no instances of insects were documented in this year's inspection reports, there were repeated reports of \"dried fat and protein from the previous day's production\" on equipment, stairs and walls. In April, an inspector at the Petersburg plant reported finding discarded meat underneath equipment, including \"5-6 hams, 4 large pieces of meat and a large quantity of pooling meat juice.\"",
      "Other reports detailed beaded condensation \"directly over the food contact surfaces of tables and conveyor belts.\" Additional reports documented rusting meat racks, doors that failed to close completely and staff who ignored required handwashing stations.",
      "The reports point to a \"food safety culture problem,\" said Barbara Kowalcyk, who directs a food safety and nutrition security center at George Washington University.",
      "\"What jumped out to me is there is an organizational culture issue that needs to be changed,\" she said. \"Usually that culture has to start at the top.\"",
      "In the meantime, she advised consumers to think carefully about deli meat consumption. Older people and those who are pregnant or have weakened immune systems are especially vulnerable to serious illness from listeria infections.",
      "\"I think they need to be aware that there are issues at this organization that still are not completely under control, apparently,\" Kowalcyk said.",
      "Boar's Head faced multiple lawsuits from people who fell ill or from the families of those who died. Several survivors declined to comment publicly on the new problems, citing financial settlements with the company that included nondisclosure agreements.",

    "story": [
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit Wednesday against Early Warning Services, or EWS, alleging the parent company of Zelle failed to implement certain safeguards, causing \"catastrophic harm to millions of consumers\" and allowing fraudsters to steal more than $1 billion from 2017 to 2023.",
      "EWS, which is\u00a0co-owned\u00a0by Bank of America, Capital One, JPMorgan Chase, PNC Bank, Truist, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo,\u00a0launched\u00a0the Zelle app in 2017.

      "As of 2024, the app has 151 million users, according to Zelle's\u00a0website.",
      "The push to launch Zelle led to design oversights that made the network \"an obvious conduit for fraudulent activity,\" the\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0alleges. Those alleged flaws include Zelle's quick registration process and lack of verification, which James claims made it easy for scammers to infiltrate the service.",

      "The SSA did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "Each fall, the agency uses inflation data from July, August and September to determine the COLA for the next year.

      "The inflation rate has remained at or below 3% since the start of 2025. However, experts predict it could inch up later in the year as tariffs put more pressure on consumer prices. Alan Detmeister, an economist at UBS, told CBS MoneyWatch that he estimates headline CPI will rise to 3.7% and core CPI will rise to 3.8% by the second quarter of 2026.",

      "The investment \u2014 the second-largest in the Louisville-based company's history \u2014 is expected to add more than 1,000 jobs while ramping up domestic production and modernizing plants in the next five years.",
      "\"Our long-term strategy is about manufacturing close to our customers,\" said CEO Kevin Nolan. \"With lean manufacturing, upskilling our workforce and automation, the math works for manufacturing in the United States.\"",
      "The majority of GE's appliance production is already in the U.S. and the shift means only that the company will transfer more work to its domestic plants.",
      "GE will relocate production of gas ranges from Mexico to a plant in Georgia, while six refrigerator models now made in China will be manufactured at its Alabama plant, the company said.",
      "In June, the company said it would move production of clothes washers from China to its sprawling manufacturing complex in Louisville.

      "GE's plant in Camden, South Carolina, will add production of electric and hybrid heat pump water heaters, doubling the factory's output and employment once the project is complete, the company said.

In all, production of more than 15 models of front load washers will shift to the company's Louisville complex \u2014 known as Appliance Park, it said.",
      "Once its new plan is fully implemented, GE Appliances will have invested $6.5 billion across its 11 U.S. manufacturing plants and nationwide distribution network since 2016, it said.",

      "GE Appliances handles product design and engineering work at its Louisville headquarters but doesn't make all of its products in the U.S. It contracts with other manufacturers, including in China, for some of its production where it doesn't have capacity or needs access to a global supply chain. The company said its core business strategy is to base production in the United States, and investments announced in June and on Wednesday are another step toward achieving that goal.",

      "The S&P 500 rose 1.1% and was on track to top its all-time high set two weeks ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 473 points, or 1.1%, as of 2:46 p.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq composite was 1.3% higher and also heading toward a record.",
      "Stocks got a lift from hopes that the better-than-expected inflation report will give the Federal Reserve leeway to cut interest rates at its next meeting in September.",
      "Lower rates would give a boost to investment prices and to the economy by making it cheaper for U.S. households and businesses to borrow to buy houses, cars or equipment. President Donald Trump has angrily been calling for cuts to help the economy, often\u00a0insulting\u00a0the Fed's chair personally while doing so.",
      "But the Fed has been hesitant because of the possibility that Trump's tariffs could make inflation much worse. Lowering rates would give inflation more fuel, potentially adding oxygen to a growing fire. That's why Fed officials have said they wanted to see more data come in about inflation before moving.",
      "Tuesday's report said U.S. consumers paid prices for groceries, gasoline and other costs of living that were 2.7% higher in July than a year earlier. That's the same inflation rate as June's, and it was below the 2.8% that economists expected.",
      "The report pushed traders on Wall Street to increase bets that the Fed will cut interest rates for the first time this year in September. They're betting on a 94% chance of that, up from nearly 86% a day earlier, according to data from CME Group.",
      "The Fed will receive one more report on inflation, as well as one more on the U.S. job market, before its next meeting, which ends Sept. 17. The most recent jobs report was a stunner, coming in much weaker than economists expected.",
      "Some economists warn that more twists and turns in upcoming data could make the Fed's upcoming decisions not so easy. Its twin goals are to get inflation to 2% while keeping the job market healthy, and helping one with interest rates often means hurting the other.",
      "Even Tuesday's better-than-expected inflation report had some discouraging undertones. An underlying measure of inflation, which economists say does a better job of predicting where inflation may be heading, hit its highest point since early this year, noted Gary Schlossberg, market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. That helped cause some up-and-down swings for Treasury yields in the bond market.",
      "\"Eventually, tariffs can show up in varying degrees in consumer prices, but these one-off price increases don't happen all at once,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"That will confound the Fed and economic commentators for months to come.\"",
      "Other central banks around the world have been lowering interest rates, and Australia's on Tuesday cut for the third time this year.",
      "On Wall Street, Intel's stock rose 5.1% after Trump said its CEO has an \"amazing story,\" less than a week after he had demanded Lip-Bu Tan's resignation.",
      "Circle Internet Group, the company behind the popular USDC cryptocurrency that tracks the U.S. dollar, climbed 2.4% despite reporting a larger loss for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It said its total revenue and reserve income grew 53% in its first quarter as a publicly traded company, and it topped forecasts.",
      "On the losing side of Wall Street was Celanese, which sank 14.1% even though the chemical company delivered a better profit than expected. It said that customers in most of its markets continue to be challenged, and CEO Scott Richardson said that \"the demand environment does not seem to be improving.\"",
      "Cardinal Health dropped 7.2% despite likewise reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue fell short of forecasts, and analysts said the market's expectations were particularly high for the company after its stock had already soared 33.3% for the year coming into the day.",
      "Critics say the broad U.S. stock market is looking expensive after its surge from a bottom in April. That's putting pressure on companies to deliver continued growth in profit.",
      "In stock markets abroad, indexes edged up in China after Trump signed an executive order late Monday that delayed hefty tariffs on the world's second-largest economy by 90 days. The move was widely expected, and the hope is that it will clear the way for a possible deal to avert a dangerous trade war between the United States and China.",

    "summary": "The inflation rate was cooler than expected, with July's CPI rising 2.7% on an annual basis.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index in July rose 2.7% on an annual basis, slightly cooler than economists had forecast.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was expected to rise 2.8% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "On a month-over-month basis, the CPI rose 0.2%, in line with economists' forecasts.",
      "The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in prices on everyday items such as food and apparel over time. So far this year, inflation has stayed at 3% or lower, with\u00a0June's CPI reading at 2.7%, above the Fed's 2% annual target.",
      "So-called core inflation, a measure or CPI that excludes food and energy prices (which are more volatile), rose by 3.1% over the past 12 months, the highest level in five months. Economists polled by FactSet had predicted a 3% increase for that measure.",
      "Food inflation continues",
      "Overall food prices in July rose 0.2% from the previous month, and 2.9% over the past year. The cost of groceries last month rose 0.1% since June and 2.2% on an annual basis.",
      "The data comes as about half of Americans say the\u00a0cost of groceries is a\u00a0\"major\" source of stress in their life right now, while 33% say it's a \"minor\" source of stress, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Only 14% say it's not a source of stress, underscoring the pervasive anxiety most Americans continue to feel about the cost of daily food essentials.",
      "Everyday staples that saw significant cost increases in July include coffee, up 2.6% from June and 14.8% from 2024. Ground beef, rose 2.4% from June and 11.5% from 2024. On a positive note, egg prices fell 3.4% from June, but were still 16.4% higher than they were in July of last year.",
      "Eating out continues to grow more costly as restaurant prices in July increased 0.3% from the previous month and 3.9% since 2024. The data comes as fast-food restaurants continue to report declines in traffic, as higher prices drive consumers away. Wendy's, for example, cut its sales outlook\u00a0last week, pointing to heightened competition and economic uncertainty weighing on its customer base.",
      "Fast-food chains like Wendy's are competing for the attention of low-income consumers who have pulled back on eating out over concerns about the economy. According to a May study from\u00a0Bankrate, among households earning less than $50,000 per year, 44% say they expect to spend less on dining out this year than they did last year.",
      "\"The low-income consumer remains under pressure,\" Sara Senatore, a research analyst at Bank of America, recently told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Gasoline prices, meanwhile, fell 0.5% from June and 9.5% from July 2024, the CPI data shows.",
      "What the experts say about the impact of tariffs",
      "Economists have been watching closely to determine how tariffs might trickle through to the CPI data. For the first several months of the year, the impact appeared to be limited, but June's reading indicated that the levies might be starting to drive up prices in certain categories such as apparel, home furnishings and appliances.",
      "Goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union are now subject to a new round of reciprocal tariffs that went into effect on Aug. 7.",
      "The figures from today's CPI report suggest that while the prices of certain imported goods such as shoes and furniture rose from June to July, the cheaper cost of gas is offsetting some of the impact of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs.",
      "\"There is some sign of tariff pass through to consumer prices but, at this stage, it is not significant enough to ring alarm bells,\" Seema Shah, chief global strategist a Principal Asset Management, said in an email to CBS News after today's CPI report was released.",
      "During a call with media yesterday, Alan Detmeister, an economist at UBS, said the investment bank expects consumers will start to see the direct effects of the tariffs this year or into early next year.",
      "\"It's possible that these tariff-induced price increases are a one-time price level shock that will start coming down early next year,\" said Detmeister. \"We think they're going to be much more lasting.\"",
      "Detmeister expects both core and headline CPI to peak in the second quarter of 2026, with headline CPI at 3.7% and core CPI at 3.8%.",
      "What the inflation data could mean for a Fed rate cut",
      "With the CPI in July rising to annualized rate of 2.7%, inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target rate, however, most analysts say that the possibility of a Fed rate cut in September is likely still on the table.",
      "\"Although core annual inflation is back to its highest level since February, today's CPI print is not hot enough to derail the Fed from cutting rates in September,\" said Shah.",
      "The latest jobs report showed that hiring slowed in July, which could bolster the case for a Fed rate cut.",
      "The Fed's mandate is to maintain maximum employment, while keeping prices down. Otherwise, the country\u00a0could slip into what's called stagflation\u00a0\u2014 which is when high inflation is coupled with high unemployment.",
      "More economic data \u2014 in the form of another CPI and jobs report \u2014 is expected next month, which will inform the central bank's decision.",

A so-called going concern warning is an accounting term that signals a risk that a business might cease operations.",
      "Shares of Kodak plunged $1.73, or 26%, to $5.05 in Tuesday morning trading. Reached for comment, a Kodak spokesperson pointed to the statement in its regulatory filing.",
      "The warning is the latest development in the photography company's storied history, which includes introducing one of the first consumer cameras in the 1880s and mass manufacturing film rolls for hobbyists and professionals alike. But Kodak struggled to adapt when digital cameras overtook film starting in the 1990s, leading to a bankruptcy filing in 2012.",

    "summary": "E.J. Antoni, an economist nominated by President Trump to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said the jobs report is flawed.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u00a0is suggesting that the agency suspend its monthly jobs report, an economic staple that is relied upon by the Federal Reserve and U.S. businesses to gauge the health of the economy.",
      "In an interview on Fox News Digital on Monday ahead of his nomination, E.J. Antoni criticized the monthly employment report as flawed and suggested it be replaced with \"more accurate, though less timely, quarterly data.\"",
      "Antoni, who is a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, was tapped by Mr. Trump on Monday to run the BLS after the president\u00a0fired the former commissioner\u00a0earlier this month, blaming her for a disappointing July jobs report. Mr. Trump took issue with large revisions made to the previous month's jobs data, although jobs number revisions are commonly issued by the agency as more accurate data is collected over time.",
      "\"How on earth are businesses supposed to plan \u2014 or how is the Fed supposed to conduct monetary policy \u2014 when they don't know how many jobs are being added or lost in our economy? It's a serious problem that needs to be fixed immediately,\" Antoni told Fox News Digital.",
      "He added, \"Until it is corrected, the BLS should suspend issuing the monthly job reports but keep publishing the more accurate, though less timely, quarterly data.\"",
      "While some survey recipients immediately respond to the BLS' surveys, others report data later, which leads to the monthly revisions. Despite this, the BLS issues its monthly jobs report in order to report employment information in a timely manner, even though it is subject to revisions \u2014 both up and down \u2014 in later reports.",
      "Asked whether the BLS would continue to release monthly jobs reports, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \"I believe that is the plan and that's the hope, and that these monthly reports will be data that the American people can trust.\"",
      "Leavitt said \"we need to restore new leadership that we trust\" at the BLS, adding that \"we need to look at the means and the methods of how the United States is acquiring this very important data.\"",
      "\"The goal, of course, is to provide honest and good data for the American people to make very important economic decisions on,\" she said.",
      "Responding to the BLS' employment surveys is voluntary for businesses, while the federal government's Office of Management and Budget directs the BLS to release \"robust\" data on basic economic indicators in a \"timely\" manner.

    "summary": "President Trump signed an executive order that he says will democratize alternative investments for workers saving for retirement.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump says he wants to democratize retirement by allowing 401(k)s to invest in so-called alternative investments, or strategies outside stocks and other traditional investments, such as private equity and cryptocurrencies.",
      "The executive order signed by Mr. Trump on Thursday would open the door to higher-risk investments landing in your 401(k). It could also potentially serve as a game changer for the $5 trillion private equity industry, which for years has wanted to gain access to America's retirement plans.",
      "The move has the potential to shake up the typically staid menu of investment choices provided to workers through their employer-sponsored defined-contribution plans, which include 401(k)s and 403(b)s, with the latter aimed at teachers. The change might appeal to some savers, given that alternative investments can provide protection from market swings while also providing the potential for outsized returns. But there are several catches to be aware of, experts say.",
      "Private equity investments \"have matured into a strong-performing asset class delivering excellent long-term returns, so this is good news for Americans,\" Simon Tang, head of U.S. at Accelex, a private markets specialist, said in an email.",
      "But there are caveats, experts say. For one, some alternative investments carry higher risk profiles than traditional asset classes, and offer less transparency about their performance on a day-to-day basis. It's also unclear whether or not employers will want to offer such investments given the risks.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "What does the executive order change about 401(k)s?",
      "The president's order directs the Labor Department and other agencies to redefine what would be considered a qualified asset under\u00a0401(k) retirement\u00a0rules.",
      "Americans' retirement plans are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, a law better known as\u00a0ERISA. Under that regulation, employers are required to offer retirement options that are in the best interest of their employees, not Wall Street.",
      "Most retirement plans for Americans are made up of stock and bond investments, and to a much lesser extent, cash and heavily traded commodities such as gold.",
      "Workers would still be able to limit their investments to traditional assets like stocks and bonds, and would also be able to opt out of adding new alternative strategies to their portfolios.",
      "When could those changes become effective?",
      "It's unclear, but it's likely going to take months or even longer given the complexity of ERISA.",
      "After the Labor Department provides its new guidance, it will take time for major retirement plan companies such as Fidelity and Vanguard to develop appropriate funds for employers to use.",
      "Employers will also likely need time to revise their retirement plan options, so it may take several years before crypto and private equity become mainstream investments in individual retirement plans. Whether employers and their workers will opt to invest in these asset classes is another question, experts added.",
      "\"While asset managers are salivating over the idea of tapping in to a portion of the $12.5 trillion in defined contribution assets, we believe adoption will be slow due to cost, transparency and complexity,\" said Pitchbook analysts in a report written to provide an analysis of some aspects of Mr. Trump's order.",
      "How risky are these investments?",
      "All investments carry risks, but alternative asset classes come with additional pitfalls that heighten their potential for volatility. For instance, private equity invests in companies that are not publicly traded, which makes it difficult to know on a day-to-day basis whether the investment is up, down or sideways.",
      "\"When it comes to investing in stocks, retail investors are used to instant pricing, clean data and daily performance updates,\" Tang said. \"Private markets are a different ballgame. There's no real-time information, no ticker and no standardization, just fragmented documents and unstructured formats.\"",
      "Cryptocurrencies, for their part, may have more transparency on pricing, but they can also be extremely volatile, with major shifts in valuation from day to day. That said, cryptocurrencies have grown increasingly popular, with about 1 in 4 people investing in crypto, according to Security.org.",
      "Do alternative investments outperform stocks and bonds?",
      "Alternative investments can outperform stocks and bonds, but there's no guarantee.",
      "For instance, bitcoin last year jumped 135% in value, compared with a 24% increase in the S&P 500. But in 2022, it was another story, with bitcoin dropping 65% while the S&P 500 lost 19%, one analysis shows.",
      "Private equity investments, meanwhile, returned 13.5% over a 10-year period, outpacing the 9.7% return for stocks and a 1.9% for bonds over the same period, according to a recent study.",
      "While the potential for outsized gains may appeal to some investors, alternative investments also tend to carry higher costs, such as pricier fees for fund managers, which can eat into returns.",
      "\"Higher costs come from the fact that while you can trade a stock for pennies, it requires travel, negotiations, legal work, and much more, to buy and operate a private company. These costs are typically passed along to fund investors,\" Pitchbook said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced E.J. Antoni as his nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Monday, after he fired the former commissioner earlier this month, blaming her for a weaker-than-expected jobs report.",
      "Antoni is a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, and he holds a doctorate in economics from Northern Illinois University. He's defended Mr. Trump's economic policy moves in the past, including the president's tariff strategy. He has also\u00a0criticized the BLS\u00a0for low response rates and questioned the agency's methodology, calling its health insurance figures \"phoney baloney\" last year and at one point joking that \"the 'L' is silent\" in BLS' name.",
      "\"DOGE needs to take a chainsaw to the BLS...,\" he wrote in a November\u00a0post on X.",
      "\"There are better ways to collect, process, and disseminate data\u2014that is the task for the next BLS commissioner, and only consistent delivery of accurate data in a timely manner will rebuild the trust that has been lost over the last several years,\" he wrote shortly after Mr. Trump fired the former BLS chief.",
      "Mr. Trump nominated Antoni in a Truth Social post, saying he \"will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE.\"",
      "Antoni will need to be confirmed by the Senate. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is currently led by acting Commissioner William Watrowski, who has worked at the agency for decades.",
      "Mr. Trump ordered his administration to terminate Erika McEntarfer, who had been commissioner of labor statistics, on Aug. 1, hours after the release of the July jobs report data. That report showed a sharp slowdown in hiring, along with a steep downward revision to May and June's hiring numbers.",
      "Hours before her firing, Antoni criticized BLS for \"data problems\" and a trend of \"highly problematic\" revisions, though he also touted some figures in the July jobs report, including a jump in employment by native-born Americans and a slowdown in government jobs.",
      "In the wake of McEntarfer's firing, influential ex-Trump strategist Steve Bannon backed Antoni to take over the BLS. Antoni appeared on Bannon's show \"War Room\" on the day the jobs report came out, calling McEntarfer \"incompetent.\" Days later, Bannon said \"we're pushing\" for Antoni to lead the BLS, and called him \"the guy that almost single-handedly took it down by going through their numbers.\"",
      "Announcing McEntarfer's firing in a post on Truth Social, the president claimed \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that she had \"faked the Jobs Numbers before the Election to try and boost Kamala's chances of Victory\" and pledged to replace her \"with someone much more competent and qualified.\"",
      "But Harvard economics professor Jason Furman, a head of the Council of Economic Advisers under former President Barack Obama, was sharply critical of the selection of Antoni,\u00a0saying on X that, \"I don't think I have ever publicly criticized any Presidential nominee before. But E.J. Antoni is completely unqualified to be BLS Commissioner. He is an extreme partisan and does not have any relevant expertise. He would be a break from decades of nonpartisan technocrats.\"",
      "Jessica Riedl, an economist at the conservative Manhattan Institute,\u00a0said on X that she's \"never met EJ Antoni because he is not seen in many DC policy circles. However, the articles and tweets I've seen him publish are probably the most error-filled of any think tank economist right now. I hope we see better at BLS.\"",
      "The jobs report for October 2024, which was released on Nov. 1, 2024, four days before Election Day, showed just 12,000 jobs were created \u2014 far short of the 100,000 forecast for the month \u2014 following two hurricanes and a major labor dispute. The following month, that figure was revised upward, to 36,000. September's jobs report, however, dramatically exceeded forecasts \u2014 254,000 jobs were created, rather than the 140,000 economic analysts had expected. That figure was later revised down to 223,000.",
      "Mr. Trump continued railing against the ousted commissioner and the BLS more broadly in the days after he fired her, claiming in a post on Truth Social last week that the July jobs report had been \"RIGGED,\" though he provided no evidence to support it. The president said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" Tuesday that it's a \"highly political situation.\" And National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended the president's decision in an appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" citing a series of revisions and patterns that \"could make people wonder.\"",
      "\"What we need is a fresh set of eyes over at the BLS,\" Hassett said, adding that \"the president wants his own people there so that when we see the numbers they're more transparent and more reliable.\"",
      "McEntarfer had been commissioner for a little over a year and a half, after she was confirmed in a broad bipartisan vote of 86 to 8 by the Senate in January 2024.",
      "The latest jobs report showed employers in July adding a weaker-than-expected 73,000 jobs, with a downward revision of 258,000 fewer jobs created in May and June. Mr. Trump, who often touts the job numbers, called the jobs figures a \"shock\" and the revision a \"major mistake.\" The BLS said in its report that monthly revisions \"result from additional reports received from businesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors.\"",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer acknowledged in an interview for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" earlier this month that \"there are always revisions,\" but he added that \"sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme ways.\"",
      "\"The president is the president. He can choose who works in the executive branch,\" Greer said.",
      "Meanwhile, some economists and lawmakers have expressed concern over the firing, and a group of former BLS leaders warned that the move \"undermines the valuable work and dedication of BLS staff\" and \"escalates the President's unprecedented attacks on the independence and integrity of the federal statistical system.\" The group called on Congress to investigate the firing.",

    "story": [
      "A Hawaii real estate investor and broker are suing Shohei Ohtani, claiming the Los Angeles Dodgers superstar and his agent got them fired from a $240 million luxury housing development on the Big Island's coveted Hapuna Coast that they brought him in to endorse.",
      "According to the lawsuit filed in Hawaii Circuit Court on Friday, Ohtani's agent, Nez Balelo, increasingly demanded concessions from developer Kevin J. Hayes Sr. and real estate broker Tomoko Matsumoto before demanding that their business partner, Kingsbarn Realty Capital, drop them from the deal.",
      "\"Balelo and Otani, who were brought into the venture solely for Otani's promotional and branding value, exploited their celebrity leverage to destabilize and ultimately dismantle Plaintiffs' role in the project \u2014 for no reason other than their own financial self-interest,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "The suit accuses Ohtani and Balelo of tortious interference and unjust enrichment. Hayes, a developer with 40 years of experience, and Matsumoto, who was to be the listing agent for the houses averaging $17.3 million each, say Ohtani and Balelo also tried to undermine their interests in a second, neighboring venture.",
      "A spokesman for Balelo's agency, CAA Baseball, declined comment. Attempts to reach Kingsbarn officials for comment were not immediately successful.",
      "\"This case is about abuse of power,\" the lawsuit says. \"Defendants used threats and baseless legal claims to force a business partner to betray its contractual obligations and strip Plaintiffs of the very project they conceived and built.",
      "\"Defendants must be held accountable for their actions, not shielded by fame or behind-the-scenes agents acting with impunity. Plaintiffs bring this suit to expose Defendants' misconduct and to ensure that the rules of contract, fair dealing, and accountability apply equally to all \u2014 celebrity or not.\"",
      "Ohtani, 31, arrived from Japan in 2018 as perhaps the most heralded international star in baseball history, with an ability to both pitch and hit that made him doubly valuable to his team. A five-time All-Star and three-time Most Valuable Player, he signed a record 10-year, $700-million contract\u00a0with the Dodgers before last season and helped the team win the 2024 World Series.",
      "Investment materials for The Vista at Mauna Kea Resort, which remained online on Monday night, listed Hayes and Matsumoto as part of the management team, along with Kingsbarn. It called Ohtani \"Japan's Babe Ruth\" and the \"1st Resident,\" giving him top billing ahead of the iconic Mauna Kea Resort, \"one of the most celebrated hotels in Hawaii,\" Hapuna Beach, \"rated the #1 beach in America by Conde Nast Traveler\" and two golf courses \u2014 one designed by Arnold Palmer, the other by Robert Trent Jones Sr.",
      "\"Ohtani will act as the celebrity spokesperson for the project and has committed to purchasing one of the 14 residences within the project,\" the brochure says. \"He also intends to spend significant time at The Vista in the off-season and will construct a small hitting and pitching facility for preseason training.\"",
      "Ohtani touted the project as his upcoming \"winter home\" in April, CBS Honolulu affiliate KGMB-TV reported at the time",
      "The suit says the developers spent 11 years working on the deal and \"as part of a bold marketing strategy\" signed an endorsement deal in 2023 with Ohtani, \"one of the most high-profile endorsements imaginable.\"",
      "\"This partnership with Ohtani will elevate the demand and create buzz within the Japanese luxury vacation home market, which is a primary target audience for the project,\" the investment brochure said. \"We see Shohei Ohtani's homeownership as having a significant impact on the global exposure of the project and expect to accelerate the pace of sales, thereby helping us achieve our pricing objectives.\"",
      "The suit said Balelo \"quickly became a disruptive force,\" threatening to pull Ohtani from the deal if concessions weren't made.",
      "\"Kingsbarn began capitulating to Balelo's every whim,\" the suit said. \"Over time, it became increasingly obvious that Kingsbarn was more concerned about preserving its relationship with Otani than honoring its obligations to its business partners.\"",
      "Last month, in what the suit called \"a coordinated ambush,\" Kingsbarn fired Hayes and Matsumoto.",
      "\"Kingsbarn openly admitted during the call that Balelo had demanded the terminations and that they were being done solely to placate him,\" the suit said. \"Plaintiffs stand to lose millions of dollars in compensation tied to projected homebuilding profit, construction management fees, and broker commissions.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump has extended a temporary truce in the U.S.-China trade war, preventing tariffs on China from leaping to at least 80%.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday signed an executive order delaying a set of sky-high tariffs on Chinese goods for at least 90 days, extending a ceasefire in the U.S.-China trade war, the White House announced.",
      "The president's order will keep tariffs at 30% \u2014 the level that was set in mid-May, when both countries agreed to temporarily back off a set of tit-for-tat tariffs that exceeded 100%. That agreement was set to expire Tuesday, and without an extension, levies on some Chinese goods could have leaped to at least 80%, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has said.",
      "The order says the U.S.'s \"reciprocal\" tariff on Chinese goods will remain at 10% until at least Nov. 10. An additional 20% tariff on China that was imposed earlier this year due to fentanyl trafficking is\u00a0also still in place, bringing the total rate to 30%.",
      "China's Commerce Ministry said in a statement it will maintain a 10% tariff on U.S. goods.",
      "\"The United States and China have engaged in multiple rounds of productive negotiations to address trade reciprocity and national security concerns,\" the White House said in a fact sheet announcing the extension.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said last week that China and the U.S. were \"likely\" to agree to a 90-day extension as the two countries seek to negotiate a longer-term trade deal. Mr. Trump told reporters earlier Monday those negotiations were going \"quite nicely.\" Representatives from both sides met in Stockholm late last month.",
      "Greer told CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" earlier this month that \"I don't think anyone wants to see\" high tariffs on China snap back.",
      "\"We're working on some technical issues, and we're talking to the president about it,\" Greer said. \"I think it's going in a positive direction.\"",
      "A return to high tariffs could have caused U.S. imports of Chinese goods to plummet, disrupting trade between the world's two largest economies. In mid-April, when tariffs on Chinese imports still stood at 145%, the Trump administration planned for possible supply chain disruptions.",
      "China was the U.S.'s third-largest trading partner last year, not counting the European Union. The U.S. imported $438.9 billion in Chinese goods and China imported $143.5 billion in American goods, according to U.S. government data.",
      "Mr. Trump first hit China with 34% tariffs in early April, one of dozens of countries to face hefty \"reciprocal\" levies. The president argues tariffs could boost U.S. manufacturers and correct what he views as unfair trade practices, but many economists warn Mr. Trump's trade strategy could lead to higher consumer prices and more sluggish economic growth.",
      "The president quickly paused his April tariffs for most countries, and reinstated them, often at substantially lower levels, last week. But the China levies remained in place for more than a month and drew retaliation from Beijing, ultimately pushing U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to 145% and Chinese tariffs on American goods to 125%.",
      "The two countries agreed to ease the tariffs for at least 90 days in May, buying more time for Mr. Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping's teams to negotiate a trade deal. Since then, the U.S. has charged 30% tariffs and China has charged 10%.",
      "The talks have occasionally proven contentious. Earlier this year, the two countries feuded over Beijing's restrictions on rare earth mineral exports, Washington's restrictions on advanced semiconductors and the Trump administration's crackdown on international students from China. Mr. Trump accused China of violating the terms of the May truce \u2014 though both countries reached a deal to ease some of those tensions in June. And on Sunday, Mr. Trump pushed China to quadruple its imports of U.S. soybeans.",

      "The arrangement, with companies providing a stream of revenue in exchange for export licenses, is highly unusual as corporations typically do not pay the federal government a share of revenue from their export sales. Export licenses also do not carry any fees,\u00a0according to shipping giant Maersk.",

      "\"[Huang] said, 'Will you make it 15%?' so we negotiated a little deal,\" the president added.",

      "The vehicle will start at $30,000. By comparison, the average price for a new electric vehicle in July was about $56,000, according to Kelley Blue Book.",
      "Field touted the new vehicle's charging capabilities, referring to the truck as a \"mobile power plant.\"",
      "\"Outlets in the back can give you high power and let you plug in anything from tools to a refrigerator, and it can provide backup power for your home,\" he said.",
      "The midsize electric truck could be produced up to 40% faster than other vehicles at the Louisville Assembly Plant due to the new process, Ford said.",
      "In another effort to lower costs, the auto company is also reducing the number of components that go into each car. Vehicles produced on the \"universal EV platform\" will have 20% fewer parts than a traditional vehicle, Ford said.",
      "The company will also use smaller cobalt and nickel-free batteries that will allow it to make \"cost gains,\" according to a video shared by Ford.",
      "Anderson said that Ford has its work cut out for them given that the new truck will need to be competitively priced and economical. According to the auto industry expert, the cost of charging EV trucks currently on the market is often much higher than the price at the pump for gas-powered versions. A report from the Anderson Economic Group shows pickup trucks drivers in New York, California and Michigan face \"significantly higher costs\" if they rely on an EV.",
      "A successfully lower-cost truck model, however, could spur a new chapter for the company in its manufacturing of EVs.",
      "\"If Ford shows the industry it can build and sell a reliable compact EV truck for $30,000, it will sell a lot of them, and open the door to making sedans using the new production process,\" Anderson said.",

Overseeing the opening is The Brand House Collective, formerly known as Kirkland's, which manages a portfolio of retail stores including Beyond Inc.'s Bed Bath & Beyond Home, Bed Bath & Beyond, Buy Buy Baby and Overstock.",
      "\"We will be testing and learning the right inventory mix by category and by brand, but the look and feel of the stores will be a transition from the original Bed Bath and Beyond stores with a tighter focus on Seasonal Home Decor, Bedroom furnishings, and Bath and Laundry products,\" Starr Hudgens, chief of staff at the Brand House Collective, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Brand House Collective\u00a0announced the opening of the Nashville store late last month.",

      "Asked whether Brand House plans to open more stores under the Bed Bath & Beyond Home moniker, Hudgens said, \"We are opening four additional Bed Bath and Beyond Home stores in the Nashville market and will be in an aggressive learn and react posture to determine appropriate merchandising, brand, and strategy shifts to make as we plan our opening strategy for 2026.\"",
      "The opening of the Nashville location marks a new chapter for the discount retailer, which struggled to stay afloat amid depressed sales and the takeoff of online shopping. The company finally got into the e-commerce game after naming Mark Tritton, a former top Target executive, as CEO in 2019. But by then the company was too far behind top competitors, according to experts.",
      "The company had over 300 brick-and-mortar locations before closing all of them after it\u00a0entered Chapter 11 proceedings in April 2023. Months later, it announced it would return as an online home furnishings brand under its new owner Overstock.com. In 2024, Overstock.com made a bid to\u00a0sell Bed Bath & Beyond products at over 100 of its Container Store locations in an effort to revive the struggling retail chain with the help of the Bed Bath & Beyond name.",

    "summary": "While many Americans are still baffled by cryptocurrency, enthusiasm for these digital assets is growing - despite the potential risks of integrating digital currencies with the mainstream economy - in part due to support coming from the White House.",
    "story": [
      "Earlier this year, more than 35,000 bitcoin enthusiasts descended on Las Vegas for Bitcoin 2025 \u2013 the largest-ever gathering of its kind, attracting an eclectic mix of high rollers ... and true believers.",
      "\"Your goal should be to own at least one bitcoin, because by the time you retire, that can be worth 20, 30 million,\" said Michael Terpin.",
      "Guy Malone said, \"You can't change the Bible; it changes you. The same is true of bitcoin.\"",
      "But everyone here seems to agree on one thing: President Donald Trump's reelection has been like hitting the jackpot. As Vice President JD Vance told the crowd, \"I'm here today to say loud and clear, with President Trump, crypto finally has a champion and an ally in the White House.\"",
      "Once dismissed by investors, and still baffling to many Americans, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have won over supporters from Wall Street to Washington. In July, the president signed the Genius Act, which opens the door for companies like Wal-Mart and Amazon to issue their own digital currencies.",
      "And Congress is debating another bill that, for the first time, aims to regulate cryptocurrency trading \u2013 this after the industry spent more than $167 million on behalf of crypto-friendly candidates ahead of last year's election.",
      "Asked how people should think of cryptocurrencies, Amanda Fischer, who served as a top official in the Securities and Exchange Commission during the Biden administration, replied, \"You could think of it as gambling, you could think of it as a collectible, you could think of it as a type of investment. But I think what's important to understand is that crypto is highly volatile. It's highly speculative.",
      "\"Crypto is often marketed to individuals as an investment opportunity that will yield them the possibility of great returns,\" she said. \"But unlike, say, a stock, which represents a part-ownership of a company, [crypto] is not backed by any sort of business that is producing goods and services.\"",
      "Unlike hard currencies like the dollar or the euro, cryptocurrencies only exist online, and are issued by individuals and companies, not central banks. And yet, billions of dollars' worth of crypto are traded every day. \"The number of scams, the types of scams, the sophistication of scams are so rife and plentiful that the capacity to lose your money in a crypto investment is substantially higher than if you're just investing in stocks and bonds,\" Fischer said.",
      "During the Biden administration, the SEC cracked down on the cryptocurrency industry. The Trump administration has changed course, dismissing the largest outstanding cases, which Fischer says leaves consumers more vulnerable.",
      "I asked, \"We are seeing leaders in crypto say we want to be regulated. And there is legislation currently here in Washington underway to regulate cryptocurrency. They say they want laws passed.\"",
      "\"They want laws that they write to be passed,\" said Fischer. \"So, the legislation currently being considered in Washington, D.C., is written by and for the crypto industry.\"",
      "David Bailey, who runs the bitcoin conference and is CEO of a bitcoin holding company called Nakamoto, said, \"I wish that was the case, that'd be fantastic. But no, it's not true.\"",
      "The rise of digital assets",
      "Like many crypto entrepreneurs, Bailey now calls Puerto Rico home. \"It started because of the taxes,\" he said. \"Now, it's like the place to do business.\"",
      "But the 34-year-old's real claim to fame might be his role in convincing a skeptical President Trump (who in June 2021 told Fox Business Channel that bitcoin \"just seems like a scam\") to go all-in on bitcoin during the 2024 campaign. Asked what he told Mr. Trump to convince him to support crypto, Bailey replied, \"First off, no one convinces the president of anything. He makes up his own mind about things. A lot of people, especially in Washington, have missed how big this has gotten. And so, we made the case to the president about how many people hold this asset. He saw the opportunity that was here by embracing this industry. And I think we had a big part of swinging the election in his direction.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve says only eight percent of Americans have bought or held cryptocurrency in the last year, and only two percent have ever used it to buy anything. But digital assets are increasingly part of the economy. You may now be able to use crypto as collateral for a mortgage, and this past week the president signed an executive order to make it easier to hold cryptocurrencies in your 401(k).",
      "All the attention has helped drive the price of bitcoin to an all-time high, recently passing $120,000 each.",
      "Bailey says bitcoin was about $10 when he first bought it. Asked how much he bought, he replied, \"Well, you know, that's something I'm not going to talk about on camera. Not enough, let's just go like that. Not enough.\"",
      "And as crypto's fortunes have improved, so have the president's; CBS News estimates that crypto ventures controlled by the Trump family have made up to $765 million in revenue from token sales since the fall of 2024.",
      "The White House did not respond to questions about the token sales, but in a statement told CBS News, \"Neither the President nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest.\"",
      "Most experts in government ethics believe the situation is unprecedented.",
      "I asked Bailey, \"Has it ever occurred to you that maybe the president has changed his position on bitcoin and crypto because he can personally benefit from it, or his family can?\"",
      "\"No, absolutely not,\" said Bailey. \"I don't think he embraced this industry to enrich himself; I think that he just sees the same potential that I see. When you get excited about an idea, you feel compelled to do something about it.\"",
      "Trump Media buys $2 billion in bitcoin as it pursues crypto treasury strategy",
      "Trump Media buys $2 billion in bitcoin as it pursues crypto treasury strategy",
      "And that potential is why investors are betting that crypto will soon become part of everyday life. Vice President Vance told the audience at Bitcoin 2025, \"We want our fellow Americans to know that crypto and digital assets, and particularly Bitcoin, are part of the mainstream economy and are here to stay.\"",
      "But for Amanda Fischer, that's a gamble not worth taking.",
      "\"We heard the same thing about subprime mortgages going into 2008,\" said Fischer. \"We heard the same thing about complex financial derivatives going into the last crisis, too. These products are wonderful and there are ways to extract so much value in wealth, until they're not. And I fear that crypto is going to follow down the same path. Things are going great many times, until they're not.\"",

    "summary": "Instagram rolled out a new Map feature that lets users see their friends' locations in real time. Here's why privacy experts are concerned.",
    "story": [
      "A new feature on Instagram that lets users share their real-time physical location with others on the app has privacy experts concerned over the amount of data exposed and potential safety risks to users.",
      "Called Instagram Map, the new feature was introduced on Thursday as part of an app update. On its blog, the company says the location-sharing tool makes it \"easier for you and your friends to stay in touch through the content you're enjoying on Instagram.\"",
      "\"You can opt into sharing your last active location with friends you pick, and you can turn it off anytime,\" Instagram said in a blog post announcing the new feature. \"You can also open the map to see content your friends and favorite creators are posting from cool spots. No matter how you use the map, you and your friends have a new, lightweight way to connect with each other.\"",
      "\"Off by default\"",
      "In a statement shared with CBS MoneyWatch Friday, Instagram's parent company, Meta, emphasized that Instagram Maps is not automatically active upon updating the app and that users must opt-in to the location-sharing feature in order to make their whereabouts visible to others.",
      "\"Instagram Map is off by default, and your live location is never shared unless you choose to turn it on. If you do, only people you follow back \u2014 or a private, custom list you select \u2014 can see your location,\" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Users can also choose not to share their locations when they are in particular places, or with particular people.",
      "Still, privacy experts say that social media users aren't always aware of how much information they're sharing with an app or its users, even if they have the ability to limit who sees what.",
      "\"The more these location features are rolled out on social media it carries out the assumption that as long as you give users the ability to toggle them on and off that they'll know exactly how to do that,\" Douglas Zytko, an app safety expert and associate professor at the College of Innovation & Technology at the University of Michigan-Flint, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But the average user isn't always aware of their privacy settings and if they match their preferences.\"",
      "When the Instagram Map feature is turned on, any content a user posts with a location tagged, including a reel, post or story, will show up on the app's map for 24 hours, according to the Instagram blog. While the feature remains on, the user's location is updated whenever they open the app or return to it. The feature can be turned off at any time.",
      "In an Instagram post discussing the feature, Instagram's head, Adam Mosseri, explains how he himself uses the map. \"Personally, I use the map to share what I'm up to with a handful of my closest friends, and I curate that list carefully,\" he said.",
      "User confusion over whether the feature is on or off",
      "On Threads, Meta's microblogging site, a number of Instagram account holders claimed that their locations were being pinned on friends' maps by default.",
      "Mosseri weighed in, saying the concerns prompted the company to re-examine how the feature works.",
      "\"We're double-checking everything, but so far it looks mostly like people are confused and assume that, because they can see themselves on the map when they open, other people can see them too,\" he said. \"We're still checking everything though to make sure nobody shares location without explicitly deciding to do so, which, by the way, requires a double consent by design (we ask you to confirm after you say you want to share).\"",
      "How to turn on Instagram Maps",
      "In the top right corner of the app, tap on the messaging function. There you will see a circular world map icon labeled \"map. If you click on the icon, you will see you're on location pinned on a map. Friends who are sharing their locations will also appear. Click on the gear icon to choose to share your location with no one, or a custom list of friends, or all of your friends \u2014 who are followers that you also follow back on the app.",
      "Social pressures, privacy and safety risks",
      "Zytko, however, said it can be complicated for social media users to manage privacy settings that let them share different kinds of content with different groups of people. \"This issue is called 'context collapse,'\" he said. \"Your co-workers see your social media posts, and your friends and family, and there is certain content you only want some groups to see but not others, and it can be hard to manage the visibility of content.\"",
      "Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which makes entertainment and technology recommendations for families, said location-sharing features can be particularly risky for younger app users.",
      "\"These features might feel fun and social, but they create unnecessary risks that teens and many adults don't necessarily understand,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "While parents who supervise their teens through controls built into the app can control their kids' location-sharing settings, he still has concerns about the kinds of social pressures such features expose teens, too.",
      "Torney said research at Common Sense Media shows that location-sharing also creates \"social pressures around where teens go and who they spend time with, and kids feel obligated to share location to show they are someplace cool.\"",
      "Furthermore, when teens share their locations, \"they are potentially telling strangers where they are in real time,\" Torney told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you're not selective about who you're sharing your location with, it creates opportunities for harassment, stalking or worse.\"",

      "Wendy's cut its sales outlook Friday, pointing to heightened competition and economic uncertainty weighing on its customer base.",
      "Company executives discussed Wendy's challenges during a call with analysts Friday, following the release of its latest earnings report. Interim CEO Ken Cook said that in light of the current environment, the company now expects full-year global sales to decline between 3% and 5%, compared with previous\u00a0projections\u00a0of flat to down 2%.",
      "Wendy's is coping with softer consumer demand in 2025, particularly among the lower-income customers that tend to frequent fast-food chains, Sara Senatore, a research analyst at Bank of America, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The low-income consumer remains under pressure,\" she said.",
      "Fast food chains like Wendy's are competing for the attention of low-income consumers who have pulled back on eating out over concerns about the economy. According to a May study from Bankrate, among households earning less than $50,000 per year, 44% say they expect to spend less on dining out this year than they did last year.",
      "Cook, who stepped in as interim CEO after former Wendy's CEO Kirk Tanner departed to lead the Hershey Company, cited \"a combination of dynamic consumer behavior and a more challenging competitive environment\" during a Friday call with analysts to discuss the results.",
      "While sales improved in May and June due to new Frosty offerings, \"overall demand recovered more slowly than we expected,\" he added. The burger chain's sales slipped 1.8% to $3.7 billion in the second quarter compared with a year earlier, according to the company's earnings report.",
      "Inflation-weary consumers who are skipping breakfast could signal this growing pressure, with Wendy's executives highlighting the trend.",
      "\"Breakfast continued to perform worse than rest of day in the second quarter, which makes sense when you look at what's happening from a consumer behavior perspective,\" Cook said. \"When consumer uncertainty increases and consumers choose to eat another meal at home, breakfast is often the first place that they that they do that with.\"",
      "Meanwhile, McDonald's, which last year saw a sales slowdown from low-income consumers, reversed that trend following its decision to\u00a0expand its value menu. CEO Chris Kempczinski told analysts earlier in the week that value items \u2014 which include its $2.99 Snack Wrap \u2014 are bringing some consumers back to its stores even as fast food visits across the industry have slowed.",
      "Senatore said Wendy's provides good values for price-conscious consumers, but added the chain may not be communicating that as effectively as its competitors. \"McDonald's has done a good job of marketing value, and that is something that Wendy's acknowledged that they needed to do,\" she said.",
      "Among other value offerings is the Wendy's Biggie Bag, which features a junior bacon cheeseburger, small fries, four-piece chicken nuggets and a soft drink for $5.",
      "Asked about adjusting core menu pricing during Friday's call, Cook said the company plans to use new data analytics capabilities to evaluate its prices.",

      "The 1973 law allows the president to require the D.C. mayor to provide \"such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the President may deem necessary and appropriate\" for a period of 48 hours, a deadline that can be extended by up to 30 days by notifying Congress, which the president has done. Any extension beyond 30 days requires a joint resolution passed by the House and Senate.",
      "Speaking at the Kennedy Center, Mr. Trump said he expects Congress to extend the federal takeover, saying, \"We think the Republicans will do it almost unanimously.\"",
      "\"We're going to need a crime bill that we're going to be putting in and it's going to pertain initially to D.C.,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We're going to be asking for extensions on that, long-term extensions, because you can't have 30 days.\"",
      "Although Republicans have majorities in both the House and Senate, the extension would require the support of at least seven Democrats to advance, since most legislation functions under a 60-vote threshold in the upper chamber, where Republicans control 53 seats.",

Robberies have dropped by 28% this year and overall violent crime is down 26%, as of Aug. 11.

      "A federal judge on Tuesday said he would block the Trump administration from using a federal building in New York City to hold immigrants facing deportation unless it reduces the number of detainees and improves conditions at the site, including by providing sleeping mats and hygiene products.",
      "U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan issued the temporary restraining order after holding a hearing earlier Tuesday. A government lawyer conceded in court that those detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, at the Manhattan facility did not have access to certain services, including sleeping mats, in-person legal visits, medication and more than two meals per day.",
      "The holding facility in question, located inside the 26 Federal Plaza building in downtown Manhattan, has been at the center of widespread criticism from pro-immigrant advocates, who have denounced conditions faced by detainees there as \"inhumane.\" Video released last month showed detainees at the facility lying on the ground, without mats or beds.",
      "ICE has said the site has fewer services because it is not designed for long-term detention, though government data indicates some detainees have been held for days there.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security denied allegations of substandard conditions in ICE's detention system and vowed to appeal the order.",
      "\"Any claim of subprime conditions at ICE facilities are categorically false,\" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in the statement. \"Federal Plaza operates as a processing center, brief intake for illegal aliens, and then transfer to an ICE detention center meeting national standards for care and custody, which are in most cases better than facilities which detain Americans.\"",
      "Last week, the American Civil Liberties Union and other advocates filed a lawsuit against ICE over the 26 Federal Plaza holding facility, alleging that detainees there were being held in unsafe and unsanitary conditions, without access to basic necessities, including hygiene products. The advocates said detainees only received two \"inedible\" meals daily and were denied access to unrestricted calls with lawyers.",
      "On Tuesday morning, Justice Department lawyer Jeffrey Oestericher said the government did not dispute that detainees at the facility only received blankets, not beds or sleeping mats. He confirmed detainees get two meals each day \u2014 not three \u2014 and that the toilets for detainees are inside the same area where they sleep. Oestericher said the facility does not permit in-person visitations due to its \"layout\" and noted the government did not dispute claims that detainees lack access to medication.",
      "In his order later Tuesday, Kaplan placed restrictions on how many people ICE can hold at the Manhattan site, prohibiting the agency from using holding rooms with a floor area that is less than 50 square feet per detainee.",
      "Kaplan said ICE could only hold people at the facility if it offered them regular calls with lawyers, clean bedding mats, know-your-rights notices, access to medication, soap, towels, toilet paper, toothpaste and feminine hygiene products. He also ordered ICE to ensure the holding areas are cleaned three times each day.",
      "Tuesday's temporary restraining order is set to last for 14 days. The Trump administration has repeatedly denied allegations of subpar conditions at ICE detention centers.",
      "\"Today's order sends a clear message: ICE cannot hold people in abusive conditions and deny them their Constitutional rights to due process and legal representation,\" said Eunice Cho, a senior attorney at the ACLU.",

      "The legal fight over the Manhattan holding facility comes at a time when ICE is detaining record numbers of people facing deportation. On Tuesday morning, ICE was holding nearly 60,000 detainees in detention centers throughout the U.S., according to internal agency data.",
      "As part of President Trump's government-wide crackdown on illegal immigration, ICE has sought to expand its detention system by bringing new facilities online, brokering agreements with states willing to convert local sites into immigration detention centers and using military bases, like Fort Bliss in Texas, as deportation staging hubs.",

    "story": [
      "Lawyers for the state of California and the federal government faced off in court Tuesday over President Trump's deployment of thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles.",
      "The attorney for the state, Meghan Strong, argued that having what she called a \"standing army\" in Los Angeles is \"unprecedented\" and goes against a \"deep-rooted policy against military involvement in civilian life.\" She said that Mr. Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth \"think that they can disregard that policy on a whim.\"",
      "Californians \"have been forced to endure anxiety and fear caused by the pervasive presence of this standing army,\" said Strong.",
      "Mr. Trump sent in around 700 Marines and 4,000 California National Guard troops to protect federal property and law enforcement agents during a series of protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in early June. The deployment prompted a lawsuit from Gov. Gavin Newsom, who did not approve of the use of his state's Guard forces and called the move an illegal \"power grab.\"",
      "At issue in the three-day bench trial pitting Newsom against the Trump administration is whether the troops violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which generally prohibits military personnel from carrying out domestic law enforcement.",
      "Strong alleged that the federal government acted in violation of that 1878 law, saying troops were used to provide armed security for federal agents, set roadblocks and perimeters that restricted civilian movement, and detained civilians.",
      "California asked U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer for an injunction that would let the military protect federal property \u2014 like courthouses and ICE facilities \u2014 but block it from continuing the support for immigration enforcement operations, which the state's lawyer called an \"unlawful military crusade.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Eric Hamilton, a lawyer for the Justice Department, argued that the military deployment is legal, with the purpose of protecting federal property and personnel. He said that no violation of the Posse Comitatus Act exists.",
      "The federal government's only witness \u2014 Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, who was at one point commanding general of the Guard task force in Los Angeles \u2014 said he was instructed \"that we were not conducting law enforcement operations and that we were there to serve the United States.\"",
      "\"We took our duty very seriously, and care and professionalism was always exhibited,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump justified the deployment using a law called Title 10, which allows the president to call up Guard forces during a \"rebellion,\" or if he is unable \"with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\" In an early June memo, Mr. Trump said the protests in Los Angeles \"constitute a form of rebellion\" and endangered federal agents.",
      "Breyer had previously ruled that Mr. Trump used Title 10 unlawfully, but he was overruled by an appellate court that said Mr. Trump had discretion to decide if that law applied.",
      "Since then, most of the troops have left Los Angeles, with roughly 300 Guard forces remaining. But the issue has drawn more attention in recent days, as the Trump administration deploys National Guard forces to Washington, D.C.",
      "The administration says that deployment is necessary to support law enforcement and crack down on violent crime, but local leaders have condemned the federal government's intervention.",
      "Strong cautioned that \"Los Angeles is only the beginning,\" citing recent comments from Mr. Trump that she said indicated he may deploy the National Guard to other cities, including Oakland and New York.",
      "A \"constitutional exception?\"",
      "Parts of Tuesday's testimony hinged on an alleged \"constitutional exception\" to the Posse Comitatus Act.",
      "At one point, Sherman referred to a \"constitutional exception.\" He testified that he was advised federal troops were allowed to do \"four things\" that would normally be barred under the law \u2014 security patrols, traffic control, crowd control and riot control \u2014 \"because it was in line with what the President was directing\" and \"what the Secretary of Defense was directing.\"",
      "But Judge Breyer was unaware of such an exception and pressed Sherman on the issue.",
      "\"I'm not a lawyer,\" said Sherman.",
      "\"That may be to your credit,\" responded Breyer.",
      "Breyer later asked if Sherman ever received legal advice that if the Guard task force engaged in certain activities, it would violate the Posse Comitatus Act. Sherman testified that he was told, since Mr. Trump's memo said the Los Angeles protests were a form of rebellion that prevented federal agents from doing their jobs, that triggered the constitutional exception. \"This is all the way from the top of DOD down to Task Force 51,\" he said.",
      "California's attorney, Strong, disputed this \"mysterious constitutional exception,\" arguing that neither the president nor the secretary of defense \"can create an exception to the Posse Comitatus Act.\"",
      "\"That means all the directives we've seen the past two days are wrong and what they told soldiers to do was illegal,\" she said. \"Those directives are based on a constitutional exception that doesn't exist.\"",
      "One exception to the Posse Comitatus Act is the Insurrection Act, which lets the president use the military to enforce the law during an insurrection. Mr. Trump has not invoked that law.",
      "\"If he calls something a rebellion, it is a rebellion?\"",
      "Mr. Trump's description of the Los Angeles protests as a \"rebellion\" was raised again in court on Tuesday, after Sherman testified Monday that he didn't hear the term used to describe the demonstrations.",
      "Sherman clarified on Tuesday that he knew Mr. Trump's memo called the protests a rebellion.",
      "The judge later pushed back against the idea that Mr. Trump has the discretion to decide if a \"rebellion\" is occurring. \"If he calls something a rebellion, it is a rebellion?\" Breyer asked, repeatedly.",
      "The federal government's attorney, Hamilton, said that the president is commander in chief, and he's entitled to deference in that judgment. But when asked by the judge multiple times, he acknowledged that it doesn't make it a rebellion.",
      "Breyer further questioned Mr. Trump's ability to dictate what the law allows, when Hamilton argued that there was no violation of the Posse Comitatus Act because the military was serving a protective function in Los Angeles.",
      "\"Are you saying that because the president says it, therefore it is?\" said Breyer.",
      "\"If the president says you can do X,\" he continued, \"because the president has said it, that's sufficient to take it out of the Posse Comitatus Act?\"",
      "The trial will conclude on Wednesday.",

    "summary": "Federal funding cuts to mRNA technology research doesn't just impact COVID vaccines \u2014 experts say it could stall progress in treatment for cancers, rare disease and more.",
    "story": [
      "If you think last week's decision by the federal government to halt $500 million in funding\u00a0for vaccine development projects that use mRNA technology will only affect COVID vaccines, think again.",
      "These types of vaccines\u00a0use\u00a0messenger RNA, or mRNA, to prompt the body to make proteins that induce an antibody response to protect against a pathogen. The science behind it is also being studied for a wide range of other uses, from fighting cancer to treating autoimmune conditions and more.",
      "Health experts have criticized the move to defund this research, pointing to the impact it will have on America's ability to develop breakthroughs against deadly or debilitating diseases.",
      "Jeff Coller, professor of RNA biology and therapeutics at Johns Hopkins University, called the cuts a \"completely reckless decision from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\" that was \"clearly being made for political motivations and not those that are rested in our science.\"",
      "Former Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams, who served in the first Trump administration, said the technology \"helps us develop vaccines and new treatments,\" and warned that cuts could halt progress in one of the \"most promising areas of modern medicine.\"",
      "\"People are going to die because we're cutting short funding for this technology,\" Adams said in a recent appearance on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "mRNA studied for pancreatic cancer, rare diseases and more",
      "Collier said one of the most exciting avenues for mRNA technology is in the treatment of deadly cancers, including pancreatic cancer, which is fatal for many patients within six months to a year.",
      "In recent years, researchers have been testing the effectiveness of using an mRNA vaccine to target the cancer. A small NIH-funded clinical trial by Sloan Kettering in 2023 used infusions of an mRNA vaccine to help boost T cells in the immune system of pancreatic cancer patients. The results, published in the journal\u00a0Nature, showed improvements among about 50% of participants.",
      "\"It was, in essence, the start of a cure for pancreatic cancer, where half of the patients in that study were surviving,\" Coller said.",
      "The early results encouraged scientists, but the small sample size called for further studies, which led to a\u00a0Phase 2 trial published in Nature earlier this year.",
      "Experimental mRNA-focused treatments have also showed promise in fighting lung,\u00a0colorectal and gastric cancers. For example, a study published online in the journal Gastric Cancer\u00a0found a mRNA-based vaccine led to robust gastric tumor regression in mice.",
      "And earlier this year, the world was was awed by news that an infant named KJ Muldoon became the first patient to undergo personalized gene-editing treatment using a technique known as CRISPR to fix a rare and potentially fatal genetic disorder.",
      "As Coller pointed out, the CRISPR technology had to be delivered via mRNA.",
      "\"This opens a floodgate for rare diseases,\" he said. \"We're now talking about, could we use the same technology to go after all rare diseases?\"",
      "Autoimmune diseases are another area of research, for treating things like multiple sclerosis, Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease.",
      "While all of these are still at the early research stage, Coller urged the importance of investing in this technology now for future progress.",
      "\"We need to do experiments and see where we can get with the next generation of mRNA-based drugs,\" he said.",
      "Like with COVID-19, there has also been continued research on mRNA-based vaccines for infectious diseases like the flu, RSV, Zika virus and cytomegalovirus, known as CMV, an infection that can be harmful to babies exposed during the mother's pregnancy.",
      "\"We're at a point where, if we continue to develop this technology, we'll get more personalized, bespoke medicine that we can use on patients and improve health care outcomes,\" Coller said.",
      "How is mRNA medicine so versatile?",
      "RNA stands for ribonucleic acid, an essential molecule in the body's cells. It is similar to DNA but has different functions. Messenger RNA, or mRNA, carries the information required for making proteins.",
      "As Coller put it: \"If your DNA is a cookbook, your mRNA is an individual recipe that's telling your body what to do.\"",
      "To harness that power for treating disease, \"All we're doing with this technology is giving it new recipes. We're taking advantage of this powerful natural system that exists in your body,\" he said.",
      "The versatility and potential to help such a range of illnesses is what has experts like Coller \u2014 who was not immediately impacted by the funding cuts \u2014 hoping the administration will reinstate funding for mRNA research.",
      "\"We have to keep moving forward,\" he said. \"People wanting to improve their family's lives and their children's lives is a bipartisan issue, it's truly an American issue. So we've got to keep moving.\"",

      "Louisville, Kentucky\u00a0\u2014 GE Appliances plans to shift production of refrigerators, gas ranges and water heaters out of China and Mexico as part of a more than $3 billion investment to expand its U.S. operations in Kentucky, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and South Carolina.",
      "The investment \u2014 the second-largest in the Louisville-based company's history \u2014 is expected to add more than 1,000 jobs while ramping up domestic production and modernizing plants in the next five years.",
      "\"Our long-term strategy is about manufacturing close to our customers,\" said CEO Kevin Nolan. \"With lean manufacturing, upskilling our workforce and automation, the math works for manufacturing in the United States.\"",
      "The majority of GE's appliance production is already in the U.S. and the shift means only that the company will transfer more work to its domestic plants.",
      "GE will relocate production of gas ranges from Mexico to a plant in Georgia, while six refrigerator models now made in China will be manufactured at its Alabama plant, the company said.",
      "In June, the company said it would move production of clothes washers from China to its sprawling manufacturing complex in Louisville. The reshoring announcements come as President Trump tries to lure factories back to the United States by imposing import taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on foreign goods.",
      "Lee Lagomarcino, GE Appliances' vice president of clothes care, told CBS MoneyWatch at the time that high levies on\u00a0imports from China\u00a0under Mr. Trump have compelled it to \"accelerate the decision-making.\"",
      "GE Appliances said Wednesday that the first phase of its new investment will begin at plants in five Southern states \u2014 Kentucky, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina.",
      "\"We are defining the future of manufacturing at GE Appliances by investing in our plants, people and communities,\" Nolan said. \"No other appliance company over the last decade has invested more in U.S. manufacturing than we have, and our $3 billion, five-year plan shows that our commitment to U.S. manufacturing will continue into the future.\"",
      "The multiyear plan includes ramping up production of gas ranges that have been made in Mexico but will shift to the company's plant in LaFayette, Georgia, the company said. Production of six refrigerators now made in China will move to its plant in Decatur, Alabama.",
      "GE's plant in Camden, South Carolina, will add production of electric and hybrid heat pump water heaters, doubling the factory's output and employment once the project is complete, the company said. The plant now produces gas water heaters. Production of the company's electric and hybrid water heaters \u2014 now made in China \u2014 will shift to South Carolina.",
      "In Selmer, Tennessee, its plant will produce two new models of air conditioners.",
      "The latest investment includes the June announcement that GE Appliances will pump $490 million into its Kentucky complex to produce a combo washer/dryer and a lineup of front load washers that are now made in China. In all, production of more than 15 models of front load washers will shift to the company's Louisville complex \u2014 known as Appliance Park, it said.",
      "Once its new plan is fully implemented, GE Appliances will have invested $6.5 billion across its 11 U.S. manufacturing plants and nationwide distribution network since 2016, it said.",
      "Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Wednesday that the investment shows his state's ability to support world-class companies with a skilled workforce and the resources needed to thrive.",
      "\"GE Appliances has established Kentucky as America's destination for advanced manufacturing and job creation, and today's news shows this iconic company's unwavering belief in the commonwealth and the role we play in their success,\" Beshear said.",
      "GE Appliances handles product design and engineering work at its Louisville headquarters but doesn't make all of its products in the U.S. It contracts with other manufacturers, including in China, for some of its production where it doesn't have capacity or needs access to a global supply chain. The company said its core business strategy is to base production in the United States, and investments announced in June and on Wednesday are another step toward achieving that goal.",
      "The company said it's partnering with universities, technical schools and high schools to help ensure that its plants and other facilities have a trained workforce.",
      "\"Infrastructure and tools matter, but they are not enough,\" said Bill Good, vice president of supply chain for GE Appliances. \"America's manufacturing renaissance will be built by people.\"",
      "GE Appliances is a subsidiary of the China-based Haier company.",
      "Overall, GE Appliances says it contributes more than $30 billion annually to the U.S. economy and supports more than 113,000 jobs \u2014 both directly and indirectly \u2014 through its operations, suppliers and distribution network.",

    "summary": "President Trump is calling up the D.C. National Guard and federal law enforcement to address crime in the capital.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced this week the deployment of 800 members of the D.C. National Guard to the District of Columbia, as part of a push to crack down on crime in the nation's capital.",
      "The president is also temporarily taking control of the District's Metropolitan Police Department. Hundreds of additional federal law enforcement officers have also joined the effort recently, from a variety of agencies fanning out across the city.",
      "\"I'm deploying the National Guard to help reestablish law, order and public safety in D.C., and they're going to be allowed to do their job properly,\" Mr. Trump said at a White House news conference Monday.",
      "The Army has activated the D.C. National Guard to \"assist law enforcement in the nation's capital,\" it said in a statement and added that of the approximately 800 soldiers activated, 100 to 200 would be supporting law enforcement at any given time on an \"array of tasks from administrative, logistics and physical presence.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Trump administration's deployment of federal law enforcement and National Guard troops in the District.",
      "What is the National Guard doing in D.C.?",
      "The District of Columbia is unique in that it's controlled by the federal government, which means the president has authority over the D.C. National Guard.",
      "For now, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says Guard members will be supporting federal agents, as they recently did in Los Angeles, when they were brought in after protests against Trump administration immigration policies to help protect federal property and personnel enforcing the policies.",
      "The National Guard this week was activated under Title 32, which concerns the role of the Guard when it is under the control of its state's governor, or in this case, the president. D.C. Guard members have the authority to make arrests while they're in this status, but defense officials say that for now, the mission is focused on supporting law enforcement.",
      "Hegseth said the Guard was formally mobilized Monday morning and would be \"flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week.\" Asked by Fox News' Laura Ingraham later that day whether the Guard troops would be detaining American citizens on U.S. soil, Hegseth replied, \"Under Title 32, which is the authorization they'll be using, they have broad latitude. But they're not going to be involved in law enforcement functions.\"",
      "He elaborated on how they might be utilized, saying, \"You can help somebody, interdict, temporarily detain like we did in Los Angeles, and hand over to law enforcement.\"",
      "And Hegseth also said the Guard members in D.C. are \"going to be proactive.\"",
      "\"If you take an action or a shot at them, there will be a consequence,\" he told Ingraham.",
      "The Army on Tuesday posted photos of the National Guard near the Washington Monument on X with the comment, \"D.C. National Guard reporting for duty.\"\u00a0Some of the vehicles\u00a0appeared to belong to the D.C. National Guard's 273rd Military Police Company, which often helps with security for high-profile D.C. events like presidential inaugurations and Independence Day celebrations, the unit's website says.",
      "The Guard troops while in Title 32 status are not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the U.S. military from carrying out domestic law enforcement actions.",
      "Members of the D.C. Guard deployed in Title 32 status in 2020, in response to protests over the killing of George Floyd, when the D.C. government requested additional manpower. They also deployed in Title 32 status in response to the Jan. 6, 2021 assault on the Capitol, after some delay.",
      "There isn't an end date for how long they can stay deployed this time. According to the executive order the president signed Monday, the deployment \"shall remain in effect\" until the president determines the \"conditions of law and order have been restored in the District of Columbia.\"",
      "Before they're sent to the D.C. streets, the service members will receive additional training on de-escalation tactics and rules for the use of force, according to defense officials.",
      "Hegseth said Monday at the White House that other guardsmen from other states and other \"specialized units\" are prepared to deploy to D.C. if needed.",
      "What is the president authorized to do with control of the D.C. police?",
      "The Home Rule Act of 1973 created D.C.'s elected government and framework for its interaction with the federal government.",
      "Section 740 of the law says \"whenever the president of the United States determines that special conditions of an emergency nature exist which require the use of the Metropolitan Police force for federal purposes, he may direct the mayor to provide him, and the mayor shall provide, such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the president may deem necessary and appropriate.\"",
      "Under the president's order, Drug Enforcement Administration Administrator Terry Cole is in charge of the daily D.C. Police operations, under the oversight of Attorney General Pam Bondi and Mr. Trump, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Cole has also been directed to work with D.C. police chief Pamela Smith.",
      "The law gives the president 48 hours to notify congressional leaders about his action, which Mr. Trump did on Monday. The president may remain in control of the D.C. police for up to 30 days, unless the House and Senate enact a joint resolution authorizing an extension.",
      "Leavitt said the deployment would be reassessed at the end of the 30-day period.",
      "The D.C. Police Department, which includes roughly 3,100 officers, has over 800 vacancies, according to the D.C. Police Union. The union, which is highly critical of D.C.'s mayor and city council, supports the federal takeover of the force.",
      "Who are the other federal law enforcement officials deployed to the streets of D.C.?",
      "Overnight Monday, about 850 officers and federal agents sent across the city made 23 arrests and seized six illegal handguns off the streets, Leavitt said Tuesday. The suspected offenses included homicide, firearms offenses, reckless driving, and driving under the influence, she said.",
      "\"This is only the beginning,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Participating members of what the White House is calling the Task Force's Law Enforcement Working Group throughout the operation include the U.S. Capitol Police, Homeland Security Investigations, the Federal Protective Service, the DEA, the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Department of the Interior, the U.S. Secret Service, and the U.S. Marshals Service. The White House generally isn't specifying which law enforcement entities are performing what responsibilities.",
      "Homeless people being relocated",
      "Leavitt said that the U.S. Park Police would continue to move homeless people off D.C. streets and suggested homeless shelters and mental health and addiction treatment centers are places they can go \u2014 or jail if they refuse.",
      "Before Mr. Trump's announcement Monday, the White House was already deploying federal law enforcement officers onto D.C. streets as a part of an effort to make the city cleaner and safer.",
      "How D.C. officials are responding to the federal takeover",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi met Tuesday with D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, along with the FBI director, head of the U.S. Marshals Service, the DEA's Cole and D.C. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro. The attorney general characterized the meeting as \"productive.\"",
      "But Bowser has called the president's takeover of the D.C. police \"unsettling and unprecedented,\" although her criticism of the Trump administration's move has been largely muted.",
      "The White House and Bowser appear to have conflicting ideas about the chain of command for the D.C. police. Bowser on Tuesday said the president has the authority to request services of the police, but \"our organizational chart, how we do business, how we fund the police, how we make changes, none of that has changed.\" That view conflicts with Leavitt's statement that\u00a0 Cole would be in charge of the police force, and would be overseen by the president and attorney general.",
      "D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith said the D.C. Police already work daily with federal law enforcement, and said she thinks an enhanced presence from the federal government may help.",
      "\"We know that we have to get illegal guns off of our street. And if we have this influx or enhanced presence, it's going to make our city even better,\" Smith said.",
      "\"I won't go into the details of our operational plan at this point, but you will see the Metropolitan Police Department working side by side with our federal partners in order to enforce the efforts that we need around the city,\" Smith said.",
      "James  LaPorta and \n                                                  \n                                  Jacob  Rosen\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "In Tuesday's all-hands, new CDC Director Susan Monarez described the shooting as \"an attack in our community \u2026 and in many ways the very mission that we serve.\" She warned that \"misinformation can be dangerous \u2026 we need to rebuild the trust together,\" urging \"rational, evidence-based discourse \u2026 with compassion and understanding.\"",
      "CDC security chief Jeff Williams told staff investigators view the incident as \"a targeted attack on the CDC related to COVID-19.\" He said agency security \"stopped\" an intrusion that could have resulted in many more casualties, that nearly 100 children at the childcare center were reunited with parents that night, and that investigators recovered nearly 500 shell casings. More than 180 rounds struck six buildings, leaving extensive damage that will take time to repair.",
      "Monarez closed the meeting by honoring fallen DeKalb County Police Officer David Rose and pointing staff to a CDC Foundation fund for his family.",
      "In April, more than 200 staff were fired from the CDC's Injury Prevention Center. In the aftermath of Friday's shooting, several CDC employees noted the grim irony: the team charged with studying how to prevent firearm violence had been dismissed.",
      "One employee who spoke with CBS News on background, because they were not authorized to comment publicly, described Monarez's remarks as \"heavily scripted.\" Another staffer said, \"Monarez is new and doesn't know the agency, but she could have brought in career leaders \u2026 to show that she's working hand in hand with experienced CDC leaders. It feels like most of the CDC community is really trying to unify and support each other.\" A union message referred to the meeting, which lasted from 11:12 a.m. to 11:24 a.m., as \"insultingly insufficient,\" and invited workers to a noon healing session.",
      "\"Dr. Monarez and CDC leadership remain focused on supporting staff during an extraordinarily difficult time as evidenced by their continued direct engagement,\" Andrew Nixon, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, told CBS News. \"Friday's shooting was a traumatic event for the agency, and leadership is working to provide continued updates along with resources for healing and recovery. There will be continued opportunities for staff engagement and dialogue in the days ahead.\"",
      "Several employees praised separate Saturday and Tuesday calls for the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, led by Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, describing them as \"validating,\" with clear next steps and mental-health resources. Monarez joined the Saturday call and \"was more natural and less scripted,\" a staffer said.",
      "On Tuesday, Daskalakis told staff, \"We've experienced a horrific and intentionally targeted attack \u2026 we're shocked, we're grieving, we're scared,\" and he urged teams to use the space to speak frankly. He emphasized that CDC would take \"time and space before we come back,\" noting the investigation is \"complex and ongoing.\"",
      "The meeting centered on mental health and resources to support traumatized staffers. Daskalakis introduced Dr. David Schonfeld of the National Center for School Crisis and Bereavement at the Children's Hospital Los Angeles, who walked through common post-crisis reactions.",
      "\"Most people try and hide their distress,\" he said, encouraging employees to seek support rather than suppress their feelings. Trying to do so, he added, \"is not a superpower.\"",
      "Daskalakis noted reports that the suspect was angry about COVID-19 vaccines and influenced by conspiracy theories. \"This is not our fault,\" he said. \"Our work is love and what we experienced is hate.\"",
      "Many of the CDC's centers are currently led by acting directors, after several center directors were reassigned to the Indian Health Service earlier this year.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. visited the CDC's campus on Monday, three days after the attack, while most staff were instructed by leadership to telework due to safety concerns and the ongoing assessments following the shootings. On the same day that he visited the CDC, Kennedy gave an interview to Scripps News in which he once again raised questions about vaccine safety, drawing sharp criticism from some CDC staff, who argued that anti-vaccine rhetoric, including from Kennedy, helped create the conditions for the attack.",
      "HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon told CBS News, \"This is a time to stand in solidarity with our public health workforce and we hope the media will respect the moment rather than exploiting a tragedy and further exacerbating an already harrowing experience by the dedicated CDC staff.\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said, \"Violence has no place in any civil society, and the White House extends our heartfelt condolences to the family of Officer David Rose and the entire CDC team.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Aug 2025 19:57:28 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has installed four U.S. attorneys without Senate confirmation, prompting questions about checks on executive power.",
    "story": [
      "Federal judges in several states have rejected President Trump's controversial picks for top prosecutor posts in a rare standoff between the courts and the White House, but those acting U.S. attorneys will nonetheless remain in place because of actions taken by the president and the Justice Department.",
      "Last month in New York and New Jersey, panels of federal district judges declined to appoint two of Mr. Trump's interim choices to serve as U.S. attorneys \u2013 John Sarcone III of New York and Alina Habba of New Jersey. By law, if the Senate fails to confirm a nominee for a judicial post within 120 days, the District Court can extend the interim appointee or select someone else to serve in an acting capacity until a presidential nominee is confirmed.",
      "In New York, the court declined to extend the interim top prosecutor but also declined to appoint an acting U.S. attorney.",
      "In New Jersey, a panel of judges replaced Habba with Desiree Leigh Grace, the first assistant to the U.S. attorney and the next-highest ranking prosecutor in that office. Within hours, however, the Justice Department fired Grace and installed Habba as acting U.S. attorney, extending her term for another 210 days.",
      "To keep Sarcone in place, Attorney General Pam Bondi named him \"special attorney to the attorney general,\" effectively giving him the power of a U.S. attorney, and he was named first assistant U.S. attorney, leaving him in charge of the office.",
      "The Trump administration employed similar maneuvers in Nevada and California in late July, this time appointing both interim U.S. attorneys in an acting capacity before the judges were to vote. Those two are Bilal \"Bill\" Essayli in California, and Sigal Chattah in Nevada.",
      "Why some of the acting U.S. attorneys have faced resistance",
      "The clash with the judiciary has come as some legal experts have expressed concern about actions taken by these Trump appointees or by comments they've made.",
      "Essayli, a former assistant U.S. attorney for California, has been accused of politicizing the office by pushing his staff to pursue cases regarded as being aligned with Trump's interests. This has contributed to an exodus from the Los Angeles-based district, Bloomberg Law reported. Essayli is the only one of the four who has prior experience as a prosecutor.",
      "Chattah was in private practice and previously ran unsuccessfully for state attorney general in Nevada. Critics have also accused her of using public office to pursue prosecutions of her political opponents and criticized her use of racially charged language in the past.",
      "A group of more than 100 former judges sent a letter to the District Court in Nevada, urging the judicial panel to reject the extension of Chattah's appointment on the grounds of inflammatory remarks she had made in the past. In 2022, she said of her opponent state attorney general's race, Aaron Ford, who is Black, that he should be \"hanging from a f****** crane.\"",
      "Chattah, an Israeli, said the comment was not racist and is just a common Israeli saying. Ford won the election and is still in office as Nevada's attorney general.",
      "Habba was one of Mr. Trump's\u00a0personal lawyers\u00a0before his 2024 election and was initially named White House counselor. As interim U.S. attorney, she initiated investigations into New Jersey's Democratic governor and attorney general, on allegations that they were not cooperating with federal immigration authorities. Upon being named interim U.S. attorney, Habba said she'd use the office to help \"turn New Jersey red,\" though U.S. attorneys are supposed to remain politically neutral. She also filed and later dropped a criminal trespassing charge against the Newark mayor, a Democrat, and accused Democratic Rep. Monica McIver of felony assault at an immigration protest.",
      "It's not just judges, but also defendants who are challenging Habba's appointment, alleging she holds the office unlawfully. Two individuals being prosecuted by Habba's office have filed motions to dismiss their cases, arguing she illegitimately holds the position.",
      "On Friday, Sarcone's office in the Northern District of New York subpoenaed state Attorney General Letitia James as part of its investigation into whether she and her office violated Mr. Trump's civil rights in the fraud lawsuit she brought against him in 2022. He was found liable of civil fraud in February 2024, months before his re-election. Sarcone served in Mr. Trump's first administration as a regional administrator for the General Services Administration.",
      "The U.S. Attorney's offices in Northern New York, New Jersey, Nevada and California have not responded to requests for comment.",
      "Sidestepping the Senate and the Judiciary",
      "Trump's administration isn't the first to exploit the acting official loophole \u2013 several administrations have relied on it in the past. In 2014, President Barack Obama appointed Vanita Gupta as acting head of the Justice Department Civil Rights Division amid the department's investigation into the Missouri shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown by a police officer. As the CATO Institute's Thomas Berry pointed out, Obama never nominated Gupta for the permanent position, but she served well beyond the 210 days allowed by the Vacancies Act. Gupta left office in January 2017, as Mr. Trump was beginning his first term.",
      "The scheme has received more attention from legal experts recently in light of the controversial nature of the four attorneys and the administration's overt push to sidestep the Senate and the judiciary.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson said Mr. Trump and Bondi have built a \"fantastic team\" of prosecutors with full departmental support. The spokesperson declined to comment on why the department chose to use the Vacancies Act to temporarily appoint the individuals, rather than sending them through the traditional Senate confirmation process.",
      "The Justice Department's use of the maneuver has raised the ire of several legal experts, who said they were concerned by the administration's moves to sidestep judicial authority.",
      "Michael Luttig, a former federal judge who signed onto the letter urging the rejection of Chattah's appointment, told CBS News that Mr. Trump's efforts to install U.S. attorneys without the Senate's approval are a part of a larger assault on the justice system and the rule of law.",
      "\"Every action that he's taken has been intended to harass, intimidate and threaten the federal judiciary into submission to his will,\" Luttig said.",
      "U.S. attorneys and the Vacancies Act",
      "Across the country, 93 U.S. attorneys lead the federal prosecutor's office in their judicial district. Each presidential appointee must be confirmed by the Senate to serve on a permanent basis. Confirmation can be a lengthy process, so, under the Vacancies Act, the president can temporarily appoint an individual to fill Senate-confirmed roles on an interim basis to allow agencies and offices to continue to function.",
      "The act enables the president to appoint an interim U.S. attorney to any of those positions for 120 days. If the Senate hasn't confirmed a nominee by the end of that period, judges in the corresponding federal district court may extend the interim appointee or install a candidate they choose as acting U.S. attorney for another 210 days.",
      "\"My understanding is that under prior administrations, there would be some behind-the-scenes communication to make sure that the interim U.S. attorney picked by the administration was acceptable to the District Court,\" Berry told CBS News.",
      "For three of the four contested nominees, Mr. Trump did not submit a nomination for the post to the Senate within the 120-day interim period. He nominated Habba to be U.S. attorney for New Jersey on June 30 but withdrew her nomination when it became evident that the Senate would not confirm her.",
      "In addition to Habba's rejection by the judges, also standing in the way of her ability to stay on in the office was her nomination. Under the Vacancies Act, a person may not serve as an acting officer if the president has submitted that individual's nomination to the Senate.",
      "Withdrawing Habba's nomination meant Mr. Trump could fire Grace and appoint Habba to replace her as first assistant, allowing her to assume the acting title.",
      "In New York, Sarcone reached the end of his 120-day term without a nomination pending before the Senate. When his term expired, the District Court declined to extend Sarcone, and didn't appoint anyone to the position. The Justice Department says its appointment of Sarcone as \"special attorney to the attorney general\" would confer him with the authority of a U.S. attorney and is \"indefinite.\"",
      "As of Tuesday, six of Mr. Trump's 49 interim U.S. attorneys have served the maximum 120 days allowed under that status. Andrew Boutros of the Northern District of Illinois and Joseph Murphy of the Western District of Tennessee, have also seen their interim appointments expire.",
      "In their cases, though, the District Courts voted to extend them on the 120th day, a person familiar with the decisions confirmed to CBS News.",
      "It's not clear whether the Trump administration will continue to use the maneuver to appoint other U.S. attorneys. Mr. Trump has named at least 45 interim U.S. attorneys since January and has submitted nominations to the Senate for at least 30 of those picks.",
      "In early August, the Senate approved the first two of Mr. Trump's nominees for U.S. attorneys: Jeanine Pirro to serve in the District of Columbia and Jason A. Reding Qui\u00f1ones for the Southern District of Florida.",
      "Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, who serves as the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement to CBS News that the Trump administration is \"abusing\" the interim appointment authority to install loyalist interim U.S. attorneys without Senate confirmation.",

    "summary": "The State Dept. said the 2024 reports on countries were \"adjusted\" to be \"aligned to the administration's executive orders.\"",
    "story": [
      "The State Department on Tuesday released a long-awaited series of reports on worldwide human rights practices that reveal scaled-back criticism of select countries including El Salvador and harsher assessments of traditional U.S. allies, including the United Kingdom and Germany.",
      "The release follows a period of revisions that administration officials said were meant to \"streamline\" the reports, which cover events in about 200 countries in 2024 and had been largely completed by the end of the Biden administration. A note included with the reports said they had been \"adjusted\" to be \"aligned to the administration's executive orders.\"",
      "The 2024 reports omit references to LGBTQ discrimination issues and significantly pare back treatments of issues including gender-based violence and government corruption. They no longer include sections dedicated to systemic racial or ethnic discrimination or violence, or to child abuse or child sexual exploitation, among other deletions.",
      "Mandated by Congress, the reports have been produced annually by the State Department for decades and are used by U.S. policymakers, human rights workers, foreign governments and judicial bodies worldwide as a resource to inform potential arms sales and court proceedings, and they also function as a U.S.-led check on government corruption and abuses.",
      "Rights groups and former State Department officials decried the revisions as an \"erasure\" of the plight of marginalized communities and what they said was a politically motivated move that undermined the prior value of the reports.",
      "\"I think the signals are quite loud and quite clear of who they value and who they don't,\" said Desir\u00e9e Cormier Smith, former special representative for racial equity and justice, now with the Alliance for Diplomacy and Justice.",
      "In the case of El Salvador, which ended presidential term limits in early August and has an agreement with the Trump administration to accept and detain undocumented immigrants from the U.S., the report notes \"There were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses\" and that the government had taken \"credible steps to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses.\"",
      "The 2023 report made note of El Salvador's overcrowded prisons and reports of \"arbitrary killings; enforced disappearance; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by security forces; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrest or detention,\" and more.",
      "This year's report for Hungary notes \"no credible reports of significant human rights abuses\" though last year's included extensive mention of \"serious government corruption\" and restrictions on media freedom.",
      "Meanwhile the 2024 report for the United Kingdom notes the \"human rights situation worsened,\" citing \"credible reports of serious restrictions on freedom of expression, including enforcement of or threat of criminal or civil laws in order to limit expression; and crimes, violence, or threats of violence motivated by antisemitism.\" A similar assessment was offered for Germany and France, countries administration officials including Vice President JD Vance have publicly accused of censorship and the suppression of free speech.",
      "Asked by a reporter how the Trump administration squares its stricter monitoring of free expression via social media accounts of U.S. visa applicants with its criticism of European countries restricting hate speech, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a press briefing Tuesday that \"restrictive laws against dis-favored voices, often on political or religious grounds \u2014 no matter how disagreeable someone's speech may be \u2014 to criminalize it, or silencing it by force only serves as a catalyst for further hatred, suppression, and polarization.\"",
      "The 2024 report for Israel, the West Bank and Gaza does not include a death toll for Israelis or Palestinians since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, a figure that was included in 2023.",
      "The report acknowledged a Committee to Protect Journalists figure of 82 Palestinian journalists having been killed in the conflict last year, but also included a line saying that \"[i]n some cases, the IDF claimed the journalists killed were embedded with Hamas terrorists.\"",
      "The report did acknowledge troubling human rights records in several countries with which it has struck agreements to deport third national nationals, such as Libya. It noted credible reports of \"arbitrary or unlawful killings; disappearances; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; arbitrary arrest and detention\" and other abuses.",
      "It also noted of Afghanistan that there was \"widespread disregard for the rule of law and official impunity for those responsible for human rights abuses.\" The U.S. terminated temporary protected status for Afghans last month, leaving more than 12,000 vulnerable to deportation.",
      "Reports for Russia, China, North Korea and Iran noted this year, as they did in previous years, \"significant\" human rights issues and included criticism of inaction by their respective governments to identify or punish those who had committed abuses.",
      "\"The 2024 human rights report has been restructured in a way that removes redundancies, increases report readability and is more responsive to the legislative mandates that underpin the report,\" a senior State Department official said in a briefing last week. \"U.S. policy on promoting respect for human rights around the globe, or in any particular country, has not changed.\"",

    "story": [
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker on Tuesday signed new legislation requiring more thorough background checks before hiring police officers, a law inspired by the shooting death of Sonya Massey.",
      "Massey was shot and killed by former Sangamon County Sheriff's deputy Sean Grayson in July 2024 inside her home near Springfield.",
      "Grayson has been fired and\u00a0charged with first-degree murder in Massey's killing, and questions have been raised about why he was hired in the first place, given concerns about his conduct at past police jobs.",
      "Grayson\u00a0shot and killed Massey\u00a0as she was checking on a pot of boiling water in her kitchen while saying \"I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,\" but prosecutors have said Grayson asked her to move the pot off the stove, and that she never posed a danger that justified the use of lethal force.",
      "Earlier this year, the Illinois House and Illinois Senate overwhelmingly passed the Sonya Massey Act with bipartisan support. The legislation would require more comprehensive background checks before hiring police or other law enforcement officers in Illinois.",
      "Pritzker said Tuesday that he signed the measure \"to help prevent these tragedies, to better equip law enforcement to keep our communities safe, and to continue working to build a justice system that protects all of our citizens.\"",
      "The new law requires local, county, and state law enforcement agencies statewide to conduct full background checks on a potential hire before offering them a badge and gun.",
      "The measure also prohibits law enforcement agencies from making a final job offer unless they've reviewed all of an applicant's prior employment records.",
      "Anyone applying for a police officer job in Illinois would be required to authorize all previous employers, including other law enforcement agencies, to provide full employment records \u2013 including \"duty-related physical and psychological fitness-for-duty examinations; work performance records,\" and any criminal records or records of other investigations connected to their conduct on the job.",
      "\"Officers with histories of serious disciplinary issues should not be serving in those capacities in our communities, and those histories should not come to light only after disaster happens,\" Pritzker said. \"Our justice system needs to be built on trust. Communities should be able to trust that when they call the police to their home, the responding officer will be well-trained and without a history bias or misconduct. And police officers should be able to trust that they are serving alongside responsible and capable individuals.\"",
      "Massey's family has said they hope this new law will become a model for other states.",
      "\"Thank you for your support and God bless you,\" her mother, Donna Massey, said after the governor signed the legislation.",
      "Before Grayson was hired in Sangamon County and went on to kill Massey,\u00a0questions about his conduct\u00a0were well-documented by other police agencies. But those concerns were somehow never shared with the Sangamon County Sheriff's office during the hiring process.",
      "In his fifth police job, he refused to terminate a high-speed chase and drove more than 110 mph \u2014 only coming to an end when he hit a deer. A report from a department where Grayson was employed also said he struggled with report writing and was aggressive in his pursuit for drugs.",
      "Grayson is\u00a0scheduled to go on trial for Massey's death in October\u00a0in Peoria County. The Illinois Supreme Court is\u00a0weighing a request from Grayson to be released from jail ahead of his murder trial.",

    "story": [
      "The White House is launching an internal review of some of the Smithsonian Institution's best-known museums, seeking to \"celebrate American exceptionalism\" and remove what it views as \"divisive or ideologically driven language.\"",
      "The review was announced in a letter Tuesday to Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution Lonnie Bunch, signed by Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought and two other White House aides. It comes after President Trump signed an executive order in March pushing for changes at the Smithsonian, including the removal of \"improper ideology.\"",
      "The review is timed with next year's celebrations of the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the letter said.",
      "\"This initiative aims to ensure alignment with the President's directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions,\" the White House's letter read.",
      "The administration's review will initially focus on eight museums, including the National Museum of African American History and Culture \u2014 which was highlighted in Mr. Trump's executive order for allegedly featuring \"divisive, race-centered ideology\" \u2014 as well as the Air and Space Museum, the Museum of American History and the National Portrait Gallery, among others. Additional museums will be reviewed in a future phase.",
      "The letter said the reviewers will look at content for exhibits, plans for future exhibitions, collections and internal processes used by the museum's curators. It requested that museums start sending over some information in the next 30 days.",
      "Within 120 days, the White House said museums should start making \"content corrections where necessary, replacing divisive or ideologically driven language with unifying, historically accurate, and constructive descriptions.\"",
      "The Smithsonian said in a statement to CBS News: \"The Smithsonian's work is grounded in a deep commitment to scholarly excellence, rigorous research, and the accurate, factual presentation of history. We are reviewing the letter with this commitment in mind and will continue to collaborate constructively with the White House, Congress, and our governing Board of Regents.\"",
      "The letter called the review a \"collaborative\" effort that \"empowers museum staff.\"",
      "\"Our goal is not to interfere with the day-to-day operations of curators or staff, but rather to support a broader vision of excellence that highlights historically accurate, uplifting, and inclusive portrayals of America's heritage,\" the White House wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump has sought to reshape the Smithsonian and other U.S. cultural institutions during his second term to combat what he sees as ideological bias \u2014 assuming a more active role than prior presidents.",
      "His March executive order directed Vice President JD Vance \u2014 who serves on the Smithsonian's Board of Regents \u2014 to work to review Smithsonian museums, including by \"seeking to remove improper ideology.\" It claimed some of the institution's museums have \"promoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.\"",
      "The order drew condemnation from Democrats. The four Democratic members of the House Administration Committee penned an open letter calling the moves \"cowardly and unpatriotic\" and saying Mr. Trump's order would undermine the Smithsonian's independence.",
      "\"Unfortunately, we now stand at the brink of seeing the Smithsonian at its worst: shaped solely by the views and ideology of one individual as a means of expanding his political power,\" the letter said.",
      "Late last month, the Washington Post reported that the National Museum of American History had removed references to Mr. Trump's two impeachments. The Smithsonian later said it would update the exhibit to reflect all impeachment proceedings in U.S. history, calling the placard that was removed \"temporary\" and saying it \"did not meet the museum's standards.\" The Smithsonian said it wasn't asked by the Trump administration to remove anything.",
      "Mr. Trump also said he would fire the director of the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery in May, calling her a \"highly partisan person, and a strong supporter of DEI.\" The Smithsonian later put out a statement noting its independence and asserting that only Bunch \u2014 who has served as secretary of the Smithsonian since 2019 \u2014 can make personnel decisions. The director later resigned, the New York Times and Washington Post reported.",

    "summary": "E.J. Antoni, an economist nominated by President Trump to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said the jobs report is flawed.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u00a0is suggesting that the agency suspend its monthly jobs report, an economic staple that is relied upon by the Federal Reserve and U.S. businesses to gauge the health of the economy.",
      "In an interview on Fox News Digital on Monday ahead of his nomination, E.J. Antoni criticized the monthly employment report as flawed and suggested it be replaced with \"more accurate, though less timely, quarterly data.\"",
      "Antoni, who is a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, was tapped by Mr. Trump on Monday to run the BLS after the president\u00a0fired the former commissioner\u00a0earlier this month, blaming her for a disappointing July jobs report. Mr. Trump took issue with large revisions made to the previous month's jobs data, although jobs number revisions are commonly issued by the agency as more accurate data is collected over time.",
      "\"How on earth are businesses supposed to plan \u2014 or how is the Fed supposed to conduct monetary policy \u2014 when they don't know how many jobs are being added or lost in our economy? It's a serious problem that needs to be fixed immediately,\" Antoni told Fox News Digital.",
      "He added, \"Until it is corrected, the BLS should suspend issuing the monthly job reports but keep publishing the more accurate, though less timely, quarterly data.\"",
      "While some survey recipients immediately respond to the BLS' surveys, others report data later, which leads to the monthly revisions. Despite this, the BLS issues its monthly jobs report in order to report employment information in a timely manner, even though it is subject to revisions \u2014 both up and down \u2014 in later reports.",
      "Asked whether the BLS would continue to release monthly jobs reports, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \"I believe that is the plan and that's the hope, and that these monthly reports will be data that the American people can trust.\"",
      "Leavitt said \"we need to restore new leadership that we trust\" at the BLS, adding that \"we need to look at the means and the methods of how the United States is acquiring this very important data.\"",
      "\"The goal, of course, is to provide honest and good data for the American people to make very important economic decisions on,\" she said.",
      "Responding to the BLS' employment surveys is voluntary for businesses, while the federal government's Office of Management and Budget directs the BLS to release \"robust\" data on basic economic indicators in a \"timely\" manner. But that's become more challenging as fewer people and institutions respond to surveys, experts say.",
      "\"Response rates have declined for nearly every top-tier government statistical survey over the last decade, a trend that accelerated during the pandemic,\" Goldman Sachs economists wrote in an Aug. 11 research note.",

    "summary": "Three officials involved in President Trump's controversial L.A. National Guard deployment testified in court Monday.",
    "story": [
      "Three officials involved in President Trump's controversial deployment of National Guard troops to respond to protests in Los Angeles testified Monday as the trial in California Gov. Gavin Newsom's lawsuit against the Trump administration began.",
      "The question at issue is whether the military forces sent in by Mr. Trump \u2014 including members of the Marine Corps and National Guard \u2014 violated the 19th century Posse Comitatus Act, which bars the military from enforcing domestic laws.",
      "Newsom called the deployment of around 4,000 California National Guard troops, who normally are under the governor's command, an illegal \"power grab.\" But Mr. Trump argued the move was legal and necessary to protect immigration agents and federal property during tense protests against operations by ICE, or Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "Mr. Trump's early June executive order calling up the Guard said the protests \"constitute a form of rebellion.\" And the administration has justified the deployment using a law called Title 10 that allows the president to call up Guard forces during a \"rebellion\" or \"invasion,\" or if he is unable \"with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\"",
      "In one notable moment during Monday's testimony, Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman \u2014 who at one point was deployed as the commanding general of the Guard task force in Los Angeles \u2014 said he never heard the term \"rebellion\" used to describe the situation in the nation's second-largest city.",
      "San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer is overseeing the three-day trial. Breyer had previously ruled in June that Mr. Trump's deployment was likely illegal. An appellate court overturned that ruling, saying the president should be given deference to decide whether Title 10 applies, and that Mr. Trump had some basis to say that violence during the protests had prevented federal officers from enforcing the law. The appellate judges didn't weigh in on whether the protests constituted a rebellion, which they said wasn't necessary for the deployment to be legal.",
      "The dispute gained new resonance on Monday, after Mr. Trump announced National Guard forces would be deployed in Washington, D.C., to assist with police. Unlike in California, the D.C. National Guard reports to the president.",
      "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said Guard forces will not be involved in law enforcement in the nation's capital, but they can briefly detain people if necessary and hand them over to police.",
      "Officials testify about military's role amid L.A. protests",
      "Military officials said their mission was to protect federal facilities and federal personnel, and \"to support federal law enforcement.\"",
      "Sherman testified that the military could be sent whenever local law enforcement carried out an operation, even if there were no physical threats and no protesters were breaking the law.",
      "The comments surprised Breyer, who pressed him on the claim, asking: \"So if there's no threat you can send out the military?\" Sherman affirmed that whenever local law enforcement was carrying out an operation, the military could be sent out, explaining that a threat could develop even if no active threat was assessed.",
      "\"Wouldn't that always be the case?\" Breyer responded.",
      "But Sherman said he had withheld support for one operation. He testified that a DHS official questioned his \"loyalty\" to his country for objecting to the request for military assistance with an immigration enforcement operation at MacArthur Park. He said he had assessed that there was a low risk to federal agents on that occasion.",
      "The operation, which took place on July 7, featured horse-mounted officers and military Humvees and drew national attention.",
      "William Harrington, deputy chief of staff for the Los Angeles military deployment's task force, testified that he understood the federalized National Guard troops could not engage in civil enforcement activities, and everybody knew the Posse Comitatus Act applied. He said task force members responded to requests for assistance from federal law enforcement agencies. These included protecting federal buildings and force protection for federal agents who were executing functions such as search warrant operations.",
      "Ernesto Santacruz Jr., a field office director for the Department of Homeland Security, testified Monday that assaults on agents from ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations division reduced drastically once the National Guard was there. He said that there had been daily attacks on officers before the deployment.",
      "Santacruz testified that the National Guard troops were there \"to assist and protect federal authorities.\" He did not know of any denials of requests for assistance.",
      "When asked about the law this trial centers on, the Posse Comitatus Act, Santacruz did not have any knowledge of what it allowed or prohibited.",
      "At its peak in June, nearly 5,000 service members were deployed to the Los Angeles area: some 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines. The vast majority of Guard forces have been returned to California, though about 300 remain under federal control.",
      "As of Sunday night, the remaining Guard forces were still guarding a courthouse in Downtown Los Angeles and a facility in Paramount, California, Sherman testified.",
      "The trial will continue on Tuesday, when the federal government will call Sherman back to the stand. On Wednesday, the court is set to hear several legal issues raised by the government, including that California lacks standing to sue."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced E.J. Antoni as his nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Monday, after he fired the former commissioner earlier this month, blaming her for a weaker-than-expected jobs report.",
      "Antoni is a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, and he holds a doctorate in economics from Northern Illinois University. He's defended Mr. Trump's economic policy moves in the past, including the president's tariff strategy. He has also\u00a0criticized the BLS\u00a0for low response rates and questioned the agency's methodology, calling its health insurance figures \"phoney baloney\" last year and at one point joking that \"the 'L' is silent\" in BLS' name.",
      "\"DOGE needs to take a chainsaw to the BLS...,\" he wrote in a November\u00a0post on X.",
      "\"There are better ways to collect, process, and disseminate data\u2014that is the task for the next BLS commissioner, and only consistent delivery of accurate data in a timely manner will rebuild the trust that has been lost over the last several years,\" he wrote shortly after Mr. Trump fired the former BLS chief.",
      "Mr. Trump nominated Antoni in a Truth Social post, saying he \"will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE.\"",
      "Antoni will need to be confirmed by the Senate. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is currently led by acting Commissioner William Watrowski, who has worked at the agency for decades.",
      "Mr. Trump ordered his administration to terminate Erika McEntarfer, who had been commissioner of labor statistics, on Aug. 1, hours after the release of the July jobs report data. That report showed a sharp slowdown in hiring, along with a steep downward revision to May and June's hiring numbers.",
      "Hours before her firing, Antoni criticized BLS for \"data problems\" and a trend of \"highly problematic\" revisions, though he also touted some figures in the July jobs report, including a jump in employment by native-born Americans and a slowdown in government jobs.",
      "In the wake of McEntarfer's firing, influential ex-Trump strategist Steve Bannon backed Antoni to take over the BLS. Antoni appeared on Bannon's show \"War Room\" on the day the jobs report came out, calling McEntarfer \"incompetent.\" Days later, Bannon said \"we're pushing\" for Antoni to lead the BLS, and called him \"the guy that almost single-handedly took it down by going through their numbers.\"",
      "Announcing McEntarfer's firing in a post on Truth Social, the president claimed \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that she had \"faked the Jobs Numbers before the Election to try and boost Kamala's chances of Victory\" and pledged to replace her \"with someone much more competent and qualified.\"",
      "But Harvard economics professor Jason Furman, a head of the Council of Economic Advisers under former President Barack Obama, was sharply critical of the selection of Antoni,\u00a0saying on X that, \"I don't think I have ever publicly criticized any Presidential nominee before. But E.J. Antoni is completely unqualified to be BLS Commissioner. He is an extreme partisan and does not have any relevant expertise. He would be a break from decades of nonpartisan technocrats.\"",
      "Jessica Riedl, an economist at the conservative Manhattan Institute,\u00a0said on X that she's \"never met EJ Antoni because he is not seen in many DC policy circles. However, the articles and tweets I've seen him publish are probably the most error-filled of any think tank economist right now. I hope we see better at BLS.\"",
      "The jobs report for October 2024, which was released on Nov. 1, 2024, four days before Election Day, showed just 12,000 jobs were created \u2014 far short of the 100,000 forecast for the month \u2014 following two hurricanes and a major labor dispute. The following month, that figure was revised upward, to 36,000. September's jobs report, however, dramatically exceeded forecasts \u2014 254,000 jobs were created, rather than the 140,000 economic analysts had expected. That figure was later revised down to 223,000.",
      "Mr. Trump continued railing against the ousted commissioner and the BLS more broadly in the days after he fired her, claiming in a post on Truth Social last week that the July jobs report had been \"RIGGED,\" though he provided no evidence to support it. The president said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" Tuesday that it's a \"highly political situation.\" And National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended the president's decision in an appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" citing a series of revisions and patterns that \"could make people wonder.\"",
      "\"What we need is a fresh set of eyes over at the BLS,\" Hassett said, adding that \"the president wants his own people there so that when we see the numbers they're more transparent and more reliable.\"",
      "McEntarfer had been commissioner for a little over a year and a half, after she was confirmed in a broad bipartisan vote of 86 to 8 by the Senate in January 2024.",
      "The latest jobs report showed employers in July adding a weaker-than-expected 73,000 jobs, with a downward revision of 258,000 fewer jobs created in May and June. Mr. Trump, who often touts the job numbers, called the jobs figures a \"shock\" and the revision a \"major mistake.\" The BLS said in its report that monthly revisions \"result from additional reports received from businesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors.\"",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer acknowledged in an interview for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" earlier this month that \"there are always revisions,\" but he added that \"sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme ways.\"",
      "\"The president is the president. He can choose who works in the executive branch,\" Greer said.",
      "Meanwhile, some economists and lawmakers have expressed concern over the firing, and a group of former BLS leaders warned that the move \"undermines the valuable work and dedication of BLS staff\" and \"escalates the President's unprecedented attacks on the independence and integrity of the federal statistical system.\" The group called on Congress to investigate the firing.",

    "story": [
      "After failing to reach a quorum in the Texas House on Monday, Gov. Greg Abbott confirmed what Republican lawmakers have been saying \u2014 that beyond efforts to add five GOP congressional seats in the Lone Star State, there have been discussions about seeking to add as many as three more.",
      "In an exclusive interview with CBS News Texas Monday, Governor Abbott said, \"What we are doing is looking at all options. We're looking at a lot of different alternatives in part to make sure we do have fairness. If you compare Texas to California or Illinois or New York or Massachusetts, those states are truly gerrymandered and have hardly any Republicans.\"",
      "When asked if Texas has also gerrymandered districts, the Governor said, \"Well, no, there's a higher percentage of Democrats in Texas than in the Congressional delegation than there are Republicans in California, Illinois, New York, and Massachusetts. So if Texas were to draw its maps the way the Democratic states have drawn their maps it could means as maybe a ten seat pick-up.\"",
      "Of California's 52 Congressional seats, Republicans serve in just nine. In Illinois, only 3 of the state's 17 Congressional districts are served by Republicans. In Texas, Democrats hold 13 of the state's 38 Congressional seats.",
      "Abbott calls out Democrats",
      "The Governor called out Texas Democrats who continue to break quorum and prevent the House from voting on the new Congressional maps favoring Republicans.\u00a0 Last week, Abbott filed a lawsuit with the Texas Supreme Court to remove House Democratic Caucus Chairman Gene Wu, who led Democrats on their out-of-state quorum break.",
      "Democrats have said they're doing what their constituents want them to do and point to the Supreme Court's opinion four years ago that said the Texas Constitution enables them to break quorum. When asked why that isn't an adequate defense for the Democrats, Abbott said, \"An interstate highway enables you to go to 100 miles per hour but doesn't authorize it. It's against the law. Same thing here. Even though the Constitution enables Democrats to break quorum, the Constitution does not authorize them to do this. In fact the Constitution does the exact opposite. It requires them to show up and cast votes on bills.\"",
      "When asked if the Constitution needs to be changed because it doesn't explicitly ban breaking quorum, or if he thought winning the lawsuit would resolve this, Abbott said \"If the Supreme Court rules in favor of the lawsuit that I filed, it will end quorum breaking. They did not think of at the time they wrote the Constitution that people would not show up and do their job.\"",
      "Removing Democrats from their seats",
      "On Monday, the Supreme Court released an expedited schedule for both the Governor and Representative Wu to file their legal briefs. Deadlines extend to September 4.",
      "Democratic lawmakers who have been at the Capitol and who have broken quorum and are out of state criticized the Governor and Republicans. Democratic Representative Eddie Morales or Eagle Pass told CBS News Texas Monday, \"I would say that the last 30 years of a Republican controlled statewide office from top down has put us in the situation that we're in, that they're failing 100% and making sure that all Texans are being represented well, that they're playing this political theater and these political games.\"",
      "Representative Ramon Romero, Jr., D-Fort Worth, who also serves as Chairman of the Mexican American Legislative Caucus told CBS News Texas Monday that he believes Republicans will lose the House in next year's midterm elections. \"They are preparing for huge losses in 2026, and that's why they have to do this at the expense of Latino voices that have been in Congress for a long time and have had overwhelming support from their communities. That's what's really happening.\"",
      "Democrats have vowed to stay away for the rest of the special session which ends August 19th. When asked if he will start the second special session on that same day, the Governor said he will.",

    "summary": "President Trump has extended a temporary truce in the U.S.-China trade war, preventing tariffs on China from leaping to at least 80%.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday signed an executive order delaying a set of sky-high tariffs on Chinese goods for at least 90 days, extending a ceasefire in the U.S.-China trade war, the White House announced.",
      "The president's order will keep tariffs at 30% \u2014 the level that was set in mid-May, when both countries agreed to temporarily back off a set of tit-for-tat tariffs that exceeded 100%. That agreement was set to expire Tuesday, and without an extension, levies on some Chinese goods could have leaped to at least 80%, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has said.",
      "The order says the U.S.'s \"reciprocal\" tariff on Chinese goods will remain at 10% until at least Nov. 10. An additional 20% tariff on China that was imposed earlier this year due to fentanyl trafficking is\u00a0also still in place, bringing the total rate to 30%.",
      "China's Commerce Ministry said in a statement it will maintain a 10% tariff on U.S. goods.",
      "\"The United States and China have engaged in multiple rounds of productive negotiations to address trade reciprocity and national security concerns,\" the White House said in a fact sheet announcing the extension.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said last week that China and the U.S. were \"likely\" to agree to a 90-day extension as the two countries seek to negotiate a longer-term trade deal. Mr. Trump told reporters earlier Monday those negotiations were going \"quite nicely.\" Representatives from both sides met in Stockholm late last month.",
      "Greer told CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" earlier this month that \"I don't think anyone wants to see\" high tariffs on China snap back.",
      "\"We're working on some technical issues, and we're talking to the president about it,\" Greer said. \"I think it's going in a positive direction.\"",
      "A return to high tariffs could have caused U.S. imports of Chinese goods to plummet, disrupting trade between the world's two largest economies. In mid-April, when tariffs on Chinese imports still stood at 145%, the Trump administration planned for possible supply chain disruptions.",
      "China was the U.S.'s third-largest trading partner last year, not counting the European Union. The U.S. imported $438.9 billion in Chinese goods and China imported $143.5 billion in American goods, according to U.S. government data.",
      "Mr. Trump first hit China with 34% tariffs in early April, one of dozens of countries to face hefty \"reciprocal\" levies. The president argues tariffs could boost U.S. manufacturers and correct what he views as unfair trade practices, but many economists warn Mr. Trump's trade strategy could lead to higher consumer prices and more sluggish economic growth.",
      "The president quickly paused his April tariffs for most countries, and reinstated them, often at substantially lower levels, last week. But the China levies remained in place for more than a month and drew retaliation from Beijing, ultimately pushing U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to 145% and Chinese tariffs on American goods to 125%.",
      "The two countries agreed to ease the tariffs for at least 90 days in May, buying more time for Mr. Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping's teams to negotiate a trade deal. Since then, the U.S. has charged 30% tariffs and China has charged 10%.",
      "The talks have occasionally proven contentious. Earlier this year, the two countries feuded over Beijing's restrictions on rare earth mineral exports, Washington's restrictions on advanced semiconductors and the Trump administration's crackdown on international students from China. Mr. Trump accused China of violating the terms of the May truce \u2014 though both countries reached a deal to ease some of those tensions in June. And on Sunday, Mr. Trump pushed China to quadruple its imports of U.S. soybeans.",

    "story": [
      "Republican lawmakers in Texas have opened a new front in their efforts to crack down on abortion, this time with a bill that would enable lawsuits targeting the use of medication to terminate pregnancies. Their proposal would also take aim at shield laws in other states that protect manufacturers and the doctors who prescribe abortion pills.",
      "In Texas, it is already illegal to knowingly mail, carry or deliver abortion-inducing drugs. It is also illegal for a doctor not licensed in the state of Texas to prescribe abortion medication.",
      "Now, in the midst of an already controversial special legislative session, lawmakers have reintroduced a bill that would allow lawsuits to target anyone who manufactures, mails, delivers, prescribes or distributes abortion pills. The bill would also permit people to file a wrongful death lawsuit if the medication results in harm or death of a fetus or the mother, within a statute of limitations up to six years.",
      "\"These are the pills that are being mailed into Texas directly to women, often without instructions, certainly without doctors as before, and without follow-up care after,\" the bill's sponsor, Texas state Sen. Bryan Hughes, a Republican, told the Texas Tribune earlier this year. \"This is illegal in Texas, but is taking place, and we've thus far not been able to protect women.\"",
      "The World Health Organization says the pills \u2014 a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol \u2014 can be safely prescribed for women to self-administer at home, without the direct supervision of a health care provider, in the first trimester.",
      "Hughes previously sponsored a state law, passed in 2021, banning abortions at six weeks, or when a \"fetal heartbeat\" is detected.",
      "The new proposal, known as the Women and Child Protection Act, is expected to be heard in committee in the Texas State Senate during Monday's special session. An earlier version stalled in the House during the most recent legislative session.",
      "The bill also seeks to route any challenges into federal court, and includes language aimed at neutralizing the force of so-called shield laws in other states, designed to protect doctors who prescribe abortion medication from states without bans.",
      "\"Texas continues to try to meddle in the provision of safe, legal and affordable reproductive health care nationwide,\" says Julie Kay, the former executive director for the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine. \"Telemedicine abortion is a modern and effective way to provide care.\"",
      "At the same time, former Texas Solicitor General Jonathan Mitchell, who led the push for the state's current abortion restrictions, has announced a lawsuit filed on behalf of a Texas woman who alleges the father of the child she was expecting slipped abortion medication into her hot chocolate, leading her to lose her pregnancy.",
      "Similar to the proposed legislation, this lawsuit targets shield laws in other states meant to protect physicians who provided the abortion pills in the plaintiff's case. The lawsuit is filed in federal court and names a nonprofit group that the plaintiff claims helped the father obtain medication, Aid Access, which is based in the Netherlands.",
      "According to the civil lawsuit, the father \"obtained these drugs from Aid Access, a criminal organization that illegally ships abortion pills into Texas and other jurisdictions where abortion has been outlawed.\"",
      "Aid Access and the father have not been criminally charged.",
      "On its website, Aid Access says it has facilitated over 200,000 online abortions to women in the U.S. since 2018. In some cases, the group relies on telemedicine shield laws, such as ones enacted in California, Colorado, Massachusetts, New York, Vermont and Washington, to fulfill orders and mail them to recipients in states with bans.",
      "Aid Access founder Dr. Rebecca Gomperts previously told CBS News the service is legal in all the jurisdictions in which it operates.",
      "\"Where I work from, it's legal to prescribe the medications. And so I'll do that. And the pharmacy that I refer to is allowed to mail the medicines, on a prescription of a doctor, to the women. So (the Texas law) has no impact on what we do,\" Gomperts said.",
      "Aid Access and the father have not responded to the filing as of Monday morning.",

She won the case, and the court ordered Mr. Trump and his company to pay $354 million in fines \u2014 a total that has risen when interest is factored in. The court also barred them from seeking loans from financial institutions in New York for three years and banned Mr. Trump from serving as an officer or director of any New York corporation.",

    "summary": "Federal funding cuts to mRNA technology research doesn't just impact COVID vaccines \u2014 experts say it could stall progress in treatment for cancers, rare disease and more.",
    "story": [
      "If you think last week's decision by the federal government to halt $500 million in funding\u00a0for vaccine development projects that use mRNA technology will only affect COVID vaccines, think again.",
      "These types of vaccines\u00a0use\u00a0messenger RNA, or mRNA, to prompt the body to make proteins that induce an antibody response to protect against a pathogen. The science behind it is also being studied for a wide range of other uses, from fighting cancer to treating autoimmune conditions and more.",
      "Health experts have criticized the move to defund this research, pointing to the impact it will have on America's ability to develop breakthroughs against deadly or debilitating diseases.",
      "Jeff Coller, professor of RNA biology and therapeutics at Johns Hopkins University, called the cuts a \"completely reckless decision from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\" that was \"clearly being made for political motivations and not those that are rested in our science.\"",
      "Former Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams, who served in the first Trump administration, said the technology \"helps us develop vaccines and new treatments,\" and warned that cuts could halt progress in one of the \"most promising areas of modern medicine.\"",
      "\"People are going to die because we're cutting short funding for this technology,\" Adams said in a recent appearance on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "mRNA studied for pancreatic cancer, rare diseases and more",
      "Collier said one of the most exciting avenues for mRNA technology is in the treatment of deadly cancers, including pancreatic cancer, which is fatal for many patients within six months to a year.",
      "In recent years, researchers have been testing the effectiveness of using an mRNA vaccine to target the cancer. A small NIH-funded clinical trial by Sloan Kettering in 2023 used infusions of an mRNA vaccine to help boost T cells in the immune system of pancreatic cancer patients. The results, published in the journal\u00a0Nature, showed improvements among about 50% of participants.",
      "\"It was, in essence, the start of a cure for pancreatic cancer, where half of the patients in that study were surviving,\" Coller said.",
      "The early results encouraged scientists, but the small sample size called for further studies, which led to a\u00a0Phase 2 trial published in Nature earlier this year.",
      "Experimental mRNA-focused treatments have also showed promise in fighting lung,\u00a0colorectal and gastric cancers. For example, a study published online in the journal Gastric Cancer\u00a0found a mRNA-based vaccine led to robust gastric tumor regression in mice.",
      "And earlier this year, the world was was awed by news that an infant named KJ Muldoon became the first patient to undergo personalized gene-editing treatment using a technique known as CRISPR to fix a rare and potentially fatal genetic disorder.",
      "As Coller pointed out, the CRISPR technology had to be delivered via mRNA.",
      "\"This opens a floodgate for rare diseases,\" he said. \"We're now talking about, could we use the same technology to go after all rare diseases?\"",
      "Autoimmune diseases are another area of research, for treating things like multiple sclerosis, Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease.",
      "While all of these are still at the early research stage, Coller urged the importance of investing in this technology now for future progress.",
      "\"We need to do experiments and see where we can get with the next generation of mRNA-based drugs,\" he said.",
      "Like with COVID-19, there has also been continued research on mRNA-based vaccines for infectious diseases like the flu, RSV, Zika virus and cytomegalovirus, known as CMV, an infection that can be harmful to babies exposed during the mother's pregnancy.",
      "\"We're at a point where, if we continue to develop this technology, we'll get more personalized, bespoke medicine that we can use on patients and improve health care outcomes,\" Coller said.",
      "How is mRNA medicine so versatile?",
      "RNA stands for ribonucleic acid, an essential molecule in the body's cells. It is similar to DNA but has different functions. Messenger RNA, or mRNA, carries the information required for making proteins.",
      "As Coller put it: \"If your DNA is a cookbook, your mRNA is an individual recipe that's telling your body what to do.\"",
      "To harness that power for treating disease, \"All we're doing with this technology is giving it new recipes. We're taking advantage of this powerful natural system that exists in your body,\" he said.",
      "The versatility and potential to help such a range of illnesses is what has experts like Coller \u2014 who was not immediately impacted by the funding cuts \u2014 hoping the administration will reinstate funding for mRNA research.",
      "\"We have to keep moving forward,\" he said. \"People wanting to improve their family's lives and their children's lives is a bipartisan issue, it's truly an American issue. So we've got to keep moving.\"",

      "\"In 2025, the waning gibbous moon will severely compromise this shower at the time of maximum activity,\" the organization says. \"Such conditions will reduce activity by at least 75 percent as only the brighter meteors will be visible.\"",
      "Viewers this year can expect to see between 10-20 Perseids each hour, as opposed to 50 Perseids per hour under darker conditions, it says.",
      "\"The strength of each Perseid display varies year to year, mainly due to lunar conditions,\"\u00a0writes Robert Lunsford with the American Meteor Society. \"If a bright moon is above the horizon during the night of maximum activity, then the display will be reduced.

      "At least two satellites were believed to be on board: one fully classified spacecraft and an experimental satellite that will carry out tests of upgraded atomic clocks and navigation technology that could lead to more accurate, jam-proof Global Positioning System-type data for military and commercial users.",
      "Both satellites were bound for geosynchronous orbit 22,300 miles above the equator, where spacecraft take 24 hours to complete one orbit, thus appearing stationary in the sky.",
      "GPS satellites operate in 12,500-mile-high orbits, but Navigation Technology Satellite 3, or NTS-3, will operate from its much higher perch using an advanced phased array antenna that can electronically direct signals to receivers in multiple locations across broad regions.",
      "It is the Pentagon's first experimental navigation satellite since GPS precursors were launched in the 1970s. Along with the NTS-3 satellite, designed and built by L3Harris Technologies, the program includes a ground-based control system and receivers linked by software that enable rapid reprogramming as needed for upgrades or to utilize different signals.",
      "\"GPS is such an integral part of our lives today,\" said Joanna Hinks, a senior aerospace engineer with the Air Force Research Laboratory at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. \"You probably all use it in ways that you didn't even realize throughout your morning.",
      "\"And with NTS-3, we are going to be experimenting with a number of different technologies that look at how we can continue to evolve and augment GPS to make sure that it remains the gold standard that our warfighters need.\"",
      "While the major goal of the flight is launching the USSF-106 payloads, the launch marked a major milestone for United Launch Alliance.",
      "It was the third launch of the powerful new Vulcan after two test flights last year and the first to be \"certified\" by the Space Force to carry costly national security spy satellites and other expensive military spacecraft.",
      "\"This mission is headed directly to geosynchronous orbit and will be one of our longest missions to date,\" said Gary Wentz, ULA vice president of government and commercial programs. \"This is the sole purpose of this vehicle. It was purposely designed to support these missions doing direct inject to geo for the Space Force.\"",
      "The Vulcan is replacing ULA's already-retired Delta family of rockets and the venerable Atlas 5, which is powered by a Russian-built RD-180 first stage engine. Criticism of ULA's use of Russian engines for launches of American military satellites and NASA spacecraft helped fuel congressional pressure for a new all-American launcher.",
      "Thirteen Atlas 5's are left in ULA's inventory, all of them slated for civilian launches as ULA, a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, transitions to an all-Vulcan fleet.",
      "In the meantime, SpaceX dominates the world launch market with its partially reusable and highly successful kerosene-fueled Falcon 9 and triple-core Falcon Heavy rockets. So far this year, SpaceX has launched 97 Falcon 9s.",
      "But ULA President and CEO Tory Bruno said the Vulcan's first stage, using high-performance BE-4 engines provided by Blue Origin \u2014 owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos \u2014 and its high-power Centaur upper stage make the rocket particularly well suited for launching heavy military payloads into hard-to-reach orbits.",
      "\"It is specifically designed for these exotic orbits that are primarily for the government,\" he said. \"And this particular mission is the quintessential example. It is a direct injection to geosynchronous orbit. That means that it is a very, very long-duration mission.\"",
      "He said the first stage is, in effect, delivering the Centaur to space with a full load of propellant \"to go from LEO (low-Earth orbit) to somewhere else, like all the way to the geo belt, which is 20 times higher up. And what that translates to in capability (is) certainly more mass and more accuracy than is easily done by others.\"",
      "While he didn't mention SpaceX or its Falcon Heavy by name, or ULA's retired Delta 4 Heavy, Bruno said \"if you're a typical three-core heavy launch vehicle and ... really derived from a vehicle optimized for that LEO mission, you're going to have to have three cores to get out there, and you're going to have to expend all of them.",
      "\"And here's the really complicated rocket science. You know, one core is cheaper and more efficient than three expendable cores. It's literally that simple.\"",
      "That, coupled with the high-energy Centaur upper stage, gives ULA the capability to launch heavy payloads directly to high orbits without requiring satellites to use their own thrusters \u2014 and limited propellant \u2014 in transit.",
      "ULA is expanding its ground infrastructure and expects to launch nine flights in 2025, reaching a cadence of two per month by the end of the year. The company expects to launch between 20 and 25 flights in 2026.",

    "story": [
      "Jim Lovell, the astronaut who commanded the famous Apollo 13 mission, has died, NASA announced Friday. He was 97.",
      "Apollo 13, a 1970 flight to the moon, became known as a \"successful failure\" after the spacecraft experienced an oxygen tank explosion thousands of miles from Earth but managed to safely return home.",
      "Acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy said in a statement that Lovell died Thursday in Lake Forest, Illinois. Duffy praised Lovell's life and work, saying he inspired millions of people.",
      "\"Jim's character and steadfast courage helped our nation reach the Moon and turned a potential tragedy into a success from which we learned an enormous amount,\" Duffy said.",
      "Lovell was the command module pilot for 1968's Apollo 8 mission, the first to carry humans to the moon and back, though it did not land on the lunar surface.",
      "Andrew Chaikin, author of the 2007 book \"A Man on the Moon\" on the Apollo program, told CBS News that Lovell had some of the most memorable comments during the Apollo 8 TV transmissions. He recalled that Lovell called Earth a \"grand oasis in the vastness of space.\"",
      "\"Lovell had imagination, there was a part of Lovell that was about imagination, and that was a neat part of him,\" Chaikin said.",
      "Apollo 8 circled the moon 10 times and sent back the famous \"Earthrise\" photo of our world from space. Lovell reflected on that journey 50 years later in an interview with CBS News.",
      "\"Sometimes I look back and say, you know, 'How did we ever do that?\" he said.",
      "In 1970, Lovell had a chance to go back to the moon with Apollo 13, with crewmates Fred Haise and Jack Swigert, but the mission abruptly changed with the explosion.",
      "\"Houston, we've had a problem here,\" Swigert reported to mission control.\u00a0Moments later, Lovell repeated, \"Houston, we've had a problem.\"",
      "The mishap forced Lovell, his crewmates and NASA's team on the ground to turn all their efforts toward returning to Earth safely.",
      "\"His calm strength under pressure helped return the crew safely to Earth and demonstrated the quick thinking and innovation that informed future NASA missions,\" Duffy said of Lovell.",
      "Lovell graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1952 and went on to become a naval aviator, including a four-year tour at the Naval Air Test Center in Maryland. Chaikin said Lovell demonstrated his skills as a test pilot during Apollo 13.",
      "\"He always said that the true measure of a test pilot is not whether you can do the mission you're assigned, but when things don't go right, how you respond,\" Chaikin said.",
      "Chaikin described Lovell as being calm and unflappable throughout the crisis, but he recalled one moment when Lovell started to seem irritable.",
      "\"He's been without sleep, and he's worried about his crew and says, like, 'You're going to have to figure out this checklist because we've got to get some sleep,'\" Chaikin said. \"That's like the only time in the whole mission when he even starts to show anything but calm, unflappable Lovell.\"",
      "Actor Tom Hanks played Lovell in the 1995 movie \"Apollo 13,\" which was nominated for best picture at the Oscars.",
      "In an Instagram post Friday evening, Hanks wrote that Lovell's \"many voyages around Earth and on to so-very-close to the moon were not made for riches or celebrity, but because such challenges as those are what fuels the course of being alive \u2014 and who better than Jim Lovell to make those voyages. On this night of a full Moon, he passes on \u2014 to the heavens, to the cosmos, to the stars. God speed you, on this next voyage, Jim Lovell.\"",
      "Before the movie was released, Chaikin said Lovell told him that the true story of Apollo 13 had never been told.",
      "\"That's how he felt,\" Chaikin said. \"Of course, everything changed when Ron Howard made that movie, to the point that Jim became probably the best known Apollo astronaut next to Neil Armstrong. But before that movie happened, he really felt that way.\"",
      "NASA shared a statement from Lovell's family: \"We are enormously proud of his amazing life and career accomplishments, highlighted by his legendary leadership in pioneering human space flight. But, to all of us, he was Dad, Granddad, and the Leader of our family. Most importantly, he was our Hero. We will miss his unshakeable optimism, his sense of humor, and the way he made each of us feel we could do the impossible. He was truly one of a kind.\"",

      "Astronomers originally estimated the size of its icy core at several miles across, but Hubble's observations have narrowed it down to no more than 3.5 miles. It could even be as small as 1,000 feet, scientists say, according to a\u00a0new paper\u00a0published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.",
      "The comet is hurtling our way at 130,000 mph, but will veer closer to Mars than Earth, keeping a safe distance from both. It was 277 million miles away when photographed by Hubble a couple weeks ago. The orbiting telescope revealed a teardrop-shaped plume of dust around the nucleus as well as traces of a dusty tail.",
      "NASA previously said the comet will make its closest approach to the sun in late October, scooting between the orbits of Mars and Earth. The agency said 3I/ATLAS should remain visible to telescopes through September, but then it will pass too close to the sun to observe. It is expected to reappear on the other side of the sun by early December, allowing for renewed observations.",
      "According to Las Cumbres Observatory in Chile, the object is named \"3I\" because it is the third such interstellar object to be found, following\u00a01I/'Oumuamu\u00a0in 2017 and\u00a02I/Borisov\u00a0in 2019.",
      "\"All three appear to be quite dark and red, reflecting only about 5% of the sunlight that hits them, which is similar in reflectivity to asphalt,\" the observatory said last month. \"Unlike 1I/'Oumuamu, 3I does not change much in brightness as it rotates, indicating that it is more likely to be spherical.\"",

    "summary": "ULA's Vulcan is replacing the company's workhorse Atlas 5 rocket and the already-retired Delta 4 family of launchers.",
    "story": [
      "United Launch Alliance fired off its first operational Vulcan rocket Tuesday, boosting two military satellites into space in the first U.S. Space Force-sanctioned flight of a new launcher that eventually will replace the company's Atlas 5 and already-retired Deltas.",
      "Equipped with four solid-fuel strap-on boosters for additional takeoff power, the 198-foot-tall Vulcan's two methane-fueled BE-4 engines thundered to life at 8:56 p.m. EDT, instantly propelling the rocket away from pad 41 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.",
      "Arcing over the Atlantic Ocean on an easterly trajectory, the Vulcan put on a spectacular sky-lighting show as it roared aloft atop nearly 3 million pounds of thrust and a jet of brilliant exhaust visible for miles around.",
      "The four strap-on boosters were jettisoned about 90 seconds after liftoff, followed three-and-a-half minutes later by burnout and separation of the Vulcan's 109-foot-tall first stage.",
      "The Centaur second stage's two hydrogen-fueled Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10C engines ignited and took over from there, but in keeping with standard policy for military missions, ULA ended its launch commentary at that point and the rest of the flight was carried out in secrecy.",
      "At least two satellites were believed to be on board: one fully classified spacecraft and an experimental satellite that will carry out tests of upgraded atomic clocks and navigation technology that could lead to more accurate, jam-proof Global Positioning System-type data for military and commercial users.",
      "Both satellites were bound for geosynchronous orbit 22,300 miles above the equator, where spacecraft take 24 hours to complete one orbit, thus appearing stationary in the sky.",
      "GPS satellites operate in 12,500-mile-high orbits, but Navigation Technology Satellite 3, or NTS-3, will operate from its much higher perch using an advanced phased array antenna that can electronically direct signals to receivers in multiple locations across broad regions.",
      "It is the Pentagon's first experimental navigation satellite since GPS precursors were launched in the 1970s. Along with the NTS-3 satellite, designed and built by L3Harris Technologies, the program includes a ground-based control system and receivers linked by software that enable rapid reprogramming as needed for upgrades or to utilize different signals.",
      "\"GPS is such an integral part of our lives today,\" said Joanna Hinks, a senior aerospace engineer with the Air Force Research Laboratory at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. \"You probably all use it in ways that you didn't even realize throughout your morning.",
      "\"And with NTS-3, we are going to be experimenting with a number of different technologies that look at how we can continue to evolve and augment GPS to make sure that it remains the gold standard that our warfighters need.\"",
      "While the major goal of the flight is launching the USSF-106 payloads, the launch marked a major milestone for United Launch Alliance.",
      "It was the third launch of the powerful new Vulcan after two test flights last year and the first to be \"certified\" by the Space Force to carry costly national security spy satellites and other expensive military spacecraft.",
      "\"This mission is headed directly to geosynchronous orbit and will be one of our longest missions to date,\" said Gary Wentz, ULA vice president of government and commercial programs. \"This is the sole purpose of this vehicle. It was purposely designed to support these missions doing direct inject to geo for the Space Force.\"",
      "The Vulcan is replacing ULA's already-retired Delta family of rockets and the venerable Atlas 5, which is powered by a Russian-built RD-180 first stage engine. Criticism of ULA's use of Russian engines for launches of American military satellites and NASA spacecraft helped fuel congressional pressure for a new all-American launcher.",
      "Thirteen Atlas 5's are left in ULA's inventory, all of them slated for civilian launches as ULA, a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, transitions to an all-Vulcan fleet.",
      "In the meantime, SpaceX dominates the world launch market with its partially reusable and highly successful kerosene-fueled Falcon 9 and triple-core Falcon Heavy rockets. So far this year, SpaceX has launched 97 Falcon 9s.",
      "But ULA President and CEO Tory Bruno said the Vulcan's first stage, using high-performance BE-4 engines provided by Blue Origin \u2014 owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos \u2014 and its high-power Centaur upper stage make the rocket particularly well suited for launching heavy military payloads into hard-to-reach orbits.",
      "\"It is specifically designed for these exotic orbits that are primarily for the government,\" he said. \"And this particular mission is the quintessential example. It is a direct injection to geosynchronous orbit. That means that it is a very, very long-duration mission.\"",
      "He said the first stage is, in effect, delivering the Centaur to space with a full load of propellant \"to go from LEO (low-Earth orbit) to somewhere else, like all the way to the geo belt, which is 20 times higher up. And what that translates to in capability (is) certainly more mass and more accuracy than is easily done by others.\"",
      "While he didn't mention SpaceX or its Falcon Heavy by name, or ULA's retired Delta 4 Heavy, Bruno said \"if you're a typical three-core heavy launch vehicle and ... really derived from a vehicle optimized for that LEO mission, you're going to have to have three cores to get out there, and you're going to have to expend all of them.",
      "\"And here's the really complicated rocket science. You know, one core is cheaper and more efficient than three expendable cores. It's literally that simple.\"",
      "That, coupled with the high-energy Centaur upper stage, gives ULA the capability to launch heavy payloads directly to high orbits without requiring satellites to use their own thrusters \u2014 and limited propellant \u2014 in transit.",
      "ULA is expanding its ground infrastructure and expects to launch nine flights in 2025, reaching a cadence of two per month by the end of the year. The company expects to launch between 20 and 25 flights in 2026.",

A so-called going concern warning is an accounting term that signals a risk that a business might cease operations.",
      "Shares of Kodak plunged $1.73, or 26%, to $5.05 in Tuesday morning trading. Reached for comment, a Kodak spokesperson pointed to the statement in its regulatory filing.",
      "The warning is the latest development in the photography company's storied history, which includes introducing one of the first consumer cameras in the 1880s and mass manufacturing film rolls for hobbyists and professionals alike. But Kodak struggled to adapt when digital cameras overtook film starting in the 1990s, leading to a bankruptcy filing in 2012.",
      "Its current financial crunch is tied to almost $500 million in short-term debt obligations, as well as more than $200 million in pension liabilities. Last year, Kodak had said it would end its pension plan in order to reduce debt, according to the Wall Street Journal.",

      "A Kodak moment",
      "Rochester, New York-based Eastman Kodak, founded by inventor George Eastman in 1892, mass produced the famed Brownie and Instamatic cameras, popularizing photography as a pastime for generations of Americans. Its yellow-and-red film boxes were ubiquitous in photo shops and other retailers.",
      "Eastman said his goal was \"to make the camera as convenient as the pencil,\" according to the Kodak website.",
      "But Kodak faced competition from Japanese companies, including Fujifilm in the 1990s, as well as the shift to digital technology, leading to its filing for\u00a0bankruptcy protection in 2012.",
      "The company wound up selling off many of its businesses and patents, while shutting down the camera manufacturing unit that first made it famous. It received approval for its plan to emerge from court oversight a year later.",
      "At the time, Kodak was looking to recreate itself as a new, much smaller company focused on commercial and packaging printing.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. chipmakers Nvidia and AMD will pay the U.S. government 15% of revenue generated by sales of their AI chips in China, a White House official confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The Financial Times on Sunday\u00a0reported that the agreement between the tech giants and the U.S. government was reached as a condition for granting export licenses for China, which were provided last week. A U.S. official confirmed the \"broad strokes\" of the report to CBS News.",
      "The arrangement, with companies providing a stream of revenue in exchange for export licenses, is highly unusual as corporations typically do not pay the federal government a share of revenue from their export sales. Export licenses also do not carry any fees,\u00a0according to shipping giant Maersk.",
      "In a Monday press conference, President Trump described the agreement with Nvidia as a deal that would benefit the nation. He described meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to discuss the terms of agreeing to the export license; Mr. Trump didn't mention AMD in his comments.",
      "\"So I said, 'I want 20% if I'm going to approve it for you,'\" Mr. Trump said of his meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to discuss the terms of the export license. \"I don't want it myself, so when I say I want 20%, it's for the country.\"",
      "\"[Huang] said, 'Will you make it 15%?' so we negotiated a little deal,\" the president added.",
      "The revenue-sharing plan comes after the White House\u00a0announced\u00a0in April that it would restrict sales of Nvidia's H20 chips and MI308 chips from rival chipmaker AMD to China. However, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang last month said it had won approval from the Trump administration to sell its H20 chips to China.",
      "The H20 chip, which is specialized for artificial intelligence applications, was developed by Nvidia for the Chinese market, while AMD's MI308 chips are also geared for AI.",
      "It is unclear how the Trump administration would use the money generated from the chip sales agreement.",
      "Nvidia declined to comment on the specifics of the deal. In a statement, a spokesperson said, \"We follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets.

    "story": [
      "A new feature on Instagram that lets users share their real-time physical location with others on the app has privacy experts concerned over the amount of data exposed and potential safety risks to users.",
      "Called Instagram Map, the new feature was introduced on Thursday as part of an app update. On its blog, the company says the location-sharing tool makes it \"easier for you and your friends to stay in touch through the content you're enjoying on Instagram.\"",
      "\"You can opt into sharing your last active location with friends you pick, and you can turn it off anytime,\" Instagram said in a blog post announcing the new feature. \"You can also open the map to see content your friends and favorite creators are posting from cool spots. No matter how you use the map, you and your friends have a new, lightweight way to connect with each other.\"",
      "\"Off by default\"",
      "In a statement shared with CBS MoneyWatch Friday, Instagram's parent company, Meta, emphasized that Instagram Maps is not automatically active upon updating the app and that users must opt-in to the location-sharing feature in order to make their whereabouts visible to others.",
      "\"Instagram Map is off by default, and your live location is never shared unless you choose to turn it on. If you do, only people you follow back \u2014 or a private, custom list you select \u2014 can see your location,\" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Users can also choose not to share their locations when they are in particular places, or with particular people.",
      "Still, privacy experts say that social media users aren't always aware of how much information they're sharing with an app or its users, even if they have the ability to limit who sees what.",
      "\"The more these location features are rolled out on social media it carries out the assumption that as long as you give users the ability to toggle them on and off that they'll know exactly how to do that,\" Douglas Zytko, an app safety expert and associate professor at the College of Innovation & Technology at the University of Michigan-Flint, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But the average user isn't always aware of their privacy settings and if they match their preferences.\"",
      "When the Instagram Map feature is turned on, any content a user posts with a location tagged, including a reel, post or story, will show up on the app's map for 24 hours, according to the Instagram blog. While the feature remains on, the user's location is updated whenever they open the app or return to it. The feature can be turned off at any time.",
      "In an Instagram post discussing the feature, Instagram's head, Adam Mosseri, explains how he himself uses the map. \"Personally, I use the map to share what I'm up to with a handful of my closest friends, and I curate that list carefully,\" he said.",
      "User confusion over whether the feature is on or off",
      "On Threads, Meta's microblogging site, a number of Instagram account holders claimed that their locations were being pinned on friends' maps by default.",
      "Mosseri weighed in, saying the concerns prompted the company to re-examine how the feature works.",
      "\"We're double-checking everything, but so far it looks mostly like people are confused and assume that, because they can see themselves on the map when they open, other people can see them too,\" he said. \"We're still checking everything though to make sure nobody shares location without explicitly deciding to do so, which, by the way, requires a double consent by design (we ask you to confirm after you say you want to share).\"",
      "How to turn on Instagram Maps",
      "In the top right corner of the app, tap on the messaging function. There you will see a circular world map icon labeled \"map. If you click on the icon, you will see you're on location pinned on a map. Friends who are sharing their locations will also appear. Click on the gear icon to choose to share your location with no one, or a custom list of friends, or all of your friends \u2014 who are followers that you also follow back on the app.",
      "Social pressures, privacy and safety risks",
      "Zytko, however, said it can be complicated for social media users to manage privacy settings that let them share different kinds of content with different groups of people. \"This issue is called 'context collapse,'\" he said. \"Your co-workers see your social media posts, and your friends and family, and there is certain content you only want some groups to see but not others, and it can be hard to manage the visibility of content.\"",
      "Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which makes entertainment and technology recommendations for families, said location-sharing features can be particularly risky for younger app users.",
      "\"These features might feel fun and social, but they create unnecessary risks that teens and many adults don't necessarily understand,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "While parents who supervise their teens through controls built into the app can control their kids' location-sharing settings, he still has concerns about the kinds of social pressures such features expose teens, too.",
      "Torney said research at Common Sense Media shows that location-sharing also creates \"social pressures around where teens go and who they spend time with, and kids feel obligated to share location to show they are someplace cool.\"",
      "Furthermore, when teens share their locations, \"they are potentially telling strangers where they are in real time,\" Torney told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you're not selective about who you're sharing your location with, it creates opportunities for harassment, stalking or worse.\"",

The 2025 questionnaires were distributed via email on March 26 with a required completion date of April 9. Data on staffing shortages at VA facilities has been collected annually for over a decade, and the report notes that this is the eighth report to identify severe occupational staffing shortages at the facility level.",
      "The report notes that the OIG did not independently verify VHA data for accuracy or completeness. It also says that due to the timing of the questionnaire, any impact on staffing from OPM's Deferred Resignation Program and VA's workforce reshaping efforts \u2014 which are expected to lead to further staffing shortages \u2014 were not fully reflected.",
      "In response to the report, Pete Kasperowicz, press secretary for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, said it is \"not based on actual VA health care facility vacancies and therefore is not a reliable indicator of staffing shortages.\"",
      "\"The report simply lists occupations facilities feel are difficult for which to recruit and retain, so the results are completely subjective, not standardized and unreliable,\" he said in an emailed statement to CBS News on Wednesday. \"VA's department-wide vacancy rates for doctors and nurses are 14% and 10%, respectively. These are lower than most other health care systems, in line with normal VA historical averages and much lower than the respective 19% and 20% physician and nurse vacancy rates VA saw at times during the Biden Administration.\"",

How do skyrocketing staffing shortages and declining applicant pools make it more 'efficient' for veterans to access the care and services they deserve?

Any extension beyond 30 days requires a joint resolution passed by the House and Senate.",

    "story": [
      "Waters have receded, ending the flood threat after Alaska's capital city faced record floodwaters Wednesday stemming from a basin dammed by the Mendenhall Glacier, which released an \"outburst flood\" that threatened parts of Juneau.",
      "\"I think we were all very grateful to see the Hesko barriers work,\" Katie Koester, the Juneau city manager, said in an interview with CBS News Wednesday evening. \"We can all breathe a sigh of relief. For the most part we had very minimal flooding and avoided a really catastrophic event.\"",
      "Water levels in the Mendenhall River, which flows through Juneau, reached unprecedented heights in the early morning hours and peaked at around 7:15 a.m. local time before beginning to fall, the National Weather Service said. At its peak, the river's flood stage rose to 16.65 feet, topping the previous record of 15.99 feet set last year, according to forecasters.",
      "\"We could have easily had almost 1,000 structures \u2014 most of them residences, some multifamily \u2014 flooded,\" Koester said. \"And for many of those homes it would have been the second year in a row of flooding. Really cold, icy waters, really difficult to mitigate against, does a lot of damage to your home because of that glacial silt.\"",
      "The Mendenhall Glacier is about 12 miles from downtown Juneau and is a popular tourist attraction due to its proximity to Alaska's capital city, home to 30,000 people, and easy access on walking trails. Homes on the city's outskirts are within miles of Mendenhall Lake, which sits below the glacier, and many front the Mendenhall River, into which the glacial outburst is flowing.",
      "Some Juneau residents in the flood zone evacuated Tuesday, heeding guidance from officials who warned the community: \"Don't wait, Evacuate TONIGHT.\"",
      "Evacuated areas were reopened to residents only Wednesday afternoon, officials said.",
      "The city of Juneau said crews would be coming through to assess the flooding damage. It advised residents noto to drive through any standing water.",
      "\"In addition to posing a safety hazard, driving generates waves that cause additional damage to nearby structures,\" the city said.",
      "On Tuesday morning, authorities confirmed water had started escaping the ice dam.",
      "Later Wednesday morning, U.S. Forest Service ranger Michael Downs told reporters at a news conference that the west side of the glacier's recreation area remained underwater, along with a number of trails in the national forest that surrounds it. The Forest Service has closed the entire Mendenhall Glacier Recreation Area until further notice, and Downs said at the briefing that it will likely be five or six days before rangers are able to fully assess the situation. The visitor's center in the recreation area, however, will reopen Thursday, he said.",
      "Public schools in Juneau will delay their return for the upcoming academic year by one day, resuming classes this Friday instead of Thursday, said Frank Hauser, the school district superintendent.",
      "Flooding from the basin has become an annual concern since 2011, and in recent years has swept away houses and swamped hundreds of homes. Government agencies installed temporary barriers this year in hopes of protecting several hundred homes in the inundation area from widespread damage.",
      "The flooding happens because a smaller glacier near Mendenhall Glacier retreated \u2014 a casualty of the warming climate \u2014 and left a basin, known as Suicide Basin, that fills with rainwater and snowmelt each spring and summer. When the water creates enough pressure, it forces its way under or around the ice dam created by the Mendenhall Glacier, enters Mendenhall Lake and eventually flows down the Mendenhall River, as it did Tuesday.",
      "Before the basin began overtopping, the water level was rising rapidly \u2014 as much as 4 feet per day, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "The city saw successive years of record flooding in 2023 and 2024 \u2014 with the river last August cresting at 15.99 feet, about a foot over the prior record set a year earlier \u2014 and flooding extending farther into the Mendenhall Valley. This year's flooding was predicted to crest at between 16.3 and 16.8 feet, the weather service said, but then said an even higher 16.75 feet was more likely.",
      "Last year, nearly 300 residences were damaged.",
      "Video posted on social media\u00a0two years ago showed towering trees behind a home falling into the rushing Mendenhall River as the water ate away at the bank. Eventually, the home, teetering at the edge, also collapsed into the river.",
      "A large outburst can release some 15 billion gallons of water, according to the University of Alaska Southeast and Alaska Climate Adaptation Science Center. That's the equivalent of nearly 23,000 Olympic-size swimming pools. During last year's flood, the flow rate in the rushing Mendenhall River was about half that of Niagara Falls, the researchers say.",
      "City officials responded to concerns from property owners this year by working with state, federal and tribal entities to install a temporary levee along roughly 2.5 miles of riverbank in an attempt to guard against widespread flooding. The 10,000 \"Hesco\" barriers are essentially giant sandbags intended to protect more than 460 properties completely during an 18-foot flood event, said emergency manager Ryan O'Shaughnessy.",
      "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is at the start of what's expected to be a yearslong process of studying conditions in the region and examining options for a more permanent solution, such as a levee. The timeline has angered some residents, who say it's unreasonable.",
      "Outburst floods are expected to continue as long as the Mendenhall Glacier acts as an ice dam to seal off the basin, which could span another 25 to 60 years, according to the university and science center researchers.",

      "\"We make decisions based on science,\" said commission chair Rodney Barreto.",
      "Opponents called the hunt cruel, unnecessary and an excuse for hunters to bag a trophy animal when the real issue is the encroaching human population in bear habitat as Florida continues to grow.",
      "\"Not all the hunters support this hunt. We'd like to see nature in balance,\" said Lauren Jorgensen, whose family owns a ranch in rural Suwannee County.",
      "\"We are developing in this state at an insane speed, so the bears are being pushed out of their habitat,\" Rhonda Roff, an environmental activist with the Florida chapter of the Sierra Club, told CBS News. \"We're building roads through their habitat.\"",
      "Recent bear attacks led to bear hunt's revival",
      "There are an estimated 4,000 black bears in Florida, one of the few states with sizable populations that do not have a bear hunting season. Several pro-hunt speakers noted that bears are much more commonly seen in many areas than in the past, causing interactions with humans that provoke fear and concern.",
      "Ottice Amison, a member of the Franklin County Commission, said residents there report bears on porches, rooting through garbage cans, roaming neighborhoods and playgrounds.",
      "\"The reality is that the frequency and severity of bear interactions continue to rise,\" Amison told the wildlife commission. \"Right now, too many of our residents see bears as threats and pests.\"",
      "There has been only one documented fatal black bear attack in Florida, the May mauling of 89-year-old Robert Markel and his daughter's dog in a rural part of Collier County, in southwest Florida.",
      "The plan adopted Wednesday has more stringent rules than the previous Florida hunt in 2015, in which hunting permits were provided to anyone who could pay for them. That led to a chaotic event shut down days early after 300-plus bears were killed, including at least 38 females with cubs, meaning the young bears probably died too.",
      "\"What they're allowing us to hunt is an insignificant fraction of the bear population,\" avid hunter Daniel Levesque told CBS News. \"They'll die of old age quicker than will impact them from hunting.\"",
      "Hunt opponents predict this year will be more of the same.",
      "\"This decision reflects political pressure, not ecological necessity or public will,\" said Susannah Randolph, director of the Sierra Club Florida chapter.",
      "Roff does not believe the hunt will diminish bear interactions.",
      "\"The hunts will happen in the woods, those bears are not the ones that are coming out,\" Roff said.",
      "New restrictions in place for the revived bear hunt",
      "Under the new rule, there would be a random drawing of permits with a limit of 187. Hunters could kill only one bear each and only in certain parts of Florida where the bear population is large enough. There would be no killing of cubs and none of females with cubs, according to the FWC staff.",
      "A permit would cost $100 for Florida residents and $300 for nonresidents.",
      "For 2025, the plan is to hold the hunt from Dec. 6 to Dec. 28. In the future, the FWC foresees a bear hunt between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31, subject to more studies about the effect of hunting and the population of the animals. In future years, hunters could use up to six dogs each to pursue bears.",
      "Private landowners with 5,000 acres (2,023 hectares) or more could hold what the FWC calls a \"bear harvest program\" on their property under the proposal. Bears could be hunted at bait feeding stations on private property. Also, bowhunting will be allowed under rules similar to those for deer.",

      "EWS, which is\u00a0co-owned\u00a0by Bank of America, Capital One, JPMorgan Chase, PNC Bank, Truist, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo,\u00a0launched\u00a0the Zelle app in 2017.

      "Those handed over to U.S. custody include Abigael Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia, a leader of \"Los Cuinis,\" a group closely aligned with notorious cartel Jalisco New Generation, or CJNG. Another defendant, Roberto Salazar, is wanted in connection to the 2008 killing of a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy. Other prominent figures have ties to the Sinaloa Cartel and other violent drug trafficking groups.",
      "Mexican officials said Wednesday the latest transfer was not part of wider negotiations as Mexico seeks to avoid\u00a0higher tariffs threatened by President Trump,",
      "\"These transfers are not only a strategic measure to ensure public safety, but also reflect a firm determination to prevent these criminals from continuing to operate from within prisons and to break up their networks of influence,\" Mexican Security Minister Omar Garc\u00eda Harfuch said in a news conference on Wednesday.",

      "The transfers are a milestone for the Trump administration, which has made dismantling dangerous drug cartels a key Justice Department priority. It's the second time in months that Mexico has expelled cartel figures accused of narcotics smuggling, murder and other crimes amid mounting pressure from the Trump administration to curb the flow of drugs onto American streets.",
      "\"These 26 men have all played a role in bringing violence and drugs to American shores \u2014 under this Department of Justice, they will face severe consequences for their crimes against this country,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. \"We are grateful to Mexico's National Security team for their collaboration in this matter.\"",
      "In February, Mr. Trump signed an executive order designating CJNG, Sinaloa and six other cartels \u2014 Tren de Aragua, Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13), C\u00e1rtel del Noreste (formerly Los Zetas), La Nueva Familia Michoacana, C\u00e1rtel de Golfo (Gulf Cartel), and C\u00e1rteles Unidos \u2014 as foreign terrorist organizations.",
      "The cartel figures were put on planes to the U.S. after the Justice Department agreed not to seek the death penalty against any of the defendants or against any cartel leaders and members sent to the U.S. in February. That transfer was of 29 cartel figures, including drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, who was behind the killing of a U.S. DEA agent in 1985.",
      "\"This transfer is yet another example of what is possible when two governments stand united against violence and impunity,\" U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Ronald Johnson said in a statement. \"These fugitives will now face justice in U.S. courts, and the citizens of both of our nations will be safer from these common enemies.\"",
      "Sheinbaum has shown a willingness to cooperate more on security than her predecessor, specifically being more aggressive in pursuit of Mexico's cartels. But she has drawn a clear line when it comes to Mexico's sovereignty, rejecting suggestions by Mr. Trump and others of intervention by the U.S. military.",
      "Last week, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News that Mr. Trump directed the military to target drug cartels in Latin America. Sheinbaum responded Friday by saying there would be \"no invasion of Mexico.\"",
      "Also included in the group expelled Tuesday was Servando G\u00f3mez Martinez, also known as \"La Tuta,\" a former school teacher who became one of Mexico's most-wanted drug lords as head of the Knights Templar cartel. He was captured in 2015 and sentenced to 55 years in a Mexican prison in June 2019.",
      "Gomez led the quasi-religious criminal group that once exercised absolute control over Michoacan and he liked to appear in interviews and videos. The cartel orchestrated politics, controlled commerce, dictated rules and preached a code of ethics around devotion to God and family, even as it murdered and plundered.",

Abigael Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia was arrested in February 2015 in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco and had been fighting extradition to the United States since then.

      "The inflation rate has remained at or below 3% since the start of 2025. However, experts predict it could inch up later in the year as tariffs put more pressure on consumer prices. Alan Detmeister, an economist at UBS, told CBS MoneyWatch that he estimates headline CPI will rise to 3.7% and core CPI will rise to 3.8% by the second quarter of 2026.",

    "story": [
      "Fewer Americans are reporting that they drink alcohol amid a growing belief that even moderate alcohol consumption is a health risk, according to a Gallup poll released Wednesday.",
      "The survey finds that 54% of U.S. adults say they drink alcoholic beverages such as liquor, wine or beer \u2014 \"the lowest by one percentage point in Gallup's nearly 90-year trend,\" the analytics company says.",
      "And a record high percentage of U.S. adults, 53%, now say moderate drinking is bad for their health, up from 28% in 2015. The uptick in doubt about alcohol's benefits is largely driven by young adults \u2014 the age group that is most likely to believe drinking \"one or two drinks a day\" can cause health hazards \u2014 but older adults are also now increasingly likely to think moderate drinking carries risks.",
      "The findings of the poll, which was conducted in July, indicate that after years of many believing that moderate drinking was harmless \u2014 or even beneficial \u2014 worries about alcohol consumption are taking hold. According to Gallup's data, even those who consume alcohol are drinking less.",
      "The federal government is updating new dietary guidelines, including those around alcohol. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, government data showed U.S. alcohol consumption was trending up. But other government surveys have shown a decline in certain types of drinking, particularly among teenagers and young adults.",
      "This comes alongside a new drumbeat of information about alcohol's risks. While moderate drinking was once thought to have benefits for heart health, health professionals in recent years have pointed to overwhelming evidence that alcohol consumption leads to negative health outcomes and is a leading cause of cancer.",
      "Growing skepticism about alcohol's benefits",
      "Younger adults have been quicker than older Americans to accept that drinking is harmful, but older adults are coming around to the same view.",
      "About two-thirds of 18- to 34-year-olds believe moderate drinking is unhealthy, according to the poll, up from about 4 in 10 in 2015. Older adults are less likely to see alcohol as harmful \u2014 about half of Americans age 55 or older believe this \u2014 but that's a substantial increase, too. In 2015, only about 2 in 10 adults age 55 or older thought alcohol was bad for their health.",
      "In the past, moderate drinking was thought to have some benefits. That idea came from imperfect studies that largely didn't include younger people and couldn't prove cause and effect. Now the scientific consensus has shifted, and several countries recently lowered their alcohol consumption recommendations. Earlier this year, the outgoing U.S. surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, recommended a label on bottles of beer, wine and liquor that would clearly outline the link between alcohol consumption and cancer.",
      "\"Alcohol is a well-established, preventable cause of cancer responsible for about 100,000 cases of cancer and 20,000 cancer deaths annually in the United States \u2014 greater than the 13,500 alcohol-associated traffic crash fatalities per year in the U.S. \u2014 yet the majority of Americans are unaware of this risk,\" Murthy said in a statement in January.",
      "The federal government's current dietary guidelines recommend Americans not drink or, if they do consume alcohol, men should limit themselves to two drinks a day or fewer while women should stick to one or fewer.",
      "Gallup's director of U.S. social research, Lydia Saad, said shifting health advice throughout older Americans' lives may be a reason they have been more gradual than young adults to recognize alcohol as harmful.",
      "\"Older folks may be a little more hardened in terms of the whiplash that they get with recommendations,\" Saad said. \"It may take them a little longer to absorb or accept the information. Whereas, for young folks, this is the environment that they've grown up in ... in many cases, it would be the first thing young adults would have heard as they were coming into adulthood.\"",
      "The government is expected to release new guidelines later this year, under the directive of health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has promised big changes. Kennedy has not hinted at how the alcohol recommendations may shift.",
      "Drinking rates fall to decade low",
      "Slightly more than half of Americans, 54%, report that they drink alcohol \u2014 a low in Gallup's data that is especially pronounced among women and young adults. The previous low was 55%, recorded in 1958.",
      "\"Declines in alcohol consumption do not appear to be caused by people shifting to other mood-altering substances \u2014 in particular, recreational marijuana, which is now legal in about half of U.S. states,\" Gallup said in a news release. \"Although marijuana use is higher today than a decade ago, it has been fairly steady over the past four years and thus doesn't appear to be a factor in people choosing not to drink alcohol.\"",
      "Gallup says it has been tracking Americans' drinking behavior since 1939. Since 2001, it has tracked their views on health implications related to moderate drinking.",
      "Young Americans' alcohol consumption has been trending downward for years, accelerating the overall decline in alcohol consumption. In sharp contrast with Gallup's findings two decades ago, when young adults were likeliest to report drinking, young adults' drinking rate is now slightly below middle-aged and older adults.",
      "Americans' reported drinking is among the lowest since the question was first asked in 1939. For most of the last few decades, at least 6 in 10 Americans have reported drinking alcoholic beverages, only dipping below that point a few times in the question's history.",
      "Americans who drink alcohol are consuming less",
      "Even if concerns about health risks aren't causing some adults to give up alcohol entirely, these worries could be influencing how often they drink.",
      "The survey found that adults who think moderate drinking is bad for one's health are just as likely as people who don't share those concerns to report that they drink, but fewer of the people with health worries had consumed alcohol recently.",
      "About half of those who worry moderate drinking is unhealthy said they had a drink in the previous week, compared with about 7 in 10 who did not think drinking was bad for their health.",

      "\"It's possible that these tariff-induced price increases are a one-time price level shock that will start coming down early next year,\" said Detmeister. \"We think they're going to be much more lasting.\"",

      "What the inflation data could mean for a Fed rate cut",
      "With the CPI in July rising to annualized rate of 2.7%, inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target rate, however, most analysts say that the possibility of a Fed rate cut in September is likely still on the table.",
      "\"Although core annual inflation is back to its highest level since February, today's CPI print is not hot enough to derail the Fed from cutting rates in September,\" said Shah.",
      "The latest jobs report showed that hiring slowed in July, which could bolster the case for a Fed rate cut.",
      "The Fed's mandate is to maintain maximum employment, while keeping prices down. Otherwise, the country\u00a0could slip into what's called stagflation\u00a0\u2014 which is when high inflation is coupled with high unemployment.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and leaders of numerous NATO countries held virtual meetings Wednesday ahead of Friday's scheduled summit in Alaska between Mr. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Mr. Trump joined in a call from the White House. In a social media post ahead of the meeting, he wrote: \"Will be speaking to European Leaders in a short while. They are great people who want to see a deal done.\"",
      "The president on Wednesday said he hopes there will be a second meeting after the Alaska meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, but that will depend on how Friday's sitdown goes. Asked by a reporter at an event at the Kennedy Center whether there will be consequences for Putin if he doesn't agree to stop the war after the Friday meeting, Mr. Trump said, \"There will be very severe consequences.\" But he declined to elaborate.",
      "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz convened the series of virtual meetings in an attempt to have the voice of European and Ukrainian leaders heard ahead of the Alaska summit, which they've been sidelined from.",
      "Zelenskyy joined Merz in Berlin, and they met with European leaders earlier Wednesday in preparation for the virtual call with Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance about an hour later.",
      "\"U.S. President Trump will start discussions with President Putin in Alaska about bringing the war to an end, and important decisions could be reached,\" Merz, standing alongside Zelenskyy, told journalists in a press conference after meeting with Mr. Trump. \"We as Europeans are doing everything we can to help set the agenda for that meeting. We're hoping that Donald Trump has success in that meeting in Anchorage.\"",
      "Merz said that he and Zelenskyy had spoken with Mr. Trump together.",
      "\"In Alaska, security interests of Europe and Ukraine must be protected. That is part of what we discussed with President Trump. We were together on the conditions of this meeting and the goals of this meeting on Friday,\" Merz said.",
      "The German leader said Ukraine would need a seat at the table if peace was to be reached in Ukraine, and that he told Mr. Trump he would speak to him after his Alaska meeting with Putin.",
      "\"We want to make sure that the right chronology happens: that there is a ceasefire and that there is an agreement that is discussed after that,\" he said. \"A legal recognition of Russian ownership of this territory cannot happen. There have to be robust security guarantees. The sovereignty of Ukraine has to be respected. Negotiations have to be part of a larger transatlantic strategy, and has to be part of necessary pressure on Russia.\"",
      "Merz added, \"If there is no movement on the Russian side, we and the U.S. have to put more pressure on Russia. President Trump knows this position and largely agrees with it, and we had a good conversation with each other.\"",
      "\"Everything ... needs to be discussed with Ukraine\"",
      "Zelenskyy thanked Merz and said \"everything regarding Ukraine needs to be discussed with Ukraine. We have to be part of this conversation.\" He said Ukraine, before anything else, needed a ceasefire and security guarantees.",
      "\"President Trump has supported us today, and the U.S. is ready to support us,\" he said.",
      "Zelenskyy also said he had told Mr. Trump and the European leaders that \"Putin is bluffing,\" and that \"Putin doesn't want peace. He wants to occupy our country, and we understand it. Putin cannot fool us. We need to pressure him. Sanctions not only from the U.S., but from the European Union. Together our union of partners can really, really stop Putin's war.\"",
      "He urged allies to keep up sanctions on Moscow, saying, \"Sanctions and increasing sanctions on Russia if they are not agreeing to a ceasefire \u2014 this is very effective and they are working.\"",
      "Regarding Friday's meeting in Alaska, Zelenskyy said he had discussed his priorities with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"We really hope that the immediate ceasefire will be one main issue during this meeting,\" Zelenskyy said. \"President Trump was talking about it. Then he suggested that he will contact me immediately after his Alaska meeting. He will tell me about all results, if there are any results, and then we will discuss our steps together.\"",
      "Earlier on Wednesday, Merz pledged to help Ukraine develop its own long-range missile systems that would be free of any Western-imposed limitations on their use and targets as the Kyiv government fights to repel Russia's invasion.",
      "Mr. Trump has said he wants to see whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is serious about ending the war, now in its fourth year, describing Friday's summit as \"a feel-out meeting\" where he can assess the Russian leader's intentions.",
      "Yet Mr. Trump has disappointed allies in Europe by saying Ukraine will have to give up some Russian-held territory. He has also said Russia must accept land swaps, although it was unclear what Putin might be expected to surrender.",
      "European allies have pushed for Ukraine's involvement in any peace talks, fearful that discussions that exclude Kyiv could otherwise favor Moscow.",
      "Mr. Trump on Monday ducked repeated chances to say that he would push for Zelenskyy to take part in his discussions with Putin, and was dismissive of Zelenskyy and his need to be part of an effort to seek peace. Mr. Trump said that following Friday's summit, a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian leaders could be arranged, or that it could also be a meeting with \"Putin and Zelenskyy and me.\"",
      "Zelenskyy warned that \"talks about us, without us, will not work.\"",
      "Ukrainian and European concerns",
      "The Europeans and Ukraine are wary that Putin, who has waged the biggest land war in Europe since 1945 and used Russia's energy might to try to intimidate the European Union, might secure favorable concessions and set the outlines of a peace deal without them.",
      "The overarching fear of many European countries is that Putin will set his sights on one of them next if he wins in Ukraine.",
      "Zelenskyy said Tuesday that Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw from the remaining 30% of the Donetsk region that it still controls as part of a ceasefire deal, a proposal the leader categorically rejected.",
      "Zelenskyy reiterated that Ukraine would not give up any territory it controls, saying that would be unconstitutional and would serve only as a springboard for a future Russian invasion.",
      "He said diplomatic discussions led by the U.S. focusing on ending the war have not addressed key Ukrainian demands, including security guarantees to prevent future Russian aggression and including Europe in negotiations and rehabilitate Putin.",
      "General Sir Richard Shirreff, former NATO Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe, told CBS News partner network BBC News he didn't believe Friday's meeting between Mr. Trump and Putin could lead to an end of the war between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "\"Russia has to recognize and Putin has to recognize that Zelenskyy is president of Ukraine, recognize the Ukrainian constitution and Ukraine's right to exist as a sovereign state. And that is only going to happen ... when Russia gets a really bloody nose. And for that to happen, we need to see some proper strategic thinking from NATO - from the president of the United States - that recognizes that this is about transatlantic security.\"",
      "Shirreff said an end to the war would require Ukraine becoming a member of NATO.",
      "\"Even if Putin moves on or falls under a bus, we're probably likely to get somebody in place just as hard-line, just as ultra-nationalistic, and just as determined to press on (with Russia's takeover of Ukraine),\" Shirreff said. \"So I think we have to recognize that European security means deterrence - a band of deterrent steel, as I've said many times - from the Baltic to the Black Sea, with Ukraine as a NATO member. Now, however far-fetched that may seem from where we are at the moment, that's the reality. ... Any sort of compromise now, any so-called freezing of conflict, is only going to continue to postpone it.\"",
      "Trump-Putin summit to take place on Alaskan military base",
      "The summit between Mr. Trump and Putin will be the first in-person meeting between Putin and a sitting U.S. president since Russia invaded Ukraine more than three years ago.",
      "The meeting will take place at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, on the northern edge of Anchorage, a senior White House official told CBS News Tuesday. Given that it is peak tourist season in Alaska, there were few viable options to host the talks. Possible venues for the high-stakes meeting also needed to meet security requirements.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier Tuesday that the mechanics of the meeting were \"still being ironed out.\"",
      "Leavitt described the meeting as \"a listening exercise for the president.\"",
      "\"Only one party that's involved in this war is going to be present, and so this is for the president to go and to get, again, a more firm and better understanding of how we can hopefully bring this war to an end,\" Leavitt said.",
      "\"Trump has obviously not been listening at all because it's very clear \u2014 and Putin continues to make it clear \u2014 what his demands are, and he's not stepped back one iota from his maximalist demands,\" former NATO Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe Shirreff said. \"And those, as we've heard, are simply impossible for Ukraine to accept without capitulation.\"",
      "Asked Wednesday at the Kennedy Center if he believes he can convince Putin to stop targeting Ukrainian civilians, Mr. Trump said no.",
      "\"Well, I'll tell you what,\" Mr. Trump responded. \"I've had that conversation with him. I've had a lot of good conversations with him. Then I go home and I see that a rocket hit a nursing home or a rocket hit an apartment building and people are laying dead in the streets. So I guess the answer to that is no, because I've had this conversation.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters in the White House briefing room Monday, Mr. Trump expressed optimism that his meeting with Putin will be \"constructive,\" and said that he is planning to establish an in-person meeting involving Putin and Zelenskyy.",

      "An American teenager was detained on an Antarctic island while attempting to pilot his small plane to every continent, said Chilean authorities, who have charged him for allegedly submitting a false flight plan. The 19-year-old pilot, Ethan Guo, denies the accusation and says the month-and-a-half-long ordeal is taking a toll on his health.",
      "Guo gained an online following by documenting his trip around the world, which lasted well over 100 days and had already taken him to six continents prior to the Antarctic voyage, according to his website and social media posts.",
      "Guo said he hoped to become the first pilot to complete a solo flight across all seven continents in a small Cessna, a feat that simultaneously aims to raise $1 million for cancer research through St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. On his site, the teen cites his cousin's 2021 cancer diagnosis as his source of inspiration.",
      "Guo's latest Instagram posts chronicled part of his path over southeastern Asia. Authorities in South America say he went on to traverse the Pacific Ocean, ending up in Chile before making his way toward Antarctica.",
      "According to Cristian Cristoso Rifo, the regional prosecutor of Magallanes and Chilean Antarctica, Guo departed from the airport in the city of Punta Arenas, near the southernmost point of Chile, and proceeded to conduct an unauthorized flight to King George Island. Located off the Atlantic coast, the island is claimed by Chile as part of its Atlantic territory.",
      "The young pilot landed his plane at the island's Teniente R. Marsh Airport, where he was detained, Cristoso said in a video statement shared on social media on Monday. He said Guo submitted a flight plan that indicated his plans to fly over Punta Arenas, but not farther than that.",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News, attorneys for Guo say those accusations are unfounded. \"Documentary evidence and audio recordings provided to the prosecutor definitively show that Mr. Guo's original destination was Ushuaia, Argentina,\" they write.",
      "But they say due to \"bureaucratic confusion,\" Chilean officials told him to \"circle in darkness over Tierra del Fuego before proceeding to Ushuaia at sunrise\" \u2014 and that's when he ran into dangerous flight conditions.",
      "\"He encountered instrument failures and heavy, unreported icing conditions caused by high cloud cover over the Andes, creating an imminent risk of a crash. To avert disaster, he diverted over the ocean. Once over the ocean, he experienced engine-related issues, likely to due to sudden, weather-related pressure changes.\"",
      "They say he then requested and received permission to land at the Marsh base from a high-ranking Chilean aviation official via WhatsApp.",
      "The prosecutor's office charged Guo for violating two articles of the Chilean Aeronautical Code, including one that calls for either short-term imprisonment or a fine brought down on anyone who lands in Chilean territory without legitimate authorization.",
      "The prosecutor said that in addition to his alleged breaches of the aeronautical code, Guo violated \"multiple national and international\" rules governing access to Antarctica and the routes taken to get there. His unauthorized flight also posed safety risks for air traffic to the frozen continent, Cristoso added.",
      "The statement from Guo's representatives blames prosecutors for refusing to acknowledge \"clear evidence\" exonerating him, \"resulting in his de facto confinement on the island for a month and a half.\"",

      "They found that populations of reindeer have declined during past periods of \"rapid climate warming.\"",
      "\"But the losses expected in the coming decades due to future climate change are likely to be even more severe than those in the past,\" Canteri said.",
      "A decline in reindeer populations also could have wider ecological implications because the animals help maintain plant diversity in the tundra.",
      "\"A reduction in tundra plant diversity resulting from the loss of reindeer and caribou will have many cascading effects, including reduction of carbon storage in Arctic soils,\" said Eric Post, a professor at the University of California Davis who contributed to the research. \"Continued losses will likely further exacerbate climatic warming through release of soil carbon to the atmosphere, which of course would further threaten reindeer and caribou as well as ourselves.\"",

      "Asked by a reporter how the Trump administration squares its stricter monitoring of free expression via social media accounts of U.S. visa applicants with its criticism of European countries restricting hate speech, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a press briefing Tuesday that \"restrictive laws against dis-favored voices, often on political or religious grounds \u2014 no matter how disagreeable someone's speech may be \u2014 to criminalize it, or silencing it by force only serves as a catalyst for further hatred, suppression, and polarization.\"",

      "Luckily, Barber had an \"above average understanding of the wilderness,\" McKinnon said. He was able to build a shelter from sticks and moss. He drank pond water to stay hydrated, McKinnon said, and \"munched on whatever he could find.\"",
      "Barber also wrote multiple messages, including carving the word \"HELP\" on a rock near his shelter and drawing an \"SOS\" in mud to try to alert rescuers.",
      "On Aug. 8, Barber was found safe near his shelter after being spotted by a helicopter from the Quesnel Search and Rescue team. Rescuers had first seen Barber's truck, then they found him and his shelter about three miles away, Quesnel Search and Rescue president Bob Zimmerman told CBC News.",
      "Barber was severely dehydrated and had a leg injury, the BBC reported. He was taken to a hospital for treatment and released.",
      "\"Today's result is why we train, why we respond, and why we never give up,\" the Quesnel Search and Rescue team said on social media.",
      "Other agencies, including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, British Columbia search and rescue organization PEP Air and BC Emergency Health Services also took part in the search for Barber.",
      "Zimmerman told CBC News that despite Barber's survival skills, he may not have lasted much longer.",
      "\"He was having a hard time standing. I don't know that he would have made it another 24 hours without us recovering him,\" Zimmerman said. \"He's a lucky man.\"",

    "story": [
      "What was intended as a fundraising mission has become a nightmare for American teen influencer Ethan Guo, who has been stuck in a remote location in Chilean territory in Antarctica since June.",
      "Last year, Guo began a journey to become the youngest person to fly solo to all seven continents. The trip also aimed to raise $1 million for childhood cancer research through St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Guo flew his Cessna 182Q to North America, South America, Asia, Africa, Australia and Europe before heading to Antarctica.",
      "Prosecutors said he was authorized to fly to the Chilean city of Punta Arenas, which is often used as a base for excursions to Antarctica. Authorities said Guo provided \"false flight plan data\" and traveled to King George Island. Guo's flight plan only included his landing in Punta Arenas, authorities said. Chile claims ownership of the island, which is about 75 miles off the coast of Antarctica.",
      "Guo was detained at the airport on King George Island. On June 29, he was charged with handing false information to ground control and landing without authorization, both breaches of the Chilean Aeronautical Code. The code calls for short-term imprisonment or a fine for anyone who lands on the country's territory without authorization.",
      "Chilean prosecutor Cristi\u00e1n Cristoso also said that Guo violated \"multiple national and international\" rules governing access to Antarctica and the routes used to travel there. The unauthorized flight posed safety risks for other air travelers, Cristoso said.",
      "Since being charged, Guo has stayed at a military base on the island. He was not forced to stay there, only to remain in Chilean territory, but because of the severe winter in that part of the southern hemisphere, there haven't been any available flights he could take.",
      "Guo was also unable to fly his Cessna. Cristoso told reporters on Monday that Guo's plane \"does not have the capabilities to make a flight,\" but did not provide more details.",
      "On Monday, a judge dropped the charges against Guo as part of an agreement with his lawyers and Chilean prosecutors. The agreement requires Guo make a $30,000 donation to a children's cancer foundation within 30 days to avoid a trial. He must also leave Chile as soon as conditions allow, and is prohibited from reentering Chilean territory for three years.",
      "The prosecutor's office said Guo must also pay all costs for his \"aircraft security and personal maintenance\" during his stay at the military facility. He also needs to cover all expenses for his return.",
      "Guo told The Associated Press in a text that he was \"relieved by the outcome.\"",
      "Guo said he is awaiting approval for his departure flight from Antarctica. He is talking with his lawyer to see if there is any way he can continue to fly his Cessna, and said he hopes he can continue with his \"original mission.\"",

      "The Perseids peak in 2025 is Aug. 12-13, specifically early Wednesday for those in North America. At that time, the moon will be 84% full, according to the American Meteor Society.",
      "\"In 2025, the waning gibbous moon will severely compromise this shower at the time of maximum activity,\" the organization says. \"Such conditions will reduce activity by at least 75 percent as only the brighter meteors will be visible.\"",
      "Viewers this year can expect to see between 10-20 Perseids each hour, as opposed to 50 Perseids per hour under darker conditions, it says.",
      "\"The strength of each Perseid display varies year to year, mainly due to lunar conditions,\"\u00a0writes Robert Lunsford with the American Meteor Society. \"If a bright moon is above the horizon during the night of maximum activity, then the display will be reduced. Most of the Perseid meteors are faint and bright moonlight will make it difficult to view.\"",
      "The Perseids meteor shower has been ongoing for several weeks. It started in mid-July and will continue until Aug. 23.",

      "NASA says the best time to view the Perseids is early in the morning, before the sun comes up, in the Northern Hemisphere. However, meteors sometimes can be seen as early as 10 p.m.",
      "When looking at the Perseids, they appear to come from the constellation Perseus, which is why this meteor shower has its name. But the meteors don't originate from the constellation; they are space debris left by a comet. That debris interacts with Earth's atmosphere, disintegrating and resulting in colorful lines in the sky, according to NASA and the American Meteor Society.",
      "\"The pieces of space debris that interact with our atmosphere to create the Perseids originate from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle,\" which last visited the inner solar system in 1992, NASA says.",
      "During peak, Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, the Earth will pass closest to the core orbit of comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle, Lunsford writes.",
      "\"To view the Perseids successfully, it is suggested you watch from a safe rural area that is as dark as possible,\" he says. \"The more stars you can see, the more meteors will also be visible.\"",

      "In the film, debuting in theaters Aug. 15, Sweeney, 27, stars as Penny Jo Poplin, a small-town diner waitress who is obsessed with the country icon and dreams of following in her footsteps.",
      "\"Dolly is definitely her biggest aspirational role model,\" Sweeney said of her character during a June interview with Entertainment Weekly.",

      "\"It's trying to find that in-between place of who Penny is and what she has,\" Sweeney added. \"But then also who she wants to be. Penny Jo dreams of being able to have Dolly's outlook on life because her world feels so gray, dark, and trapped. [Dolly has] this beautiful big personality and energy that makes everything have color again, and that's what she wants.\"",
      "In \"Americana,\" Penny Jo, who is also an aspiring country music singer-songwriter, joins forces with lovelorn military veteran and ranch-hand Lefty Ledbetter (Paul Walter Hauser) to procure a rare Native American artifact \u2014 a Lakota Ghost Shirt \u2014 after it lands on the black market in their South Dakota town.",

      "\"She finally sees something that can be her ticket to Nashville,\" Sweeney told Entertainment Weekly. \"It's her ticket to be able to go and chase her dreams. And she's past the point of waiting for it to happen.\"",
      "\"Americana\" marks the directorial debut of screenwriter Tony Tost, who also wrote the screenplay. The movie also stars pop singer Halsey, Eric Dane, Zahn McClarnon and Simon Rex.",
      "Though \"Americana\" originally premiered at the 2023 South by Southwest Film & TV Festival, the movie's worldwide release date comes as drama continues to swirl over Sweeney's July American Eagle ad campaign.",
      "Sydney Sweeney co-stars with Paul Walter Hauser in the Western heist movie. (Ursula Coyote/Courtesy of Lionsgate)",
      "However, PR expert Eric Schiffer shared his view that Sweeney's character will be a big draw for audiences, and the timing of the release will prove to be serendipitous for the production.",
      "\"She plays Penny Jo, a waitress who worships Dolly; that disarming sweetness offsets the AE edge and broadens demo reach,\" the Reputation Management Consultants CEO told Fox News Digital.",
      "He continued, \"Country-curious teens and red-state moms will test-drive the movie; coastal critics bring pitiless scrutiny \u2014 perfect storm for sales.\"",

      "Pop singer Halsey also stars in \"Americana.\" (Courtesy of Lionsgate)",
      "In a promo video posted to the brand's Instagram, Sweeney was seen walking toward an AE billboard featuring her and the tagline \"Sydney Sweeney Has Great Genes.\" Sweeney crossed out \"Genes\" and replaced it with \"Jeans\" before walking away.",

      "The ad's detractors have suggested that it has shades of \"eugenics\" and \"White supremacy.\" According to Salon, the term \"great genes\" was historically used to \"celebrate whiteness, thinness and attractiveness.\"",
      "American Eagle released a statement on its social media on Aug. 1, which read, \"\u2019Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans\u2019 is and always was about the jeans. Her jeans. Her story.

      "\"The AE firestorm shoved Sweeney into toxic culture-war crosshairs \u2014 exactly where attention monetizes fastest,\" he said. \"Backlash may spook a few \u2018safe\u2019 brands, but risk-tolerant studios will ruthlessly overpay for her heat.",
      "\"American Eagle\u2019s denim blitz could jam an outrage cocktail of $5 million more in Sweeney\u2019s wallet before Labor Day,\" Schiffer added. \"The viral jeans spot is a ruthless napalm-grade cash cannon \u2014 every click fires fresh royalty checks at her $40 million pile. Critics rant, but controversy drives denim sales \u2014 she\u2019s riding a volatile tornado straight to the bank.\"",

      "\"Outrage addicts labeled the ad \u2018eugenics\u2019 but Hollywood execs smell radioactive buzz and cast her faster,\" he said. \"Hollywood forgives denim puns; it rewards controversial cash.\"",
      "Schiffer continued, \"She proved she can take heat and directors love an actress with fierce armor. Her blend of bombshell and backlash is near lethal catnip for producers. Hollywood loves a polarizing star with a merciless marketing punch that sells.\"",
      "PR experts weighed in on how the controversy could impact Sydney Sweeney's career. (American Eagle)",
      "However, PR expert Steve Honig voiced his opinion that the backlash was unlikely to affect Sweeney's career.",
      "\"Regardless of which side you are on, the ads have undeniably gotten the actress, and the company, more attention and publicity than they have ever had. Judging by the public\u2019s split opinion, I don\u2019t think this will have much, if any, impact on Sweeney\u2019s career or upcoming projects,\" he said. \"She is a popular, up-and-coming talent with a bright future ahead of her.\"",
      "Honig went on to cite other ad campaigns that saw great success by courting controversy.",
      "AMERICAN EAGLE FIRES BACK AT CRITICS AFTER SYDNEY SWEENEY CAMPAIGN SPARKS ONLINE BACKLASH",
      "\"Historically, ads for jeans have been provocative,\" he noted. \"Look back to Calvin Klein\u2019s advertising campaign in the early 1980s featuring Brooke Shields; there was a lot of criticism about how a 15-year-old girl was being portrayed. The ads turned out to have a positive result for both Klein and Shields, and in many ways put the actress/model on the map.\"",
      "Honig continued, \"As far as the Sweeney ads being too sexual or aimed at \u2018male gazing,\u2019 I would point to the highly successful Pepsi ad campaign with Cindy Crawford, which was recently rebooted. Gloria Vanderbilt\u2019s advertising campaign was all about her name being on a woman\u2019s backside.\"",
      "\"The bottom line here is that American Eagle decided to push the envelope in much the same way Klein and Vanderbilt did,\" he added. \"Like it or not, the campaign is sparking discussion and getting a lot of notice, which is likely what they set out to do.\"",
      "Sydney Sweeney's new movie debuts in theaters on Aug. 15. (American Eagle)",
      "In addition to \"Americana,\" Sweeney also has several other projects in the works. The actress is set to return for the third season of the hit HBO series \"Euphoria,\" which is aiming for a 2026 release, according to Deadline.",

      "The actress will next be seen starring alongside Amanda Seyfried, Brandon Sklenar, and Michele Morrone in Paul Feig's upcoming film \"The Housemaid,\" which is based on Freida McFadden's 2022 novel. \"The Housemaid\" will be released in theaters on Dec. 25.",

      "While the deal began in 2020 and now includes five Sussex-branded media projects in addition to Markle's As Ever lifestyle brand, experts questioned if the extended partnership with the streaming giant signaled a downward trend for the royals.",
      "Despite the success of her recent \"With Love, Meghan\" series, The Hollywood Reporter claimed the Netflix change mirrored the \"downgrade\" the Obamas experienced with the streamer and their Higher Ground banner.",
      "MEGHAN MARKLE'S LEGAL CLASH WITH HALF-SISTER COULD DERAIL PRINCE HARRY'S ROYAL RECONCILIATION",
      "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex extended their partnership with Netflix on Monday with a first-look deal for their Archewell Productions banner. (Karwai Tang/WireImage)",

      "\"There clearly is no repeat of the reported $100 million Netflix offered before. This first-look deal is certain to be less, probably a good deal less. It is true that Netflix continues to link with As Ever, Meghan's lifestyle brand, and that may be the most commercially successful part of this new arrangement.\"",
      "According to The New York Times, citing a source, the deal is indeed reportedly worth less for Harry and Meghan than their last arrangement with Netflix.",
      "Meghan Markle's \"With Love, Meghan\" picked up a second season on Netflix. (Netflix)",
      "Meanwhile, Fitzwilliams added, \"If you don't do much you don't deserve much, and we've been reading about how they will adapt \u2018Meet Me At The Lake\u2019 for ages.\"",
      "In August 2023, the couple purchased the rights to Carley Fortune's best-selling romance novel, \"Meet Me at the Lake,\" and had plans to make the page-turner into a feature film. It is reportedly still in the works.",
      "LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS",
      "\"Meet Me at the Lake\" has a storyline that resembles Prince Harry's life, and follows a 30-something woman who finds love in a hopeless place following the tragic loss of her mother, who died in a car crash.\u00a0Fern, the novel's main character, returns to her mom's lakeside resort in Canada to figure out a plan for her life, only to reconnect with a long-lost love with a penchant for expensive suits named Will.",
      "While Fitzwilliams believed the updated Netflix deal was \"a bad hit\" for the royal couple, branding expert Doug Eldridge told Fox News Digital that the new agreement isn't uncommon in the entertainment industry.",

      "\"While it appears like a negative downgrade on first pass, that's akin to reading only headlines versus the fine print,\" Eldridge said. \"In other words, Harry and Meghan still have several other creative projects with Netflix, as well as an expanded relationship around the As Ever lifestyle brand. The latter will be a revenue generator for both sides, which is difficult to create (much less sustain) around traditional reality television.",

      "\"This might not be a home run for Markle, but it's certainly not the strikeout critics might have been hoping for.\"",
      "Eldridge noted that the couple could have faced a bigger setback if they had \"placed all their eggs in the reality/pseudo-doc category.\"",
      "\"This might not be a home run for Markle, but it's certainly not the strikeout critics might have been hoping for.\"",
      "\"I'm not sure what the market looks like, in terms of a would-be bidding war, now that the exclusivity clause is set to expire,\" Eldridge explained. \"That said, just like the boosters and fuel tank eventually fall off the space shuttle as it ascends into orbit, so too might be the case with Harry and Meghan, as they climb higher to their bigger, broader, vision.\"",
      "The \"Heart of Invictus\" focused on Prince Harry's global event which helps wounded service members heal through sports. (Karwai Tang/WireImage)",
      "\"If this series was what was required to get them into orbit, then it was certainly a win, as they are now able to explore the 'deep space' of other ventures, which are not only intellectually more diverse, but also don't require them to be the 'name and face' behind the product itself.\"",
      "Still, royal expert Ian Pelham Turner said the Netflix shift alluded to unanswered questions about the couple's future branding potential from within the streaming giant.",
      "\"Obviously, Netflix feels that Harry and Meghan are losing brand value based on their current standing,\" Turner told Fox News Digital. \"However, the streaming giant may have made a fundamental mistake in that the isolated position the couple are currently in could rapidly change if negotiations [return] to the U.K.\"",
      "\"Perhaps there could be a new approach of them becoming royal ambassadors in America,\" Turner stated, noting that \"it could see their brand value soaring.\"",
      "For now, season two of \"With Love, Meghan\" will premiere this month, and a special holiday episode will air in December.",
      "\"Harry and Meghan are influential voices whose stories resonate with audiences everywhere,\" Bela Bajaria, Netflix\u2019s chief content officer, said in a statement. \"The response to their work speaks for itself \u2014 Harry & Meghan gave viewers an intimate look into their lives and quickly became one of our most-watched documentary series.\"",
      "\"More recently, fans have been inspired by With Love, Meghan, with products from the new As ever line consistently selling out in record time. We\u2019re excited to continue our partnership with Archewell Productions and to entertain our members together.\"",

      "The District of Columbia is a special case in American governance.",
      "Which is why President Trump has distinctive authority to dispatch federal agents and National Guard troops to patrol the city\u2019s streets for at least a month.",
      "It\u2019s in the Constitution.",
      "Article I, Section 8 grants Congress the power \"To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of particular states, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the government of the United States.\"",
      "That\u2019s a reference to what would become the District of Columbia.",
      "REPUBLICANS READY TO SUPPORT TRUMP'S MOVE TO SKIRT CONGRESS IN DC CRIME CRACKDOWN",
      "The Founders wanted the home of the federal government somewhat cloistered \u2013 and protected \u2013 from local whims and danger. The precursor to the present Congress convened in Philadelphia. But Continental Army soldiers staged what was known as the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783, claiming the \"Congress of the Confederation\" owed them back pay. The incident prompted Alexander Hamilton to suggest that the Congress vacate Philadelphia. It wasn\u2019t clear that local authorities could protect the incipient Congress from the mutineers. So they abandoned Philadelphia for Princeton, New Jersey.",
      "Scarred by what happened in Philadelphia, the Founders etched out a quirky \"federal district\" which didn\u2019t exist in a state. The Founders felt Pennsylvania was lax at guarding the original Congress. So developing their own \"capital city\" for Congress \u2013 with the government in control \u2013 would grant them security.",
      "The Trump administration's deployment of federal authorities into the nation's capital reinvigorates an age-old debate over its governance and jurisdiction. (Samuel Corum/Getty Images)",
      "The 1st Congress adopted the \"Residence Act.\" It established what became Washington, DC. There was a compromise that the new nation would initiate the seat of government anywhere from what is now Hagerstown, Md., to its present location. But the law gave President George Washington authority to determine the exact location. Washington\u2019s residence was along the Potomac at Mount Vernon. So they carved out a \"District of Columbia\" from territory which was otherwise part of Maryland and Virginia \u2013 on opposite sides of the Potomac River.",
      "Congress forked over the parcel of land on the \"western\" shore of the Potomac to Virginia in the 1840s. Stone markers still mark the old District of Columbia boundaries in and around Alexandria, Va.",
      "So Congress was in charge of the District of Columbia until 1973.",
      "That\u2019s when lawmakers approved the Home Rule Act for DC. DC gained a non-voting delegate to the House (similar to those from U.S. territories) a few years earlier. But now Washington, DC would feature a mayor and a city council. But under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, Congress would maintain ultimate authority over the city. The House and Senate presided as a sort of \"super city council.\"",
      "SUMMERTIME AND THE LIVING IS UNEASY ON CAPITOL HILL",
      "Lawmakers periodically infused themselves into Washington\u2019s local affairs beginning in the late 1980s \u2013 and mostly at the behest of Republicans. Congress blocked the legalization of medical marijuana in DC in 1998. The House and Senate also bigfooted a new criminal justice system for the city in 2022. That\u2019s because the local law diminished punishments for serious crimes like carjacking.",
      "Republicans won control of the House in 1994 and promptly discussed dialing back home rule for Washington, DC. Republicans made their mark by blocking a needle exchange program for drug abusers.",
      "The U.S. ratified the 23rd Amendment in 1961. That granted the city three electoral votes. However, Washington lacks a vote on the floor of the House or two votes in the Senate \u2013 even though its citizens pay federal income taxes, serve in the military and are subject to the draft. That\u2019s why the city festooned license plates with the moniker \"Taxation Without Representation\" in the 1990s.",

      "Democrats have largely championed the plight of DC. A bill to make DC a state failed in 1993, 277-153. However, the House passed a statehood bill for DC in 2020, 232-180. The bill would convert most of the present city into \"Douglass Commonwealth,\" named after abolitionist Frederick Douglass. So the city wouldn\u2019t be a state, but a \"commonwealth\" like Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky and Massachusetts.",
      "That bill would chisel out a swath of land, encompassing the Capitol, the White House, the Supreme Court, the National Mall and many federal buildings. Supporters of the legislation argued that this would be the new \"seat\" of government as prescribed by the Constitution.",

      "Note that Alaska and Hawaii entered the union virtually together as part of a compromise. One would be the \"Democratic\" state. The other would be the \"Republican\" state. Therefore, the admissions created political balance in Congress.",
      "Ironically, Alaska was supposed to be the \"Democratic\" state and Hawaii the \"Republican\" state. However, the prevailing politics of both of those states mostly flipped over the years.",
      "Moreover, it\u2019s hard to see how any plan for statehood could overcome a Senate filibuster requiring 60 yeas. That\u2019s why some progressives pushed Senate Democratic leaders to abolish the filibuster several years ago. But it was unclear if DC even had the votes to become a state when Democrats controlled a slim Senate majority.",
      "DC VIOLENCE HAS GROWN FAR MORE DEADLY, DESPITE DEMS CLAIMING 30-YEAR LOW",
      "So this brings us to present day and President Trump\u2019s use of the 1973 Home Rule Act to take over the local police department in Washington. The law says Congress must approve such action within a month. One can bet that the GOP-controlled House and Senate will consider such a measure in September. Prospective passage is always tight in the House because of the narrow majority. However, such a plan is likely subject to a filibuster in the Senate.",
      "Most Republicans are eager to follow the lead of President Trump. Moreover, Congressional Republicans would embrace the opportunity to dare Democrats to vote no on a renewal \u2013 and portray them as opposing order in the streets.",

You have different demographics in different areas. You have different population counts in different areas.\"",
      "The U.S. was rocked by violent crime waves from coast-to-coast in 2020 and the subsequent years, when the pandemic upended day-to-day life with lockdown orders and social justice protests and riots broke out in major cities nationwide. The FBI logged a nearly 30% increase in murders compared to the year prior, marking the largest single-year increase in killings since the agency began tracking the crimes.",

The data shows violent crime across the board fell by roughly 35% from 2023, when the department reported 5,345 violent crime incidents, to 2024, when it reported 3,469 violent crimes.",
      "\"Everyone should be celebrating that crime is falling,\" Snider said. \"But at the same time, we don't have the full picture: Why is crime more deadly than it once was?\"",
      "The Council on Criminal Justice study found, specifically, that Washington's lethality increased each year from 2012\u20132021, except for 2016.",
      "\"The largest single-year increase was a 57% jump from 2014 to 2015,\" the study reported. \"From 2019 to 2020, lethality increased by 22%, followed by another 14% increase in 2021. It then declined slightly in 2022 (-3%) and 2023 (-8%), before a 5% uptick in 2024. Lethality in 2020 was significantly higher than in all earlier years, except for 2019. However, lethality levels observed in 2021 through 2024 were not significantly different from those in 2020.\"",
      "The author behind the study, Council on Criminal Justice senior researcher Ernesto Lopez, explained to local media in July that \"lethality has climbed significantly\" in the nation's capital despite crime trends falling.",
      "\"We look back to 2012 lethality \u2013 again, that share of violence that ended a homicide \u2013 that increased by over 300% from 2012 to 2024, even though the homicide rate drops,\" Lopez told WTOP in July. \"So, the violent situations can be getting less frequent, but when those violent situations occur, they more likely end in a fatality than over a decade ago.\"",
      "He added that the top takeaway from the study was \"homicide and other violent crimes are declining through the first half of this year and continuing to fall below pre-pandemic levels.\"",
      "\"This is a continuing pattern of declining crime rates,\" he added. \"Even some offenses, such as motor vehicle theft, that are seeing huge spikes really throughout 2022 and 2023, are really starting to come down in many jurisdictions.\"",
      "While violence has dropped in D.C. in recent years, \"it\u2019s still at a very high level,\" Council on Criminal Justice President and CEO Adam Gelb told Fox News Digital Wednesday, when asked about recent rhetoric that crime is at a 30-year low despite lethality spiking in the city.",
      "\"There\u2019s been a large and unmistakable drop in violence in Washington over the last two years but it\u2019s still at a very high level and there are microtrends that cut against that overall positive picture,\" Gelb said. \"When pieces of the puzzle are moving in different directions, it\u2019s easy for people to pick out some of them and create an image that advances their policy and political agenda.\"",
      "National Guard troops are seen next to a Metropolitan Police car. (WTTG)",
      "Snider explained that violent crimes decreasing while lethality increases is attributable to a handful of variables, including gang-related crimes.",
      "\"D.C. is known for having gangs and crews, and I know that there have been reports of increased juvenile-related crime,\" Snider said, pointing to a surge that began in 2021 as youths committed violent carjackings. \"If you see higher gang or crew-related activity that potentially is using weapons, obviously that's where you're going to see more serious physical injury or death. So that's one of the bigger attributes also.\"",
      "WHITE HOUSE LAUNCHES FEDERAL SECURITY BLITZ AS PRESIDENT VOWS TO END DC 'CRIME PLAGUE'",
      "Other variables that can contribute to an increase in lethality are long wait times to receive emergency care, such as slow EMS response times or long hospital waits, and if a police department is understaffed.",
      "The study argued \"two interrelated developments\" on firearms likely drove the lethality in D.C., claiming \"widespread availability (of firearms) may contribute to a perceived need for self-armament, creating a feedback loop or \u2018arms race\u2019 in which people acquire guns because they believe others are armed.\"",
      "\"This dynamic appears to have real consequences: Firearms purchased in 2020 were used in more crimes than the annual average in previous years. In addition, the flow of new firearms into legal markets contributes directly to the stock of firearms in illegal markets. That is, guns that are legally obtained may eventually be illegally sold and acquired by people who may not have the right to lawfully possess a firearm,\" the study's findings reported, while adding the \"advancement of firearm technology\" that increases their \"lethal potential\" likely drove lethality.",

      "Snider added that she understands the Trump administration's rationale for federalizing the police force, but underscored the importance of having local police lead their jurisdiction as they understand the neighborhoods they patrol, the community and where crime lurks. Snider argued the administration should consider delivering federal funds to bolster local police departments' abilities to recruit and retain officers.",

But after the surge is over and after this National Guard deployment has withdrawn, what does that leave the MPD with?\""

Vance briefly joked to reporters that the \"one strain on the special relationship\" he has with Lammy \"is that all of my kids caught a fish, but the foreign secretary did not.\" The vice president soon delved into more serious topics, including telling reporters that, unlike the U.K., the United States has \"no plans to recognize a Palestinian state\" given the \"lack of a functional government\" in Gaza.",

Microsoft Edge also includes strong phishing defenses through its SmartScreen filter. Make sure features like Enhanced Safe Browsing or SmartScreen are turned on. These tools detect threats before you click, giving you a critical layer of defense.",
      "Password managers don't just store your logins; they can also alert you when a site looks suspicious. If your manager won't autofill a password on a CAPTCHA screen or login page, that's a red flag. It usually means the site isn't recognized as legitimate.

It's smarter, faster, and harder to detect. And unless we understand how it spreads, it will only grow. Security now means thinking twice about the everyday. Even a CAPTCHA.",

      "How TrueLimb sets itself apart from other bionic arms",
      "TrueLimb is a full-arm prosthetic solution designed to feel more like an extension of the body than a mechanical device. Each arm is personalized to match the user's opposing limb, down to fingertip size and skin tone. A wide range of color options are available, including natural shades, jet black and metallic silver.",
      "Instead of relying on standard sizes, TrueLimb is custom-built using a remote 3D scanning system. This digital process eliminates the need for in-person fittings and allows for precise, individualized design. The socket is breathable, adjustable and crafted for all-day wear. A built-in BOA dial lets users fine-tune the fit with ease. At just 1.0 to 1.5 pounds from socket to fingertip, the prosthetic remains lightweight and comfortable.",
      "TrueLimb, a 3D-printed prosthetic\u00a0 (Unlimited Tomorrow)",
      "Smart sensors power intuitive, muscle-based control",
      "TrueLimb features TrueSense technology, which includes over 30 topographical sensors embedded within the socket. These sensors detect subtle muscle movements on the residual limb, delivering accurate and responsive control, even when the limb is covered or sweating.",
      "While often referred to as \"mind-controlled,\" TrueLimb does not read brain signals directly. Instead, it uses advanced sensors to pick up electrical activity from muscles in the residual limb. These signals reflect the user\u2019s intended movements, allowing the prosthetic to respond in real time, creating a seamless, intuitive experience that feels like second nature.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The system adapts automatically by identifying the most active myo sites, deactivating less useful sensors and fine-tuning responsiveness based on the user's signal strength. This ensures consistent performance, even if muscle activity changes over time.",
      "The prosthetic includes six intuitive grip patterns to support a wide range of daily activities. Independent finger joints allow the hand to wrap around objects naturally, offering both strength and flexibility. The device is precise enough to handle delicate tasks, such as lifting an egg without cracking it.",
      "TrueLimb, a 3D-printed prosthetic\u00a0 (Unlimited Tomorrow)",
      "Feel touch again with haptic feedback technology",
      "Beyond movement, TrueLimb gives the user back a sense of touch. Gentle vibrations provide feedback when the prosthetic hand makes contact with objects. This helps users operate the device without always needing to look down, making actions more fluid and natural. The thumb is manually opposable, giving the user better control over grip force and object handling. Whether opening a bottle or holding a pen, the motion feels smooth and confident.",
      "Built for daily life with durable, lightweight materials",
      "TrueLimb is made with PA12 nylon, a highly durable material used in industrial-grade applications. The entire arm is built to withstand daily life. It's splash-resistant, heat-resistant, stain-resistant and tough enough to handle impact or abrasion. Thanks to its rubberized palm and coated fingertips, the hand maintains a firm grip on smooth or slippery surfaces. And with bionic strength, it can lift objects up to 15 pounds with ease.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Fast charging and multi-day battery life",
      "Power won't hold the user back. TrueLimb uses a USB-C charger, the same kind used for most phones and laptops, so no special adapter is needed. A high-capacity 5600mAh battery provides multi-day life, giving freedom to move without frequent recharges. The device also receives over-the-air software updates, so performance improves over time without needing to return the device. Behind the scenes, analytics tools help optimize each arm's performance based on how it's being used.",
      "How TrueLimb is designed and delivered from home",
      "One of the most innovative parts of the TrueLimb process is how it reaches users. Everything happens remotely. Users receive a 3D scanner in the mail to capture the shape of their limb. The data goes directly to the Unlimited Tomorrow team, which builds the prosthetic in-house. This approach eliminates middlemen and dramatically speeds up delivery. Users typically receive their completed prosthetic within weeks.",
      "TrueLimb is pictured in the box in which it was delivered. (Unlimited Tomorrow)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you or a loved one needs a prosthetic arm, this technology changes everything. You no longer need to wait months, file insurance claims or attend repeated fittings. With TrueLimb, you get a high-tech, customized solution faster and at a lower cost. You also gain full control and comfort. The sensors respond to your muscle signals without any lag. The arm fits your body, looks natural and feels like part of you.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Unlimited Tomorrow is revolutionizing prosthetics with TrueLimb. This device combines 3D printing, smart sensors and remote support to deliver a user-friendly solution. It's lightweight, strong, affordable and customizable. Most importantly, it brings freedom and functionality back to people who need it. TrueLimb proves that cutting-edge technology can be both personal and practical.",

      "A man checking his emails on his laptop.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why these retirement scams feel so real",
      "Scammers now buy your personal data from data brokers to craft convincing offers. If you're in your 50s or 60s, you're a prime target. They know your age, homeownership status, estimated net worth and even retirement timeline. They don't guess, they know. Your information is being sold across hundreds of websites, and thousands of people can access it. Curious about how exposed you are?",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "What is a \"pre-qualified\" retirement scam?",
      "These scams mimic real communications from financial institutions. You might get a letter or call claiming you're approved for a new investment or annuity opportunity. Scammers often use financial buzzwords like \"IRA consolidation\" or \"required minimum distribution guidance.\" The goal? To make you feel like you're dealing with a trusted expert. They create fake advisor profiles, complete with headshots, license numbers and U.S. contact info. Many even add logos or branding from familiar banks to boost credibility. But once you respond, they'll ask for private financial info or, worse, get you to transfer funds directly into their accounts.",
      "A woman typing on her laptop and taking notes in her notebook. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why older adults are prime targets",

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "How scammers get your data",
      "These scams are fueled by data purchased from brokers. These companies gather your details, compile profiles and sell them, often without your knowledge. You could appear on lists labeled \"Retirees with $250k+ Net Worth\" or \"Homeowners Nearing Retirement.\" It's disturbingly precise. Some brokers scrape public records, while others buy data from loyalty cards, surveys or sweepstakes. Bottom line: this happens quietly, behind your back.",
      "The financial toll of these scams",
      "In 2024, the FBI reported that seniors lost over $4.8 billion to scams, a record high. Retirement-related fraud was a major part of that. Once your money is gone, it's usually gone for good. Even if the scammer misled you, your bank may not cover the loss if you authorized the transaction. These scams drain more than just savings. They create lasting stress, fear and shame.

      "Samsung Galaxy tablets are capable of storing everything from passwords and payment methods to sensitive documents. They can even act as authentication devices for logging into other accounts. That makes them valuable, not just to you, but to hackers looking for a way in.",
      "Unlike Apple devices, Galaxy tablets run on Android, which is known for its flexibility and open-source ecosystem. While this gives users more freedom, it also opens the door to greater risk. Third-party apps, less strict app store screening and inconsistent update habits across devices can leave Galaxy tablets exposed to malware and data theft. In short, the more essential your tablet becomes in your daily life, the more attractive it becomes to cybercriminals.",

    "summary": "Ghislaine Maxwell&apos;s attorney David Oscar Markus has used an increase in attention on Jeffrey Epstein&apos;s case to try pushing for an early release from prison.",
    "story": [
      "Criminal defense attorney Mark Eiglarsh, who's a friend of Markus, says Maxwell's attorney \"does not shy away from a challenge.\"",
      "Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2021, but her attorney is lobbying to secure an early release.",
      "Who is the man representing Maxwell?",
      "David Oscar Markus has been Maxwell's attorney dating back to her trial in 2021, when she was sentenced to 20 years in prison for her role in a scheme to sexually exploit and abuse young girls with Epstein. Markus has continued to represent Maxwell and was involved in interviews between the Department of Justice and Maxwell, which took place in late-July over a two-day period.",
      "Following the interviews, Maxwell was transferred from a federal prison facility in Tallahassee, Florida, to a Federal Prison camp in Bryan, Texas. Neither the Department of Justice nor Maxwell's attorney explained why she was transferred.",
      "Markus previously told Fox News Digital that \"people shouldn't be so quick to judge and throw stones\" after Maxwell's move to a minimum security prison camp.",

      "\"I love what I do,\" Markus said during the interview. \"I love representing the underdog. You know, being a criminal defense lawyer isn't for everybody, but it is one of the most rewarding and great jobs there is, and I really enjoy what I do. So, you know, this case, as all my cases, is an honor to be able to help somebody.\"",
      "While Markus has represented Maxwell going back to 2021, he has also represented other high-profile defendants, including politicians and athletes.",
      "Markus represented former NBA star Dwight Howard, who was being investigated for alleged child abuse. According to ESPN, Howard was investigated after an incident where he allegedly hit his own child with a belt.",
      "The former basketball player told authorities he was disciplined in a similar way growing up. While police in Florida and Georgia investigated the incident, no charges were filed.",
      "Former Florida Democrat gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum was also among Markus' clients, turning to the lawyer when he was facing corruption charges. Federal prosecutors alleged the former Tallahassee mayor took illegal gifts and picketed campaign money.",
      "Federal prosecutors dismissed the corruption charges after Gillum was acquitted on one count, with the jury hung on the remaining charges.",
      "Markus also represented Tom Grady, a Naples, Florida-based attorney who was accused of obstructing waters in the Florida Keys, according to Naples News.",
      "In January 2014, Grady filed applications with state agencies to build a dock and two boat lifts, but the U.S. government claimed federal permits were necessary.",
      "Prosecutors alleged the dock and two boat lifts violated the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, which barred any bridge or dam from being built over some navigable waters. A jury in 2021 found him not guilty of the violations.",
      "As Epstein's death and previous criminal cases were brought back into the spotlight, Markus has made an effort to get Maxwell out of jail.",
      "Maxwell in late July filed a brief with the Supreme Court asking justices to consider her appeal, which seeks a ruling on Jeffrey Epstein's non-prosecution agreement signed in 2007. The agreement states that \"the United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein.\"",
      "Maxwell argued that the agreement would have prevented federal prosecution in New York.",

      "Markus has also, so far, successfully prevented the disclosure of grand jury transcripts in Maxwell's sex trafficking case.",
      "\"Jeffrey Epstein is dead. Ghislaine Maxwell is not,\" her attorney wrote. \"Whatever interest the public may have in Epstein, that interest cannot justify a broad intrusion into grand jury secrecy in a case where the defendant is alive, her legal options are viable, and her due process rights remain.\"",
      "A federal judge on Monday denied the Department of Justice's request to release the grand jury material, stating the documents do not contain \"significant, undisclosed information about [their] crimes, or the investigation into them.\"",

He seems to understand what many high-profile lawyers don't, and that is his ego is not his amigo,\" Eiglarsh said. \"He does not shy away from a challenge. And boy, does he have a challenge here. Getting the Supreme Court to take this case at all is going to be extremely challenging. But then to zealously argue and effectively get them to embrace this case and his point of view, he's probably one of the only of few attorneys who could ever pull that off.\"",

    "story": [
      "In the end, President Donald Trump's offer was one that Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser could not refuse.",
      "In mobilizing the D.C. National Guard, pressing federal agents into urban law enforcement and taking control of the Metropolitan Police Department \u2014 all in the name of fighting violent crime in the nation's capital \u2014 Trump invited Bowser to cooperate with his administration.",
      "The law, federal money and a long-standing threat to repeal self-government in the city lined up behind him, giving Bowser, who one former aide described as having a rare ability to \"remove emotion\" from political and policy calculations, little choice but to comply.",
      "\"What I\u2019m focused on is the federal surge and how to make the most of the additional officer support that we have,\" Bowser told reporters after a Tuesday meeting with Attorney General Pam Bondi.",
      "That's not to say Bowser is thrilled with the position she finds herself in, effectively handing over law enforcement in her city to a president with whom she has had a complicated relationship since his first term. During a videoconference with Washington, D.C., community leaders Tuesday evening, Bowser described Trump's maneuvers as an \"authoritarian push.\"",
      "But on the whole, her response has been far more measured than those of Democrats \u2014 both in the D.C. area and nationally \u2014 who, less encumbered by practical consequences of a fight with the president, have repeatedly and forcefully hammered Trump\u2019s move and him.",
      "\"The Trump administration has consistently broken the law and violated the Constitution to further the personal and political agenda of a wannabe king,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said in a statement Monday. \"We stand with the residents of the District of Columbia and reject this unjustified power grab as illegitimate.\"",
      "In a Monday news conference announcing his assertion of power through an executive order, Trump called Bowser \"a good person who has tried,\" adding that he acted because \"she has been given many chances.\"",
      "As Bowser noted during a Monday news conference, the city and federal agencies have a long history of working together to plan, execute and protect special events in the city, including during both of Trump's terms. The two are also largely aligned on the goal of bringing the Washington Commanders back to the city from the Maryland suburbs, and Bowser attended a White House news conference on the topic in May.",
      "But Bowser criticized Trump in the summer of 2020 when he deployed federal law enforcement officers in the nation's capital and activated the D.C. National Guard to combat protests against police violence. Those forces, including the U.S. Park Police, were used to violently break up a peaceful demonstration outside Lafayette Square, just steps from the White House, clearing a path for Trump to walk to a nearby church to address the news media.",
      "In a letter to Trump in June 2020, before officers on horseback drove demonstrators away from the park, Bowser accused him of \"inflaming\" and \"adding to the grievances\" of protesters, creating a more dangerous dynamic.",
      "In order to push federal agents and guardsmen into the streets, Trump declared an emergency in Washington, D.C., even as violent crime rates in the city have been falling.",
      "Bowser is at a disadvantage at a time when her administration is fighting to get Congress and Trump to reverse course on a law enacted this year that froze $1 billion in city money. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in May that he would move \"as quickly as possible\" to fix what some Republicans said was a mistake in the drafting of the law. The Senate passed a change earlier this year, but the House, which is out of session for its August recess, has made no move toward sending it to the president for his signature.",
      "Beyond that, federal law plainly gives the president the power to assume control of Washington's Metropolitan Police Department for up to 30 days at a time when he declares an emergency, as he did this week, and to activate the D.C. National Guard.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that roughly 850 federal law enforcement officers and agents fanned out across the city Monday night and made 23 arrests on charges ranging from homicide and drug crimes to skipping out on a fare and reckless driving.",
      "Leavitt did not reply to a request for comment on Trump's relationship with Bowser, nor did city spokesperson Susana Castillo.",
      "Justin Bibb, the mayor of Cleveland and president of the Democratic Mayors Association, said in an interview with NBC News that municipal leaders across the country are watching what's happening in Washington \u2014 on the heels of Trump activating the California National Guard to assist with immigration enforcement in Los Angeles \u2014 with wary eyes.",
      "\"Absolutely, we're concerned about it,\" he said. \"I want to be very crystal clear about something: We do not want the National Guard in our cities.\u201d",
      "Bibb also defended Bowser's handling of Trump's crackdown this week, pointing to the unusual situation Bowser finds herself in compared to leaders of other major cities.",
      "\u201cShe understands and recognizes that she\u2019s in a unique position where there\u2019s no real statehood in D.C., and her autonomy can be limited, but at the end of the day, she\u2019s going to continue to do the job she\u2019s been doing on reducing violent crime, with or without the support of Donald Trump,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump has publicly mused about returning the limited powers of Washington's local government to federal control. Since 1973, the city has operated under a \"home rule\" charter granted by Congress that allows for residents to elect a mayor and city council. But ultimately, the Constitution gives Congress authority to determine the laws of the nation's capital. Though residents of Washington, D.C., pay federal taxes, the city does not have voting representation in Congress.",
      "Declining to directly criticize Trump, Bowser nodded to the city's subservient position during her Monday news conference.",
      "\"He has prerogatives in D.C. unlike anywhere else in the country,\" she said of Trump. \"There are things that, when a city is not a state and not fully autonomous and doesn't have senators, that the federal government can do.\""

    "story": [
      "Taylor Swift got teary during a sit-down with boyfriend and Kansas City Chief Travis Kelce and his brother, retired Philadelphia Eagle Jason Kelce, as she discussed getting the master recordings for her music earlier this year.",
      "The emotional moment came on the brothers' podcast, \"New Heights\" Wednesday night, during which the couple discussed the start of their relationship and Swift also divulged new details about her upcoming album \u2014 her 12th.",
      "The podcast started the same moment an announcement appeared on Swift's website to reveal the cover for \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" along with four \"variants\" or deluxe versions of the album.",
      "The podcast conversation was limited to music, however, the couple (and his brother) covered a range of topics, everything from Swift's newfound love of football, an obsession for baking sourdough loaves, watching otter videos, her parents' health and the start of the superstars' relationship.",
      "A 'wild, romantic gesture'",
      "Travis Kelce's side of the story has been widely reported: He attended the Eras Tour in Kansas City with a friendship bracelet with his number on it. While he didn't get it into Swift's hands that night, a proclamation of his interest after the fact on an episode of \"New Heights\" apparently alerted Swift of his affection. The rest was history.",
      "Swift's point of view was divulged for the first time on the pod, describing what Travis Kelce did as a \"wild, romantic gesture.\" She said she was making her first podcast appearance only because \"New Heights\" \"got me a boyfriend\" after Travis Kelce made it \"his personal dating app.\"",
      "While Swift admits Travis Kelce's verve was a bit crazy, she said they got to know each other in a very natural way and that he often made her laugh.",
      "\"This is sort of what I've been writing songs about wanting to happen to me since I was a teenager,\" Swift said of the wooing.",
      "She said he's taught her all of the ins and outs of football, a world she was previously not immersed in, but that she now follows closely.",
      "The couple also addressed the media attention their relationship has attracted, with Travis Kelce admitting that Swift is the professional when brushing off the negative attention. Swift went so far as to admit, \"it's hard to hurt my feelings at this point.\"",
      "\"My name can be in the actual headline and it can still be none of my business,\" Swift explained of blocking out the noise. \"You should think of your energy as if it's expensive, as if it\u2019s like a luxury item. Not everyone can afford it.\"",
      "Tears when Swift reclaimed master recordings",
      "Swift described the moment she and Travis Kelce found out she would get the opportunity to buy her master recordings from Shamrock Capital, tears in her eyes as she remembered the moment just months ago.",
      "She said she heard from her mom and \"very dramatically hit the floor\" and started crying. She tried to collect herself to tell her boyfriend in \"a normal way,\" but instead broke down in sobs.",
      "\"I'm just so happy for you, because I've seen how you make music ...  I know how much it burned you that you didn't have that, and you didn't have your creation,\" Travis Kelce said, adding that he too found the moment emotional.",
      "Swift discussed her re-recorded albums, four of which were released before she claimed her work as her own, halting the process, and noted how she was repeatedly told that the idea was a bad one. Instead, she followed her heart and connected with her fans, who she said propelled her desire to continue the project after they so lovingly received the first, \"Fearless (Taylor's Version).\"",
      "Swift said \"Red (Taylor's Version)\" \"was very special,\" and admitted she thinks her vocals are better on some of the re-recorded tracks than on the original.",
      "On the Eras Tour",
      "Jason Kelce made sure to give proper attention to Swift's behemoth Eras Tour, which Swift said she misses but admitted \"it feels great\" that it's over.",
      "During the more than 100 shows, she said she and Travis Kelce traded physical therapy notes.",
      "\"I've never played for crowds that were more committed,\" Swift said, noting how the fans made the music an \"event,\" something she strives to do.",
      "She said seeing the bonding between generations at the tour was \"the most incredible feeling in the world,\" and one of her favorite parts of it.",
      "\"I can see all that, I have LASIK,\" the pop singer quipped.",
      "She called the moment Travis Kelce joined her on stage at the Eras Tour \"so special,\" a moment Jason Kelce called his favorite.",
      "\"I was serious in terrifying fashion,\" Travis Kelce said of his commitment to the role.",
      "Swift's still hiding Easter eggs",
      "Swift wants to make something clear: She loves to hide Easter eggs, but they always lead back to music, never her personal life.",
      "For example, she said she dropped a bunch of \"lyrical Easter eggs\" in the speech she gave upon receiving an honorary doctorate from NYU. When her next album, \"Midnights,\" came out, she said her fans were quick to realize \"the whole speech was an Easter egg.\"",
      "Announcing 'The Life of a Showgirl'",
      "Monday threw the Swiftie fandom into a frenzy, when, minutes apart, both \"New Heights\" and Taylor Nation, a social media account affiliated with Swift's team, seemed to hint at major pending news.",
      "It started with a social media post from \"New Heights\" teasing a new episode with a major guest. In the promo image, Jason Kelce wore a shirt with Swift's face on it, and fans insisted a silhouette of said guest resembled Swift.",
      "On Monday night, a countdown to 12:12 a.m. Aug. 12 began on Swift's website, and later, \"New Heights\" confirmed the guest rumors, posting a video clip of Swift recording the podcast with the Kelces.",
      "\"We're about to do a f---ing podcast,\" Swift exclaims in the video.",
      "Finally, at 12:12 a.m. Tuesday, when the countdown was up, \"New Heights\" posted another snippet of Swift showing the brothers her new album, \"The Life of a Showgirl.\"",
      "\"Life of a Showgirl\" will be Swift's first release of 2025 and her first since the Eras tour wrapped last year."

    "summary": "Three children, including a 4-year-old boy with stage-four kidney cancer, were swept up by ICE authorities and sent to Honduras, despite being American citizens.",
    "story": [
      "Despite being American citizens, three children \u2014 a 4-year-old boy with Stage 4 kidney cancer, his 7-year-old sister and a 2-year-old girl \u2014 were swept up along with their families by immigration authorities in Louisiana and quickly sent to Honduras, according to a lawsuit filed on behalf of the families.",
      "The suit alleges that despite the government\u2019s own directives, the parents \u201cwere never given a choice as to whether their children should be deported with them and were prohibited from contacting their counsel or having meaningful contact with their families to arrange for the care of their children.\u201d The mothers, named in the suit as Rosario and Julia, allege they wanted their children to remain in the U.S.",
      "Instead, the families were \u201cillegally deported without even a semblance of due process,\u201d the lawsuit states.",
      "Romeo, as the now 5-year-old is identified in the lawsuit, was diagnosed with a \u201crare and aggressive form of kidney cancer,\u201d at age 2. He immediately began receiving ongoing \u201ccritical, life-saving medical treatment\u201d in the U.S., according to the lawsuit, which was filed by immigrant advocacy group National Immigration Project and three law firms.",
      "\u201cThe failure to allow his mother to arrange for his care, in violation of ICE\u2019s own directive, and his unlawful deportation to Honduras interfered with his needed medical treatment,\u201d the suit said.",
      "The suit was filed on behalf of the two mothers and their children in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana on July 31. The plaintiffs\u2019 names in the lawsuit are pseudonyms to protect their identities and safety, attorneys said. The case against the federal government is in its early stages, and plaintiffs are seeking a jury trial and damages, and for their arrests and removals to be found unlawful and to be returned to the United States.",
      "\u201cThis is emblematic of what happens when the administration is laser-focused on deportation, that when the end result is all that matters, you are going to end up with wrongful and unlawful deportations,\u201d Stephanie Alvarez-Jones, an attorney with the National Immigration Project, told NBC News.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that U.S. children were not being \u201cdeported\u201d and denied that the parents were not given a choice regarding the care of their children before being sent to Honduras.",
      "\u201cRather than separate their families, ICE asked the mothers if they wanted to be removed with their children or if they wanted ICE to place the children with someone safe the parent designates,\u201d Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said. \u201cThe parents in this instance made the determination to take their children with them back to Honduras.\u201d",
      "McLaughlin said that when there is \u201can underlying health issue, ICE makes sure that treatment is available in the country to which the illegal alien is being removed. The implication that ICE would deny a child the medical care they need is flatly FALSE, and it is an insult to the men and women of federal law enforcement.\u201d",
      "NBC News has previously reported on U.S. citizen children being sent with their deported immigrant parents to other countries, including a 10-year-old girl recovering from a rare brain tumor sent to Mexico.",
      "Rosario and Julia and their children were put on a plane to Honduras on April 25 after being detained at immigration check-in appointments where they were told to bring their U.S. citizen children and their passports, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Both women had settled in the U.S. some years ago, the lawsuit states. Rosario came to the U.S. in 2013 as a 13-year-old unaccompanied minor. She gave birth to her first child, Ruby, in 2018 in New Orleans, and her second child, Romeo, in 2020.",
      "In the lawsuit, Rosario claims she didn\u2019t know an immigration case against her was playing out while she was in the U.S. She said she only found out she had a removal order dating back 10 years after she was taken into ICE custody during a traffic stop in February.",
      "The mother of two was given an ankle monitor and had check-ins with ICE both at her home and at their local office, the suit states.",
      "On April 24, Rosario showed up at her immigration check-in with her attorney and children, along with their passports, per ICE\u2019s instructions. At the appointment, Rosario and her children were taken to a back room without their attorney and told they would be deported, according to the lawsuit.",
      "ICE allegedly asked Rosario to sign a document without telling her what it was and Rosario refused. Agents allegedly dismissed her pleas to speak with her attorney about Romeo\u2019s condition.",
      "Her attorney then learned that the family had been transferred to a facility in Alexandria, Louisiana, three hours away. The attorney filed a stay of removal for Rosario\u2019s family that included evidence of Romeo\u2019s Stage 4 cancer diagnosis.",
      "The family was boarded on a plane the next day.",
      "According to the lawsuit, Rosario \u201cexplicitly opposed her U.S. citizen children\u2019s deportation and had never provided consent for such action. Indeed, given Romeo\u2019s cancer and specialized medical needs, Rosario wanted both of her U.S. citizen children to remain in the United States.\u201d",
      "Like Rosario, Julia was also denied access to an attorney when she and her children were detained by ICE and deported, the lawsuit states.",
      "Julia first arrived at the U.S. border in 2019 fleeing Honduras, after her daughter Janelle was kidnapped there, according to the details in the lawsuit. After applying for asylum, they were forced to wait in Mexico at the time under Trump\u2019s \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy. They said in the lawsuit they were kidnapped in Mexico before they were able to return to the U.S. in August 2021.",
      "Her daughter Jade was born in Louisiana in 2023.",
      "Julia was told in February 2025 to begin bringing both of her daughters to her regular ICE check-ins, the lawsuit states.",
      "On April 22, Julia, who was now pregnant, attended a check-in with her daughters as her partner waited outside. She said she was told her family was being transferred to Alexandria and that a judge would determine their fate in the U.S., according to the lawsuit. Her partner alleges he was told his family was transferred hours later and he was not given time to speak to Julia.",
      "Later that night, Julia was told she would be deported along with her children.",
      "Her attorney was allegedly told by ICE that Jacob, Julia\u2019s partner and also an immigrant, would be detained as well if he attempted to pick up his daughter Jade, who is a U.S. citizen.",
      "While Jacob and the family attorney fought to temporarily stop the removal of Julia and her children, an ICE officer allegedly told Julia to write on a piece of paper that her daughter Jade would be going with her to Honduras.",
      "\u201cWhen Julia objected, the officer threatened Julia that Jade would be immediately sent to a foster home in the United States if Julia did not write a note stating that Jade would be deported to Honduras with her,\u201d the lawsuit states, adding that Julia did as instructed under duress.",
      "\u201cAt no point was Julia provided an opportunity to arrange for care of her U.S. citizen daughter Jade in the United States.\u201d",
      "DHS said in its statement to NBC News that it \u201ctakes its responsibility to protect children seriously and will continue to work with federal law enforcement to ensure that children are safe and protected.\u201d The agency said parents \u201ccan take control of their departure\u201d by self-deporting.",
      "Julia and her children were sent to Honduras on April 25 on the same plane as Rosario\u2019s family.",
      "Rosario said in a statement that in Honduras she lacks the resources to care for her children the way they need.",
      "\u201cSince returning, my daughter has gotten sick and struggled with anxiety, and I\u2019ve been struggling with my own health issues too,\u201d she said.",
      "Julia said in a statement she thought she and her children were going to a regular appointment, but she was lied to. \u201cI never imagined they would send me and my children to Honduras,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cReturning to Honduras has meant leaving my husband behind, and that\u2019s been very hard,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were deprived of the opportunity to be and make decisions as a family.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A federal judge has ordered Ohio State University to resolve via mediation the remaining lawsuits filed by former students who claim it failed to protect them from a sexual predator on the school payroll.",
      "U.S. District Judge Michael H. Watson issued the order Monday as the university still faces five active lawsuits from 236 men alleging that Dr. Richard Strauss molested them, mostly under the guise of giving physicals.",
      "\u201cThe Ohio State University portrays itself as a different university today than it was when Dr. Richard Strauss abused hundreds of young men \u2014 for decades \u2014 as its employee,\u201d Watson, of the Southern District of Ohio, wrote. \u201cYet it is today\u2019s Ohio State that must reckon with the consequences of that ugly past in these cases.\u201d",
      "If the case went to trial and the accusers won, it would be a \u201cpyrrhic\u201d victory, Watson wrote.",
      "\u201cThe best way for plaintiffs to close this horrific chapter of their lives and for Ohio State to move forward as a respectable institution of higher education, is through a mutual resolution short of a trial,\u201d the judge wrote.",
      "Watson, in his order, referred the cases to Layn Phillips, a former Oklahoma federal judge who mediated the lawsuits filed against Michigan State by some 200 women athletes who were sexually abused by sports doctor Larry Nassar.",
      "Michigan State paid Nassar sex abuse survivors $500 million, which is believed to be the largest settlement ever in a sexual misconduct case involving a university.",
      "\u201cHe got Michigan State to pay the victims millions in settlement money. So we see this as a big win for us,\u201d one of the OSU plaintiffs, who asked not to be identified to avoid angering Watson, told NBC News.",
      "Phillips will be working alongside fellow mediators Catherine Geyer and Michelle Yoshida, as well as law clerk Caroline Kedeshian, Watson\u2019s order states.",
      "Watson also gave both sides a deadline of Feb. 27, 2026 to provide the court with a progress report \u201cat which point the Court will consider whether additional mediation would be productive.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, lawyers for OSU and the plaintiffs will be allowed to continue taking depositions from witnesses.",
      "Among those who have already been deposed are Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who was the assistant wrestling coach at the university from 1986 to 1994 before he got into politics, four plaintiffs in lawsuits against the university told NBC News last month.",
      "Jordan has repeatedly and publicly denied any knowledge that Strauss was preying on athletes. He was deposed about a month after the release of an HBO Max documentary about the Strauss scandal called \u201cSurviving Ohio State,\u201d in which one of the wrestlers he once coached called him a liar. Jordan is not a defendant, but he is referred to in some of the lawsuits alleging he was aware of the abuse.",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Watson\u2019s ruling. A spokesperson for Ohio State, Benjamin Johnson, also declined to comment, saying via email, \u201cWe don\u2019t typically comment on pending litigation.\"",
      "Ohio State found itself under fire in 2018 after a whistleblowing former wrestler named Mike DiSabato went public with allegations that Strauss had sexually abused him and hundreds of other athletes and that the school knew about it but did nothing to stop him.",
      "Strauss preyed on hundreds of men from the mid-1970s to the late 1990s. He died by suicide in 2005.",
      "An independent investigation sponsored by Ohio State and conducted by the Perkins Coie law firm concluded in May 2019 that Strauss sexually abused at least 177 male athletes and students and that coaches and administrators knew about it for two decades but failed to stop him.",
      "Since the release of the report, OSU has said it has paid out $60 million in settlement money and its former president has publicly apologized \u201cto each person who endured\u201d abuse at the hands of Strauss. But it has balked at settling the remaining lawsuits.",
      "CORRECTION (Aug. 13, 2025, 5:35 p.m. ET): An earlier version of this article misspelled Larry Nassar\u2019s last name. It is Nassar, not Nasser."

      "As people turn to chatbots for increasingly important and intimate advice, some interactions playing out in public are causing alarm over just how much artificial intelligence can warp a user\u2019s sense of reality.",
      "One woman\u2019s saga about falling for her psychiatrist, which she documented in dozens of videos on TikTok, has generated concerns from viewers who say she relied on AI chatbots to reinforce her claims that he manipulated her into developing romantic feelings.",
      "Last month, a prominent OpenAI investor garnered a similar response from people who worried the venture capitalist was going through a potential AI-induced mental health crisis after he claimed on X to be the target of \u201ca nongovernmental system.\u201d",
      "And earlier this year, a thread in a ChatGPT subreddit gained traction after a user sought guidance from the community, claiming their partner was convinced the chatbot \u201cgives him the answers to the universe.\u201d",
      "Their experiences have roused growing awareness about how AI chatbots can influence people\u2019s perceptions and otherwise impact their mental health, especially as such bots have become notorious for their people-pleasing tendencies.",
      "It\u2019s something they are now on the watch for, some mental health professionals say.",
      "Dr. S\u00f8ren Dinesen \u00d8stergaard, a Danish psychiatrist who heads the research unit at the department of affective disorders at Aarhus University Hospital, predicted two years ago that chatbots \u201cmight trigger delusions in individuals prone to psychosis.\u201d In a new paper, published this month, he wrote that interest in his research has only grown since then, with \u201cchatbot users, their worried family members and journalists\u201d sharing their personal stories.",
      "Those who reached out to him \u201cdescribed situations where users\u2019 interactions with chatbots seemed to spark or bolster delusional ideation,\u201d \u00d8stergaard wrote. \u201c... Consistently, the chatbots seemed to interact with the users in ways that aligned with, or intensified, prior unusual ideas or false beliefs \u2014 leading the users further out on these tangents, not rarely resulting in what, based on the descriptions, seemed to be outright delusions.\u201d",
      "Kevin Caridad, CEO of the Cognitive Behavior Institute, a Pittsburgh-based mental health provider, said chatter about the phenomenon \u201cdoes seem to be increasing.\u201d",
      "\u201cFrom a mental health provider, when you look at AI and the use of AI, it can be very validating,\u201d he said. \u201cYou come up with an idea, and it uses terms to be very supportive. It\u2019s programmed to align with the person, not necessarily challenge them.\u201d",
      "The concern is already top of mind for some AI companies struggling to navigate the growing dependency some users have on their chatbots.",
      "In April, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company had tweaked the model that powers ChatGPT because it had become too inclined to tell users what they want to hear.",
      "In his paper, \u00d8stergaard wrote that he believes the \u201cspike in the focus on potential chatbot-fuelled delusions is likely not random, as it coincided with the April 25th 2025 update to the GPT-4o model.\u201d",
      "When OpenAI removed access to its GPT-4o model last week \u2014 swapping it for the newly released, less sycophantic GPT-5 \u2014 some users described the new model\u2019s conversations as too \u201csterile\u201d and said they missed the \u201cdeep, human-feeling conversations\u201d they had with GPT-4o.",
      "Within a day of the backlash, OpenAI restored paid users\u2019 access to GPT-4o. Altman followed up with a lengthy X post Sunday that addressed \u201chow much of an attachment some people have to specific AI models.\u201d",
      "Representatives for OpenAI did not provide comment.",
      "Other companies have also tried to combat the issue. Anthropic conducted a study in 2023 that revealed sycophantic tendencies in versions of AI assistants, including its own chatbot Claude.",
      "Like OpenAI, Anthropic has tried to integrate anti-sycophancy guardrails in recent years, including system card instructions that explicitly warn Claude against reinforcing \u201cmania, psychosis, dissociation, or loss of attachment with reality.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Anthropic said the company\u2019s \u201cpriority is providing a safe, responsible experience for every user.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor users experiencing mental health issues, Claude is instructed to recognize these patterns and avoid reinforcing them,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe\u2019re aware of rare instances where the model\u2019s responses diverge from our intended design, and are actively working to better understand and address this behavior.\u201d",
      "For Kendra Hilty, the TikTok user who says she developed feelings for a psychiatrist she began seeing four years ago, her chatbots are like confidants.",
      "In one of her livestreams, Hilty told her chatbot, whom she named \u201cHenry,\u201d that \u201cpeople are worried about me relying on AI.\u201d The chatbot then responded to her, \u201cIt\u2019s fair to be curious about that. What I\u2019d say is, \u2018Kendra doesn\u2019t rely on AI to tell her what to think. She uses it as a sounding board, a mirror, a place to process in real time.\u2019\u201d",
      "Still, many on TikTok \u2014 who have commented on Hilty\u2019s videos or posted their own video takes \u2014 said they believe that her chatbots were only encouraging what they viewed as Hilty misreading the situation with her psychiatrist. Hilty has suggested several times that her psychiatrist reciprocated her feelings, with her chatbots offering her words that appear to validate that assertion. (NBC News has not independently verified Hilty\u2019s account).",
      "But Hilty continues to shrug off concerns from commenters, some who have gone as far as labeling her \u201cdelusional.\u201d",
      "\u201cI do my best to keep my bots in check,\u201d Hilty told NBC News in an email Monday, when asked about viewer reactions to her use of the AI tools. \u201cFor instance, I understand when they are hallucinating and make sure to acknowledge it. I am also constantly asking them to play devil\u2019s advocate and show me where my blind spots are in any situation. I am a deep user of Language Learning Models because it\u2019s a tool that is changing my and everyone\u2019s humanity, and I am so grateful.\u201d"

      "Antoni is on the west side of the Capitol in one video, archived from the social media website Parler, and appears in surveillance footage posted online by the Republican-led Committee on House Administration Subcommittee on Oversight.",
      "Reached by NBC News on Tuesday, Antoni declined to comment. A White House official said Wednesday that Antoni was in Washington on Jan. 6 for in-person meetings with his then-employer at an office blocks away from the Capitol, and that he did not cross any barricades or participate in any demonstrations. The footage does not show Antoni crossing barricades or demonstrating."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0President Donald Trump told European leaders during a call on Wednesday that he does not intend to discuss any possible divisions of territory when he meets with  Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska this week, according to two European officials and three other people briefed on the call.",
      "Trump said on the call, which also included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, that he is going into the meeting with Putin with the goal of securing a ceasefire in Ukraine, those sources said.",
      "Trump and European leaders agreed that a ceasefire in Ukraine has to be implemented before peace negotiations can begin, the European officials and two other people briefed on the call said. Some of the European leaders were left with the impression from the call that Trump is not optimistic about the results of his meeting with Putin, they added.",
      "The call on Wednesday took place just days ahead of Trump\u2019s meeting with Putin, which is planned for Friday. European and Ukrainian officials have been nervous about the president\u2019s meeting with the Russian leader since he announced it last week. Among their concerns is that Trump and Putin might agree to the parameters of a peace deal, including territorial divisions, and then try to pressure Ukraine to agree to it. Trump\u2019s comments last week that there would \"be some land swapping\u201d between Russia and Ukraine, in particular, put Zelenskyy and European leaders on edge.",
      "But the two European officials and three other people briefed on Wednesday\u2019s call said all the leaders agreed that Ukraine must be included in negotiations and should be the one to decide what territorial concessions it might be willing to make. They also said the leaders were united in their belief that if Putin does not agree to a ceasefire, Trump will likely levy new sanctions on Russia.",
      "Two additional people familiar with Wednesday\u2019s call said European leaders left feeling positive about Trump\u2019s plans for his meeting with Putin. One of them said achieving a ceasefire is expected to be the priority for Trump in the meeting. The other person expressed confidence that Ukrainian territory would not be negotiated without Ukraine.",
      "In response to a request for comment, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement: \"The White House does not discuss details of the President\u2019s private diplomatic conversations. However, President Trump has been clear that he wants to end this war and stop the killing, and Friday\u2019s meeting with President Putin will serve as an important moment in this process.\u201d",
      "Trump said Wednesday after the call that it was \u201cvery good\u201d and suggested that another meeting involving Zelenskyy could quickly follow his sit-down with Putin.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a very good chance that we\u2019re going to have a second meeting, which will be more productive than the first, because the first is I\u2019m going to find out where we are and what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cI would like to do it almost immediately, and we\u2019ll have a quick second meeting between President Putin and President Zelenskyy and myself, if they\u2019d like to have me there.\u201d",
      "The president also said Russia will face \u201csevere consequences\u201d if Putin doesn\u2019t agree to end the war.",
      "Vice President JD Vance, who also participated in Wednesday\u2019s call, said afterward during remarks to U.S. troops at RAF Fairford in the U.K. that \u201cone of our most important shared security goals in Europe\u201d is ending the war in Ukraine."

    "story": [
      "A Denver-based company proposing a $30 billion data center on land owned by the widow of NASCAR champion Dale Earnhardt in rural Mooresville, North Carolina, will not move forward with the project, a city official and an engineer representing the company said Wednesday. The proposal had drawn intense community backlash, including from Earnhardt\u2019s eldest son.",
      "For months, developers with Tract had said they wanted to build a data center campus in Mooresville, about 30 miles outside of Charlotte. Many residents pushed back against the proposal, citing concerns about the future facility\u2019s water and electricity usage. Others viewed the project as an encroachment on the area\u2019s close-knit feel.",
      "Mooresville Mayor Chris Carney said in a Facebook post Wednesday afternoon that Tract developers had withdrawn their proposal. Dan Brewer, an engineer representing Tract, confirmed that he had withdrawn a request for a rezoning that was needed to move the project forward. The city\u2019s commissioners had been scheduled to vote on the rezoning next month.",
      "\u201cMy client is Tract, I was instructed to withdraw it and that\u2019s what I did,\u201d Brewer said in a phone interview. \u201cThat\u2019s the only comment I have.\u201d",
      "Representatives for Tract, which had pitched the project as a boon for local tax revenue, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Tract spokesperson said last week in a statement to The Charlotte Observer that the company was \u201cboth disappointed and surprised\u201d by the mayor\u2019s previous comments indicating he no longer supported the project.",
      "Earnhardt was killed in a crash during the 2001 Daytona 500. When he wasn\u2019t at the racetrack, he was an avid outdoorsman, and neighbors said he used the North Carolina property at the center of the recent battle for hunting and fishing.",
      "Teresa Earnhardt, who married Dale Earnhardt in 1982, began asking city officials to rezone 400 acres of that land for a data center last fall. She didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Kerry Earnhardt, Dale Earnhardt\u2019s eldest son, blasted efforts to rezone the property on social media recently, saying his father \u201cwould be livid for his name to be associated\u201d with the project. At an Aug. 4 meeting, roughly 200 residents showed up, many in protest of the pending rezoning. Several of them, including Kerry Earnhardt\u2019s wife, Ren\u00e9, urged commissioners to halt the project.",
      "Kerry and Ren\u00e9 Earnhardt posted a YouTube video Wednesday detailing their opposition to the data center. Kerry Earnhardt recalled dove hunting with his father on the property, and added that he felt compelled to speak up on behalf of his neighbors.",
      "\u201cThe bottom line is this project does not belong where they\u2019re trying to put it,\u201d he said.",
      "While the White House embraces data centers as critical infrastructure in the global artificial intelligence race, in a growing number of communities they\u2019re not welcome.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s announcement makes Mooresville the latest city where developers have either backed off their plans for a data center, or had their plans for a data center voted down by local leaders amid public backlash. Last week, officials in Tucson, Arizona, rejected a proposed Amazon data center.",
      "Kerry Pennell, who ordered yard signs for the campaign opposing the Mooresville project, cheered Wednesday\u2019s withdrawal.",
      "\u201cAI and data centers are an important part of the world we live in today, but we really need to figure out their proper place in this country,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t just take rural residential land and destroy it forever.\u201d",
      "Late last week, Carney, the mayor, cast doubts on the project\u2019s prospects because Tract hadn\u2019t said which tech company would ultimately use the facility once it was built.",
      "\u201cThere is no request to postpone \u2014 this is a full withdrawal,\u201d Carney wrote on Facebook on Wednesday. The mayor added that there are no other \u201cactive\u201d requests for a data center in Mooresville.",
      "For Donna Jones, who lives about a half mile from the proposed Mooresville site, Wednesday\u2019s retreat felt like a victory. But she\u2019s remaining vigilant \u2014 and urges her neighbors to hold onto their anti-data center lawn signs \u201cin the event that something else comes along.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou just never know what they\u2019re going to plan for the future,\u201d she said."

      "Texas Democrats met late into the night Tuesday then again Wednesday, including breaking into smaller groups, to discuss their next steps and what their ultimate exit strategy looked like after spending the last 10 days out of the state, according to four sources close to the talks.",
      "But those sources said the lawmakers do not yet have full consensus on an exit plan. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get folks on the same page,\u201d said one of the sources, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly about internal party strategy.",
      "Still, there does appear to be agreement on one point: The Democrats won\u2019t come back to Austin until Republicans officially bring the first special session to a close. They\u2019re beginning to describe their ability to block Republicans from passing their new map that could net the party as many as five seats in the U.S. House during the first special session as proof of victory.",
      "\u201cOur commitment was only to kill this corrupt special session. What we will do, what we\u2019re going to do in the future, we\u2019re in discussions right now,\u201d Texas Democratic Caucus Chairman Gene Wu said Wednesday on \u201cMeet the Press NOW.\u201d",
      "Wu said they would not finalize their next steps until there was \u201cconsensus among our membership.\u201d But he noted Democrats have other avenues to push back against the GOP\u2019s redistricting effort in the courts, through the legislative process and with other states, like California, countering with new congressional maps.",
      "\u201cWe can fight this fight for as long as we can do it. But we have other strategies, other methods of fighting it,\u201d Wu said. \u201cIt does not have to be just a quorum break, it does not have to be just one thing or the other. We can throw everything at this.\u201d",
      "Republican leaders in Texas have promised to call \u201cspecial session after special session,\u201d and they need just a handful of Democrats to relent in order to achieve a quorum in the state House so they can move forward with their redistricting plan.",
      "So while it appears likely that Democrats will succeed in delaying the process enough to force a second special session, there is an acknowledgement among the caucus that their protest will need to come to an end some point soon.",
      "\u201cFrom the get-go, they knew they were never going to stay out of Texas forever. People didn\u2019t expect them to. The goal that the smartest among them set was: We need to bring national attention to this issue so other states are ready to counter if Republicans really do this,\u201d one aide to a Texas House Democrat breaking quorum told NBC News.",

The White House says it wants to ensure that the museums are celebrating \u201cAmerican exceptionalism\u201d before next year\u2019s celebration of the nation\u2019s 250th anniversary.",
      "The criticism by many, if not most, historians is that this risks distorting the reality of America\u2019s founding, which includes the reality that the genius of the Founding Fathers\u2019 creation was scarred by the reality that they were all white, male and largely property owners \u2014 including many slave owners. It spawned a reckoning that eventually led to the brutality of the Civil War, followed by a century of legalized segregation, and continuing generational poverty and second-class citizenship for millions of Americans.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration\u2019s expanded ban on immigrants\u2019 access to social services, such as Head Start and Meals on Wheels, could have a \u201cdevastating\u201d impact on children of immigrants, including U.S. citizens, hundreds of opponents told the federal government Wednesday.",
      "A total of 372 organizations have coalesced to oppose the administration\u2019s decision to make more federally funded health and human service programs off-limits to immigrants with some form of permission to be in the country.",
      "The groups say the administration wrongly promotes the expanded restrictions as part of its efforts to target illegal immigration. The policy actually \u201cdirectly targets lawfully present immigrants\u201d by turning early learning centers, community health centers and mental health and addiction treatment programs \u201cinto immigration checkpoints\u201d where providers would have to check a person\u2019s immigration status, according to the groups.",
      "\u201cUndocumented immigrants already are not eligible for most federally funded programs. This is another case where the administration is lying to the public,\u201d said Adriana Cadena, director of the Protecting Immigration Families coalition, which led the organizations\u2019 opposition to restrictions to be implemented by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).",
      "As a result, the restrictions will harm millions, the groups stated in official comments filed in response to the administration's expanded restrictions, published in the Federal Register July 14.",
      "The deadline for public comment on the new restrictions was set for 11:59 p.m. Wednesday.",
      "One in 4 children in the U.S. are in a family with at least one immigrant parent. In 2023, 86% of those children were born in the U.S., making them U.S. citizens, according to Migration Policy Institute, an immigration think tank. (President Donald Trump also wants to change such birthright citizenship.)",
      "Even if a U.S. citizen child is entitled to use a program, the Trump administration's restrictions are likely to cause confusion and misunderstanding, Cadena said, because of the many children who are in families whose members have different types of immigration status.",
      "\"This is going to have long-term consequences we cannot begin to grasp,\" she said.",
      "In response to an NBC News request for comment, the White House sent a link to a July 10 news release by HHS announcing the new restrictions. The administration said in the release that it was ensuring that public benefits were not \u201cdiverted to subsidize illegal aliens.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor too long, the government has diverted hardworking Americans\u2019 tax dollars to incentivize illegal immigration,\u201d HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., stated in the July 10 release. \u201cToday\u2019s action changes that \u2014 it restores integrity to federal social programs, enforces the rule of law, and protects vital resources for the American people.\u201d",
      "Expanding the programs restricted to 'qualified' immigrants",

      "The HHS has added 13 more programs to the list of programs open only to qualified immigrants.",
      "Those newly added by the administration include Head Start, some of the funding for community health centers, family planning services, child welfare prevention, kinship guardian assistance, substance abuse prevention, treatment and recovery and mental health services and the Community Services Block Grant, the groups said. The federal government has said the list is not comprehensive and more programs could be added later.",
      "The groups argue that the programs and immigrants' access to them have a larger benefit to society as a whole and that \"reducing access to these vital programs will make all of our communities less healthy, less safe, less stable, less able to thrive.\"",
      "Restrictions on the HHS programs announced in July were to be effective immediately. Groups said little guidance has been given to providers regarding their implementation, creating confusion and having a chilling effect on people who are eligible for the programs and benefits as well as on the nonprofits, local governments and others who provide them.",
      "Several states have sued over the changes, which they said would also affect programs such as Meals on Wheels, domestic violence shelters, housing assistance and more. A lawsuit also was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and others on behalf of parent groups challenging Trump\u2019s policies on Head Start.",
      "The administration provided a 30-day comment period for the new restrictions.",
      "\"We do not necessarily expect that there is a real interest from the administration to seek comment on public policy that will impact millions of people,\" Cadena said.",
      "\"This is all about the Trump administration's governmentwide attack on immigrant families, and to dismantle the safety net system that many Americans rely on,\" she said."

      "A federal judge has ordered Ohio State University to resolve via mediation the remaining lawsuits filed by former students who claim it failed to protect them from a sexual predator on the school payroll.",
      "U.S. District Judge Michael H. Watson issued the order Monday as the university still faces five active lawsuits from 236 men alleging that Dr. Richard Strauss molested them, mostly under the guise of giving physicals.",
      "\u201cThe Ohio State University portrays itself as a different university today than it was when Dr. Richard Strauss abused hundreds of young men \u2014 for decades \u2014 as its employee,\u201d Watson, of the Southern District of Ohio, wrote. \u201cYet it is today\u2019s Ohio State that must reckon with the consequences of that ugly past in these cases.\u201d",
      "If the case went to trial and the accusers won, it would be a \u201cpyrrhic\u201d victory, Watson wrote.",
      "\u201cThe best way for plaintiffs to close this horrific chapter of their lives and for Ohio State to move forward as a respectable institution of higher education, is through a mutual resolution short of a trial,\u201d the judge wrote.",
      "Watson, in his order, referred the cases to Layn Phillips, a former Oklahoma federal judge who mediated the lawsuits filed against Michigan State by some 200 women athletes who were sexually abused by sports doctor Larry Nassar.",
      "Michigan State paid Nassar sex abuse survivors $500 million, which is believed to be the largest settlement ever in a sexual misconduct case involving a university.",
      "\u201cHe got Michigan State to pay the victims millions in settlement money. So we see this as a big win for us,\u201d one of the OSU plaintiffs, who asked not to be identified to avoid angering Watson, told NBC News.",
      "Phillips will be working alongside fellow mediators Catherine Geyer and Michelle Yoshida, as well as law clerk Caroline Kedeshian, Watson\u2019s order states.",
      "Watson also gave both sides a deadline of Feb. 27, 2026 to provide the court with a progress report \u201cat which point the Court will consider whether additional mediation would be productive.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, lawyers for OSU and the plaintiffs will be allowed to continue taking depositions from witnesses.",
      "Among those who have already been deposed are Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who was the assistant wrestling coach at the university from 1986 to 1994 before he got into politics, four plaintiffs in lawsuits against the university told NBC News last month.",
      "Jordan has repeatedly and publicly denied any knowledge that Strauss was preying on athletes. He was deposed about a month after the release of an HBO Max documentary about the Strauss scandal called \u201cSurviving Ohio State,\u201d in which one of the wrestlers he once coached called him a liar. Jordan is not a defendant, but he is referred to in some of the lawsuits alleging he was aware of the abuse.",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Watson\u2019s ruling. A spokesperson for Ohio State, Benjamin Johnson, also declined to comment, saying via email, \u201cWe don\u2019t typically comment on pending litigation.\"",
      "Ohio State found itself under fire in 2018 after a whistleblowing former wrestler named Mike DiSabato went public with allegations that Strauss had sexually abused him and hundreds of other athletes and that the school knew about it but did nothing to stop him.",
      "Strauss preyed on hundreds of men from the mid-1970s to the late 1990s. He died by suicide in 2005.",
      "An independent investigation sponsored by Ohio State and conducted by the Perkins Coie law firm concluded in May 2019 that Strauss sexually abused at least 177 male athletes and students and that coaches and administrators knew about it for two decades but failed to stop him.",
      "Since the release of the report, OSU has said it has paid out $60 million in settlement money and its former president has publicly apologized \u201cto each person who endured\u201d abuse at the hands of Strauss. But it has balked at settling the remaining lawsuits.",
      "CORRECTION (Aug. 13, 2025, 5:35 p.m. ET): An earlier version of this article misspelled Larry Nassar\u2019s last name. It is Nassar, not Nasser."

    "story": [
      "Taylor Swift's fondness for dropping clues and making sleuths out of her most dedicated fans was on full display this week after she announced her upcoming 12th album, \"The Life Of A Showgirl.\"",
      "The pop sensation left quite a few blank spaces for fans after announcing the album title on her website at 12:12 a.m. Tuesday. Swift's website was then updated with the option to pre-order the record on vinyl, cassette and CD.",
      "When will the album be available?",
      "Swift revealed Wednesday that \u201cThe Life Of A Showgirl\u201d will drop on October 3.",
      "The pre-order description on her website initially said orders would ship by Oct. 13, but also made clear that this was not the release date.",
      "New music typically releases on Fridays, in part to maximize how well a song or album does on the charts.",
      "What does the album cover look like?",
      "It's clear that her new era will be defined by the colors orange and mint green.",
      "The cover includes Swift seemingly submerged while wearing a jeweled top with her face slightly above water. \"The Life of a Showgirl\" is emblazoned in orange glitter.",
      "When \u201cThe Life Of A Showgirl\u201d pre-orders dropped, however, no album art was shown. She revealed the album art during Wednesday\u2019s episode of the \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast, hosted by boyfriend Travis Kelce and his brother, Jason.",
      "\u201cThis is my new brand new album, \u2018The Life of a Show Girl,\u201d Swift said, as the retired Philadelphia Eagles center screamed in excitement.",
      "Her website updated at the exact same time the podcast debuted to show the new album as well as three other variations.",
      "The four album variant names are \"The Life Of A Showgirl: Sweat and Vanilla,\" \u201cThe Life Of A Showgirl: It's Frightening,\" \u201cThe Life Of A Showgirl: It's Rapturous,\" and \u201cThe Life Of A Showgirl: It's Beautiful.\"",
      "She told the brothers that she worked on the album while touring in Europe, flying to Sweden on her three days off after playing three shows in a row.",
      "\u201cAnd actually, like, working on this, I was physically exhausted at this point in the tour, but I was so mentally stimulated and so excited to be creating.\u201d",
      "How many tracks on the album?",
      "Swift revealed there will be 12 tracks on the album, going through them one by one on the podcast.",
      "In order, the tracks are: \"The Fate of Ophelia,\" \"Elizabeth Taylor,\" \"Opalite,\" \"Father Figure,\" \"Eldest Daughter,\"  \"Ruin the Friendship,\" \"Actually Romantic,\" \"Wi$h Li$t,\" \"Wood,\" \"CANCELED!,\" \"Honey,\"  and \"The Life Of A Showgirl (Feat. Sabrina Carpenter.\"",
      "Travis Kelce, who was thrilled he knew so much about the album, described \"CANCELED!\" as a \"banger.\"",
      "Fans do their best Sherlock impressions",
      "With so little \u2014 but so much \u2014 to go on, fans were in a tizzy trying to decipher what clues Swift may have dropped about the new album.",
      "Her website updated Wednesday with a countdown four and half hours before 7 p.m. ET, the podcast release time. The screen showed a door in the spotlight slowly lowering to a small glitter orange square with a lock on it.",
      "It was the same orange lock seen over the album cover on the pre-order. The door is also the same one seen in visuals during The Eras Tour at the end of the show when Swift performed \u201cKarma.\u201d",
      "The padlock appears to have an imprint of a key in the same shape as The Eras Tour stage. Then a red lock appeared, followed by a blue lock and finally a silver lock.",
      "Swifties, the self-proclaimed name for the singer\u2019s fanbase, rightly guessed that the locks were symbolizing four album variants.",
      "Many also believe the singer might announce a tour documentary alongside the album\u2019s release. Cameras were seen following Swift around during multiple dates of The Eras Tour.",
      "\u201cThe lock being the eras tour stage has me 1000% convinced that the eras documentary is also called the life of a showgirl bc it goes behind the scenes of her life as a showgirl ??!!,\u201d one X user posted.",
      "Swift\u2019s profile on Spotify uploaded a new playlist, titled \u201cAnd, baby, that\u2019s show business for you,\u201d around the time of the album name reveal Tuesday.",
      "The playlist featured all the songs Swift made with producers Max Martin and Shellback in alphabetical order. Swifties believed this could be the sign she\u2019s diverging from her good friend Jack Antonoff, who has been the producer on her most recent albums, for \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl.\u201d",
      "This fan theory was confirmed during Swift's podcast interview, where she said she reunited with the two Swedish producers. Swift credited them with having worked on some of her favorite songs.",
      "She added that the three have never made an album with just the three of them. She told Martin during her show in Stockholm that she felt they could \"knock it out of the park.\"",
      "\"It felt like catching lightning in a bottle, honestly,\" Swift said. \"We hadn't worked together in like seven or eight years ... there's something about these guys. They're just geniuses in different avenues, in different ways.\"",
      "The phrase \u201cAnd, baby, that\u2019s show business for you\u201d also appeared when you googled Swift\u2019s name on Tuesday. Some suspect that will be a lyric on the album.",
      "Fans have already reflected on the most obvious Easter eggs she left behind. The singer\u2019s tour performance of \u201cI Can Do It With A Broken Heart\u201d had a showgirl theme.",
      "There were also many instances where she wore orange throughout The Eras Tour. Fans also pointed out that the last show of the tour was Dec. 8, or 12/8, and that the album was announced Aug. 12, or 8/12.",
      "Eagle-eyed sleuths guessed that either the album or a lead single will release Sept. 12, because the Taylor Nation carousel was posted at 9:12 a.m. on Monday."

      "The suit alleges that despite the government\u2019s own directives, the parents \u201cwere never given a choice as to whether their children should be deported with them and were prohibited from contacting their counsel or having meaningful contact with their families to arrange for the care of their children.\u201d The mothers, named in the suit as Rosario and Julia, allege they wanted their children to remain in the U.S.",
      "Instead, the families were \u201cillegally deported without even a semblance of due process,\u201d the lawsuit states.",
      "Romeo, as the now 5-year-old is identified in the lawsuit, was diagnosed with a \u201crare and aggressive form of kidney cancer,\u201d at age 2. He immediately began receiving ongoing \u201ccritical, life-saving medical treatment\u201d in the U.S., according to the lawsuit, which was filed by immigrant advocacy group National Immigration Project and three law firms.",
      "\u201cThe failure to allow his mother to arrange for his care, in violation of ICE\u2019s own directive, and his unlawful deportation to Honduras interfered with his needed medical treatment,\u201d the suit said.",
      "The suit was filed on behalf of the two mothers and their children in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana on July 31. The plaintiffs\u2019 names in the lawsuit are pseudonyms to protect their identities and safety, attorneys said. The case against the federal government is in its early stages, and plaintiffs are seeking a jury trial and damages, and for their arrests and removals to be found unlawful and to be returned to the United States.",
      "\u201cThis is emblematic of what happens when the administration is laser-focused on deportation, that when the end result is all that matters, you are going to end up with wrongful and unlawful deportations,\u201d Stephanie Alvarez-Jones, an attorney with the National Immigration Project, told NBC News.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that U.S. children were not being \u201cdeported\u201d and denied that the parents were not given a choice regarding the care of their children before being sent to Honduras.",
      "\u201cRather than separate their families, ICE asked the mothers if they wanted to be removed with their children or if they wanted ICE to place the children with someone safe the parent designates,\u201d Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said. \u201cThe parents in this instance made the determination to take their children with them back to Honduras.\u201d",
      "McLaughlin said that when there is \u201can underlying health issue, ICE makes sure that treatment is available in the country to which the illegal alien is being removed. The implication that ICE would deny a child the medical care they need is flatly FALSE, and it is an insult to the men and women of federal law enforcement.\u201d",
      "NBC News has previously reported on U.S. citizen children being sent with their deported immigrant parents to other countries, including a 10-year-old girl recovering from a rare brain tumor sent to Mexico.",
      "Rosario and Julia and their children were put on a plane to Honduras on April 25 after being detained at immigration check-in appointments where they were told to bring their U.S. citizen children and their passports, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Both women had settled in the U.S. some years ago, the lawsuit states. Rosario came to the U.S. in 2013 as a 13-year-old unaccompanied minor. She gave birth to her first child, Ruby, in 2018 in New Orleans, and her second child, Romeo, in 2020.",
      "In the lawsuit, Rosario claims she didn\u2019t know an immigration case against her was playing out while she was in the U.S. She said she only found out she had a removal order dating back 10 years after she was taken into ICE custody during a traffic stop in February.",
      "The mother of two was given an ankle monitor and had check-ins with ICE both at her home and at their local office, the suit states.",
      "On April 24, Rosario showed up at her immigration check-in with her attorney and children, along with their passports, per ICE\u2019s instructions. At the appointment, Rosario and her children were taken to a back room without their attorney and told they would be deported, according to the lawsuit.",
      "ICE allegedly asked Rosario to sign a document without telling her what it was and Rosario refused. Agents allegedly dismissed her pleas to speak with her attorney about Romeo\u2019s condition.",
      "Her attorney then learned that the family had been transferred to a facility in Alexandria, Louisiana, three hours away. The attorney filed a stay of removal for Rosario\u2019s family that included evidence of Romeo\u2019s Stage 4 cancer diagnosis.",
      "The family was boarded on a plane the next day.",
      "According to the lawsuit, Rosario \u201cexplicitly opposed her U.S. citizen children\u2019s deportation and had never provided consent for such action. Indeed, given Romeo\u2019s cancer and specialized medical needs, Rosario wanted both of her U.S. citizen children to remain in the United States.\u201d",
      "Like Rosario, Julia was also denied access to an attorney when she and her children were detained by ICE and deported, the lawsuit states.",
      "Julia first arrived at the U.S. border in 2019 fleeing Honduras, after her daughter Janelle was kidnapped there, according to the details in the lawsuit. After applying for asylum, they were forced to wait in Mexico at the time under Trump\u2019s \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy. They said in the lawsuit they were kidnapped in Mexico before they were able to return to the U.S. in August 2021.",
      "Her daughter Jade was born in Louisiana in 2023.",
      "Julia was told in February 2025 to begin bringing both of her daughters to her regular ICE check-ins, the lawsuit states.",
      "On April 22, Julia, who was now pregnant, attended a check-in with her daughters as her partner waited outside. She said she was told her family was being transferred to Alexandria and that a judge would determine their fate in the U.S., according to the lawsuit. Her partner alleges he was told his family was transferred hours later and he was not given time to speak to Julia.",
      "Later that night, Julia was told she would be deported along with her children.",

      "\u201cAt no point was Julia provided an opportunity to arrange for care of her U.S. citizen daughter Jade in the United States.\u201d",
      "DHS said in its statement to NBC News that it \u201ctakes its responsibility to protect children seriously and will continue to work with federal law enforcement to ensure that children are safe and protected.\u201d The agency said parents \u201ccan take control of their departure\u201d by self-deporting.",
      "Julia and her children were sent to Honduras on April 25 on the same plane as Rosario\u2019s family.",
      "Rosario said in a statement that in Honduras she lacks the resources to care for her children the way they need.",
      "\u201cSince returning, my daughter has gotten sick and struggled with anxiety, and I\u2019ve been struggling with my own health issues too,\u201d she said.",
      "Julia said in a statement she thought she and her children were going to a regular appointment, but she was lied to. \u201cI never imagined they would send me and my children to Honduras,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cReturning to Honduras has meant leaving my husband behind, and that\u2019s been very hard,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were deprived of the opportunity to be and make decisions as a family.\u201d"

      "Wafaa Eeed, a Palestinian woman in Gaza, told NBC News last month that she had walked several miles to a GHF aid distribution site on July 24, a day set aside only for women. She and two other witnesses said they were shot at, pepper-sprayed and tear-gassed.",
      "\u201cArab states, why don\u2019t you help us? We don\u2019t want the Americans,\u201d Eeed said.",
      "Two women were killed on their way to the site, a Gaza health official said. The GHF said at the time that there were \u201cno incidents\u201d at the site itself.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces did not respond to a request to comment on the incident, but at the time it told the BBC that early in the day it had \"identified suspects who approached them, posing a threat to the troops\" and \"fired warning shots.\"",
      "It was not aware of casualties, and the shots were fired \"hundreds of meters away\" from the GHF site before its opening hours, it said.",
      "Israel also denies there is starvation in Gaza, contradicting medics in the Palestinian enclave, global aid groups and even a close ally, President Donald Trump.",
      "Some Arab leaders dependent on American aid and security guarantees are wary of angering the U.S. and Israel and see little strategic advantage in helping Palestinians, whom they may even see as a threat, experts say.",
      "Arab states have participated in airdrops of aid and food convoys into Gaza, but Palestinians and aid groups say it\u2019s nowhere near enough to ward off a looming famine. Egypt and Qatar have also mediated talks among Israel, the U.S. and Hamas, but they have not led to an end to the conflict.",
      "Several Latin American states, along with Spain, Ireland and Norway, have blasted Israel for its conduct in Gaza and threatened sanctions or a downgrade of diplomatic ties.",
      "And in recent weeks, longtime Israeli allies like France and Australia have pledged to officially recognize Palestine \u2014 a move decried by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government. In late 2023, South Africa filed a case with the United Nations\u2019 top court alleging that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza.",
      "Arab states have been much less vocal, with Egypt and Jordan even cracking down on pro-Palestinian protests and activism, fearing they could turn against the country\u2019s leaders, experts say.",
      "\u201cPalestine resonates deeply in the Arab imagination,\" Gerges said. \"Palestine reminds Arabs of the subservience of their governments. Palestine reminds Arabs of the hegemony and domination and the continuing colonialism and imperialism of the West.\"",
      "He added, \u201cI would say that Gaza, the tragedy of Gaza, the destruction of Gaza, could really serve as a time bomb that implodes the Arab political order from within.\u201d",
      "Polling before Oct. 7, 2023, showed that most Arab citizens rejected normalizing ties with Israel, a sentiment subsequent surveys show has only deepened since.",
      "A survey published in June by pollster Arab Barometer found that support for such a move has collapsed, not exceeding 13 percent in the seven countries surveyed.",
      "The Egyptian and Jordanian embassies in the U.S., along with the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on this story.",
      "Egypt and Jordan, even with the crackdown, have allowed limited protests, though hundreds of activists have also been arrested, according to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.",
      "The Gulf states rarely allow protests, but they have largely maintained diplomatic and trade links with Israel throughout its devastating offensive in the Gaza strip that began after the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks, in which some 1,200 were killed and 250 taken hostage.",
      "Health officials in Gaza say that more than 61,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, have been killed in the ensuing war.",
      "Many academics, including Israeli scholars, have in recent months joined rights groups in condemning Israel\u2019s operations in Gaza as genocide, a charge Israel vehemently denies.",
      "\u201cDespite the genocide, in the middle of the genocide, this extraordinary depravity that we see in Gaza, not a single Arab state that has relations with Israel has cut relations with Israel, although other states in other parts of the world have,\u201d said Ussama Makdisi, professor of history and chancellor\u2019s chair at the University of California, Berkeley.",
      "The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain were among the Arab states that signed the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords in 2020, paving the way for economic and diplomatic ties with Israel. Saudi Arabia had been set to follow, but the Gaza conflict put those plans on hold.",
      "For Gulf Arab states, better ties with Israel have little to do with public attitudes and more to do with realpolitik, experts say. The Gulf states host several U.S. military bases that analysts say help shield them from regional rival Iran and also help maintain Western access to the region\u2019s vast energy supplies.",
      "Access to Israel\u2019s vibrant tech sector has also been a draw for some Arab states, who have used its surveillance technology to stifle dissent, experts and rights groups say.",
      "\u201cThose regimes in the Arab world that depend on the U.S. for their security, they don\u2019t depend on their legitimacy vis a vis their own people. They depend on U.S. protection, U.S. military bases,\u201d Makdisi said.",
      "Houthi rebels, who control large parts of Yemen, have fired missiles and drones at Israel and ships in the region in what they say is an attempt to end Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, but Yemen is alone among Arab states in pressuring Israel militarily. Arab countries could apply economic pressure through oil embargoes or restricting access to the Suez Canal and Arab airspace, but experts say such moves are unlikely.",
      "Arab countries once supplied Palestinian militant groups with weapons, funding and bases from which to attack Israel, but such solidarity proved costly and dangerous.",
      "In Jordan, tensions between Palestinian militant groups and the ruling monarchy exploded into the \u201cBlack September\u201d civil war in 1970, leading to the militants\u2019 eventual expulsion and relocation to Lebanon.",
      "The presence of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Lebanon in the 1970s exacerbated the country\u2019s civil war and triggered an Israeli invasion in 1982 to target \u201cPalestinian terrorists.\u201d",
      "More recently, Israel invaded Lebanon last year, heavily bombing southern Beirut in an offensive against the Hezbollah militant group, which had been firing rockets at Israel in solidarity with Hamas.",
      "Hezbollah and Hamas are backed by Iran, which has led some Arab states to distance themselves from both groups.",
      "For Ryan Crocker, former U.S. ambassador to Iraq, Lebanon and Kuwait, lukewarm Arab support for the Palestinian cause is less about U.S. and Israeli pressure and more about self-preservation.",
      "\u201cThe Palestinians, both the cause, the PLO and the population, in the Jordanian and Lebanese examples, have both been seen as a threat to the rule of these Arab regimes,\u201d Crocker told NBC News.",
      "The U.S. and Israel had floated plans for Arab countries to accept tens of thousands of Gaza refugees, but the idea was flatly rejected, with those Arab countries fearing both renewed Palestinian militancy and accusations of aiding ethnic cleansing, experts say.",
      "Crocker compared Palestinians to the Kurds, another stateless group in the Middle East.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a saying among the Kurds, who are scattered between Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey, that they have no friends but the mountains,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, the Palestinians don\u2019t even have the mountains.\u201d"

      "\u201cIt\u2019s what you do behind closed doors that no one sees that gives you the opportunity to stand out on this field every single week during the season and be great,\u201d Phelps told the players.",

      "On Tuesday, Aug. 12, the team headed toward the pool, where Phelps told TODAY\u2019s Craig Melvin how he planned to teach football players how to swim and be safe in the water.",
      "\u201cStart with baby steps,\" Phelps said. \"I know it might sound crazy, but try just blowing bubbles in the water ... become more vulnerable.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s something that a lot of people are afraid of. And instead of being one foot on the boat, one foot on the dock, jump right in. Literally, jump in. Come jump in with me,\u201d he added.",
      "Phelps has been a water safety advocate for years, launching the Michael Phelps Foundation in 2008 to help kids and adults learn to swim.",
      "Drowning is the leading cause of death for children ages one to four, and about 40 million adults in the U.S. don\u2019t know how to swim, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Phelps, a father of four, said he remembers the fear during his first swimming lessons clearly.",
      "\u201cWhen I first got into the water to swim, Miss Cathy was my teacher, and I didn\u2019t want to put my face under,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, me, Michael Phelps, afraid to put my face into the water. But naturally, you overcome those fears based off your confidence and your comfort level in the pool.\u201d",

      "How I picked the best meal delivery services",
      "I consulted with our experts about which features to consider when shopping for meal kit delivery services. Here are the most important ones to remember:",
      "Serving size: Keep in mind how many people you\u2019re looking to feed, and make sure the service offers multiple servings (if you need). A single-serve pre-prepared meal is likely best if you\u2019re only feeding yourself. If you\u2019re feeding a family or partner, look for a customizable plan with multiple serving sizes (typically ranging from two to eight servings).Dietary restrictions: If you\u2019re gluten-free, vegetarian, vegan or follow any other specific type of diet, look for services that offer a variety of options to fit those dietary needs.Customizability: Are you a picky eater or someone who gets easily bored of eating the same meals? Look for meal delivery services that provide a weekly rotating menu with several meal options, as well as customizable features like portion size and the amount and type of protein in each meal.Pricing: The price of meal kit delivery services is based on the quality of meals and ingredients, the frequency of your deliveries, how many people you\u2019re cooking for and the specific meal plan. Keep in mind that more budget-friendly services may not cater to all dietary restrictions or needs, while diet- and lifestyle-specific options typically cost more.Delivery dates and times: Consider your availability to receive your meals to ensure they don\u2019t go to waste. Most services will offer customizable delivery plans to choose what days you want to receive your kit. Most will also let you pause plans or skip weeks as needed.",

      "We\u2019ve tested nearly a dozen meal delivery services, many of which are listed below. To pick the best ones, we looked at the following factors:",
      "Serving size: We considered how many people we\u2019re feeding, and whether the service accommodates multiple servings. For example, a few editors are feeding themselves plus a partner or families, while others are only cooking for one.Prep time: We looked at how long it took to cook or heat up meals, and whether it was worth it for a busy schedule (all of the services we recommend have easy-to-follow recipes and take less than an hour to make, or under 10 minutes to heat up). Price: We tried options across various price points, though most fall within the $10-$12 per meal range.Dietary restrictions: We tried services that catered to different diets, including gluten-free and pescatarian, and how that food actually tasted.Shipping and packaging: We considered how meals are packaged, how that packaging helps (or hinders) meal preparation and whether the shipping is quick, easy and painless.",

You can also flag any allergies or foods you don\u2019t like, and the service will notify you if they appear in any meals on the menu.",

      "It\u2019s also a favorite of NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin: \u201cThe convenience is unbeatable \u2014 the meals show up at my door at the beginning of the week, and knowing all I need to do to cook dinner is pull the wrapper off a meal and warm it up makes my evenings totally stress-free,\u201d she says. However, Malin notes there is some more prep work involved than other services she\u2019s tried. \u201cI did have to take out some components of meals before I microwaved them, like a kale salad or coleslaw, which was a bit tricky and caused me to do more dishes \u2014 normally, I\u2019d reheat and eat meals out of the same disposable containers they came in,\u201d she says.",

You can also swap proteins and sides if the weekly recipes don\u2019t quite fit your preferences. The service also offers 14 veggie meals (including up to two vegan meals) in its Classic Plan each week.",

In addition to delivering fresh food for the week, it also sends you specific recipes based on the groceries you order. You can also edit your delivery every week in case you want a specific ingredient or food item.",
      "With the ability to choose the type of meal you want (breakfast, lunch or dinner) and to customize the groceries you get, Hungryroot essentially \u201callows you to be a bit more adventurous and cook from the hip, or also follow the recipes exactly,\u201d says Leonard.",
      "How to shop for a meal delivery service",
      "The biggest factors to consider when shopping include the price per meal/serving, the quality of the ingredients, the amount of time you\u2019re willing to dedicate and your own cooking ability.",
      "The price of meal kit delivery services varies based on several factors, including the quality of meals and ingredients you\u2019re getting, the frequency of your deliveries, how many people you\u2019re cooking for and the meal plan you choose. More budget-friendly services like EveryPlate and Dinnerly will typically cost around $5 per serving, while most other popular services like HelloFresh will cost anywhere between $8 and $11 per serving. If you\u2019re looking at more premium or diet-specific services like Sunbasket and Green Chef, they will cost you approximately $12 to $15 per serving.",
      "Take advantage of trial offers, says Daniel Shumski, a recipe developer and cookbook author. \u201cSo many meal kits and delivery services offer great introductory prices \u2014 it\u2019s worth trying around to find one that fits your taste and budget,\u201d he says.",
      "The time you\u2019re willing to allocate to preparing, cooking and plating your food can help determine which meal delivery service is right for you. If you\u2019re choosing a plan that sends you all the ingredients, you should be prepared to take the time needed to prepare each dish, says Christine Wansleben, owner and culinary director at Mise En Place, which offers cooking classes, private events and more. You\u2019ll also need to ensure you\u2019re cooking the meals as soon as possible since the ingredients can be easily perishable, she adds.",
      "For those who don\u2019t have as much time during the week, ready-to-eat meal delivery services are typically the best option.",
      "Generally, meal delivery services have specific rules and procedures in place to ensure their ingredients are high-quality and trustworthy, according to the experts we talked to. But if you\u2019re extremely particular about the freshness and origin of your ingredients, you should likely skip these services and shop on your own.",
      "For those looking to meet specific nutritional goals, Moskovitz recommends paying attention to the individual ingredients in each meal plan, the nutrition facts and the portion sizes. \u201cDon\u2019t just assume that because it\u2019s homemade or marketed as \u2018healthy\u2019 that it\u2019s the healthiest option for you,\u201d she says.",
      "Certain meal delivery services will offer a variety of options for those with dietary restrictions. However, Resnick notes there\u2019s one caveat: Those with medical issues, such as shellfish allergies or celiac disease, should be mindful of possible cross-contamination.",
      "\u201cCompanies are usually forthright about shared equipment, but eaters with food intolerances should exercise caution,\u201d she says. \u201cThat said, for special diets that are usually choice-based, such as veganism or low carb, I think these services are an excellent choice.\u201d",
      "Before committing to a specific plan, you should consider when you\u2019ll be able to receive these meals to avoid ingredients spoiling or not getting delivered, according to Resnick. Most services will offer customizable delivery plans to choose what days you want to receive your weekly delivery \u2014 if you know you won\u2019t be there, most services will let you skip a week (but keep in mind there is usually a cutoff time to select this option).",
      "Frequently asked questions",
      "Meal kits are usually less expensive than dining out or ordering delivery from a local restaurant, according to our NBC Select staff reviewers. However, it all depends on the specific meal delivery service you choose; some are more expensive than others because of premium meal options, organic ingredients and delivery rate, experts say.",
      "There are plenty of benefits to meal delivery services, including saving you time at the grocery store (or avoiding a trip altogether) and meal planning. Plus, it avoids buying too much of an ingredient that will probably go bad in a few days.",
      "\u201cMeal delivery services and kits offer the ability to eat fresh food without wasting anything or having leftovers you don\u2019t want,\u201d says Resnick.",
      "They\u2019re also a great option for culinary beginners because they offer a great opportunity to learn and try out new skills in the kitchen. \u201cI appreciate that they offer people who don\u2019t cook well a hands-on way to learn, and that they allow those who are averse to prep work the ability to avoid it while still eating fresh food,\u201d says Resnick.",

      "When she first saw the clip of him from that July 2023 episode, Swift asked around to see if he\u2019d ever tried to attend a meet-and-greet or connect at another show. Since she rarely scrolls social media and doesn\u2019t check her DMs, she found his approach refreshingly bold.",

      "He addressed the controversy during his audition on \"America's Got Talent\" in June 2025, where he explained to the judges that he made some \"really bad choices\" during the cheating scandal that \"pretty much destroyed\" his life.",

She had a little mouse that was Boots that lived in her pocket,\u201d Walsh Valdes tells TODAY.com. \u201cBut there were some things that stayed the same throughout, like the essence of her character. We tried to hold on to that.\u201d",

There\u2019s been so many kids who\u2019ve gone through this, and now young adults are having their own kids, and they\u2019re becoming \u2018Dora\u2019 fans,\u201d says Walsh Valdes. \u201cThat\u2019s something that we learned in research this time around. It\u2019s like being a proud parent. I\u2019m so happy that this gets to continue and spread.\u201d",

      "\u201cSomehow that little girl resonated in a really strong way, and continues to in all the different iterations that Dora takes. There\u2019s something timeless about that,\u201d says Gifford. \u201cI think it has to do with being open to all people. There\u2019s an acceptance that Dora shows. She\u2019s always true to who she is.\u201d",
      "The creators add that there are so many universals to Dora, \u201ccertainly bilingualism in other parts of the world is very accepted.\u201d",
      "\u201cSeeing a character move between two languages isn\u2019t so unusual for them,\u201d Walsh Valdes notes. \u201cBut having that magic backpack... was a game changer.\u201d",

      "Dora will always be needed, the creators say, explaining, \u201cShe is so loving and accepting and she really connects with the viewer and listens to the viewer.\u201d",
      "Adding, \u201cWith all the noise out there, she is a break from that, and it makes a little kid feel like they\u2019re heard, they\u2019re special.\u201d"

      "Trump said on the call, which also included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, that he is going into the meeting with Putin with the goal of securing a ceasefire in Ukraine, those sources said.",
      "Trump and European leaders agreed that a ceasefire in Ukraine has to be implemented before peace negotiations can begin, the European officials and two other people briefed on the call said. Some of the European leaders were left with the impression from the call that Trump is not optimistic about the results of his meeting with Putin, they added.",
      "The call on Wednesday took place just days ahead of Trump\u2019s meeting with Putin, which is planned for Friday. European and Ukrainian officials have been nervous about the president\u2019s meeting with the Russian leader since he announced it last week. Among their concerns is that Trump and Putin might agree to the parameters of a peace deal, including territorial divisions, and then try to pressure Ukraine to agree to it. Trump\u2019s comments last week that there would \"be some land swapping\u201d between Russia and Ukraine, in particular, put Zelenskyy and European leaders on edge.",
      "But the two European officials and three other people briefed on Wednesday\u2019s call said all the leaders agreed that Ukraine must be included in negotiations and should be the one to decide what territorial concessions it might be willing to make. They also said the leaders were united in their belief that if Putin does not agree to a ceasefire, Trump will likely levy new sanctions on Russia.",
      "Two additional people familiar with Wednesday\u2019s call said European leaders left feeling positive about Trump\u2019s plans for his meeting with Putin. One of them said achieving a ceasefire is expected to be the priority for Trump in the meeting. The other person expressed confidence that Ukrainian territory would not be negotiated without Ukraine.",
      "In response to a request for comment, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement: \"The White House does not discuss details of the President\u2019s private diplomatic conversations. However, President Trump has been clear that he wants to end this war and stop the killing, and Friday\u2019s meeting with President Putin will serve as an important moment in this process.\u201d",
      "Trump said Wednesday after the call that it was \u201cvery good\u201d and suggested that another meeting involving Zelenskyy could quickly follow his sit-down with Putin.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a very good chance that we\u2019re going to have a second meeting, which will be more productive than the first, because the first is I\u2019m going to find out where we are and what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cI would like to do it almost immediately, and we\u2019ll have a quick second meeting between President Putin and President Zelenskyy and myself, if they\u2019d like to have me there.\u201d",
      "The president also said Russia will face \u201csevere consequences\u201d if Putin doesn\u2019t agree to end the war.",
      "Vice President JD Vance, who also participated in Wednesday\u2019s call, said afterward during remarks to U.S. troops at RAF Fairford in the U.K. that \u201cone of our most important shared security goals in Europe\u201d is ending the war in Ukraine."

      "\u201cWhere are the Arabs? The Arabs are napping. The Arabs are nowhere to be seen. The Arabs, and I\u2019m talking about the Arab rulers, have buried their heads in the sand,\u201d said Fawaz Gerges, professor of international relations at the London School of Economics.",
      "The situation in Gaza has become even more dire as Palestinians risk their lives to get food. An aid distribution system implemented by the U.S. and the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has led to hundreds more Palestinians being killed, often by Israeli soldiers.",
      "Wafaa Eeed, a Palestinian woman in Gaza, told NBC News last month that she had walked several miles to a GHF aid distribution site on July 24, a day set aside only for women. She and two other witnesses said they were shot at, pepper-sprayed and tear-gassed.",
      "\u201cArab states, why don\u2019t you help us? We don\u2019t want the Americans,\u201d Eeed said.",
      "Two women were killed on their way to the site, a Gaza health official said. The GHF said at the time that there were \u201cno incidents\u201d at the site itself.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces did not respond to a request to comment on the incident, but at the time it told the BBC that early in the day it had \"identified suspects who approached them, posing a threat to the troops\" and \"fired warning shots.\"",
      "It was not aware of casualties, and the shots were fired \"hundreds of meters away\" from the GHF site before its opening hours, it said.",
      "Israel also denies there is starvation in Gaza, contradicting medics in the Palestinian enclave, global aid groups and even a close ally, President Donald Trump.",
      "Some Arab leaders dependent on American aid and security guarantees are wary of angering the U.S. and Israel and see little strategic advantage in helping Palestinians, whom they may even see as a threat, experts say.",
      "Arab states have participated in airdrops of aid and food convoys into Gaza, but Palestinians and aid groups say it\u2019s nowhere near enough to ward off a looming famine. Egypt and Qatar have also mediated talks among Israel, the U.S. and Hamas, but they have not led to an end to the conflict.",
      "Several Latin American states, along with Spain, Ireland and Norway, have blasted Israel for its conduct in Gaza and threatened sanctions or a downgrade of diplomatic ties.",
      "And in recent weeks, longtime Israeli allies like France and Australia have pledged to officially recognize Palestine \u2014 a move decried by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government. In late 2023, South Africa filed a case with the United Nations\u2019 top court alleging that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza.",
      "Arab states have been much less vocal, with Egypt and Jordan even cracking down on pro-Palestinian protests and activism, fearing they could turn against the country\u2019s leaders, experts say.",
      "\u201cPalestine resonates deeply in the Arab imagination,\" Gerges said. \"Palestine reminds Arabs of the subservience of their governments. Palestine reminds Arabs of the hegemony and domination and the continuing colonialism and imperialism of the West.\"",
      "He added, \u201cI would say that Gaza, the tragedy of Gaza, the destruction of Gaza, could really serve as a time bomb that implodes the Arab political order from within.\u201d",
      "Polling before Oct. 7, 2023, showed that most Arab citizens rejected normalizing ties with Israel, a sentiment subsequent surveys show has only deepened since.",
      "A survey published in June by pollster Arab Barometer found that support for such a move has collapsed, not exceeding 13 percent in the seven countries surveyed.",
      "The Egyptian and Jordanian embassies in the U.S., along with the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on this story.",
      "Egypt and Jordan, even with the crackdown, have allowed limited protests, though hundreds of activists have also been arrested, according to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.",
      "The Gulf states rarely allow protests, but they have largely maintained diplomatic and trade links with Israel throughout its devastating offensive in the Gaza strip that began after the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks, in which some 1,200 were killed and 250 taken hostage.",
      "Health officials in Gaza say that more than 61,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, have been killed in the ensuing war.",
      "Many academics, including Israeli scholars, have in recent months joined rights groups in condemning Israel\u2019s operations in Gaza as genocide, a charge Israel vehemently denies.",
      "\u201cDespite the genocide, in the middle of the genocide, this extraordinary depravity that we see in Gaza, not a single Arab state that has relations with Israel has cut relations with Israel, although other states in other parts of the world have,\u201d said Ussama Makdisi, professor of history and chancellor\u2019s chair at the University of California, Berkeley.",
      "The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain were among the Arab states that signed the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords in 2020, paving the way for economic and diplomatic ties with Israel. Saudi Arabia had been set to follow, but the Gaza conflict put those plans on hold.",
      "For Gulf Arab states, better ties with Israel have little to do with public attitudes and more to do with realpolitik, experts say. The Gulf states host several U.S. military bases that analysts say help shield them from regional rival Iran and also help maintain Western access to the region\u2019s vast energy supplies.",
      "Access to Israel\u2019s vibrant tech sector has also been a draw for some Arab states, who have used its surveillance technology to stifle dissent, experts and rights groups say.",
      "\u201cThose regimes in the Arab world that depend on the U.S. for their security, they don\u2019t depend on their legitimacy vis a vis their own people. They depend on U.S. protection, U.S. military bases,\u201d Makdisi said.",
      "Houthi rebels, who control large parts of Yemen, have fired missiles and drones at Israel and ships in the region in what they say is an attempt to end Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, but Yemen is alone among Arab states in pressuring Israel militarily. Arab countries could apply economic pressure through oil embargoes or restricting access to the Suez Canal and Arab airspace, but experts say such moves are unlikely.",
      "Arab countries once supplied Palestinian militant groups with weapons, funding and bases from which to attack Israel, but such solidarity proved costly and dangerous.",
      "In Jordan, tensions between Palestinian militant groups and the ruling monarchy exploded into the \u201cBlack September\u201d civil war in 1970, leading to the militants\u2019 eventual expulsion and relocation to Lebanon.",
      "The presence of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Lebanon in the 1970s exacerbated the country\u2019s civil war and triggered an Israeli invasion in 1982 to target \u201cPalestinian terrorists.\u201d",
      "More recently, Israel invaded Lebanon last year, heavily bombing southern Beirut in an offensive against the Hezbollah militant group, which had been firing rockets at Israel in solidarity with Hamas.",
      "Hezbollah and Hamas are backed by Iran, which has led some Arab states to distance themselves from both groups.",
      "For Ryan Crocker, former U.S. ambassador to Iraq, Lebanon and Kuwait, lukewarm Arab support for the Palestinian cause is less about U.S. and Israeli pressure and more about self-preservation.",
      "\u201cThe Palestinians, both the cause, the PLO and the population, in the Jordanian and Lebanese examples, have both been seen as a threat to the rule of these Arab regimes,\u201d Crocker told NBC News.",
      "The U.S. and Israel had floated plans for Arab countries to accept tens of thousands of Gaza refugees, but the idea was flatly rejected, with those Arab countries fearing both renewed Palestinian militancy and accusations of aiding ethnic cleansing, experts say.",
      "Crocker compared Palestinians to the Kurds, another stateless group in the Middle East.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a saying among the Kurds, who are scattered between Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey, that they have no friends but the mountains,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, the Palestinians don\u2019t even have the mountains.\u201d"

      "\u201cAl Jazeera fear these allegations may serve as a pretext for further violence against the journalists, mirroring the tragic fates of other media professionals targeted and killed by Israeli occupation forces,\u201d the media network said at the time.",

      "This prompted the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists to warn that it was \u201cgravely worried\u201d about al-Sharif. In a statement it said he was \u201cbeing targeted by an Israeli military smear campaign, which he believes is a precursor to his assassination.\u201d",

      "DAKAR, Senegal \u2014 It\u2019s the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth \u2014 a 54-pound (25-kilogram) meteorite that fetched more than $5 million at a New York auction last month, setting a world record.",
      "But in the West African nation of Niger, where the rusty-red rock was unearthed in the Sahara Desert, officials have launched an investigation into what they call possible \u201cillicit international trafficking,\u201d claiming it may have been smuggled out of the country.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the meteorite and the legal dispute:",
      "How it was found",
      "Sotheby\u2019s said the rock, named NWA 16788, was blown off the surface of Mars by a massive asteroid strike and traveled 140 million miles (225 million kilometers) to Earth.",
      "It was discovered in the Sahara in northwestern Niger by a meteorite hunter in November 2023, according to the auction house. His identity was not disclosed. Nor was the identity of the buyer last month.",
      "Meteorite hunting is growing in arid Saharan countries like Niger. Though meteorites can fall anywhere on Earth, the Sahara has become a prime spot for their discovery in part due to the favorable climate for their preservation.",
      "Hunters often search for space rocks that can be sold to collectors or scientists. The rarest and most precious are from Mars and the moon.",
      "According to the Heritage academic journal, the rock was sold to an international dealer before it ended up in a private galley in Italy. A team of scientists from the University of Florence examined the rock last year to learn more about its structure and where it came from before falling to Earth, the publication said.",
      "The meteorite was also briefly on display in Rome before it was next seen in public in New York last month during the auction.",
      "Why Niger is investigating",
      "Following the sale, Niger raised questions about how the meteorite came to be sold at auction.",
      "Niger\u2019s government announced an investigation last month to determine the circumstances of the meteorite\u2019s discovery and sale, saying in a statement it was \u201cakin to illicit international trafficking.\u201d",
      "Last week, President Abdourahamane Tiani suspended the export of \u201cprecious stones, semiprecious stones and meteorites nationwide\u201d in an effort to ensure their traceability.",
      "Sotheby\u2019s said in a statement sent to The Associated Press the meteorite was exported from Niger and transported in line with all relevant international procedures.",
      "\u201cAs with everything we sell, all necessary documentation was in order at each stage of its journey, in accordance with best practice and the requirements of the countries involved.\u201d the statement read.",
      "Authorities in Niger did not respond to AP questions.",
      "What international law says",
      "Patty Gerstenblith, a cultural heritage lawyer and expert on illicit trade, said that under the UNESCO convention on cultural property \u2014 which Niger and the U.S. have ratified \u2014 rare minerals, like meteorites, can qualify as cultural property.",
      "However, Gerstenblith said Niger needs to be able to prove it owned the meteorite and that it was stolen, as illegal export from the country does not make the meteorite illegal in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIf the meteorite was not stolen and if it was properly declared upon import into the U.S., then it would not seem that Niger can recover the meteorite,\u201d she told the AP.",
      "Paul Sereno, a paleontologist who has spent years uncovering dinosaur fossils in Niger\u2019s Sahara, is campaigning to return the country\u2019s cultural and natural heritage \u2014 including meteorites.",
      "\u201cWhen you have laws that clearly say rare minerals like meteorites are cultural artifacts, you cannot simply come in an take something that is so unique and valuable to a country,\u201d he told the AP.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just not in the colonial area anymore,\u201d he added.",
      "Some countries, like Morocco, one of the leading sources of meteorites on the international market, require restitution if the objects are discovered on their territory. But enforcement has been challenging due to the vast desert areas and informal trading networks."

      "A growing number of U.S. politicians are condemning a new British law that requires some websites and apps \u2014 including some based in the United States \u2014 to check the ages of users across the pond.",
      "A bipartisan group of members of Congress visited London recently to meet counterparts and air their concerns about the U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act, which went into effect July 25. Vice President JD Vance has been criticizing the law for months, as have privacy advocates who argue that the law infringes on free expression and disproportionately hurts vulnerable groups.",
      "Vance criticized the U.K. again on Friday, this time in person at the start of a visit to the country. Sitting alongside British Foreign Secretary David Lammy and speaking to reporters, Vance warned the U.K. against going down a \u201cvery dark path\u201d of online \u201ccensorship\u201d that he said was trod earlier by the Biden administration.",
      "The U.K. Online Safety Act is aimed at preventing children from accessing potentially harmful material online, and internet companies are now asking British users to verify their ages in a variety of ways, including with photos of their IDs, through a credit card provider or with selfies analyzed via age-check software.",
      "But the sweeping nature of the law has caught some Britons by surprise. They\u2019re being asked to prove their age not only for pornography websites but also before they can listen to songs with explicit lyrics or access message boards to discuss sensitive subjects. Reddit, for example, is restricting access to various pages including r/stopsmoking, r/STD and r/aljazeera.",
      "Reddit said in a post about its enforcement of the law that for people in the U.K., it was now verifying ages before they can \u201cview certain mature content.\u201d A spokesperson for the company said r/STD \u2014 a message board focused on questions of sexual health \u2014 is restricted because of explicit images. They said r/stopsmoking is restricted because it deals with harmful substances and that r/aljazeera \u2014 which is not affiliated with the news organization of the same name but deals with similar topics \u2014 is restricted because it depicts serious injury or violence.",
      "To get around the new law, the use of virtual private network software that can mask a person\u2019s location, also known as VPNs, has surged in the U.K.",
      "The primary argument of U.S. politicians who oppose the law is that they don\u2019t want American tech companies to have to comply, even if they\u2019re serving British customers.",
      "House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said he raised his objections with U.K. government officials during meetings in London at the end of July. In a statement after his return, he said the law and other European regulations \u201ccreate a serious chilling effect on free expression and threaten the First Amendment rights of American citizens and companies.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe absolutely need to protect children and keep harmful, illegal content off these platforms \u2014 but when governments or bureaucracies suppress speech in the name of safety or regulation, it sets a dangerous precedent that threatens the core of Western democratic values,\u201d Jordan said.",
      "The issue may come to a head in a couple of different venues. That could be the courts if any tech companies file lawsuits over the law, or it could come up in trade negotiations if President Donald Trump decides to press the issue with British politicians, although they say it\u2019s not open to debate in trade talks.",
      "Marc Andreessen, a venture capitalist and Meta board member with close ties to the Trump administration, recently called U.K. leaders to complain about the law, the Financial Times reported Friday. A spokesperson for Andreessen said the report was not true.",
      "The U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act is one of the most comprehensive national laws that any democracy has ever passed to try to curtail potentially harmful content online in the name of children. Parliament passed the law in 2023, and the government went through two years of writing detailed rules before putting the law into effect last month.",
      "The law is notable for a combination of reasons: the variety of content it applies to, the potential fines and the possible international reach.",
      "A wide array of content is at issue. While the \u201cprimary\u201d focus of the law is online material such as pornography and suicide, it also requires websites to age-gate content with bullying, serious violence, \u201cdangerous stunts\u201d and \u201cexposure to harmful substances.\u201d That has covered relatively mainstream services such as Spotify and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox gaming system.",
      "Companies that don\u2019t comply face potential fines of up to 10% of their global revenue, which for the biggest companies could be billions of dollars. The British regulator Ofcom, short for Office of Communications, says companies must use \u201chighly effective age assurance\u201d to restrict the riskiest types of content.",
      "And the U.K. has not been adamant that it won\u2019t allow international borders to stymie enforcement. Ofcom says it plans to apply the law to services with \u201ca significant number\u201d of U.K. users, services where U.K. users \u201care a target market\u201d and services that are \u201ccapable of being accessed\u201d by U.K. users with a \u201cmaterial risk of significant harm\u201d to such users.",
      "The law appears to retain strong support among the British public. About 69% said they supported the new rules in a YouGov poll taken after implementation began, and 46% said they supported it \u201cstrongly.\u201d But 52% said they do not think the law will be very effective at preventing minors from accessing pornography.",
      "The law was passed during a previous, Conservative-led government and took effect under the current, Labour-led government.",
      "But the far-right party Reform U.K. is pushing for a repeal of the law. Party leader Nigel Farage, a former member of Parliament, has called it \u201cstate suppression of genuine free speech,\u201d and his party is running high in polls.",
      "\u201cMillions of people have noticed that what they\u2019re getting on their feeds is different to what it was,\u201d Farage said at a recent news conference.",
      "Farage also met with visiting members of Congress last week, and the talks turned heated with Farage and Democrats exchanging insults, according to Politico, although the dispute appeared to be more about Trump\u2019s free speech restrictions than about the U.K. law.",
      "Most U.S.-based tech companies say they are complying with the new law. Microsoft said in a blog post that Xbox users in the U.K. would begin seeing notifications \u201cencouraging them to verify their age\u201d as a \u201cone-time process,\u201d with actual enforcement starting next year. If users don\u2019t comply, Microsoft warned, they\u2019ll lose access to social features of Xbox but will still be able to play games.",
      "Discord said it was implementing new default settings for all U.K. users, in effect treating everyone like a minor with heavy content filtering unless they verify that they\u2019re adults. Discord says users can choose to verify their age either with a face scan or an ID upload.",
      "Elon Musk\u2019s X has also restricted posts, including information about the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, according to the BBC. X and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "But a few services are not complying. The far-right social media site Gab, which allows white supremacist views and other extremist content, said in a notice on its website that it had received notices from Ofcom and, rather than comply, decided to block the entire U.K. from accessing its site. The company said in the notice: \u201cWe refuse to comply with this tyranny.\u201d",
      "Preston Byrne, a U.S. lawyer who specializes in technology issues, has said on X that he plans to file a lawsuit soon on behalf of an unnamed client seeking to quash possible enforcement of the British law within the United States.",
      "The subject has been simmering for months ahead of the law\u2019s implementation, and it came up in February when British Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited the White House.",
      "In an Oval Office meeting, a reporter asked Trump what he thought of the U.K. approach to free speech, and Trump tossed the question to Vance, who expressed concern.",
      "\u201cWe do have, of course, a special relationship with our friends in the U.K. and also with some of our European allies. But we also know that there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British \u2014 of course, what the British do in their own country is up to them \u2014 but also affect American technology companies and, by extension, American citizens,\u201d he said.",
      "Starmer defended his government\u2019s approach.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom, and it will last for a very, very long time. Certainly, we wouldn\u2019t want to reach across U.S. systems and we don\u2019t, and that\u2019s absolutely right,\u201d he said.",
      "British Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy later said the U.K. would not make any changes to the Online Safety Act as part of trade negotiations with the Trump administration.",
      "American privacy advocates are watching the debate play out with alarm, concerned that similar age verification laws \u2014 like new state laws targeting the Apple and Google app stores \u2014 would upend the internet closer to home.",
      "\u201cYoung people should be able to access information, speak to each other and to the world, play games, and express themselves online without the government making decisions about what speech is permissible,\u201d wrote Paige Collings, a senior speech and privacy activist at the San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation, in a blog post Tuesday."

    "summary": "Alternative for Germany has joined France's National Rally and Reform U.K. in becoming the most popular party in its country, according to polls.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 For the first time in modern history, far-right and populist parties are simultaneously topping the polls in Europe\u2019s three main economies of Germany, France and Britain.",
      "A poll Tuesday showed Alternative for Germany \u2014 which is under surveillance by the country\u2019s intelligence services over suspected extremism \u2014 is now the most favored by voters. The survey by broadcaster RTL put the AfD at 26%, ahead of the ruling Christian Democrats at 24%.",
      "This is a high watermark for the European far right, a once fringe movement whose virulently anti-immigration, anti-Islam and culture-war politics were shunned by the mainstream just a decade ago. Today, these parties have developed deep ties with President Donald Trump and his Republican allies, who openly cite nationalists such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n as inspirations on policy and tactics.",
      "For years, France\u2019s National Rally has consistently led polls ahead of the country\u2019s next presidential election in 2027. And Britain\u2019s Reform U.K., led by Trump ally and friend Nigel Farage, has since April topped most polls there.",
      "Far-right parties have been elected over the past few years into the governments of Italy, Hungary and elsewhere. The center right and the center left have hemorrhaged votes amid high inflation, fears over immigration and collapsing faith in institutions \u2014 all familiar issues in America, too.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s polling milestone is \u201ca sign of the power of populism, disinformation and the failure of established parties to understand what is happening,\u201d said Nic Cheeseman, a professor of democracy and international development at England\u2019s University of Birmingham.",
      "Though the far right has been making gains for the past decade, Cheeseman believes the polls showing the far right leading Europe\u2019s top three economies is \u201ca first \u2014 at least in modern times.\u201d",
      "There is no guarantee that London, Berlin and Paris will be ruled by far-right parties; these countries\u2019 next elections are not until 2029, 2029 and 2027 respectively. These groups are all polling in the 20s and 30s percentage-wise, enough to lead polls in Europe\u2019s multiparty systems but not enough to govern alone outside of a coalition.",
      "Most of Europe\u2019s politicians on this former fringe reject the \u201cfar right\u201d label, with its historical connotations of the Nazism that marauded the continent 80 years ago. Many scholars say these parties nevertheless fit the academic model, defined by nativism \u2014 the idea that perceived \u201cnon-native\u201d groups threaten their social fabric \u2014 and harsh punishments for criminality.",
      "The roots of the far-right surge lie in the world financial crisis of 2008, which prompted government to cut budgets for public services and lowered living standards, some experts say, compounded by the Arab Spring of 2011 that birthed civil war in Syria and a mass refugee crisis in Europe four years later.",
      "More recent societal stressors such as the coronavirus pandemic and war in Ukraine have further increased the allure of populism, according to Hans-Jakob Schindler, the senior director of the Counter Extremism Project, a nonprofit international group. But populist parties in Europe have also harnessed social media more powerfully than their more centrist opponents, he said.",
      "\u201cThey are masters of using social media much better than any of the more established parties,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you have easy solutions to complex problems\u201d \u2014 as he says populist parties do \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s easier to communicate than complex political issues that the actual parties, who do politics rather than just doing populism, will have to deal with.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014  JD Vance got a very English welcome after he, his family and their large security detail rolled through the village of Charlbury this week, just not the kind the vice president would  have hoped for.",
      "Bathed in sunshine, dozens of demonstrators drank tea, ate cake  featuring a meme of the vice president\u2019s face and held up humorous placards Tuesday in the small community in the Cotswolds, as this part of the countryside is known.",
      "\u201cJD Vance Netflix password is \u2018password,\u2019\u201d said one handmade sign at a protest near where the Vances are vacationing some 100 miles west of the capital, London.",
      "A second sign declared that Vance \u201cclaps when the plane lands,\u201d referring to a practice mocked by some Britons who see it as very un-British overenthusiasm. Others held placards quoting Vance when he said he \u201cnever liked\u201d President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cCotswolds childless cat ladies say go home,\u201d another read, referring to comments Vance made to former Fox News host Tucker Carlson in 2021 about senior Democrats in Congress that resurfaced during last year\u2019s presidential race.",
      "In the nearby town of Chipping Norton, some locals said they were unprepared for the level of security disruption as some of the already tight roads in the area were closed for Vance\u2019s motorcade.",
      "Design manager Geoff Holliday, 51, said Wednesday he was \u201cgetting bored\u201d with the closures, adding that he was longing for the motorcade to be slowed down by \u201ca disgruntled farmer and a combine harvester.\u201d",
      "Nestled among the rolling hills that rise up from meadows of the upper River Thames, the Cotswolds\u2019 picture-postcard towns and villages have been popular with holidaymakers for centuries.",
      "More recently, the area has attracted a wealthier crowd.",
      "Chipping Norton and its surrounding area are known for the \u201cChipping Norton set,\u201d including former Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife, Samantha Cameron; Elizabeth Murdoch,  media executive and daughter of Rupert Murdoch; and more recently, comedian and talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.",
      "Former \"Top Gear\" presenter Jeremy Clarkson\u2019s \u201cDiddly Squat Farm\u201d in Chadlington is also nearby, and he shared an image on Instagram which highlighted how his farm is under a no-fly zone over the Cotswolds.",
      "Appearing to reference filming for his \u201cClarkson\u2019s Farm\u201d Amazon show, he wrote: \u201cThe JD Vance no fly zone. We are the pin. So on the downside, no drone shots today. On the upside, no annoying light aircraft.\u201d",
      "Later, he shared a video of a peaceful Cotswolds scene."

    "story": [
      "U.N.-backed investigators say they have found significant evidence of \u201csystematic torture\u201d at Myanmar detention centers, where the military government is holding children as young as 2 years old as proxies for their parents.",
      "The Southeast Asian nation of about 54 million people has been mired in turmoil since 2021, when democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi was overthrown by the military. The coup set off mass protests across the country that were violently suppressed, followed by a nationwide armed resistance movement that has displaced millions of people.",
      "Investigators said Tuesday there was evidence of \u201ca continued increase in the frequency and brutality of atrocities\u201d across Myanmar, with war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by government security forces and affiliated militias as well as armed opposition groups.",
      "That includes an increase in crimes committed against those in detention, many of whom are being held without due process, said Nicholas Koumjian, head of the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve documented torture against those in detention, including beatings and electric shocks, strangulations, pulling out fingernails, gang rape, burning of sexual body parts and other forms of sexual violence,\u201d he told reporters in Geneva as his team released its annual report.",
      "Koumjian said investigators had seen evidence that children as young as 2 years old were being detained, often in place of their parents if they are accused of being associated with the opposition and cannot be found.",
      "\u201cSome of the detained children have been subjected to torture, ill-treatment or sexual and gender-based crimes,\u201d the report says.",
      "Myanmar\u2019s military government has detained about 30,000 people in the past four years, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, an advocacy group that tracks arrests in the country.",
      "The Myanmar military could not be reached for comment. It has denied any atrocities are taking place and blamed \u201cterrorists\u201d for unrest.",
      "The 16-page report, which covers a one-year period up to June 30, draws on more than 1,300 sources, including nearly 600 eyewitness testimonies, photographs, videos, documents, maps and forensic evidence.",
      "Koumjian said the Myanmar military appeared to be increasing its use of airstrikes as it loses control of more territory. They continued even after a devastating earthquake in March, he said, often against \u201cblatantly civilian targets\u201d such as schools, hospitals and places of worship.",
      "\u201cOften there\u2019s no military target that we can identify anywhere in the area that could have been the intent of the airstrike,\u201d he said.",
      "Koumjian said investigators were working to determine how the airstrikes were ordered, who was in the chain of command and who flew the planes.",
      "In addition, he said, there is growing evidence of crimes committed by opposition forces, including summary executions of captured fighters from other armed groups.",
      "The team is also still investigating the 2017 Rohingya refugee crisis, during which more than 700,000 people from the mostly Muslim ethnic minority fled a military crackdown in Buddhist-majority Myanmar for neighboring Bangladesh. Along with other ethnic groups, the remaining Rohingya population is again in danger as they are persecuted by the Arakan Army rebel group that now has effective control of Rakhine state, their ancestral home.",
      "Koumjian said investigators had made progress in identifying some of the people responsible for crimes in Myanmar, including commanders overseeing detention facilities, and that \u201cwe stand ready to support any jurisdictions willing and able to prosecute these crimes.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are working towards the day when the perpetrators will have to answer for their actions in a court of law,\u201d he said in a news release.",
      "The work of Myanmar investigators is already being used in cases before the International Criminal Court (ICC), the International Court of Justice and in Argentina. In November, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the head of Myanmar\u2019s military government, for crimes committed against the Rohingya.",
      "Min Aung Hlaing tightened his grip on power last month in an administrative restructuring as the junta said it was ending the state of emergency it declared in 2021. A general election is planned for December but faces a widespread boycott by critics who say it will be neither free nor fair."

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration released its new, drastically scaled-down version of the State Department\u2019s annual human rights report after months of delay Tuesday. The administration\u2019s assessment of human rights abuses in some countries, which is one-tenth as long as last year\u2019s report, reaches notably different conclusions and dedicates no sections to abuses against women or LGBTQ people.",
      "The report also places a new focus on restrictions of freedom of expression by U.S. adversaries and allies alike.",
      "Amanda Klasing, Amnesty International USA\u2019s national director of government relations and advocacy, said the Trump administration had engaged in highly selective documentation of human rights abuses in certain countries.",
      "\u201cWe have criticized past reports when warranted, but have never seen reports quite like this,\u201d Klasing said in a statement. \u201cNever before have the reports gone this far in prioritizing an administration\u2019s political agenda over a consistent and truthful accounting of human rights violations around the world \u2014 softening criticism in some countries while ignoring violations in others.\u201d",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce defended the administration\u2019s version of the report, which U.S. diplomats have compiled for nearly 50 years under a congressional mandate to measure countries\u2019 adherence to internationally recognized human rights.",
      "\u201cThe Human Rights Report has been restructured in a way that removes redundancy, increases report readability, and is responsive to the legislative mandates that underpin the report, rather than an expansive list of politically biased demands and assertions,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cIndividual reports are more readable, objective, true to their statutory origins, and more useful than ever before.\u201d",
      "Criticism of Europe",
      "In the United Kingdom, France, Germany and other European countries, the Trump administration concluded that the human rights situation \u201cworsened during the year.\u201d The report cited restrictions on freedom of expression, as well as reports of \u201ccrimes, violence, or threats of violence motivated by antisemitism.\u201d",
      "In Germany, the report found \u201climits on the speech of groups it deemed extremist.\u201d In France, the State Department found \u201csome limitations on freedom of speech.\u201d And the assessment listed restrictions on political speech in the U.K. it deemed \u201chateful\u201d or \u201coffensive.\u201d",
      "The concerns were similar to those Vice President JD Vance expressed in a speech to the Munich Security Conference in February. Vance accused European Union leaders of suppressing free speech, particularly that off far-right groups.",
      "Asked by reporters about the Trump administration\u2019s review of visa applicants\u2019 social media accounts, Bruce said: \u201cWe consider freedom of expression to be a foundational component of a functioning democracy. Societies are strengthened by free expression of opinion and government censorship is intolerable in a free society.\u201d",
      "Support for Brazil's former president",
      "The human rights situation also declined in Brazil last year, the Trump administration concluded, citing court rulings that it called \u201cbroad and disproportionate action to undermine freedom of speech and internet freedom.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe government undermined democratic debate by restricting access to online content deemed to \u2018undermine democracy,\u2019 disproportionately suppressing the speech of supporters of former president Jair Bolsonaro as well as journalists and elected politicians, often in secret proceedings that lacked due process guarantees,\u201d the report says.",
      "Bolsonaro is currently on trial for allegedly plotting to assassinate his rivals to remain in office despite his loss in the 2022 election.",
      "The report also criticizes Supreme Federal Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who has overseen Bolsonaro\u2019s court case, saying he \u201cpersonally ordered the suspension of more than 100 user profiles on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), disproportionately suppressing the speech of advocates of former president Jair Bolsonaro.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently sanctioned de Moraes, revoking U.S. visas for him and members of his family.",
      "Questioning a South African law",
      "The report found the human rights situation had \u201csignificantly worsened\u201d in South Africa, which Trump has repeatedly criticized since he returned to office. That was in sharp contrast with the State Department human rights report the Biden administration issued last year, which found no significant changes in human rights in South Africa.",
      "The report called the Expropriation Act, a law that attempts to address the disparity in land ownership between white and Black South Africans, \u201ca substantially worrying step towards land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has publicly decried the law, which allows the South African government to expropriate land \u2014 in some cases without compensation \u2014 in instances where it is unused or there is a public interest in its redistribution. Earlier this year, the administration resettled 59 white South Africans as refugees in the United States as it blocked refugee admissions from almost all other countries.",
      "\u201cThe government did not take credible steps to investigate, prosecute, and punish officials who committed human rights abuses,\u201d the report said, \u201cincluding inflammatory racial rhetoric against Afrikaners and other racial minorities, or violence against racial minorities.\u201d",
      "No 'significant' abuses in El Salvador",
      "The report said that in El Salvador, which imprisoned hundreds of migrants from the United States at the request of the Trump administration, there were \u201cno credible reports of significant human rights abuses.\u201d",
      "But several Venezuelan migrants who had been imprisoned in El Salvador\u2019s notorious CECOT prison told NBC News they had experienced physical and psychological torture. One man said he was sexually assaulted.",
      "The Biden administration\u2019s human rights report on El Salvador last year was four times longer than the Trump administration\u2019s. It listed several significant human rights issues in the country, including credible reports of \u201cunlawful or arbitrary killings; enforced disappearance; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by security forces and harsh and life-threatening prison conditions.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s report also removed the section on Indigenous peoples and made no mention of elections or political participation in El Salvador.",
      "Shorter passages on Israel, the West Bank and Gaza",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s reports on Israel, the West Bank and Gaza were also dramatically shorter and had significantly less documentation of abuses by the Israeli government, the Palestinian Authority and Hamas than the Biden administration reports did last year.",
      "In assessing Israel, the Trump administration cited reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings, enforced disappearance and degrading treatment of Palestinians by Israeli officials but emphasized that they resulted from the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack by Hamas. The State Department\u2019s findings also concluded that the Israeli government \u201ctook several credible steps to identify officials who committed human rights abuses, with multiple trials pending at year\u2019s end.\u201d",
      "The report listed significant human rights abuses by the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, including \u201carbitrary or unlawful killings; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; arbitrary arrest or detention; serious restrictions on freedom of expression and trafficking in persons, including forced labor; and existence of the worst forms of child labor.\u201d",
      "The report also included a detailed description of abuses by Hamas in Gaza, including, \u201cunlawful killings, severe physical abuses and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d",
      "Regarding human rights abuses by Israeli security forces in the West Bank and Gaza, the report said simply that \u201cthere have been reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings; and serious restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom.\u201d But it again added that \u201cIsraeli authorities took steps to identify and punish officials or civilians accused of committing human rights abuses.\u201d And it did point out that human rights groups \u201cfrequently criticized authorities for not adequately pursuing investigations and disciplinary actions.\u201d",
      "The report made no direct mention of the Israeli government\u2019s restrictions on humanitarian aid into Gaza or documented reports of starvation among some Palestinians this year. But it did highlight that in the West Bank, incidents of Israeli violence against Palestinians and their property reached their highest daily average figure since the United Nations started recording data in 2005.",
      "War crimes allegations against Russia",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s assessment of human rights in Russia is less than half as long as the same assessment in the Biden administration\u2019s report. Both reports cited allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity and abuses by Russian forces and officials in the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "The assessment also pointed to human rights groups\u2019 concerns domestically, among them that Russian officials used new laws to punish dissent and limit independent expression. It did not dedicate a section to Russian government corruption as the Biden administration did.",
      "The new report said that \u201cRussia\u2019s occupation and purported annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula and four oblasts in eastern Ukraine affected significantly and negatively the human rights situation there.\u201d It also described \u201ccredible reports of politically motivated arrests, detentions, and trials of Ukrainian citizens in Russia, many of whom claimed to have been tortured.\u201d",
      "It also called the deportation of thousands of civilians to Russia, including children, a crime against humanity."

      "But support for Israel remains ironclad among many American Jewish groups and rabbis, who argue that Hamas is preventing humanitarian aid from reaching innocent civilians.",
      "\u201cIsrael has facilitated an extraordinary amount of aid to Palestinians in Gaza, in wartime, and that\u2019s really an unprecedented situation,\u201d said Belle Etra Yoeli, spokesperson for the American Jewish Committee, which recently ran a full-page ad in The New York Times with the image of an Israeli hostage who remains in Hamas custody.",
      "\u201cThe Palestinian civilians who have been caught in the crossfire throughout this entire war because of Hamas\u2019 actions should not be suffering,\u201d she added. \u201cIsrael doesn\u2019t want that.\u201d",
      "Nearly 1,400 people have been killed and more than 4,000 have been injured seeking food in Gaza, the United Nations\u2019 Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said last week.",
      "At least 859 people have been killed near sites operated by Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, or GHF, a controversial American- and Israeli-backed organization, the United Nations said.",
      "The foundation's executive director, Johnnie Moore, said Hamas is largely responsible for the killings and dismissed news reports about people dying by Israeli gunfire.",
      "\u201cWe have not seen the Israeli military do anything that remotely aligns with some of these accusations,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt is a quite evident fact that Hamas has killed intentionally probably hundreds of people in proximity not to just our sites, to U.N. distribution sites, as a means of sort of misattributing those attacks either to the IDF or to being in proximity to GHF,\u201d he added, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.",
      "To address escalating concerns over the humanitarian crisis, synagogues across Jewish movements in the United States have organized roundtables with the executive director of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.",
      "At an event with GHF hosted last month by Sinai Temple in Los Angeles, reactions were mixed, according to Sherman, the rabbi, who led the discussion.",
      "Some people were shocked that an organization that has come under so much criticism was allowed to present its case. Others appreciated hearing directly from people on the ground.",
      "\u201cHow do you block evil from your midst while also feeding the hungry and supporting the orphan and widow?\u201d Sherman said after the roundtable, referring to Psalm 146. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s an impossible task, and I give credit to somebody who is at least trying to do that.\u201d",
      "Polling suggests Jewish Americans are divided over Netanyahu\u2019s handling of the war. According to a Pew Research Center report, 53% of Jewish Americans say they lack confidence in his leadership, while 45% say they have confidence. About 6 million Jews live in the United States, or 2% of the population, according to the Pew Research Center.",
      "The poll was conducted in April, before GHF began its operations in Gaza.",
      "Supporters of Netanyahu\u2019s government, including several Jewish American organizations, have said Hamas is spreading misleading information about who is to blame for ongoing violence at aid sites, a claim Hamas has repeatedly denied. They have also criticized detractors for losing focus on the remaining Israeli hostages held captive by Hamas.",
      "\u201cAll of this can just be stopped anytime if Hamas puts down its weapons,\u201d said Orthodox Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization that supports Netanyahu\u2019s government.",
      "An emerging concern echoed by several organizations and rabbis is that Netanyahu\u2019s position is not creating a safer Israel or global environment for Jewish people. Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of nonprofit advocacy organization J Street, said the ongoing violence is exposing Israelis and Palestinians to unnecessary bloodshed.",
      "J Street, which supports a two-state solution, opposed Netanyahu years before the war.",
      "\u201cIf you say to people you must be pro-Palestinian or pro-Israel, then we\u2019re condemning ourselves and our kids to a never-ending conflict,\u201d Ben-Ami said Monday.",
      "But according to Rabbi Ari Lev Fornari of Kol Tzedek, a Reconstructionist synagogue in Philadelphia, the war is creating an \u201cexistential rupture\u201d that is pitting friends and family members against one another.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s catastrophic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re wrestling with the very question \u2018Do we belong to each other?\u2019\u201d",
      "Fornari was among more than 40 people arrested outside Trump Tower in a rally organized by IfNotNow, a group that opposes the war in Gaza Strip, in New York City earlier this month as they shouted for the United States to stop arming Israel and feed Gaza. He was arrested for investigation of blocking traffic and obstruction, his third arrest since the war started on Oct. 7, 2023, he said.",
      "Some posters and signs displayed outside Trump Tower referred to an ancient maxim about the moral obligation to speak out against injustice, Fornari said.",

      "Rabbi Jill Jacobs, the CEO of T\u2019ruah, a rabbinic human rights organization, said she supported Israel\u2019s military response to Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack in 2023, which killed 1,200 people and led to the taking of 250 hostages. The strike, the worst one-day attack on Jews since the Holocaust, shocked the world.",
      "Since then, more than 61,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, and much of the territory has been destroyed.",
      "Jacobs began questioning Netanyahu\u2019s strategy as more and more civilians in Gaza were killed, she said. In July, she denounced American Jewish leaders who had not spoken out against the humanitarian crisis unfolding thousands of miles away.",
      "\u201cPrivately, Jewish lay leaders are anguished over Gaza. Publicly, they fear being labeled antisemitic,\u201d she wrote in an opinion column in The Forward, a Jewish American newspaper.",
      "Jacobs has been called antisemitic by other Jewish people who support Netanyahu and shunned by legacy Jewish organizations, she said. Some of it, she said, comes from a legitimate fear of prejudice.",
      "In May, two Israeli Embassy staffers were killed outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., and a Colorado pro-Israeli hostages group was attacked with two Molotov cocktails in June. There have also been reports of anti-Jewish slurs and signs at college campuses and pro-Palestinian protests across the country.",
      "The cultural fallout has been playing out in living rooms and across kitchen tables. Sonya Meyerson-Knox, a spokesperson for the anti-Zionist group Jewish Voice for Peace, which has opposed the war since 2023, said a member was uninvited to Shabbat family dinners because of differing opinions about the war.",
      "The group was suspended from several campuses, including Columbia University\u2019s, over allegations it intimidated Jewish students and made them feel unsafe during pro-Palestinian protests last year. Jewish Voice for Peace maintains that its views are not antisemitic.",
      "\u201cIt is not unique in Jewish history for Jews to be in fierce disagreement with each other,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is unique is that there seems to be an effort to weaponize one-half of our community against the other.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Russian forces may have punched a small but significant hole through Ukraine\u2019s front lines, Kyiv-supporting military analysts warned Tuesday, a development that could give Vladimir Putin a boost ahead of his Alaska summit with President Donald Trump.",
      "Advanced units have pushed farther into Ukrainian-held territory in the Donetsk region, creating two narrow, 10-mile prongs near the battlefield hot spot town of Pokrovsk, according to watchdogs including Ukraine's Deep State and Washington's Institute for the Study of War, two of the top open-source teams tracking the war's battlefield developments.",
      "Expert observers supportive or at least sympathetic to Kyiv are deeply worried that these forays could expand into a full-scale breakthrough for the Kremlin. Already claiming he is winning this war, and refusing to stop fighting unless Ukraine surrenders, Putin could use such a development to lobby for an even more favorable peace deal in Alaska.",
      "\u201cGuys. We are in trouble here,\u201d Rima Ziuraitis, an American enlisted as a medic in the Ukrainian armed forces, posted to X. \u201cWhile Putin and Trump keep everyone distracted, Russia has broken through our lines in Pokrovsk. The situation is critical.\u201d",
      "Though small, the Russian breakthroughs represent a far quicker land grab than either side has managed in months. The concern for Ukraine is that Russia would be able to expand outward into poorly defended parts of Donetsk. The advance may have also cut off a crucial resupply highway to Ukraine\u2019s \u201cfortress\u201d city of Kramatorsk, according to those watching the troop movements.",
      "Pasi Paroinen, an analyst with Finland\u2019s Black Bird Group, which tracks the conflict, told NBC News that if the Russians do break through and consolidate, \u201cit could be very bad for the Ukrainians.\u201d",
      "This push may have been timed ahead of the Putin-Trump summit, he added.",
      "\u201cThe Russians have had a tendency to intensify military operations in support of ongoing negotiations so the current events would fit into that picture quite well,\u201d Paroinen said, adding that \u201cwe don\u2019t have enough information yet\u201d to be sure.",
      "The next 24-48 hours will likely be \u201ccrucial\u201d in whether Ukraine is able to stanch the Russian advance before Moscow reinforces these advanced units, he posted to X earlier. \u201cClearly the Ukrainians have a crisis on their hands,\u201d he wrote.",
      "A Ukrainian military spokesperson told NBC News that breakthroughs were being made only by small groups of Russian \u201cinfiltrators\u201d \u2014 who are being quickly found and \u201cdestroyed\u201d \u2014 rather than larger units capable of taking and controlling territory.",
      "Viktor Tregubov, spokesperson of Ukraine\u2019s \u201cDnipro\u201d strategic group of troops, downplayed the severity of the maneuvers.",
      "\u201cOf course, the situation there is and remains difficult, and the fighting in this region is the most intense compared to other sections of the front line,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cHowever, the Ukrainian troops are making every effort to ensure that even those groups of Russians who managed to infiltrate through the first line are destroyed as soon as possible \u2014 which is what happens.\u201d",
      "The severity of the situation was made clear by the 1st Azov Corps \u2014 seen as among the most adept fighters Ukraine has \u2014 announcing Tuesday it had been deployed to the region.",
      "All eyes on Alaska",
      "The question of who is winning the war will be a key point in Trump\u2019s summit with Putin on Friday.",

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has not been invited \u2014 \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a part of it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s been there for 3 1/2 years \u2014 nothing happened\u201d \u2014 creating Europe-wide panic that its and Kyiv\u2019s interests will be disregarded by Washington and Moscow."

      "Lin faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a fine up to $250,000 or twice the gain or loss from the illegal activity when he is sentenced on Dec. 23, according to the DOJ.",
      "\u201cAs part of his plea, Lin also agreed to abandon any property interest in the reptiles seized during the investigation,\u201d the department said.",
      "In a similar case in March, another Chinese national, Sai Keung Tin, also known as Ricky Tin, was sentenced to 30 months in prison for smuggling more than 2,100 eastern box turtles, the DOJ said at the time.",
      "The animals were also hidden in socks and packed in boxes labeled as almonds and chocolate cookies. Authorities estimated at the time that each turtle could have been sold for $2,000, bringing the total value of the smuggled reptiles to $4.2 million."

      "The new deadline would be Nov. 10.",
      "\u201cAll other elements of the Agreement will remain the same,\u201d Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "In a statement accompanying an executive order, the White House said the administration would be holding \u201congoing negotiations\u201d with China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, to \u201cresolve trade disputes and strengthen economic ties.\u201d",
      "\u201cEach round of negotiations with the Chinese has built on each other, further strengthening economic cooperation,\u201d the White House added.",

      "For companies and consumers, another pause means continued uncertainty as President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariff regime enters its fifth month.",
      "Last week, import taxes went into effect for dozens of countries. Prices have ticked up in the United States while existing tariffs on imports from China and others work their way into the economy, with companies eating much of the higher costs and consumers absorbing some. Trump has downplayed inflation concerns and lauded the tens of billions of dollars in federal revenue from the levies.",
      "This is the second time the Trump administration has delayed imposing even higher tariffs on China, which is one of America\u2019s largest trading partners. In 2024, the United States imported more than $438 billion worth of Chinese goods, including everything from clothing to electronics to toys.",
      "While there is no deal in hand, there has been movement on a few fronts. Just days ago, Trump authorized American tech companies Nvidia and AMD to resume selling some of their artificial intelligence semiconductors to China. China has also reportedly eased some restrictions on exports of rare earth metals. Those were key issues for both sides.",
      "Trump\u2019s back-and-forth with China over tariffs started just days after he re-entered office. In early February, he imposed a 10% tariff on all imports from China, which quickly retaliated with higher tariffs of its own. Then, on April 2, Trump said he would slap a 34% tariff on China.",
      "A week later, after China hiked its tariffs on U.S. goods to 84%, Trump said on Truth Social: \u201cBased on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World\u2019s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately.\u201d That brought U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to a total of 145% versus 125% in Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods, amounting to a mutual trade embargo.",
      "Seeking to defuse the tension, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met with their Chinese counterparts in Geneva in early May. Following those talks, both countries lowered their tariffs by 115 percentage points for 90 days, to 30% on Chinese goods and 10% on U.S. goods.",
      "Just weeks later, Trump said on Truth Social that \u201cChina, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US.\u201d U.S. officials later said that China was \u201cslow rolling\u201d the delivery of rare earths.",
      "Bessent and Greer met again with their counterparts, namely Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, in London in mid-June. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also joined those talks, which yielded positive language.",
      "\u201cThe two largest economies in the world have reached a handshake for a framework,\u201d Lutnick said at the conclusion of the London talks. Since that meeting, the details of that framework agreement have not been released or published by either government.",
      "A full-fledged trade deal with China remains elusive despite at least seven days of face-to-face talks this year between high- ranking officials on both sides.",
      "\u201cBeijing will be happy to keep the U.S.-China negotiation going, but it is unlikely to make concessions,\u201d said William Yang, a senior Northeast Asia analyst for the International Crisis Group who is based in Taiwan.",
      "\u201cChina believes momentum is on its side because Trump has a stronger desire to sign a deal with Beijing so that he can claim victory and secure a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the fall,\u201d Yang said.",

The group also said the RSF looted the properties of those people and stole their money and livestock. Those displaced ended up arriving at Khartoum and White Nile provinces last week."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0President Donald Trump said Monday that he would try to return territory to Ukraine as he prepares to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and lay the groundwork for a deal to bring an end to the grinding multiyear war between Ukraine and Russia.",
      "\u201cRussia has occupied a big portion of Ukraine. They\u2019ve occupied some very prime territory. We\u2019re going to try and get some of that territory back for Ukraine,\u201d Trump said at a news conference at the White House.",
      "Trump said he\u2019s going to see what Putin \u201chas in mind\u201d to end the war and, if it\u2019s a \u201cfair deal,\u201d he will share it with European and NATO leaders, as well as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who have been liaising closely with Washington ahead of the meeting.",
      "Asked Monday if Zelenskyy was invited to the meeting Friday with Putin in Alaska, Trump said that the Ukrainian leader \u201cwasn\u2019t a part of it\u201d and that despite his having participated in numerous sitdowns over the course of the war, little has come of them. \u201cI would say he could go, but he\u2019s gone to a lot of meetings. You know, he\u2019s been there for three and a half years \u2014 nothing happened,\u201d Trump added.",
      "The president's first call out of the Putin meeting, which he referred to as \u201creally a feel-out,\u201d would be to Zelenskyy \u201cout of respect.\u201d  He noted that he might tell Zelenskyy \"\u2018lots of luck, keep fighting,\u2019 or I may say, \u2018We can make a deal.\u2019\"",
      "The comments came during a winding press conference to discuss efforts to fight crime in Washington, D.C., with a plan to federalize the city\u2019s police force.",
      "During his remarks, the president noted how even following \u201ca great call\u201d with Putin in the past, \u201cmissiles would be lobbed into Kyiv or some other place, and you\u2019d have 60 people laying on a road dying,\u201d a nod to the challenge of reaching a deal.",
      "A follow-up meeting could include Zelenskyy and Putin, and perhaps Trump himself, the president added. He said he would \u201cbe there if they need.\u201d",
      "But Trump said a Zelenskyy and Putin meeting was the only way to bring the conflict to a close.",
      "\u201cNow, I will say this, ultimately, I\u2019m going to put the two of them in a room, I\u2019ll be there or won\u2019t be there, and I think it\u2019ll get solved,\u201d the president added.",
      "He said he would like to see a ceasefire and reach the \u201cbest deal that could be made for both parties.\u201d",
      "But \u201cthere\u2019ll be some swapping, there\u2019ll be some changes in land,\u201d Trump said, returning to the idea of \u201cland swaps,\u201d which he said Friday would be \u201cto the betterment of both.\u201d Zelenskyy, though, has been unwavering in his position that Ukraine should not cede any territory to Russia; European allies have agreed that giving up lands would encourage further Russian aggression.",
      "\u201cThe answer to Ukraine\u2019s territorial question is already in the constitution of Ukraine,\u201d Zelenskyy said Saturday. \u201cNo one will and no one can deviate from it. Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.\u201d",
      "Trump announced last week that he is meeting with Putin on Friday in Alaska as he tries to reach a ceasefire in Ukraine. The White House had initially held out a meeting with Putin and Zelenskyy as a condition for a meeting between Trump and the Russian president to take place, but Trump later said that was not a precondition.",
      "The White House emphasized over the weekend that the priority is the upcoming one-on-one with Putin, even as it weighed the prospect of a future meeting with Zelenskyy.",
      "\u201cNext Friday will be important, because it will be about testing Putin, how serious he is on bringing this terrible war to an end,\u201d NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said over the weekend on ABC.",
      "Trump\u2019s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with Putin in Moscow last week ahead of an Aug. 8 deadline that the president had set for the Russian leader to agree to a ceasefire or face new sanctions.",
      "Putin proposed the outlines of an agreement to end the war that would allow Russia to hold sweeping Ukrainian territory, but has not agreed to a ceasefire.",
      "Zelenskyy has urged stronger international pressure on Russia, warning against concessions to Moscow.",
      "\u201cAnother week has ended without any attempt by Russia to agree to the numerous demands of the world and stop the killings,\u201d the Ukrainian leader said on X.",
      "\u201cRussia is dragging out the war, and therefore it deserves stronger global pressure. Russia refuses to stop the killings, and therefore must not receive any rewards or benefits. And this is not just a moral position \u2014 it is a rational one. Concessions do not persuade a killer. But truly strong protection of life stops the killers,\u201d he added."
