      "Can one documentary encapsulate the life of Martin Scorsese",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The first time the filmmaker Rebecca Miller met Martin Scorsese was on the set of 2002's \u201cGangs of New York.\u201d Miller\u2019s husband, Daniel Day-Lewis, was starring in it. There, Miller found an anxious Scorsese on the precipice of the film\u2019s enormous fight scene, shot on a sprawling set.",
      "\u201cHe seemed like a young man, hoping that he had chosen the right way to shoot a massive scene,\u201d Miller recalls. \u201cI was stunned by how youthful and alive he was.\u201d",
      "That remains much the same throughout Miller\u2019s expansive and stirring documentary portrait of the endlessly energetic and singularly essential filmmaker. In \u201cMr. Scorsese,\u201d which premieres Friday on Apple TV, Miller captures the life and career of Scorsese, whose films have made one of the greatest sustained arguments for the power of cinema.",
      "\u201cWe talk about 32 films, which is a lot of films. But there are yet more films,\u201d Miller says, referencing Scorsese\u2019s projects to come. \u201cIt\u2019s a life that overspills its own bounds. You think you\u2019ve got it, and then it\u2019s more and more and more.\u201d",
      "Scorsese\u2019s life has long had a mythic arc: The asthmatic kid from Little Italy who grew up watching old movies on television and went on to make some of the defining New York films. That\u2019s a part of \u201cMr. Scorsese,\u201d too, but Miller\u2019s film, culled from 20 hours of interviews with Scorsese over five years, is a more intimate, reflective and often funny conversation about the compulsions that drove him and the abiding questions \u2014 of morality, faith and filmmaking \u2014 that have guided him.",
      "\u201cWho are we? What are we, I should say?\u201d Scorsese says in the opening moments of the series. \u201cAre we intrinsically good or evil?\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the struggle,\u201d he adds. \u201cI struggle with it all the time.\u201d",
      "Miller began interviewing Scorsese during the pandemic. He was then beginning to make \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon.\u201d Their first meetings were outside. Miller first pitched the idea to Scorsese as a multifaceted portrait. Then, she imagined a two-hour documentary. Later, by necessity, it turned into a five-hour series. It still feels too short.",
      "\u201cI explained I wanted to take a cubist approach, with different shafts of light on him from all different perspectives \u2014 collaborators, family,\u201d Miller says. \u201cWithin a very short amount of time, he sort of began talking as if we were doing it. I was a bit confused, thinking, \u2018Is this a job interview or a planning situation?\u2019\u201d",
      "Scorsese\u2019s own documentaries have often been some of the most insightful windows into him. In one of his earliest films, \u201cItalianamerican\u201d (1974), he interviewed his parents. His surveys of cinema, including 1995\u2019s \u201cA Personal Journey With Martin Scorsese Through American Movies\u201d and 1999\u2019s \u201cMy Voyage to Italy,\u201d have been especially revealing of the inspirations that formed him. Scorsese has never penned a memoir, but these movies come close.",
      "While the bulk of \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d are the director\u2019s own film-to-film recollections, a wealth of other personalities color in the portrait. That includes collaborators like editor Thelma Schoonmaker, Paul Schrader, Robert De Niro, Leonardo DiCaprio and Day-Lewis. It also includes Scorsese\u2019s children, his ex-wives and his old Little Italy pals. One, Salvatore \u201cSally Gaga\u201d Uricola for the first time is revealed as the model for De Niro\u2019s troublemaking, mailbox-blowing-up Johnny Boy in \u201cMean Streets.\u201d",

      "\u201cCinema consumed him at such an early age and it never left him,\u201d DiCaprio says in the film. \u201cThere will never be anyone like him again,\u201d says Steven Spielberg.",
      "It can be easy to think of Scorsese, perhaps the most revered living filmmaker, as an inevitability, that of course he gets to make the films he wants. But \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d is a reminder how often that wasn\u2019t the case and how frequently Scorsese found himself on the outside of Hollywood, whether due to box-office disappointment, a clash of style or the perceived danger in controversial subjects (\u201cTaxi Driver,\u201d \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ\u201d) he was drawn to.",
      "\u201cHe was fighting for every single film,\u201d Miller says. \u201cCutting this whole thing was like riding a bucking bronco. You\u2019re up and you\u2019re down, you\u2019re dead, then alive.\u201d",
      "Film executives today, an especially risk-averse lot, could learn some lessons from \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d in what a difference they can make for a personal filmmaker. As discussed in the film, in the late \u201970s, producer Irwin Winkler refused to do \u201cRocky II\u201d with United Artists unless they also made \u201cRaging Bull.\u201d",
      "For Miller, whose films include \u201cThe Ballad of Jack and Rose\u201d and \u201cMaggie\u2019s Plan,\u201d being around Scorsese was an education. She found his films began to infect \u201cMr. Scorsese.\u201d The cutting of the documentary took on the style of his film\u2019s editing. \u201cIn proximity to these film,\u201d she says, \u201cyou start to breathe the air.\u201d",
      "Nearness to Scorsese also inevitably means movie recommendations. Lots of them. One that stood out for Miller was \u201cThe Insect Woman,\u201d Japanese filmmaker Sh\u014dhei Imamura\u2019s 1963 drama about three generations of women.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s still doing it,\u201d Miller says. \u201cHe\u2019s still sending me movies.\u201d",
      "\u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d recently debuted at the New York Film Festival, where Miller's son, Ronan Day-Lewis made his directorial debut with \u201cAnemone,\u201d a film that marked her husband's return from retirement. At the \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d premiere, a packed audience at Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall came to enthusiastically revel in, and pay tribute to its subject.",
      "\u201cYou hear all those people laughing with him or suddenly bursting into applause when they see Thelma Schoonmaker or at the end of the \u2018Last Waltz\u2019 sequence,\u201d Miller says. \u201cThere was a sense of such palpable enthusiasm and love. My husband said something I thought was very beautiful: It reminded everyone of how much they love him.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Broadway is a tense place these days after two major labor unions authorized strike action amid ongoing contract negotiations with producers.",
      "Actors\u2019 Equity Association \u2014 which represents over 51,000 members, including singers, actors, dancers and stage managers \u2014 and American Federation of Musicians Local 802 \u2014 which represents 1,200 musicians \u2014 have voted in favor of a strike authorization, a strategic step ahead of any work stoppage. No strike has been called.",
      "Members of both unions are currently working under expired contracts. The musicians\u2019 contract expired on Aug. 31, and the Equity contract expired on Sept. 28.",
      "Both unions want pay increases and higher contributions by producers toward employee health care costs, a key sticking point. Actors Equity also wants producers to hire more backup performers and stage managers, add protections for performers in the event of injury and put limits on how many performances in a row actors can be asked to do without a day off.",
      "The health of Broadway \u2014 once very much in doubt due to the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 is now very good, at least in terms of box office. The 2024-2025 season took in $1.9 billion, the highest-grossing season in recorded history, overtaking the pre-pandemic previous high of $1.8 billion during the 2018-2019 season. It has been a long road back from the days when theaters were shuttered and the future looked bleak.",
      "The unions are pointing to the financial health of Broadway to argue that producers can afford to up pay and benefits for musicians and actors. Producers, represented by The Broadway League, counter that the health of Broadway could be endangered by increasing ticket prices.",

      "Diane Keaton never really played the part of glamorous movie star. She was in iconic films and she dated some of the biggest stars of her generation, and yet she somehow remained other and defiantly herself despite so many years working in the Hollywood system. Eccentric and approachable, with a sort of effervescent charm, it\u2019s no surprise that she played muse to so many, from Woody Allen to Nancy Meyers.",
      "People often describe her as self-deprecating, as if it was a choice and not a product of deep-seated insecurity. Keaton was someone who thought herself ugly, who battled eating disorders and who never seemed to give herself enough credit for her successes. But she was also able to channel that into her performances spanning five decades unlike none other.",
      "There are so many Keaton films worth noting, including her full run with Allen. There are the Instagram favorites like \u201cThe First Wives Club\u201d (available to rent), nostalgic classics like \u201cFather of the Bride\u201d (streaming on Hulu) and dramatic turns in \u201cMarvin\u2019s Room\u201d (streaming on Kanopy) and \u201cShoot the Moon\u201d (available to rent).",
      "Here are six essential roles to get you started.",
      "Kay Adams, the future Mrs. Corleone, could have been a wallpaper role. But Keaton, in her breakout role, held the screen next to her flashier counterparts. She was the wife who had something going on behind her eyes, who could hold the screen in the chilling final shot of the first film. Social media doesn\u2019t often produce anything worthwhile but in 2023 Francis Ford Coppola and Keaton had an exchange on an Instagram story \u201cask me anything\u201d session. She wondered why he\u2019d picked her.",

      "JOHANNESBURG -- JOHANNESBURG (AP) \u2014 South Africa's health minister on Tuesday called lenacapavir, the first twice-yearly HIV prevention jab in the world, a \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d tool to fight the disease, but warned initial donated supply would be limited to nearly half a million people in the African country with the highest prevalence rate.",
      "This comes just weeks after the U.S. announced plans to buy 2 million doses of the HIV prevention drug for low-income countries.",
      "The initial supply in South Africa is set to begin in April 2026, funded by a $29.2 million Global Fund grant with an additional $5 million allocated by the Networking HIV and AIDS Community of Southern Africa (NACOSA).",
      "Addressing a national healthcare roundtable dialogue in Johannesburg, Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said the Global Funds\u2019 catalytic commitment will deliver around 456,000 lenacapavir initiations over two years, translating into 912,000 doses.",
      "\u201cWe plan to roll out lenacapavir initially in about 23 high-incident districts across six provinces, targeting around 360 high-performing public clinics within these areas for phase one implementation,\u201d said the minister.",
      "\u201cAbout half a million people will be able to begin using lenacapavir, and thanks to this support, but demand will likely outstrip supply at first,\u201d said Motsoaledi, highlighting that research data suggested that prioritizing vulnerable populations in high-burden districts first would result in the highest impact in terms of new infections prevented.",
      "The minister was quick to caution against complacency with the initial investment after South Africa\u2019s health system was significantly hit by the abrupt cuts to funding from USAID and other U.S. government sources in early 2025. These cuts have had a severe impact on HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (TB) treatment, prevention, and research programs across the country.",
      "Although Motsoaledi expressed gratitude that Gilead had lowered the price from the $28,000, initially touted to $40, per person annually, he said that South Africa aimed to fund its program independently, with long-term funding hinging on lenacapavir\u2019s integration into local systems, such as the essential medicines list.",
      "The World Health Organization in July recommended the six-month HIV prevention jab that\u2019s already approved in the U.S. and Europe, as an additional prevention choice as part of combination approaches. Gilead is expediting registration in 18 high-incidence countries, including South Africa, to deliver lenacapavir until generic versions become available in 2027.",
      "Early in October, Gilead Sciences announced it had executed voluntary, non-exclusive, royalty-free license contracts with six pharmaceutical companies in Egypt, Pakistan, and India to produce and market generic lenacapavir. Despite participating in the clinical trials for the drug in recent years, South African companies were excluded from Gilead Sciences\u2019 voluntary licensing, which has infuriated civil society.",

      "Fewer choices may be on the menu again as Medicare patients shop for prescription coverage this fall.",
      "The number of available, stand-alone drug plans has fallen for a few years, and that trend will continue for 2026. Most markets will still have several choices, but some options are becoming particularly sparse for shoppers with low-income subsidies. And help may be harder to find because some insurers no longer pay brokers commissions for new business.",
      "Shoppers have from Oct. 15 to Dec. 7 to find new coverage that starts in January.",
      "Some things to consider:",
      "Regular Medicare, which most people qualify for after turning 65, does not come with prescription coverage, known as Part D. People must choose that separately.",
      "About 23 million people with regular Medicare have this standalone coverage, according to the non-profit KFF, which studies health care.",
      "Another roughly 34 million people have Medicare Advantage plans, which are privately run versions of Medicare that often come with prescription coverage.",
      "A typical shopper will be able to choose a standalone drug plan from among eight to 12 options for 2026, according to KFF Medicare expert Juliette Cubanski. That\u2019s down from 12 to 16 options in 2025.",
      "Shoppers had nearly 30 choices as recently as 2021, according to the Commonwealth Fund\u2019s Gretchen Jacobson.",
      "Depending on the state, a range of one to four plans will be available at no premium to people who qualify for low-income subsidies, according to KFF. Eight were available in 2021.",
      "Some insurers are reducing their presence in standalone Part D plans, while the Blue Cross-Blue Shield carrier Elevance is leaving the market entirely. Insurers and analysts who follow the industry note that the Inflation Reduction Act, which will cap annual out-of-pocket drug costs at $2,100 in 2026, puts more financial pressure on insurers. The same law now allows patients to spread the cost of prescriptions over the year.",
      "Most markets will have several choices. But experts say Medicare Part D customers don\u2019t like to shop, especially if they already have a plan that covers their medications. Finding affordable coverage for multiple prescriptions can be tricky.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of inertia and, frankly, people may be concerned that if they switch, they\u2019re going to end up worse off,\u201d Cubanski said.",
      "More people are being pushed to shop. Nearly 11% of those with standalone prescription drug coverage lost their plan in 2024, according to research published recently in the Journal of the American Medical Association.",
      "Before 2023, that figure was often under 1%, said Dr. Christopher Cai, one of the researchers involved in the study.",

      "But while plans may provide lower coverage prices, they could also raise deductibles or offer more limited lists of covered drugs, which are called formularies. Shoppers should check these details.",
      "Insurers will be allowed to raise premiums by as much as $50 a month for 2026, up from a $35 increase allowed this year. But Cubanski said only some plans will hit that higher limit and not necessarily in all states.",
      "Shoppers can use a federal government website to compare plan prices and coverage.",

      "France could face a deeper political crisis as Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu faces two no-confidence votes in parliament",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 France could sink deeper into political crisis Thursday when the prime minister faces two attempts in Parliament to topple his fragile new government, which could leave President Emmanuel Macron with no palatable option other than calling snap legislative elections.",
      "Legislators in the National Assembly, the powerful but deeply divided lower house, will vote on no-confidence motions filed by Macron's fiercest opponents \u2014 the hard-left France Unbowed party and Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Rally and her allies in Parliament.",
      "If Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu survives, it could be close. Should the ally of Macron fall, the president has signaled through a government spokeswoman that he could dissolve the National Assembly rather than name a replacement for Lecornu. He resigned as prime minister last week only for Macron to re-appoint him again four days later.",
      "The outcome of legislative elections that would follow any National Assembly dissolution is uncertain. But Le Pen's party \u2014 already the largest in the National Assembly \u2014 believes that it's poised to make strong gains, possibly putting the National Rally in government for the first time should Macron take that route again, having tried it once before in June 2024.",
      "Here's a closer look at the high-stake no-confidence votes:",
      "Le Pen has for weeks been campaigning hard for fresh legislative elections, buoyed by polls that suggest that the National Rally could capitalize, as it did after the last dissolution in 2024.",
      "Le Pen and her right-wing ally Eric Ciotti filed their censure motion the morning after the newly re-appointed prime minister named his new Cabinet on Sunday. It says that dissolving the National Assembly \u201cis the most efficient and most democratic way to get our country out of the dead end.\u201d",
      "The France Unbowed censure motion, also filed Monday morning, argues that toppling Lecornu could help spur the ouster of Macron, too \u2014 even though the French leader has said that he has no intention of cutting short his second and last presidential term that ends in 2027.",
      "\u201cThe resignation or the impeachment of Emmanuel Macron are the only solutions to offer a clear democratic outcome to the current chaos: a return to the ballot boxes. That way, the people will have the opportunity to turn the page on an authoritarian presidency,\" the motion says.",
      "A majority of the 577 National Assembly legislators need to vote against Lecornu for him and his government to fall. The National Assembly will convene at 9 a.m. local time (0700 GMT) on Thursday and the France Unbowed motion will be voted on first.",
      "Alone, the National Rally and France Unbowed can't reach the required number of 289.",

      "A left-wing of grouping of 38 lawmakers including the Ecologists says it also will vote against Lecornu. Many members of a smaller left-wing group of 17 lawmakers, in the large part communists, are also expected to follow suit.",
      "But together, Lecornu's opponents could still find themselves dozens of votes short of 289.",
      "There are some wildcards, however, and the outcome could still be close.",
      "Macron's centrists are counting on support from their allies and for the opposition Socialists \u2014 with 69 lawmakers \u2014 and the conservative Republicans \u2014 with 50 \u2014 to not vote against Lecornu, because they could tip the outcome against him.",
      "In a big carrot to the Socialists, Lecornu this week announced that he'll suspend an extremely unpopular change to France's retirement age, gradually raising it from 62 to 64. That flagship reform of Macron's second term could now be sacrificed to buy time for Lecornu and some stability in the National Assembly as it sets to work on debating France's budget for 2026, a priority for the European Union's second-largest economy.",
      "Even if Lecornu survives, lawmakers could file more no-confidence motions against his government in the weeks ahead in what are expected to be fractious budget negotiations.",

      "Dutch far-right lawmaker Geert Wilders has announced his return to the campaign trail",
      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) \u2014 Dutch far-right lawmaker Geert Wilders said Wednesday that he's returning to the campaign trail, with two weeks to go before a general election after he briefly suspended his election activities following reports that he was a possible target of a suspected plot in Belgium to kill politicians using an explosives-laden drone.",
      "Wilders' populist Party for Freedom, known by its Dutch acronym PVV, won the last election in late 2023 and was the biggest bloc in a four-party ruling coalition until earlier this year, when Wilders pulled his ministers out of the government in a dispute over a crackdown on migration.",
      "His manifesto for the upcoming election calls for measures including for a total halt to asylum-seekers entering the Netherlands, military patrols at borders to enforce the ban and the closure of recently opened asylum-seeker centers.",
      "His party leads polls heading into the Oct. 29 election for all 150 seats in the Second Chamber, the lower house of the Dutch parliament. The Netherlands' system of proportional representation combined with a splintered political landscape all but guarantees a coalition government.",
      "\u201cElections are coming, it is campaign time and I feel a great responsibility toward the Netherlands and PVV voters,\" Wilders said in a written statement on X. \"So I am getting back to work.\u201d",

      "It remains to be seen if Wilders can cobble together a right-wing coalition if he wins the most seats. The leader of the center-right Party for Freedom and Democracy has said that she won't join a coalition with the PVV.",
      "Although his party won the last election and was the largest in the four-party coalition, Wilders didn't become prime minister, because other parties wouldn't support his leadership. Instead, a career civil servant, Dick Schoof, was appointed to lead the government that lasted just 11 months.",

      "Former Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga has died of a heart attack in India",
      "NAIROBI, Kenya -- NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) \u2014 Raila Odinga, a former prime minister of Kenya and perennial presidential candidate whose populist campaigns challenged one-party rule, rattled authorities and gave him outsized influence on political life in the East African country, died Wednesday of a heart attack while traveling in India. He was 80.",
      "His death was confirmed by Devamatha Hospital in Kerala State, where he was taken after he collapsed during a morning walk. A hospital statement said Odinga didn\u2019t respond to resuscitation efforts.",
      "There were somber scenes at his home in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, where mourners included national leaders. Tributes cited his commitment to democracy.",
      "President William Ruto declared a seven-day mourning period during which national flags will fly at half-staff, calling Odinga's death an \u201cimmense and immeasurable loss.\u201d Odinga will have a state funeral, Ruto said.",
      "Odinga had recently signed a political pact with Ruto that saw his opposition party involved in government policy-making and its members appointed to the cabinet.",
      "But his ambition was to become Kenya\u2019s president, and he ran five times over three decades \u2014 sometimes with enough support that many believed he might win.",
      "He came close to taking the presidency in 2007, when he narrowly lost to incumbent Mwai Kibaki in a disputed election marred by ethnic violence. And in 2017, a court nullified the presidential election \u2014 a first in Africa \u2014 after Odinga's challenge but he decided to boycott the fresh vote, asserting it wouldn't be credible without reforms.",
      "Although Odinga never succeeded at becoming president, for many he was a revered figure and statesman whose activism helped steer Kenya into a vibrant multiparty democracy.",
      "Odinga, a member of the Luo ethnic group in western Nyanza province, reached the peak of his political career in the 2007 presidential race, winning the support of leaders from other tribes and drawing massive crowds during campaign events.",
      "Although Kibaki, of the Kikuyu ethnic group, had posted good economic figures in his first term, his government had been weakened by corruption scandals. The official results \u2014 Odinga\u2019s 44% against Kibaki\u2019s 46% \u2014 was the closest in Kenyan history.",
      "Odinga\u2019s camp rejected that result, provoked in part by an unreliable electoral authority whose leader said later that he did not know whether Kibaki had won.",
      "Protests erupted in Nairobi almost immediately after Kibaki's inauguration, and violence spread to other parts of Kenya as people were targeted along ethnic lines: Luos and Kalenjins targeting Kikuyus, and Kikuyus mobilizing reprisal attacks.",
      "Hundreds of people were killed in days of violence that shattered Kenya\u2019s status as a stable democracy in a volatile region.",
      "Although Odinga was never accused of inciting violence, others \u2014 including future presidents Ruto and Uhuru Kenyatta \u2014 were. They were among six suspects who faced criminal charges related to post-election violence when the International Criminal Court opened its investigation in 2010.",
      "The case never yielded any successful prosecutions, with charges withdrawn, terminated or tossed out amid claims of witness intimidation and political interference.",
      "After the turmoil, Odinga became prime minister in a unity government put together with the mediation of the international community.",

      "Odinga first rose to prominence as a political activist fighting against the one-party rule of President Daniel arap Moi in the 1980s. He was linked to a failed coup plot by a group of air force officers who tried to take power in 1982.",
      "Some of the coup leaders were convicted of treason and executed, and the names of Odinga and his father came up during interrogations of some suspects. Odinga was accused of treason, and though the charge was later dropped, he spent much of the next decade in detention.",
      "Odinga described the harsh conditions of imprisonment and alleged torture, including an assault by a police officer who hit him with a wooden table leg. He insisted that while he had been involved in educating and mobilizing people to bring about change in Kenya at the time of the coup attempt, he had never advocated violence.",

      "It was one of the latest examples of what Ukrainian officials say has been a surge since mid-summer in attacks on railways, a critical artery for commercial and military logistics.",
      "They are part of Russia's broader targeting of infrastructure that now is being carried out with greater precision thanks to advances in long-range drone technology that include onboard video feed.",
      "In the attack in Shostka, less than 70 kilometers (43 miles) from the Russian border, two explosives-laden drones struck two commuter trains in quick succession.",
      "Russia has stepped up railway attacks over the past three months, seeking to sow unrest in Ukrainian regions it borders by depriving people there of rail connections, Oleksandr Pertsovskyi, the CEO of the Ukrainian state railway, told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cWhat happens is not just about the quantity, it\u2019s also the approach of enemy forces. Now, as they have very precise Shahed drones, they are targeting individual locomotives,\u201d Pertsovskyi said.",
      "Ukrainian railway managers have prided themselves on speedy repairs and their ability \u2014 so far \u2014 to keep the trains running despite repeated strikes, but officials and analysts warn that advances in Russian drone capabilities and the growing tempo of attacks pose a serious threat.",
      "Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in early 2022, railway officials have publicly reported about roughly one attack on railways per week. Since mid-summer of this year, that rate has more than doubled to about two or three per week, according to an AP review of public reports.",
      "However, what is publicly reported is only a small fraction of the overall number of attacks on all rail-related infrastructure, which could include damage to power lines, electrical substation, rail tracks, train stations and other structures.",
      "Oleksii Kuleba, a deputy prime minister in charge of restoration and development, said there have been 300 attacks on railway infrastructure since August alone \u2014 which would represent about 10 attacks per week.",

      "SHAMVA, Zimbabwe -- SHAMVA, Zimbabwe (AP) \u2014 Inside a white tent with a wooden fireplace in the middle, about two dozen African girls slipped off their shoes, sat on mattresses and prepared to pour their hearts out.",
      "They held hands and their chants of \u201cit's so nice to be here\u201d echoed through the tent before they set about discussing sexuality, child marriage, teen pregnancy, gender bias, education, economic empowerment and the law. Nothing was off limits.",
      "The girls' hangout in rural northeastern Zimbabwe is a revival of Nhanga, the local term for \u201cgirls\u2019 bedroom,\u201d an ancient traditional space once used to prepare adolescent girls for marriage. Across rural Zimbabwe, girls are now reinventing the centuries-old practice as a peer-led movement to resist child marriage, which is rife in the southern African nation.",
      "\u201cThis is a safe space, every girl feels free,\u201d said 18-year-old Anita Razo, who joined at 14 and now mentors younger girls.",
      "In traditional homesteads, a round thatched hut served as Nhanga, a female-only room where girls were taught obedience, how to please husbands and moral education. It reinforced patriarchal expectations.",
      "Today, the practice is being flipped. \u201cThe new Nhanga is a cultural innovation dealing with modern problems,\u201d and where girls candidly tackle subjects still sensitive in many conservative homes, said Nokutenda Magama, a programs officer with Rozaria Memorial Trust, a nonprofit that works to empower rural girls and women and is behind the Nhanga revival.",
      "Sessions include practical skills like poultry raising, farming and soap making.",
      "The trust organizes gatherings by age group, from girls as young as five to women over 35, ensuring an age-appropriate curriculum and mentorship across generations. Elders, including senior government officials, are sometimes invited.",
      "The reinvention comes against worrying statistics. One in three girls in Zimbabwe marries before 18, according to the United Nations Children's Fund, calling it \u201ca national emergency demanding urgent action.\u201d It\u2019s a similar situation across East and southern Africa. Child marriage rates soar to above 40% in central and West Africa, with Niger, at 76%, the highest globally, according to UNICEF.",
      "Zimbabwe and many other African countries have outlawed child marriage, even overturning laws prohibiting abortion for girls under 18, but poverty, lethargic enforcement and cultural and religious customs keep it alive.",
      "For Samantha Chidodo, the revival offered a path back. Now 26 and a final-year law student, she was forced into an abusive marriage at 17 to a man nearly a decade older.",
      "\u201cAll I wanted was to play and think of my future. Suddenly I had to be a mother and wife,\u201d she said at a camp that blended tent sessions with a \u201cgirls and goals\u201d soccer tournament.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t even know what to do. I would be dead asleep, oblivious that I needed to breastfeed.\u201d A woman next door would take the crying baby, feed him and return him to the sleeping teen mother, she recalled.",
      "After two years, she walked away, enduring stigma as neighbors warned others not to associate with her. With support from Rozaria Memorial Trust, she returned to school and became one of the modern Nhanga pioneers.",

      "Around 15 shots were fired at the activists, who fled widening government repression last year, and Peche Arteaga was hit six times, said Laura Dib, a colleague of Vel\u00e1squez and Venezuela Program Director for the Washington Office on Latin America. Both went through surgery and were in stable condition.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s tragedy after tragedy,\u201d said Dib. \u201cIt has been a really hard day for all of the human rights movement in Venezuela. This sends a very clear message about the risks of transnational repression.\"",

      "The two men were among an exodus of political opposition and civil society leaders who fled Venezuela after Maduro was widely accused of stealing last year's election and the government detained more than 2,000 people, including human rights defenders and critics.",
      "Vel\u00e1squez was already arbitrarily detained by Venezuelan authorities for hours as he tried to leave the country for a human rights conference in August last year, according to an Inter-American Commission on Human Rights report.

      "Arles Pereda, president of the Colony of Venezuelans in Colombia (ColVenz) said that concern has simmered for years as the government has targeted civil society groups. It\u2019s not hard to contract a hired gun in Colombia, in part due to the prevalence of criminal groups in the region.",

      "The ouster of Rajoelina, who himself came to power as a transitional leader in a military-backed coup in 2009, capped weeks of protests led by young people fed up with power and water outages, persistent poverty and a lack of opportunities, among other issues.",
      "Rajoelina's office issued a statement calling the coup \u201ca serious breach of the rule of law\" and insisting that the state \u201cremains standing.\u201d But Col. Michael Randrianirina, whose elite CAPSAT military unit tipped the scales of power in the country last weekend by siding with the protesters, said \u201cWe are taking power,\" as demonstrators celebrated with soldiers in the capital, Antananarivo.",
      "Here's what to know about the events that led to Rajoelina's ousting.",
      "The uprising started weeks ago when protests erupted over chronic water and electricity outages. It snowballed into larger dissatisfaction with Rajoelina, alleged government corruption and poverty, which affects about 75% of the country of roughly 30 million people, according to the World Bank.",
      "The protests brought thousands onto the streets in several cities and initially sparked a harsh crackdown by security forces that left 22 people dead and more than 100 injured, according to the United Nations. The government disputed those figures.",
      "Although civic groups and labor unions also joined in, the protests were led by a group calling itself \u201cGen Z Madagascar,\u201d though participants have insisted there isn't a leader and that they were inspired by recent youth uprisings in Nepal and Sri Lanka.",
      "A key moment came Saturday when Randrianirina and his soldiers accompanied protesters to a main square in the capital and demanded that Rajoelina step down. The CAPSAT troops exchanged gunfire with gendarmerie security forces still loyal to Rajoelina, and one CAPSAT soldier was killed, according to Randrianirina.",
      "On Tuesday, protesters cheered on the CAPSAT troops as they stood on armored vehicles in Antananarivo's streets. Although Rajoelina's office said only some CAPSAT troops were backing the protesters, the unit said other military units, including the gendarmerie, stand with them.",
      "CAPSAT is the unit that also rebelled against the Madagascar government in 2009, leading to the military-backed coup that brought Rajoelina to power as a transitional leader. There are strong parallels between the two coups, in that CAPSAT troops also joined a wave of anti-government protests against then-President Marc Ravalomanana 16 years ago, forcing him into exile.",
      "After weeks of pressure on Rajoelina, a chaotic 24-hour period began Monday when the president's office announced he would deliver a speech to the nation on state television and radio. The speech was delayed for hours and was finally only broadcast on social media after soldiers arrived at the state broadcaster's buildings.",

      "Smucker also asserted that the boxes Trader Joe\u2019s sandwiches come in violate the Orrville, Ohio-based company's trademarks because they are the same blue color it uses for the lettering on \u201cUncrustables\u201d packages.",

      "Smucker said Trader Joe\u2019s sandwiches are so similar to Uncrustables that they were already confusing customers. In the lawsuit, Smucker showed a social media photo of a person claiming that Trader Joe\u2019s is contracting with Smucker to make the sandwiches under its own private label.",
      "This isn\u2019t the first time Smucker has taken legal action to protect its Uncrustables brand. In 2022, it sent a cease and desist letter to a Minnesota company called Gallant Tiger, which was making upscale versions of crustless peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with crimped edges.",
      "Smucker\u2019s lawsuit comes a few months after a similar lawsuit filed against the Aldi by Mondelez International, which claimed that Aldi\u2019s store-brand cookies and crackers have packaging that is too similar to Mondelez brands like Chips Ahoy, Wheat Thins and Oreos.",

      "Federal workers furloughed or working without pay are feeling the financial squeeze and fear being swept up in the Trump administration's layoffs",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 With every passing day of the government shutdown, hundreds of thousands of federal employees furloughed or working without pay face mounting financial strain. And now they are confronting new uncertainty with the Trump administration's promised layoffs.",
      "Little progress has been made to end the shutdown as it enters its third week, with Republicans and Democrats digging in and convinced their messaging is resonating with voters. The fate of the federal workers is among several pressure points that could eventually push the sides to agree to resolve the stalemate.",
      "\u201cLuckily I was able to pay rent this month,\u201d said Peter Farruggia, a furloughed federal worker. \u201cBut for sure I am going to have bills that are going to go unpaid this month, and I really don\u2019t have many options.\u201d",
      "The shutdown has a familiar feel for many federal employees who endured past stalemates \u2014 including during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term \u2014 but this time, the stakes are higher. The Republican White House is leveraging federal workers\u2019 jobs to pressure Democrats to soften their demands.",
      "The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Democrats rejected a short-term funding fix and demanded that the bill include an extension of federal subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Trump and other Republican leaders have said the government must reopen before they will negotiate with Democrats on the health subsidies.",
      "Farruggia is the head of the American Federation of Government Employees local representing employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency that faced a wave of layoffs over the weekend. Like 8,000 other CDC employees who have been furloughed from the agency, he was already living paycheck to paycheck, and the partial pay that arrived Friday was his last until the government comes back online.",
      "With the agency's leadership in turmoil and still rattled from a shooting, the shutdown and new firings mean \u201cpeople are scared, nervous, anxious, but also really just exasperated,\u201d Farruggia said.",
      "After Russ Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said last week on social media that the \u201cRIFs have begun,\u201d referring to reduction-in-force plans aimed at reducing the size of the federal government, Vice President JD Vance doubled down on the threat Sunday, saying \u201cthe longer this goes on, the deeper the cuts are going to be.\"",
      "The layoffs have begun across federal agencies. Labor unions have already filed a lawsuit to stop the move by Trump\u2019s budget office.",
      "In a court filing on Friday, the Office of Management and Budget said well over 4,000 federal employees from eight departments and agencies would be fired in conjunction with the shutdown.",
      "Jessica Sweet, an Albany, New York, Social Security claims specialist who is a union steward of AFGE Local 3343 in New York, said, \u201cI, myself, have a backup plan\u201d in case she is fired during the shutdown, \u201cbut I know most people don't.\u201d",
      "She says the Social Security Administration is already so short-staffed from layoffs earlier this year brought on by the Department of Government Efficiency, she doesn't fear a massive layoff during the shutdown.",
      "\u201cThe one thing this administration has taught me is that nothing is ever for certain, even if it's codified into law,\" she said.",
      "Having received a partial payment in her last paycheck, Sweet has begun reaching out to her local power companies to request that she not get charged late fees, since \u201cmy bills won't wait for me to eventually get paid.\u201d",
      "For some federal workers, this isn\u2019t their first shutdown \u2014 the last one, during Trump\u2019s first term in 2019, stretched a record 34 days. But this time, federal employees are being used more directly as leverage in the political fight over government funding.",
      "The Republican administration last week warned that there would be no guaranteed back pay for federal workers during a shutdown \u2014 a reversal of long-standing policy affecting roughly 750,000 furloughed employees, according to a White House memo. The move, which Trump later backtracked on, was widely seen as a strong-arm tactic.",

      "Pelletier, a union leader for NLRB local 3, said \u201cright now, nothing is being investigated at the NLRB. There\u2019s no elections for unions or elections for decertifications. Basically nothing is happening.\u201d",
      "As for the financial strain on workers, he said workers can't even find alternate employment to weather the shutdown because \"the ethics office that would approve of those requests is not staffed now.\"",
      "National Treasury Employees Union President Doreen Greenwald, which represents workers across dozens of federal agencies, said several of the union's members had been laid off as of Friday. The Treasury Department would lose 1,446 workers, according to the filing.",
      "Greenwald said it was unfortunate that the Trump administration was using \u201cfederal employees as political pawns by furloughing and proposing to fire them all to try to cause pressure in a political game of chicken.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t about one party or the other. It\u2019s about real people,\u201d said Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees.",
      "\u201cThe correction officer worrying about his next paycheck. The TSA officer who still shows up to work because he or she loves their country, even though they\u2019re not getting paid. No American should ever have to choose between serving their country and feeding their family,\u201d Kelley said.",
      "Kelley and other major federal worker union leaders gathered blocks from the Capitol last week, urging congressional leaders to find a solution and put \u201cpeople over politics.\u201d The event grew emotional at times, with union heads outlining the difficulties facing their members and the stakes growing daily.",
      "Randy Erwin, president of the National Federation of Federal Employees, which represents 110,000 workers nationwide, called on both sides of Congress to find a resolution. He said Trump appeared to aim to \u201cdegrade, frighten, antagonize hardworking federal employees.\u201d",
      "Chris Bartley, political program coordinator for the International Association of Fire Fighters, said thousands of firefighters were showing up for work without pay out of a sense of devotion but stressed that could have broader consequences.",

      "The U.S. government shutdown\u2019s strain on the aviation system is starting to show",
      "A startling message came over the radio from an air traffic control tower near Los Angeles less than a week into the federal government shutdown: \u201cThe tower is closed due to staffing.\"",
      "Without enough air traffic controllers to guide planes into and out of Hollywood Burbank Airport, the tower went dark for almost six hours on Oct. 6, leaving pilots to coordinate their movements among themselves. Flight delays averaged two-and-a-half hours in one of the first visible signs that the shutdown was already taking a toll on the nation's aviation system.",
      "Since the shutdown began Oct. 1, the Federal Aviation Administration has reported controller shortages in cities across the U.S., from airports in Boston and Philadelphia, to control centers in Atlanta and Houston. Flight delays have spread to airports in Nashville, Dallas, Newark and more.",
      "And already there has been an increase in unscheduled absences among security screeners at some airports. The union representing Transportation Security Administration employees says the absences haven't yet caused major disruptions, but it warned longer lines at security checkpoints could soon become a reality after workers received their final paychecks over the weekend.",
      "Experts and union leaders say the disruptions are a stark reminder that the aviation system is already stretched too thin by chronic understaffing and outdated technology. They warn the cracks in the system could rapidly deepen the longer the shutdown drags on and critical aviation workers are without their regular paychecks.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like having a drought the year after you had a drought,\u201d Greg Raiff, CEO of Elevate Aviation Group, told The Associated Press.",
      "These concerns aren't new. In 2019, the aviation system buckled under the weight of a 35-day government shutdown \u2014 the longest in U.S. history \u2014 during President Donald Trump's first term.",
      "Around the three-week mark, air traffic controllers, many of them working up to 60 hours a week, sued the government over their missed paychecks. One terminal at the Miami International Airport was forced to close because security screeners were calling out sick in large numbers. Some even quit altogether.",
      "\u201cHere we are so many years later, and the problems have not been addressed,\" said aviation attorney Ricardo Martinez-Cid, a Florida Bar-certified expert on aviation law who regularly represents crash victims. \u201cNow we're in a worse position when we had been put on notice. We had the opportunity to address it.\"",
      "Since then, the country has faced repeated warnings. In January, a mid-air crash over the Potomac River involving a commercial jet and a military helicopter killed 67 people. A series of equipment failures and radar outages this year also highlighted the need for upgrades.",
      "Before the latest shutdown, both the FAA and TSA were already dealing with staffing shortages. That includes a shortage of about 3,000 air traffic controllers.",
      "Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, has said staffing levels have reached a \u201ccritical\u201d point, the lowest in decades. The shortage is so severe that even a few air traffic controllers missing work can disrupt operations at already understaffed facilities.",
      "\u201cAnd on top of that,\" he said, \u201cthey\u2019re working with unreliable equipment.\u201d",

      "Now, the shutdown is delaying those long-needed efforts. And union leaders say the staffing shortages may be worse by the time the government reopens.",
      "Johnny Jones, secretary-treasurer of the American Federation of Government Employees chapter representing TSA workers, expressed concern that the shutdown could drive even more security screeners to leave the agency, especially given the uncertainty that the workers already have faced this year. That includes the Trump administration's attempts to revoke their collective bargaining rights.",

      "\"All of these air traffic controllers and aviation safety professionals were used as pawns in a political fight that had nothing to do with aviation. This is wrong and must not be allowed to happen again,\" warned the union leader representing air traffic controllers at the time.",
      "At the hearing, there were also bipartisan calls for reform to keep the FAA funded \u201cwithout interruption, even when the rest of the government shuts down,\" as one lawmaker put it.

      "Finland and Sweden say they're ready to buy more weapons from the United States to give to Ukraine",
      "BRUSSELS -- BRUSSELS (AP) \u2014 NATO\u2019s two newest members, Finland and Sweden, said Wednesday that they would buy more weapons from the United States to give to Ukraine, a day after data showed that foreign military aid to the war-torn country had declined sharply in recent months.",
      "Over the summer, NATO started to coordinate regular deliveries of large weapons packages to Ukraine to help fend off Russia's war. The aim was to send at least one load a month of targeted and predictable military support, each worth around $500 million.",
      "Spare weapons stocks in European arsenals have all but dried up, and NATO diplomats have said that the United States has around $10-$12 billion worth of arms, air defense systems and ammunition that Ukraine could use.",
      "Under the financial arrangement \u2014 known as the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List, or PURL \u2014 European allies and Canada are buying American weapons to help Kyiv keep Russian forces at bay. About $2 billion worth has already been allocated.",
      "Finland\u2019s defense minister, Antti H\u00e4kk\u00e4nen, said that his country has \u201cdecided to join the PURL, because we see that it\u2019s crucial that Ukraine gets the critical U.S. weapons.\u201d Finland will also provide a separate package of its own military equipment.",
      "Swedish Defense Minister P\u00e5l Jonson said that \u201cSweden stands ready to do more.\u201d He welcomed discussions among other Nordic countries and the Baltic nations \u2014 Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania \u2014 on sending an extra load too.",
      "\u201cThis is critical now because we\u2019ve been seeing the wrong trajectory when it comes to support to Ukraine, that it\u2019s been going down and we want to see more stepping up,\u201d Jonson told reporters at NATO headquarters, where defense ministers were meeting.",
      "Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur also expressed concern about a drop in Western backing, noting that \u201cthe reality is that the share of the U.S. contributions to Ukraine has decreased significantly this year.\u201d",
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that the American \u201cexpectation today is that more countries donate even more, that they purchase even more to provide for Ukraine, to bring that conflict to a peaceful conclusion.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration hasn't donated military equipment to Ukraine. It has been weighing whether to send Tomahawk long-range missiles if Russia doesn't wind down its war soon, but it remains unclear who will pay for those weapons, should they ever be approved.",
      "Indeed, new data on Western military aid to Ukraine shows that despite the PURL program, support plunged by 43% in July and August compared to the first half of the year, according to Germany\u2019s Kiel Institute, which tracks deliveries and funding for Kyiv.",

      "In documents submitted in the run-up to the Montana sale, NTEC indicated the coal had little value because of declining demand for the fuel. The Associated Press emailed a company representative regarding the rejected bid.",

      "Spring Creek also ships coal overseas to customers in Asia. Increasing those shipments could help it offset lessening domestic demand, but a shortage of port capacity has hobbled prior industry aspirations to boost coal exports.",

      "The United States' economy will expand 2% in 2025, the IMF projected in its influential semiannual forecast, the World Economic Outlook. That is slightly higher than the 1.9% forecast in the IMF's last update in July and 1.8% in April. The U.S. should grow 2.1% next year, also just one-tenth of a percent faster than its previous projection, the IMF said.",
      "Its current forecasts are still down from a year ago, however, a sign that the international lending agency expects the tariffs to weaken the U.S. economy, in part by creating more uncertainty for businesses. Last October, the IMF forecast the U.S. would grow 2.2% this year.",
      "All the projections also represent a slowing from 2024, when the U.S. economy expanded at a faster 2.8%.",
      "The global economy, meanwhile, will grow 3.2% this year, up from a 3% estimate in July, the IMF forecast, and 3.1% in 2026, the same as its previous estimate.",
      "While the U.S. and world economies have fared better than expected, it's too soon to say they are fully in the clear, the IMF said, as Trump has continued to make tariff threats and it can take time for changes in international trade patterns to play out.",
      "On Friday, for example, Trump threatened to slap 100% duties on all imports from China, which caused a sharp fall in the stock market.",
      "IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said at a news conference that the import taxes and ongoing threats to impose more duties have created ongoing uncertainty for many businesses and are weighing on the world economy.",
      "\u201cThe tariff shock is here, and it is further dimming already weak growth prospects,\u201d he said.",
      "Gourinchas also said that a burst of investment in artificial intelligence, in the form of huge data centers and extensive computing power, has helped offset the drag from trade and boosting the U.S. economy. Yet if a financial market bubble formed and then burst, it could sharply slow business investment and consumer spending, he said.",
      "\u201cThere are echoes in the current tech investment surge of the dot-com boom of the late 1990s,\" he said. \u201cIt was the internet then, it is AI now.\u201d",
      "Shares of two companies active in the AI sector, AMD and Oracle, which announced an expanding partnership Tuesday, have seen their shares rise 80% this year.",
      "Gains in AI-related stock values have lifted Americans' wealth and fueled consumer spending, Gourinchas said, just as companies are ramping up their investments in advanced computer chips and building data centers. Hotter spending and investment could push central banks to raise interest rates over time, he said.",
      "Gourinchas also offered several reasons the U.S. and global economies have remained resilient after the widespread imposition of tariffs earlier this year.",

And the private sector also proved agile, front-loading imports and rerouting supply chains.\u201d",
      "By front-loading imports, many U.S. companies were able to stock up on goods before the duties took effect, enabling them to avoid or delay price increases.",
      "Yet many of those factors only reflect \"temporary relief, rather than underlying strength in economic fundamentals,\u201d the IMF's report said.",
      "The IMF also said that import price data in the U.S. shows that so far importers and retailers are paying most of the tariffs, not overseas companies, as many Trump administration officials have predicted. Over time, those firms are likely to pass on more of the price hikes to consumers, the report said.",
      "There are signs that some downsides of the higher tariffs are starting to emerge, the IMF outlook said. Core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy categories, has ticked up to 2.9%, according to the Federal Reserve's preferred measure, up from 2.7% a year ago. Hiring has ground to nearly a halt, which could partly reflect a more cautious approach by many firms in the wake of the uncertainty created by the higher tariffs.",
      "The IMF's forecasts are modestly more optimistic than many private-sector economists' expectations. The National Association for Business Economics, a group of academic and business economists, on Monday forecast that the U.S. would grow just 1.8% this year and 1.7% in 2026.",
      "Nearly two-thirds of the economists surveyed by the NABE said they think the administration's duties are nevertheless slowing growth, by up to a half-percentage point.",
      "China, meanwhile, has weathered the hit from U.S. tariffs by sending more of its goods to Europe and Asia, rather than the United States, the IMF said. Its currency has depreciated, which has made its exports cheaper. The IMF is forecasting that China's economy will expand 4.8% this year and 4.2% in 2026, the same as in July.",
      "Gourinchas said that China's economy has grown increasingly dependent on exports, while its real estate sector continues to struggle under heavy debt loads.",
      "\u201cIt is increasingly hard to see how this could be sustained,\u201d he added.",
      "In Europe, Germany is bolstering growth by increasing government spending to build up its military, Gourinchas said. The IMF now expects the 20 countries that use the euro to grow 1.2% this year, up from a 1% forecast in July, and 1.1% next year, the same as three months ago.",

For the first time, the NBA has three players simultaneously entering their 20th seasons; James, when he makes his 2025-26 debut, will be the first 23-year player in league history, while Paul is going into his 21st season and Lowry is entering his 20th.",
      "\u201cThe love of the game is still high. The love of the process is even higher,\u201d James said. \u201cSo, that\u2019s what continues to push me to play this game. I mean, it is really that simple.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s nothing simple about it. To still be contributing at this level, at this point in their careers, is practically unheard of.",
      "All three invest plenty of their own money (they\u2019ve made a combined $1.2 billion in NBA salaries) in their own individualized programs that have helped them survive the rigors of NBA life for this long.",
      "James\u2019 workout regimen is legendary, yet still not invincible \u2014 he\u2019ll miss the start of this season while dealing with sciatica and there\u2019s no firm timetable for when he\u2019ll actually take the floor with the Los Angeles Lakers to start Year 23.",
      "Lowry, at least since the NBA began tracking such stats, is the NBA\u2019s all-time leader in charges taken, which means he\u2019s probably taken more hard falls than anybody. And last season with San Antonio, Paul became the first player in NBA history to play 82 games in a 20th year of a career \u2014 and he started all of them, too.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always believed in \u2018keep stacking days\u2019 and that you just have to show up every single day, every single day,\u201d said Paul, who rejoined the Los Angeles Clippers this summer. \u201cSo, that\u2019s what I plan on bringing to this team. \u2026 My role on this team is obviously different than it\u2019s been the past 20 years of being in the NBA, but showing up every day, if I can show some of the guys what it looks like every day to clock in and clock out, I\u2019m excited for it.\u201d",
      "Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was the first player in the 20-season club, getting there in 1988-89. Robert Parish followed in 1995-96 (and played a 21st season as well). Kevin Willis played 21 seasons, his career ending in 2006-07.",
      "The rest of the entrants into the club have all come in the last decade: Kevin Garnett, Kobe Bryant, Dirk Nowitzki, Vince Carter (the league\u2019s first 22-year player before James tied that mark last year), Jamal Crawford, Udonis Haslem, James, Paul and soon, Lowry.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m asking and taking advice from these guys and I want to take even more advice from them in the future,\u201d said San Antonio center Victor Wembanyama, who is going into his third season. \u201cThey\u2019re definitely examples.\u201d",
      "Milwaukee forward Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is entering his 13th season, pointed out that constant innovation in medicine, recovery, technology and more has made it possible for players to extend their careers if they choose to put in the effort.",

They have their own physio, they have their chef. You know how you sit down with your financial advisor four times a year and you go through your finances? I think you should sit down with your doctors and your physios four times a year, minimum, to talk about what you want from your body.\u201d",
      "Lowry is back with the Philadelphia 76ers this season, though he has signed with another team as well \u2014 Amazon Prime, which he\u2019s joining as an analyst this season, even while still playing. It\u2019s a multiyear deal with one of the NBA\u2019s new broadcast partners, with the assumption that when he stops playing he\u2019ll simply slide into a bigger analysis role.",
      "He'll debut on Amazon next week. But his mind is fully on Year 20 as a player, not Year 1 of TV.",
      "\u201cI love the game of basketball and I have had the ability to play professional basketball for 20 years and basketball my whole life,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cWhen you wake up every day you should still be motivated to play basketball. \u2026 And I have some unbelievable teammates, unbelievable teammates. That\u2019s my motivation. I just want to continue to give what I\u2019ve learned for as long as I can.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to play better,\u201d Brewers designated hitter Christian Yelich said. \u201cIt\u2019s not an ideal start to the series, by any means. Just have to continue to battle and find a way to get the offense going. I\u2019ve got to be better. We\u2019ve got to be better. It\u2019s just facts.\u201d",
      "The Brewers ranked second in the majors in on-base percentage (.332) and third in runs (806) and batting average (.258) while posting a franchise-best 97-65 regular-season record.",
      "But they\u2019ve totaled just five hits through the first two games of this series and mustered only one run in each of them.",
      "The Brewers got just two hits in a 2-1 Game 1 loss, as two-time Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell allowed one hit and no walks over eight shutout innings fo Los Angeles. They managed three hits Tuesday and fell 5-1 as Yoshinobu Yamamoto pitched the first postseason complete game in eight years.",
      "During the regular season, the Brewers had the best chase rate in the majors, meaning they swung at the lowest percentage of pitches outside the strike zone. But their inability to work counts the last two night allowed Los Angeles\u2019 starters to go deep into the games and prevented the Brewers from getting many shots at the Dodgers\u2019 vulnerable bullpen.",
      "\u201cBoth those pitchers were as dominant as two pitchers have been,\u201d Milwaukee manager Pat Murphy said. \u201cWe chased way more than we\u2019ve chased all year. We\u2019ve been the best in baseball at not chasing. These pitchers brought out the worst in us.\u201d",
      "The most notable example came when Blake Treinen struck out Brice Turang swinging at a neck-high fastball with the bases loaded to end Game 1.",
      "But the chasing was prevalent again Tuesday, allowing Yamamoto to pitch a complete game for the first time since entering the majors last season on a 12-year, $325 million contract.",
      "Jackson Chourio homered on Yamamoto\u2019s first pitch to continue his impressive postseason. The 21-year-old already has four career postseason homers to tie a Brewers record he now shares with Orlando Arcia and Prince Fielder.",
      "But the Brewers accomplished little else. Their only other hits were two-out singles by Brice Turang in the third inning and Sal Frelick in the fourth.",

      "Yelich, a three-time All-Star and the 2018 NL MVP, is 0 for 13 in his last four games. Two-time All-Star William Contreras and Andrew Vaughn each homered twice in the NL Division Series against the Chicago Cubs, but both are hitless so far in this series.",

      "The marriage didn't even last a full season with Callahan fired after six games in a move that maybe should have been predictable based on recent history.",
      "Over the last decade, nothing has put an NFL coach on the hot seat more than the franchise using a high draft pick on a quarterback.",

Caleb Williams and Matt Eberflus lasted 12 games together in Chicago in 2024; Bryce Young and Frank Reich got 11 games in Carolina in 2023; and Trevor Lawrence and Urban Meyer got 13 games in Jacksonville in 2021.",

      "The only No. 1 pick quarterback in the NFL still with his original coach is 2020 top selection Joe Burrow in Cincinnati with Zac Taylor.",
      "Teams picking first in the draft typically have many holes based on getting that selection although the Bears and Rams got their No. 1 picks in trades. Four of the fired coaches \u2014 Callahan, Eberflus, Jackson and Fisher \u2014 came into those seasons on thin ice based on a lack of success already during their tenure.",
      "Reich got fired in his first season with the Panthers and Meyer got fired in year one with the Jaguars, although that decision went far deeper than just the quarterback.",
      "But the issue of quick hooks potentially stunting the growth of young quarterbacks goes beyond players picked first overall.",
      "There have been 35 quarterbacks taken in the first round of the past 10 drafts \u2014 including Ward and Jaxson Dart of the New York Giants this season. Seven of those teams fired their coach during the rookie season of the quarterback with eight more making a change before the start of year two.",
      "Only seven of those first-round picks finished their four-year rookie deals with the same coach, with the verdict still out on several members of the 2023-25 drafts.",
      "One of those first-round quarterbacks who had a coaching change before the start of his second season was Justin Fields with Chicago. Fields spent his rookie season in 2021 under Matt Nagy before playing the next two seasons for Eberflus.",
      "Fields is now on his third team with the Jets and his game is trending in the wrong direction. Fields was sacked nine times and completed only nine passes in a 13-11 loss to Denver on Sunday in London, with the Jets finishing with minus-10 net yards passing thanks to the sacks for the lowest total in any game since the Chargers had minus-19 against Kansas City on Sept. 20, 1998, in Ryan Leaf's third career start.",
      "Fields had the 10th game since the merger with at least nine sacks and nine or fewer completions and is the first player to do it twice with it also happening in his first career start in 2021 for Chicago against Cleveland.

      "Yoshinobu Yamamoto threw a three-hitter for the first postseason complete game in eight years as the Dodgers beat the slumping Milwaukee Brewers 5-1 on Tuesday to extend their lead in the National League Championship Series. Yamamoto's gem in Game 2 came one night after two-time Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell allowed one hit over eight shutout innings for a 2-1 victory.",

      "Yamamoto\u2019s complete game was the first for Los Angeles since Gavin Stone\u2019s four-hit shutout on June 26 last year at the Chicago White Sox.

Bos chested the ball to himself, split Roldan and Sands, then beat Chris Richards to the ball and hooked it with his left foot past Matt Freese\u2019s outstretched left arm for his second international goal.",
      "Wright tied the score after Richards intercepted a pass and played it to Roldan, who headed the ball to Weston McKennie and then received a return pass. Roldan slid a through ball to Wright, who took a touch with his left foot and with his right lifted the ball over goalkeeper Mathew Ryan from about 10 yards.",
      "Wright got his seventh international goal after Roldan took a quick restart and booted the ball two-thirds of the way down the field and into the penalty area. Wright ran onto the ball after four bounces and cut inside as Cameron Burgess fell, then curled the ball inside the far post with his left foot from about 14 yards.",

      "Pochettino changed six starters, inserting Pulisic, Wright, Roldan and Sands along with defender Mark McKenzie and right wing back Alex Freeman. Tim Weah shifted to left wing back. Sands made his first appearance since July 2023 and Freese his 10th straight start at goalkeeper. Midfielder Malik Tillman did not dress because he felt thigh cramp in training Monday,",
      "Freese stopped Nestory Irankunda's close-range shot in the 90th.",

      "\u201cBut the biggest thing I would say is it speaks to the fact that I\u2019ve had a chance to play in so many postseason games. And that\u2019s the biggest thing about being a Dodger. You know you\u2019ll have a chance in October to play meaningful baseball games. To be able to have that chance every single year I\u2019ve been here, that\u2019s always been the most important thing to me. You get as many chances as you can to win that World Series.

      "Hold on. The rat hole wasn't what you think. It wasn't some back alley bar that served as a speakeasy for the city's notorious gangster clientele or a tenement stuffed to the brim with junk. It was actually a full-body impression of an unlucky critter that got trapped in wet sidewalk cement in the city's Roscoe Village neighborhood about 20 or 30 years ago. The imprint closely resembles that of a spread-eagled rat, complete with outlines of what appear to be tiny claws, arms and legs and even a tail.",
      "The rat hole went viral early last year after comedian Winslow Dumaine posted a photo of it on X. The post drew curious tourists to the site at all hours, with some leaving coins and other odd objects around the impression as a tribute.",
      "The constant traffic drew complaints from neighbors, though, and in April 2024 someone filled the impression with a substance resembling plaster. City workers eventually removed that slab of sidewalk and took it to the City Hall-County Building. A plaque honoring the rat hole remains at the actual site.",
      "Researchers hailing from the University of Tennessee, New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine and the University of Calgary published a paper Wednesday in the journal Biology Letters that concludes the rat hole was most likely created not by the titular rodent but a squirrel or a muskrat.",

      "The researchers studied online photos of the rat hole and compared measurements of the imprint to museum specimens of animals commonly found in the Chicago area. The presence of arms, legs and a tail excluded birds, snakes, frogs and turtles, shrinking the possibilities to a mammal. The claw outlines further reduced the field to rats, mice, squirrels, chipmunks and muskrats, the study said.",
      "The creature's long forelimbs, third digits and hind paws were too large for a rat but fell into the measurement ranges for Eastern gray squirrels, fox squirrels and muskrats. The most probable suspect is the Eastern gray squirrel given how abundant that creature is in the Chicago area, the study concluded.",
      "Other researchers have theorized that a squirrel created the imprint, the study acknowledged. Cement is typically wet during the day, and rats are nocturnal and the creature didn't leave any tracks, suggesting a squirrel misjudged a leap or slipped from a branch and landed in the wet cement, the study noted.",
      "The imprint didn't show any sign of a bushy tail, but hair often lacks the rigidity to create deep, well-defined impressions, and it would have been surprising to find such an imprint, the study said.",
      "\u201cWe therefore propose that the specimen be rechristened the 'Windy City Sidewalk Squirrel' \u2014 a name more fitting of its likely origins and more aligned with the evidence at hand,\" they wrote.",

      "U.S. lawmakers and national security officials are increasingly alarmed that long-standing research ties between the U.S. and China could give China an advantage when it comes to developing new military technology",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For many years, American and Chinese scholars worked shoulder to shoulder on cutting-edge technologies through open research, where findings are freely shared and accessible to all. But that openness, a long-standing practice celebrated for advancing knowledge, is raising alarms among some U.S. lawmakers.",
      "They are worried that China \u2014 now considered the most formidable challenger to American military dominance \u2014 is taking advantage of open research to catch up with the U.S. on military technology and even gain an edge. And they are calling for action.",
      "\u201cFor far too long, our adversaries have exploited American colleges and universities to advance their interests, while risking our national security and innovation,\u201d said Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican and chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He has introduced legislation to put new restrictions on federally funded research collaboration with academics at several Chinese institutions that work with the Chinese military, as well as institutions in other countries deemed adversarial to U.S. interests.",
      "The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party makes it a priority to protect American research, having accused Beijing of weaponizing open research by converting it into a \u201cpipeline of foreign talent and military modernization.\u201d",
      "The rising concerns on Capitol Hill threaten to unravel deep, two-generations-old academic ties between the countries even as the world's two largest economies are moving away from each other through tariffs and trade barriers. The relationship has shifted from engagement to competition, if not outright enmity.",
      "\"Foreign adversaries are increasingly exploiting the open and collaborative environment of U.S. academic institutions for their own gain,\u201d said James Cangialosi, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, which in August issued a bulletin urging universities to do more to protect research from foreign meddling.",
      "The House committee released three reports in September alone. They targeted, respectively, Pentagon-funded research involving military-linked Chinese scholars; joint U.S.-China institutes that train STEM talent for China; and visa policies that have brought military-linked Chinese students to Ph.D. programs at American universities. The reports recommend more legislation to protect U.S. research, tighter visa policies to vet Chinese students and scholars and an end to academic partnerships that could be exploited to boost China\u2019s military powers.",
      "More than 500 U.S. universities and institutes have collaborated with Chinese military researchers in recent years, helping Beijing develop advanced technologies with military applications, such as anti-jamming communications and hypersonic vehicles, according to a report by the private U.S. intelligence group Strider Technologies.",
      "Despite efforts in recent years by the U.S. government to set up guardrails to prevent such collaboration from boosting China\u2019s military capabilities, the practice is still prevalent, according to Strider, based in Salt Lake City, Utah.",
      "The report identified nearly 2,500 publications produced in collaboration between U.S. entities and Chinese military-affiliated research institutes in 2024 on STEM research, which includes physics, engineering, material science, computer science, biology, medicine and geology. While the number peaked at more than 3,500 in 2019, before some new restrictive measures came into effect, the level of collaboration remains high, the report said.",
      "This collaboration not only facilitates \u201cpotential illicit knowledge transfer,\u201d but supports China's \u201cstate-directed efforts to recruit top international talent, often to the detriment of U.S. national interests,\u201d the report said.",

Stealing the fruits of that labor, however, can be as easy as hacking into a university network, hiring away researchers or coopting the research itself. That\u2019s why, authorities say, it\u2019s so tempting for American adversaries looking to take advantage of U.S. institutions and research.",
      "The most recent threat assessment report from the Department of Homeland Security highlights concerns that American adversaries \u2014 and China specifically \u2014 seek to illicitly acquire U.S. technology. Authorities say China aims to steal military and computing technology that might give the U.S. an advantage, as well as the latest commercial innovations.",
      "Abigail Coplin, assistant professor of sociology and science, technology and society at Vassar College, said there are already guardrails for federally funded research to protect classified information and anything deemed sensitive.",

      "Arnie Bellini, a tech entrepreneur and investor, also said efforts to protect U.S. research risk stifling progress if they go too far and prevent U.S. colleges or startups from sharing information about new and emerging technology. Keeping up with China will also require big investments in efforts to protect innovation, said Bellini, who recently donated $40 million to establish a new cybersecurity and AI research college at the University of South Florida.",

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday vetoed landmark legislation that would have restricted children's access to AI chatbots.",
      "The bill would have banned companies from making AI chatbots available to anyone under 18 years old unless the businesses could ensure the technology couldn't engage in sexual conversations or encourage self-harm.",
      "\u201cWhile I strongly support the author's goal of establishing necessary safeguards for the safe use of AI by minors, (the bill) imposes such broad restrictions on the use of conversational AI tools that it may unintentionally lead to a total ban on the use of these products by minors,\u201d Newsom said.",
      "The veto came hours after he signed a law requiring platforms to remind users they are interacting with a chatbot and not a human. The notification would pop up every three hours for users who are minors. Companies will also have to maintain a protocol to prevent self-harm content and refer users to crisis service providers if they expressed suicidal ideation.",
      "Newsom, who has four children under 18, said California has a responsibility to protect kids and teens who are increasingly turning to AI chatbots for everything from help with homework to emotional support and personal advice.",
      "California is among several states that tried this year to address concerns surrounding chatbots used by kids for companionship. Safety concerns around the technology exploded following reports and lawsuits saying chatbots made by Meta, OpenAI and others engaged with young users in highly sexualized conversations and, in some cases, coached them to take their own lives.",
      "The two measures were among a slew of AI bills introduced by California lawmakers this year to rein in the homegrown industry that is rapidly evolving with little oversight. Tech companies and their coalitions, in response, spent at least $2.5 million in the first six months of the session lobbying against the measures, according to advocacy group Tech Oversight California. Tech companies and leaders in recent months also announced they are launching pro-AI super PACs to fight state and federal oversight.",
      "The youth AI chatbot ban would have applied to generative AI systems that simulate \u201chumanlike relationship\u201d with users by retaining their personal information and asking unprompted emotional questions. It would have allowed the state attorney general to seek a civil penalty of $25,000 per violation.",
      "James Steyer, founder and CEO of Common Sense Media, said Newsom's veto of the bill was \u201cdeeply disappointing.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis legislation is desperately needed to protect children and teens from dangerous \u2014 and even deadly \u2014 AI companion chatbots,\u201d he said.",
      "But the tech industry argued that the bill was so broad that it would stifle innovation and take away useful tools for children, such as AI tutoring systems and programs that could detect early signs of dyslexia.",
      "Steyer also said the notification law didn't go far enough, saying it \u201cprovides minimal protections for children and families.\"",

The mother of a teenage boy in Florida who died by suicide after developing what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship with a chatbot has filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against Character.AI.

      "Arctic seals are being pushed closer to extinction by climate change and more than half of bird species around the world are declining under pressure from deforestation and agricultural expansion, according to an annual assessment from the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "One bright spot is green sea turtles, which have recovered substantially thanks to decades of conservation efforts, the IUCN said Friday as it released its latest Red List of Threatened Species.",
      "While many animals are increasingly at risk of disappearing forever, the updated list shows how species can come back from the brink with dedicated effort, Rima Jabado, deputy chair of the IUCN Species Survival Commission, told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cHope and concern go hand in hand in this work,\u201d Jabado wrote by email. \u201cThe same persistence that brought back the green sea turtle can be mirrored in small, everyday actions \u2014 supporting sustainable choices, backing conservation initiatives, and urging leaders to follow through on their environmental promises.\u201d",
      "The list is updated every year by teams of scientists assessing data on creatures around the world. The scope of the work is enormous and important for science, said Andrew Farnsworth, a visiting scientist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology who studies bird migration and wasn't involved with the IUCN report.",
      "\u201cEvery time one is done and every time there\u2019s revision, there\u2019s more information, and there\u2019s more ability to answer questions\u201d on species, some of which are still largely a mystery to researchers, Farnsworth said.",
      "Because all the marine mammals native to the Arctic \u2014 seals, whales and polar bears \u2014 rely on the habitat provided by sea ice, they're all at risk as it diminishes because of human-caused climate change, said Kit Kovacs, co-chair of IUCN\u2019s Species Survival Commission Pinniped Specialist Group, which focuses on seals.",
      "The three species highlighted in the latest IUCN report \u2014 harp, hooded and bearded seals \u2014 have been moved up to a designation of greater concern in the latest update, indicating they are increasingly threatened by extinction, Kovacs said.",
      "The same melting of glaciers and sea ice destroying seal habitats also \u201cgenerally will bring escalation in extreme weather events, which are already impacting people around the globe,\u201d wrote Kovacs.",
      "\u201cActing to help seals is acting to help humanity when it comes to climate change,\u201d Kovacs said.",

      "KNOWiNK, a St. Louis-based provider of electronic poll books that allow election officials to confirm voter information, announced the deal and the name change. In a possible nod to a groundless conspiracy theory that linked Dominion to the late Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez, the release highlighted that the company would become \u201c100% American-owned.\u201d",
      "The announcement also quotes KNOWiNK's owner, former St. Louis elections director Scott Leiendecker, as vowing to provide \u201celection technology that prioritizes paper-based transparency,\u201d one of the longtime demands of election conspiracy theorists.

      "The NTSB report states that the faulty engineering of the Titan \u201cresulted in the construction of a carbon fiber composite pressure vessel that contained multiple anomalies and failed to meet necessary strength and durability requirements.\u201d It also stated that OceanGate, the owner of the Titan, failed to adequately test the Titan and was unaware of its true durability.",

      "CONCORD, N.H. -- CONCORD, N.H. (AP) \u2014 New Hampshire\u2019s 2020 law abolishing deadlines for lawsuits alleging sexual assault cannot be applied retroactively, the state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday.",
      "The ruling came in the case of Randy Ball, who sued the Roman Catholic Bishop of Manchester in 2023 alleging he was raped by a priest at a summer camp in the 1970s. Under the law at the time of the alleged assaults, Ball had only until he turned 20 in 1986 to sue, but he argued his lawsuit was permissible under a 2020 amendment that removed the statute of limitations.",
      "The amendment itself did not specify whether it could be applied retroactively, but the court ruled that doing so would violate the state Constitution, which gives private parties a vested right to a statute of limitations defense.",
      "In upholding the dismissal of Ball\u2019s lawsuit, justices said they were \u201cacutely aware that victims of child sex abuse are some of the most vulnerable victims who deserve all the protections and remedies available in our judicial system,\u201d but emphasized their role was to interpret the Constitution.",
      "Ball's attorneys did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday. In court documents, they said it was understandable that it took him decades to come forward about the alleged abuse in which a now-deceased priest told him rape was \u201cthe product of God\u2019s love and all part of His plan.\u201d They also said the court should weigh the diocese's vested right to the statute of limitations defense against Ball's right to seek recourse for the harm he suffered.",
      "\u201cIt is one thing in a debt collection case to claim a right based on the passage of time to keep one's books in order,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIt is another thing altogether to claim freedom from accountability for one's part on the rape of a child because enough time has passed to make one believe they have escaped liability for the same.\u201d",

      "In 2002, the state agreed after a lengthy investigation not to prosecute the diocese as an institution or any individuals for their past handling of sexual abuse allegations involving clergy. In return, the diocese agreed to enact strict new child protection policies, admit its actions had harmed children and open itself up to a series of audits.",
      "\u201cFor more than 20 years, the Diocese has worked with victims and survivors of abuse to listen to their experiences and respond as each person may need, including pastoral care, counseling support, and financial assistance,\u201d the diocese said.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how many potential lawsuits would be affected by the ruling. Dioceses elsewhere have filed for bankruptcy due to the costs associated with lawsuits and settlements stemming from clergy abuse scandals. In January, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court sided with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Portland, which challenged a 2021 law that retroactively removed the statute of limitations for civil claims about child sexual abuse.",

      "A United Nations letter to Colombia warns that mercury contamination from illegal gold mining in the Atrato River basin is causing a grave human rights crisis for Indigenous and Afro-descendant communities",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) \u2014 The United Nations warned that mercury contamination from illegal gold mining in Colombia\u2019s Atrato River basin has created a \u201cserious and ongoing human rights crisis,\u201d threatening the health and survival of Indigenous and Afro-descendant communities who depend on the river for food, water and culture.",
      "In a letter made public on Tuesday, three U.N. Human Rights Council special rapporteurs raised concerns with the Colombian government about insufficient compliance with a 2016 Constitutional Court ruling that recognized the Atrato River as a legal entity with rights to protection and restoration.",
      "\u201cTen years have passed and we have seen that there has been insufficient implementation and compliance with the terms of that decision,\u201d Marcos Orellana, the U.N. special rapporteur on toxics and human rights, told The Associated Press. \u201cA big part of the problem stems from the presence of organized crime \u2014 smuggling mercury, smuggling gold, and corruption in military and police forces.\u201d",
      "The Atrato River, one of Colombia\u2019s largest waterways, winds nearly 500 miles from the western Andes to the Caribbean Sea through the lush jungles of Choco, one of the country\u2019s most biodiverse yet impoverished regions. It\u2019s home to predominantly Afro-Colombian and Indigenous communities that rely on fishing and small-scale farming \u2014 livelihoods now imperiled by toxic pollution.",
      "Illegal gold mining is now among the main drivers of deforestation and pollution across many of Latin America's Amazon regions. Soaring gold prices and weak traceability systems have fueled demand for illicitly mined gold that often slips into global supply chains. The mercury used to extract the metal has devastated wildlife \u2014 including river dolphins and fish \u2014 and contaminated the food sources of Indigenous communities in remote areas of the Amazon.",
      "AP reporting last year showed how local residents \u2014 charged with safeguarding the river \u2014 act as watchguards of illegal mining and the health of the river, often under threat from armed groups.",
      "Orellana said the U.N. received evidence showing that more than a third of the population in the Atrato watershed has been exposed to mercury levels exceeding World Health Organization limits. He called the situation \u201cincredibly concerning,\u201d citing the metal\u2019s extreme toxicity and its ability to cause neurological damage, organ failure and developmental disorders in unborn children.",
      "The 2016 court ruling was hailed globally as a milestone in environmental law, inspiring similar \u201crights of nature\u201d initiatives elsewhere. But Orellana said political turnover, lack of funding and alleged corruption have undermined enforcement.",
      "\u201cComplying with a court decision requires institutional commitment over the long term,\u201d he said. \u201cPolitics can interfere, and reality kicks in when budgets don\u2019t follow.\u201d",
      "The letter \u2014 cosigned by the special rapporteur on the right to a healthy environment and the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent \u2014 was sent to the Colombian government more than 60 days ago, Orellana said, but has not yet received a response. Under standard U.N. procedures, governments are given 60 days to reply to such communications before they are made public.",
      "\u201cIt is my expectation that the government will reply, giving effect to its obligations under international human rights law,\u201d he said.",

      "Mercury is commonly used in small-scale gold mining to separate gold from sediment, but when released into rivers it poisons fish and builds up in human tissue. Colombia banned mercury use in mining in 2018, yet enforcement remains weak \u2014 especially in conflict zones dominated by armed groups and criminal networks.",
      "Orellana said his office has received evidence of slavery like labor, forced prostitution and displacement linked to illegal mining operations in the Atrato region.",

      "Hinojosa, who represents Austin, joins a race that has been without big-name challengers and overshadowed in Texas by a competitive U.S. Senate contest. She was a fierce critic of a $1 billion private school voucher program in Texas and joined Democrats' walkout this summer that temporarily delayed the passage of redrawn U.S. House maps sought by President Donald Trump.",
      "Abbott, who is seeking a record fourth term, has won each of his last three races by double-digits and his campaign is sitting on more than $80 million, underscoring the tall task facing any challenger.",
      "\u201cOur fight right now is against the billionaires and the corporations who are driving up prices, closing our neighborhood schools and cheating Texans out of basic health care. That's who Greg Abbott works for,\u201d she said in a video announcing her candidacy. \u201cI'm running for governor to work for you.\u201d",

      "The Geneva-based agency said the increase in the global average concentration of carbon dioxide from 2023 to 2024 amounted to the highest annual level of any one-year span since measurements began in 1957. Growth rates of CO2 have accelerated from an annual average increase of 2.4 parts per million per year in the decade from 2011 to 2020, to 3.5 ppm from 2023 to 2024, WMO said.",
      "\u201cThe heat trapped by CO2 and other greenhouse gases is turbo-charging our climate and leading to more extreme weather,\" said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett in a statement. \u201cReducing emissions is therefore essential not just for our climate but also for our economic security and community well-being.\u201d",

      "Even though fossil fuel emissions were \u201crelatively flat\u201d last year, he said, the report appeared to show an accelerating increase of CO2 in the atmosphere, \u201csignaling a positive feedback from burning forests and warming oceans driven by record global temperatures.\u201d",
      "\"Let there be no mistake, this is a very clear warning sign that the world is heading into an extremely dangerous state \u2014 and this is driven by the continued expansion of fossil fuel development, globally,\" Hare said. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to feel that this points to a slow-moving climate catastrophe unfolding in front of us.\u201d",
      "WMO called on policymakers to take more steps to help reduce emissions.",
      "While several governments have been pushing for further use of hydrocarbons like coal, oil and gas for energy production, some businesses and local governments have been mobilizing to fight global warming.",

      "The weekend storm brought high winds and surf that battered the low-lying Alaska Native communities along the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta in the southwestern part of the state, nearly 500 miles (800 km) from Anchorage. At least one person was killed and two were missing. The Coast Guard plucked two dozen people from their homes after the structures floated out to sea.",
      "Hundreds were staying in school shelters, including one with no working toilets, officials said. The weather system followed a storm that struck parts of western Alaska days earlier.",
      "Across the region, more than 1,500 people were displaced. Dozens were flown to a shelter set up in the National Guard armory in the regional hub city of Bethel, a community of 6,000 people, and officials were considering flying evacuees to longer-term shelter or emergency housing in Fairbanks and Anchorage.",
      "The hardest-hit communities included Kipnuk, population 715, and Kwigillingok, population 380. They are off the state's main road system and reachable this time of year only by water or by air.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s catastrophic in Kipnuk. Let\u2019s not paint any other picture,\u201d Mark Roberts, incident commander with the state emergency management division, told a news conference Tuesday. \u201cWe are doing everything we can to continue to support that community, but it is as bad as you can think.\u201d",

      "Originally scheduled for Wednesday, the 2024 Social Security COLA announcement will now be Oct. 24. It is timed to the September Consumer Price Index, which also has not yet been released.",
      "The agency adjusts its benefits every year based on inflation. The postponement of the announcement is the most recent example of how the government shutdown, entering its third week and with little progress made toward a resolution, has made it more difficult for people to plan out their finances.",

      "Some lawmakers have proposed legislation that would make SSA use a different index, called the Consumer Price Index for the Elderly (CPI-E), to calculate the cost-of-living increase that measures price changes based on the spending patterns of older people on things such as health care, food and medicine.",

      "The agency is expected to begin notifying recipients about their new benefit amount starting in early December.

      "Charles Crawford, 59, has been on death row for more than 30 years. The scheduled lethal injection comes several months after the execution of Mississippi\u2019s longest-serving death row inmate in a year of increasing executions nationwide.",
      "Crawford was convicted of abducting Kristy Ray from her parents\u2019 home in northern Mississippi\u2019s Tippah County on Jan. 29, 1993. According to court records, when Ray\u2019s mother came home, her daughter\u2019s car was gone and a handwritten ransom note had been left on the table.",

      "He later told authorities he blacked out and did not recall killing Ray.",
      "At the time of his arrest, Crawford was days away from going to trial on a separate assault charge. That stemmed from an attack in 1991 in which Crawford was accused of raping a 17-year-old girl and hitting her friend with a hammer.",

The argument relies on a 2018 Supreme Court ruling, which ordered a new trial for a death row inmate and established that a lawyer for a criminal defendant cannot override a client\u2019s wish to maintain innocence at trial.",

      "The Supreme Court is taking up a major Republican-led challenge to the Voting Rights Act, the centerpiece legislation of the Civil Rights Movement",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court is taking up a major Republican-led challenge to the Voting Rights Act, the centerpiece legislation of the Civil Rights Movement, that could gut a key provision of the law that prohibits racial discrimination in redistricting.",
      "The justices on Wednesday are hearing arguments for the second time in a case over Louisiana's congressional map, which has two majority Black districts. A ruling for the state could open the door for legislatures to redraw congressional maps across the South, potentially boosting Republican electoral prospects by eliminating majority Black and Latino seats that tend to favor Democrats.",
      "A mid-decade battle over congressional redistricting already is playing out across the nation, after President Donald Trump began urging Texas and other Republican-controlled states to redraw their lines to make it easier for the GOP to hold its narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.",
      "The court's conservative majority has been skeptical of considerations of race, most recently ending affirmative action in college admissions. Twelve years ago, the court took a sledgehammer to another pillar of the landmark voting law that required states with a history of racial discrimination to get approval in advance from the Justice Department or federal judges before making election-related changes.",
      "The court has separately given state legislatures wide berth to gerrymander for political purposes, subject only to review by state supreme courts. If the court now weakens or strikes down the law's Section 2, states would not be bound by any limits in how they draw electoral districts, a result that is expected to lead to extreme gerrymandering by whichever party is in power at the state level.",
      "Just two years ago, the court, by a 5-4 vote, affirmed a ruling that found a likely violation of the Voting Rights Act in a similar case over Alabama\u2019s congressional map. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined their three more liberal colleagues in the outcome.",
      "That decision led to new districts in both states that sent two more Black Democrats to Congress.",
      "Now, though, the court has asked the parties to answer a fundamental question: \u201cWhether the state\u2019s intentional creation of a second majority-minority congressional district violates the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.\u201d",
      "In the first arguments in the Louisiana case in March, Roberts sounded skeptical of the second majority Black district, which last year elected Democratic Rep. Cleo Fields. Roberts described the district as a \u201csnake\u201d that stretches more than 200 miles (320 kilometers) to link parts of the Shreveport, Alexandria, Lafayette and Baton Rouge areas.",

But the changes effectively maintained the status quo of five Republican-leaning majority white districts and one Democratic-leaning majority Black district.",
      "Civil rights advocates won a lower-court ruling that the districts likely discriminated against Black voters.",
      "The state eventually drew a new map to comply with the court ruling and protect its influential Republican lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson. But white Louisiana voters claimed in their separate lawsuit that race was the predominant factor driving it. A three-judge court agreed, leading to the current high court case.",

But the remote location and severe damage are limiting their options as they race against other impending storms and the onset of winter.",
      "High winds and surging waters battered low-lying, isolated Alaska Native communities along the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta in southwest Alaska, nearly 500 miles (800 km) from Anchorage, over the weekend. The Coast Guard plucked two dozen people from their homes after the structures floated out to sea in high water, three people were missing or dead, and hundreds of people were staying in school shelters \u2014 including one with no working toilets, officials said.",
      "The system followed a storm that struck parts of western Alaska days earlier.",
      "Across the region, more than 1,500 people were displaced. Dozens had been flown to a shelter set up in the National Guard armory in the regional hub city of Bethel, a community of 6,000 people, and officials are considering flying evacuees to longer-term shelter or emergency housing in Fairbanks and Anchorage as they run out of room there.",
      "Fuel storage depots intended to support communities in the region had apparently been damaged, threatening pollution that could harm the fish and game the Alaska Native residents rely on for subsistence. Some people in the area may have lost freezers full of food such as salmon and moose intended to get them through the winter.",
      "The hardest-hit communities included Kipnuk, population 715, and Kwigillingok, population 380. They are off the state's main road system and reachable this time of year only by water or by air.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s catastrophic in Kipnuk. Let\u2019s not paint any other picture,\u201d Mark Roberts, incident commander with the state emergency management division, told a news conference Tuesday. \u201cWe are doing everything we can to continue to support that community, but it is as bad as you can think.\u201d",

      "Officials warned of a long road to recovery and a need for continued support for the hardest-hit communities. Most rebuilding supplies would have to be transported in, and there is little time left with winter just around the corner.",

      "A Florida judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked the planned transfer of prime downtown Miami land for President Donald Trump\u2019s future presidential library.",
      "The move by Circuit Judge Mavel Ruiz came after a Miami activist alleged that officials at a local college violated Florida's open government law when they gifted the sizable plot of real estate to the state, which then voted to transfer it to the foundation for the planned library.",

      "Marvin Dunn, an activist and chronicler of local Black history, filed a lawsuit this month in a Miami-Dade County court against the Board of Trustees for Miami Dade College, a state-run school that owned the property. He alleged that the board violated Florida's Government in the Sunshine law by not providing sufficient notice for its special meeting on Sept. 23, when it voted to give up the land.",
      "An agenda released ahead of the meeting simply stated the board would consider conveying property to a state fund overseen by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet, but provided no details on which piece of property was being considered or why. Unlike every other meeting the board has held this year, the 8 a.m. meeting on Sept. 23 was not livestreamed.",
      "A week later, DeSantis and other top GOP officials voted to transfer the land again, effectively putting the property under the control of the Trump family when they deeded it to the foundation for Trump\u2019s library.

    "story": [
      "The Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library is rising from the rugged Badlands of western North Dakota, where the 26th president roamed as a young man in the 1880s",
      "MEDORA, N.D. -- MEDORA, N.D. (AP) \u2014 The day his young wife and mother died, Theodore Roosevelt wrote in his diary that \u201cthe light has gone out of my life,\u201d and it was only through extended trips to the isolated Dakota Territory in the 1880s that he regained \u201cthe romance\" of living.",
      "A library examining the country\u2019s 26th president will open next summer in the North Dakota landscape remarkably similar to what Roosevelt would have experienced: far from any city and surrounded by rugged hills beneath a vast sky.",
      "The isolation that was so appealing to Roosevelt remains today, and it raises a question.",
      "How many people will visit a museum so distant from the rest of America?",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s a calculated risk that is being taken, and I actually think it\u2019s a good one,\u201d said Clay Jenkinson, a public humanities scholar and Roosevelt author who believes the area's beauty will help draw visitors.",
      "The nearly 100,000-square-foot facility near Medora, North Dakota, is planned to open July 4, 2026, America's 250th anniversary. All living presidents have been invited.",
      "Library Foundation CEO Ed O'Keefe said he wants the library to be where \u201ckids drag their parents,\" a setting for picnics, weddings and even presidential debates.",
      "Library boosters have a $450 million fundraising goal, with $344 million in cash and pledges so far, including from oil executive Harold Hamm and Walmart heir Rob Walton and his wife, Melani. Construction, design and related costs alone are pegged at $276 million. Other costs include millions for developing exhibits and digitizing archives.",
      "The library rises from the flat, grassy top of a butte across a highway from Theodore Roosevelt National Park, which had more than 732,000 visits last year. A path leads onto the library's sloping roof planted with grasses and flowers. Inside, enormous rammed-earth walls of layered colors represent the dramatic Badlands.",
      "\u201cThis is a purposeful place. We like to say that the library is the landscape,\u201d O'Keefe said.",
      "Roosevelt came to the Badlands to hunt bison in 1883. He invested in a ranching operation and returned multiple times over several years following the deaths of his wife and mother.",
      "Stories of his adventures live on, from riding with cowboys to knocking out a bully in a bar and apprehending three boat thieves.",
      "In an Independence Day speech in Dickinson, Roosevelt gave his famous \u201cI like big things\u201d oration, which more or less was the beginning of his speaking career, said William Hansard, public historian at Dickinson State University's Theodore Roosevelt Center.",
      "\u201cHe goes on to talk about how all of the material prosperity that America has means nothing if it's not backed up by morals and virtues. ... All these big things in the world don't matter if Americans don't have good character to use them and to use them well and correctly,\u201d Hansard said.",
      "Roosevelt's time in Dakota largely ended after cattle losses in the terrible winter of 1886-87. He later said he never would have been president were it not for his time in North Dakota.",
      "Roosevelt is a favorite president of people across the political spectrum, and his use of executive power \u2014 such as conserving public lands and building the Panama Canal \u2014 has shaped the modern presidency.",

      "But there's no question North Dakota's winters can be brutal with subzero temperatures and blizzards that close highways and make travel nearly impossible.",
      "Still, Roosevelt admirers note that earlier attempts to create Roosevelt libraries in other places fell short, and it was in North Dakota where the idea really took root.",
      "\u201cWe North Dakotans who justly feel that we created Theodore Roosevelt, that he became the Theodore Roosevelt of American greatness and memory during his time here in North Dakota, we feel that it would be very appropriate to have a presidential library in the heart of the Badlands,\u201d Jenkinson said.",
      "And beyond hardy winter travelers, O'Keefe said, library planners want to bring thousands of eighth graders from a five-state area to the library outside of summer, envisioning a \u201cnight at the museum\u201d program.",
      "\u201cIt's not going to be as busy as the summer, but that's the magic of it. You get a little more of the Badlands to yourself,\u201d O'Keefe said.",
      "O\u2019Keefe said the facility will \u201chumanize, not lionize\u201d Theodore Roosevelt.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to shy away from the controversies and things that, perhaps if this library had been built 125 years ago, wouldn\u2019t have been mentioned,\u201d O'Keefe said.",
      "It would be a travesty to portray Roosevelt only as a wholly good figure, said Jenkinson, who called him a man of his times, a bully, an imperialist and perhaps a warmonger.",
      "He invited Black leader Booker T. Washington to dine at the White House. But he discharged \u201cwithout honor\u201d an entire regiment of 167 Black soldiers without due process, in connection with a shooting in a Texas town. Roosevelt encouraged photographer Edward S. Curtis in his photography of Native peoples, and some Native Americans were among Roosevelt's Rough Riders.",
      "\u201cBut he also believed that Anglo-Saxon white America had a right and even a duty to dispossess Native peoples and install what he took to be a superior civilization. There was no ambiguity about that,\u201d Jenkinson said.",
      "Kermit Roosevelt said he hopes the library helps people understand the legacy of his great-great-grandfather.",
      "\u201cI really do think Theodore Roosevelt is important for us now because of his ability to appeal to people across the political spectrum and, in our polarized times, maybe bring people together and give them a sense of what it means to be American,\u201d he said.",

      "Roberts plays the professor, whose devoted student, portrayed by Edebiri, accuses her closest confidante of misconduct. The movie, which also stars Andrew Garfield, explores the fallout from the allegation as the characters compete for tenure and navigate shifting alliances.",

    "story": [
      "For 14 years, Donnie Wahlberg starred as Detective Danny Reagan on the CBS police procedural \"Blue Bloods.\" The hit drama about the Reagans, the fictional first family of the New York Police Department, had a loyal following. \"I was stopped on airplanes, on trains, on the street, at basketball \u2013 you name it. Wherever I was, somebody would tell me they love 'Blue Bloods,'\" said Wahlberg.",
      "Now 56, Wahlberg is sitting at a new family's dinner table, in \"Boston Blue,\" a \"Blue Bloods\" spinoff set in a city the actor knows well.",
      "Wahlberg grew up the eighth of nine kids in the working-class Boston neighborhood of Dorchester. \"We were poor,\" he said. \"There were nine kids, a dog, a cat, and a grandma in the basement, and my mom and dad for a while. There were kids coming and going, running away, being arrested. There were arguments, fights, alcohol. I definitely learned from some of my older siblings that, here's a clear path of what not to do.\"",
      "Wahlberg says he was the family peacemaker. \"I don't like to use the term ('cause I don't wanna insult my other siblings), but one of the adults. My role was to get everyone together and be happy by any means necessary.\"",
      "The discord wasn't just inside the house; 1970s Boston was a cauldron of racial tension. A controversial court-ordered desegregation program bussed students to schools outside their neighborhoods. As a first grader, Wahlberg was sent from Irish-Catholic Dorchester to predominantly Black Roxbury.",
      "He describes it as \"probably the most important thing that ever happened in my life.\"",
      "Because? \"Because I don't know what I would've not been exposed to, had I not been on those buses. In my neighborhood, if I woulda said, 'Yeah, I wanna be a singer one day,' I could think of five kids in the neighborhood who would punch me in the face. And two of them lived in my house!\"",
      "It was after hearing hip hop in the fourth grade that Wahlberg caught the performing bug. \"I would listen to 'Rapper's Delight,' I just would start writing my own raps and making up my own songs,\" he said.",
      "That helped Wahlberg earn an audition, at just 14 years old, with Maurice Starr, the local impresario who'd founded New Edition and was starting a new band. \"Maurice was looking for the equivalent of the Osmonds to the Jacksons,\" he said.",
      "What did his parents think? \"My mom was super supportive,\" he recalled. \"And I said, 'Dad, I'm gonna start this music band.' And he said, 'Well, I tell ya' what: If you ever do make it big, and you come home, and you've changed, I'm gonna kick your ass.'\"",
      "In 1984, Donnie and his younger brother Mark became the first two members of New Kids on the Block. But the family affair was short-lived, as Mark quit. \"He didn't like singing,\" said Donnie. \"He couldn't sing.\u00a0 There's a scene of him as Dirk Diggler in 'Boogie Nights' singing horribly. That's actually better than he sang as a member of New Kids!\"",
      "With four other members in place (including some of Wahlberg's schoolmates), the group struggled at first to find its footing. But by the late 1980s, they appeared to have the right stuff:",
      "While the band was popular, it was far from critics' choice. \"I really struggled with the criticism of the band \u2013 we couldn't sing, we were puppets, we were fake,\" said Wahlberg.",
      "To feel better about himself, Wahlberg focused on writing and producing, not just for the New Kids, but also for his brother Mark. Soon enough they had a #1 hit, \"Good Vibrations.\"",
      "Donnie said, \"Marky Mark and my brother's career and his music was really when I started to get my head screwed on right of how I could really prove myself.\"",
      "Prove himself \u2026 and protect his kid brother. \"My brother was getting in trouble and my mom was like, 'You gotta help your brother and get him out of the streets,'\" said Wahlberg. \"I don't like to wear the Marky Mark and my brother's career as some kind of badge of honor. He worked very hard for his career. But I really did, you know, help him in a big way, and helped myself in a big way in doing that.\"",
      "After the New Kids broke up in 1994, Wahlberg turned to acting, breaking through in \"The Sixth Sense.\" Other roles followed, including \"Band of Brothers\" and \"Boomtown,\" along with reunions for New Kids on the Block, which still keep him busy.",
      "Wahlberg now lives outside Chicago, in a home he shares with his second wife, TV personality Jenny McCarthy.",
      "\"We have very similar upbringings, which really helps,\" said McCarthy. \"I think we're both people-pleasers, which could also be bad if you're not in therapy about it!\"",
      "\"Lotta therapy we've each had, and together,\" said Wahlberg.",
      "\"But we're caretakers, you know, of our family, which I think is something to be proud of,\" McCarthy added.",
      "They may now live in McCarthy's hometown, but Boston is never far from Wahlberg's heart, as evident in his home office, which features mementoes from Bill Belichick, Bill Russell and Larry Bird.",
      "And then there's his new show which he wasn't sure he wanted to do after \"Blue Bloods\"' cancellation. \"I love 'Blue Bloods,'\" he said. \"I fought tooth-and-nail to keep it on the air. And here's an opportunity to keep this character alive. And suddenly, when I started to look at it through that lens, it was like, how do I not do this? If all those millions of 'Blue Bloods' fans don't show up and love it, then I know we put our best foot forward.\"",
      "Between his TV work and concerts, it's a busy life for Donnie Wahlberg. \"People say to me, 'Oh, gosh, when do you sleep?' You want me to complain? Everything I ever wanted, I'm doing it. I wanna work harder, I want to be worthy of it. I want to be worthy of \u2026 the gift that so many people give me of their time. How can I not work my ass off to repay that?\"",
      "But he says he's just doing what he's always done: \"My childhood was spent trying to bring joy and love to a large group of people amidst chaos and confusion and pain. And it's what I do for a living right now.\u00a0 It's what I've grown up to do.\"",

      "Had that Brooklyn boy come out here, say, three years ago, he might have been just another tourist. But not anymore. His turn as the talented but tormented chef on the award-winning FX series \"The Bear\" has made the 34-year-old one of the hottest commodities in Hollywood.",
      "I said, \"Early on, it strikes me that if you were just to read the script, it was kind of just a story about a sandwich shop.\"",
      "\"It was a hard thing to explain,\" said White, \"and it sounded something like that, you know? Yes, this, like, kid, he comes back, he's a chef, and he's, like, opening a sandwich shop. And I saw my friends trying to be nice and say, Oh, that sounds great, you know?\"",
      "He ended up sweeping nearly all of the awards: Emmys, Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild, Critics Choice. His two young daughters call them his \"trophy winners cups.\" \"They like them, they get a kick out of it, but they also are very honest and there's just like, Why do you get all these things?\" White said.",
      "Back out at the Jersey shore, it's not those past awards that matter. It's the ones that might be coming down the Jersey Turnpike for White's performance as Springsteen himself.",
      "And yes, that really is White's voice. He said, \"If you're gonna do one thing to get it right, you have to perform to the point of exhaustion. 'Cause he continues until he cannot go any longer.",
      "\"Everybody's got their own idea of Bruce Springsteen. And I think at the beginning, I was approaching it like, how am I going to make everybody happy? That's a fool's errand. It's an impossibility.\"",
      "\"Was there a moment that you thought to yourself, Yeah, I got this. I can do this?\" I asked.",
      "\"No, I don't think so,\" White replied. \"There were moments where I found confidence, but I always wanted more, I wanted more time, I wanted to go deeper.\"",
      "Springsteen was aware of White before the film. He had seen and admired the emotional complexity in his work, and that's a well Springsteen knew whoever played him needed to have. White said, \"Bruce has gone on record and said, you know, I have no problem performing for three hours on stage. That's easy for me. I know exactly who I am on stage. You know, it's the other 21 hours that I have trouble with.\"",
      "\"Did you know any of that before you really took a deep dive?\" I asked.",
      "\"I mean, I was familiar enough with his music that, you know, I understood his depth, and I understood, you know, we're dealing with a man who's looked over the edge before, absolutely,\" said White. \"But, no.\"",
      "The film, \"Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,\" based on the book of the same name, follows the making of the 1982 album \"Nebraska.\" Some say it's Springsteen as his best, but he himself may have actually been at his worst.",
      "In his 2016 autobiography, \"Born to Run,\" he describes an emotional breakdown while at a Texas county fair, not long after \"Nebraska\" was finished:",
      "\"I've just pulled a perfect swan dive into my abyss; my stomach is on rinse cycle, and I'm going down, down, down. I just feel a need to get rooted somewhere, before I drift into ether.\"",
      "White said, \"I asked him, what's that panic about? You know, what is that fear inside of you? And he said, 'I had this moment where I felt like an outsider and observer in my own life.'\"",
      "I asked, \"Have you ever struggled with mental illness yourself?\"",
      "\"Yeah, of course,\" said White. \"When he told me about that, that feeling of being an observer of your own life, that was very familiar to me. I remember when I found acting, there was a lot of like, I think like, chaos and confusion, just a lot going on. I couldn't focus on myself. And I found acting, and I found some peace and I found some focus.\"",
      "White has drawn from that emotional trough as early as he can remember, even during his days of doing crime dramas on TV, when he was looking for certain things \u2013 not just a job. \"Yeah, you know, I was very lucky, I was a kid, so my first agents were kind of confused and upset with me for kind of, like, having a standard for what I would go audition for,\" he said. \"I'd never done anything before when I was 13, and they were like, Just go on the audition, you know?\"",
      "One of those auditions landed him on \"Shameless.\" For 11 seasons he played bad boy, big brother, and brainiac Lip Gallagher.",
      "His unruly hair and blue eyes got him counted among the so-called \"rodent men\" - a term used to describe a few of the most physically desirable things a man can be these days. His Calvin Klein underwear ad certainly helped.",
      "Before we left the shore, we stopped by the Stone Pony, where White tried to re-create on film Springsteen's early glory days.",
      "\"Bruce was there, like he was a lot of days, and he came out, and he kind of introduced me to the audience, so he gave them to me all warmed up,\" White recalled. \"They made me feel like a star for three-and-a-half minutes. And then the first A.D. would say 'Cut,' and they would go silent. And I remembered, I am not Bruce Springsteen, I am just an actor!\"",
      "A guy from Brooklyn playing a guy from Jersey \u2013 they both seem to understand one another, and neither would change a thing.",
      "White said, \"The ride is fun, but I'm, you know, I'm filled up. I just want to work with people I admire and be able to keep doing what I love to do. That's what's important to me.\"",
      "I asked, \"So, if all the fame and success ended after this film, you'd feel like ...?\"",
      "\"Can I still work?\"",
      "\"Yeah.\"",
      "\"Then, yeah, I'm okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 12 Oct 2025 10:00:14 -0400",
    "summary": "The latest white-knuckle thriller by director Kathryn Bigelow imagines the responses within the government and the military when a single ICBM is launched toward the United States.",
    "story": [
      "It's a nightmare we've been living with all our lives. \"I grew up in an era when we had to hide under our desks in the case of an atomic bomb,\" said director Kathryn Bigelow, \"so I suppose I was sort of imprinted early on with the prospect of nuclear war.\"",
      "In Bigelow's new film, \"A House of Dynamite,\" the prospect of nuclear war suddenly becomes an insane reality. It tells of a single missile launched from an unknown location in the Pacific. At first it looks like a test, but it keeps on coming \u2013 with a trajectory estimated to be the continental United States.",
      "With 19 minutes to impact, the president (played by Idris Elba) has to make an impossible decision.",
      "Noah Oppenheim, a former president of NBC News, wrote the script, which dramatizes what he calls \"the insanity that we would expect a single human being with limited preparation to decide in a matter of minutes the fate of all mankind.\"",
      "Bigelow, whose previous movies include \"The Hurt Locker\" (an all-too-real look at the war in Iraq) and \"Zero Dark Thirty\" (about the hunt for Osama Bin Laden) applied her trademark authenticity to the unthinkable. \"It's my responsibility as a filmmaker, if I'm presenting an environment that really exists, to be as authentic as possible,\" she said.",
      "Bigelow says she did not seek cooperation from the Pentagon for the film: \"I felt that we needed to be more independent. But that being said, we had multiple tech advisors who have worked in the Pentagon. They were with me every day we shot.\"",
      "One military consultant was retired Lt. Gen. Dan Karbler. \"Never in a million years would I have thought that I would have been in this position,\" he said.",
      "Karbler nailed his audition when he opened his first Zoom call with Bigelow like this: \"'This is the DDO from the Pentagon convening a strategic conference. This conference is Top Secret. Please bring the President into the conference.' And I stopped there and clicked on my camera and I said, 'Ladies and gentlemen, that's how the worst day of America's history will begin.'\"",
      "I noted, \"That doesn't sound like something you were ad-libbing?\"",
      "\"I was not ad-libbing at all,\" said Karbler. \"That comes from a lot of practice.\"",
      "He was on a movie set, but Karbler took command of the actors just as he once did with the real soldiers at Fort Greeley, Alaska, the front line of defense against an incoming missile. He described those scenes as \"super-realistic.\"",
      "He said. \"I have a son and daughter, and they're both missile defenders. And all I can think about is my own kids and how those actors totally nailed it.\"",
      "In \"A House of Dynamite,\" the missile is tracked as it arcs toward the United States. [In such a scenario, the U.S. would have less than 10 minutes to make the decisions and get interceptors airborne.]",
      "Two interceptors are launched \u2013 the classic \"bullet hitting a bullet.\"",
      "\"That kill vehicle will go and basically run itself into the incoming missile,\" said Karbler. \"That closing velocity can be in excess of 30,000 miles an hour. I think the movie has it pretty accurate when they talk about 61% chance of killing it.\"",
      "The watch officer in the White House Situation Room is played by Rebecca Ferguson. Larry Pfeiffer, who once ran the real White House Situation Room, said, \"This movie is going to give the American moviegoer a chance to feel what it's really like to work in a space like that.",
      "\"There are going to be things that happen in the world that require the immediate attention and action by the President of the United States, and you need to be as perfect as possible,\" he said.",
      "The president is in a motorcade when he's hit with the one crisis he thought he would never face: a missile inbound for Chicago. \"I had one briefing when I was sworn in,\" he says. \"One! And they told me that's the protocol!\"",
      "According to Dan Karbler, a real-world president is likely to be just as unprepared.",
      "Asked whether he had ever done a drill when the real president was involved, he replied, \"No, no, sir.\"",
      "\"So, if it were the real thing, he wouldn't have a lot of practice?\" I asked.",
      "\"I believe the last president to have participated in one of the exercises was President Reagan,\" Karbler said.",
      "So, what does screenwriter Noah Oppenheim want audiences to be thinking, once they've caught their breath? \"I want people to be reminded that, even though the Cold War is long over, the nuclear era is not, and that we live, as the title says, in a house full of dynamite,\" he said.",
      "To which director Kathryn Bigelow added, \"My question is how do we take the dynamite out of the walls \u2026 without tearing down the house?\"",

      "Additional information was not immediately available. Keaton's family, which has not responded to CBS News' inquiries, has not released a statement, and is not planning to today, according to Rath.",
      "People Magazine, which first reported Keaton's death, said the actress died in California on Saturday, Oct. 11, citing a family spokesperson.",
      "An actress for more than four decades, the beloved star thought she would be a singer, telling\u00a0\"CBS Sunday Morning\" in February 2010, \"I wanted to sing. I did everything I could to be a singer.\"",
      "Born in 1946 in Los Angeles, Keaton appeared on the stage in the musical \"Hair\" at 22 years old and then in Woody Allen's \"Play It Again, Sam\" in 1968, for which she would receive a Tony nomination.",
      "Keaton said her voice wasn't good enough, and she moved on to acting, making her first film appearance in \"Lovers and Other Strangers\" in 1970, while her many early TV credits include appearances on \"Mannix,\" \"The F.B.I.,\" \"Night Gallery,\" and \"Love, American Style.\"",
      "She starred as Al Pacino's girlfriend Kay in \"The Godfather\" in 1972 and repeated the role in the crime saga's two sequels. The couple became romantically involved after the filming of The Godfather Part II, Keaton said.",
      "Keaton then became well-known for a string of movies she did with famed director Woody Allen \u2014 starting one of the 70s most enduring screen partnerships. She starred in \"Manhattan,\" \"Annie Hall,\" and \"Love and Death, among others.",
      "She said she had a \"huge crush\" on Allen right from the moment she saw him.",
      "\"He was hilarious,\" Keaton told \"CBS News Sunday Morning.\"",
      "She was also romantically linked to Warren Beatty, who directed her and with whom she co-starred in \"Reds.\"",
      "Keaton won her first Oscar for \"Annie Hall\" \u2014 an exceptionally rare win for a comic performance \u2014 at the 50th Annual Academy Awards and would go on to be nominated three more times, for \"Reds,\" \"Marvin's Room,\" and \"Something's Gotta Give.\"",
      "Keaton never married and didn't start a family until she was 50, saying she was \"a late developer.\"\u00a0 Keaton said if she got married, she would've had to \"compromise too much.\"",
      "She said she wanted to try more adventurous things for herself and also said she was \"afraid of men.\" She said she was always being turned down and overlooked. \"I wasn't marriage material.\"",
      "She adopted two children when she was in her 50s: a daughter, Dexter, and a son, Duke.\u00a0 Keaton said she really enjoyed being a daughter and didn't embrace parenthood until after her father died.",
      "\"I had to accept I had to move on,\" she said.",
      "She continued to act throughout her life, her last appearance coming in 2024's \"Summer Camp.\"",
      "Hollywood stars pay tribute to Diane Keaton",
      "Tributes to Keaton poured in from fellow Hollywood actors after they learned of her passing.",

      "\"[Keaton] was hilarious, a complete original, and completely without guile, or any of the competitiveness one would have expected from such a star,\" Midler, who starred alongside Keaton in \"The First Wives Club,\" wrote on Instagram. \"What you saw was who she was...oh, la, lala!\"",
      "Kimberly Williams-Paisley, who played Keaton's daughter in \"Father of the Bride,\" said working with the legendary actress will always be one of the highlights of her life.",

    "story": [
      "Audiences have been enjoying films at movie theaters for decades, but streaming and expensive\u00a0ticket prices\u00a0have impacted\u00a0moviegoing habits. For the owners and operators of independent theaters, survival means getting creative.",
      "Kevin Smith, the man behind cult classics like \"Clerks\" and \"Mallrats,\" bought a theater in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, in 2022. It was the cinema he'd gone to growing up. He renamed it Smodcastle Cinemas, and hoped that even as it reeled from COVID-19 shutdowns, he could rekindle the magic he'd loved as a child.",
      "\"I learned more about myself sitting in this (theater) than I ever did sitting in a classroom or sitting in church or something like that, and it led me to the rest of my life,\" Smith said.",
      "But the reality of operating the movie theater was difficult, even for a celebrity like Smith. They operate as a non-profit, Smith said, because if they functioned as a for-profit business, they \"would die.\" Smith can bring in celebrity guests for Q&A sessions and other events. The theater also hosts an annual film festival.",
      "\"Saving my childhood theater with my friends? Dream come true, worst financial investment I ever made in my life,\" Smith said.",
      "On the opposite coast, film store Vidiots has been bringing new movies to audiences for 40 years. When it opened in Santa Monica, Los Angeles, in 1985, it operated as a traditional video store with an extensive and rare collection of films. In 2023, Vidiots moved to Eagle Rock and expanded into an exhibition space, reviving the historic Eagle Theater.",
      "\"We opened to uncertainty,\" said executive director Maggie MacKay. \"We had no idea if people would come, and they did. And they've been coming ever since.\"",
      "MacKay said Vidiots has become a touchstone for local kids.",
      "\"One of the biggest surprises and the happiest surprises for us and the thing that I think I most wanted to happen here is that young people come here,\" she said. \"Teens, tweens are getting dropped off by their parents. And because this place is affordable and welcoming and nonjudgmental and safe, they are coming here all the time. We've got kids growing up here who call the video store their video store. We have a kid who calls it 'my video store.' That kid has no idea that that is a very unique thing to say in the 2020s.\"",
      "Like Smodcastle, Vidiots operates as a non-profit. That isn't the only path to success for these kinds of theaters, though, as New York City's Metrograph proves. The two-screen theater in Manhattan's Lower East Side shows international and arthouse fare and operates as a for-profit. Business is booming, CEO Christian Grass said, with the theater recently enjoying its best summer on record.",
      "\"People love going to the movies and people love the experience,\" Grass said. The theater also has a bookstore, a magazine, a streaming service, an extravagant concession stand and a swanky bar and restaurant. The establishment has focused on building a sense of community, said Metrograph director of programming Inge de Leeuw, which ensures people keep coming back. MacKay said she's also found people are looking for connection, community and a place they can go.",
      "\"Everybody wants movies in their lives, whether they know it or realize it or not,\" MacKay said. \"To save this thing, you have to make available every point of access for it. You have to make a return to a social experience.\"",
      "While independent theaters are taking different paths to success, they have one thing in common: They want to keep introducing new and classic films to audiences.",
      "\"You want to learn something about somebody, sit in the darkness and watch movies with them,\" Smith said. \"You will learn a lot about a person. You'll find out if they're empathetic. You'll find out what makes them laugh. You'll find out if there's a real human being there, if there's a heart underneath that all, man.\""

      "Americans are still cracking open cold ones, but what's inside their cans is changing.",
      "More people are now reaching for cannabis beverages, nonalcoholic drinks infused with tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the main ingredient in marijuana that makes you feel high. Some varieties also include cannabidiol, or CBD, a chemical compound found in marijuana or hemp that proponents say helps relieve pain, anxiety and other health symptoms. The drinks come in different forms including seltzers, juices, sodas and teas.",
      "Consumer demand for cannabis beverages is growing as Americans drink less booze. According to a July Gallup survey, the percentage of U.S. adults who say they consume alcohol fell to 54%, the lowest level since 1939, when the polling organization first started tracking people's drinking behavior. More Americans also believe even moderate alcohol consumption is unhealthy, the poll found.",
      "Hundreds of brands small and large now hawk cannabis beverages, many promising to help take the edge off in social settings.",
      "\"There's a replacement factor going on between THC beverages and wine and beer and distilled spirits,\" said Beau Whitney, chief economist at Whitney Economics, an Oregon-based consultancy focused on the cannabis and hemp industry.",
      "THC beverage sales in the U.S. are expected to grow from $1.1 billion last year to nearly $5.6 billion by 2035, according to Whitney Economics.",
      "\"The remarkable growth and innovation we're seeing in the hemp-derived beverage space is a clear sign of consumer enthusiasm and entrepreneurial success,\" Michelle Rutter Friberg, director of government relations at the National Cannabis Industry Association, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Potential health impacts, side effects",
      "Several THC beverage brands market themselves as nonalcoholic alternatives and say their drinks contain zero calories and zero sugar. Doctors, however, warn that cannabis beverages can come with side effects.",
      "Whether smoked or ingested as an edible or drink, cannabis can affect the brain, heart, lungs and mental health, CBS News medical contributor Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder said, adding that the drug can trigger anxiety, paranoia, elevated heart rate and, in rare cases, psychosis.",
      "Potential short-term effects of cannabis include issues with memory, focus and coordination, said Gounder.",
      "\"People may have trouble remembering new information, paying attention or moving smoothly,\" she said. \"This can slow reaction time, cause slurred speech, and raise the risk of car crashes by 30%-40%. The effects depend on how much cannabis is used, how it's taken and how used to it someone is.\"",
      "Heavy or long-term intake of the drug, especially in teens, can lead to lasting issues with memory, attention and decision-making, said Gounder. Long-term use, she added, can also lead to cannabis-use disorder, which is a clinical term for addiction,\u00a0defined\u00a0by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as when users are unable to stop using cannabis even though it's causing them health and social problems.",
      "Some heavy users may also develop severe nausea and vomiting, Gounder said. Those most at risk are pregnant individuals, teens, and people with mental or heart conditions, she added.",
      "The potential effects of a cannabis-infused drink can be felt in as little as 15 to 20 minutes, compared with 30 to 90 minutes for an edible, according to Dr. Staci Gruber, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, in a recent article on the school's website.",
      "\"If you are interested in trying it and it is legal for you to do so, be mindful about controlling the experience until you know how a particular product affects you,\" Gruber said.",
      "Target eyes THC segment",
      "The U.S. has a patchwork of regulations governing the sale of cannabis products, with states offering varying degrees of restrictions, including minimum-age requirements. THC beverages can be legally sold in 44 states in total, \u00a037 of which allow sales outside of the marijuana dispensary systems according to Whitney.",
      "In those areas, the beverages can commonly be found at restaurants, bars, grocery stores and liquor stores.",
      "In Atlanta, for example, Scofflaw Beverage Company \u2014 previously a brewery fighting for its financial life after the pandemic \u2014 revived its business by canning drinks without alcohol that contain 5 to 10 milligrams of hemp-derived THC, CBS News Atlanta reports. Cannabis products are legal in Georgia and can be shipped across the U.S.",
      "\"It's really been an almost seismic shift in customer preference,\" Scofflaw co-founder Matt Shirah told CBS News Atlanta. \"The THC infused business has the potential to be 10 to 20 times the size of beer business.\"",
      "Cannabis beverages have even caught the attention of major retailers like Target. The Minneapolis-based chain confirmed to CBS News that it is testing the sale of THC beverages at certain Target liquor stores in Minnesota. While other retailers, such as Total Wine & More, already sell cannabis beverages, Target is the first big-box player to explore the THC beverage market.",
      "\"At Target, we're always exploring new ways to meet our guests' evolving preferences and needs,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "Whitney Economics estimates there are 500 to 750 brands marketing cannabis drinks. Of those, roughly 30 are sizable labels with national distribution, while the rest are regional and local brands, according to Diana Eberlein, chair of the Coalition for Adult Beverage Alternatives Retailers, a group that represents stakeholders in the hemp and alcohol industries.",
      "Better-known names in the space include Cycling Frog, which makes THC seltzers and edibles; Cann, which markets itself as a \"social beverage\"; and Nowadays, which employs the motto \"the future of drinking is here.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Oct 2025 18:10:23 -0400",
    "summary": "A new lawsuit alleges Bank of America profited from its dealings with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "story": [
      "Bank of America was sued Wednesday over its alleged financial ties with Jeffrey Epstein, with the lawsuit claiming the financial giant facilitated and also benefited from his alleged sex trafficking venture.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in federal court on behalf of a Jane Doe, alleges Epstein committed his crimes \"through access to funding and financial support from both individuals and institutions, including Bank of America.\" Epstein died in 2019 in jail while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges.",
      "\"Egregiously, Bank of America had a plethora of information regarding Epstein's sex trafficking operation but chose profit over protecting the victims,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Bank of America said it has no immediate comment on the lawsuit.",
      "The lawsuit comes after Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland and the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, opened an investigation into four large banks, including Bank of America, over their business relationship with Epstein. The probe is seeking more information about roughly $1.5 billion in financial transactions handled by the banks on behalf of Epstein.",
      "Suspicious activity?",
      "Jane Doe was living in Russia when she met Epstein in 2011, and was sexually abused and trafficked by him until 2019, the lawsuit alleges. It claims Epstein relied on force, threats, fraud and coercion to control her.",
      "In 2013, Epstein's accountant instructed her to open a Bank of America account, where money could be wired, purportedly to generate records for U.S. immigration authorities and to cover her rent, according to the lawsuit. The banking transactions should have raised red flags with the bank, the complaint alleges.",
      "\"A review of Jane Doe's account history will show incredibly alarming and erratic banking behavior, as Epstein, through one of his loyal employees, would utilize Jane Doe's account, often without her knowledge, to conduct business in amounts that were not typical for Jane Doe, and that would have in fact been impossible based on Jane Doe's income or typical pattern of deposit,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Banks are required by law to report suspicious activity in customer accounts to federal authorities in order to flag potential criminal activity, such as money laundering or fraud. The complaint alleges that Bank of America failed to file suspicious activity reports, known as SARs, until after Epstein's death in 2019.",
      "According to the New York Times, Bank of America\u00a0filed two SARs in 2020 related to $170 million in payments made to Epstein by billionaire investor Leon Black. The timing of the SARs was questioned by Raskin in an October 2025 letter to Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan.",
      "\"These SARs not only were untimely \u2014 filed years after the transactions in question \u2014 but Bank of America processed the payments without asking for information as to the nature of the transactions,\" Raskin wrote. \"Financial institutions are often the first line of defense in detecting serious federal crimes, especially the ones that involve significant flows of money like sex trafficking.\"",
      "He added, \"Flagging and detecting Mr. Epstein's suspicious withdrawals may well have stopped his crimes years earlier.\"",
      "The Oct. 15 lawsuit claims that \"Bank of America's failure to timely file SARs about Epstein's sex-trafficking venture, in spite of numerous red flags, was wrongful and purposeful.\"",
      "The complaint also alleges that Epstein would not have been able to expand his illegal operations \"without complicit financial banking institutions that would ignore red flags and assist him in his sex-trafficking scheme.\"",
      "JPMorgan's settlement",
      "In exchange for looking the other way, the suit alleges, Bank of America profited by earning \"interest, commissions, service fees, and other financial benefits directly from its connection with Epstein, Epstein-related entities, and others acting in concert with Epstein.\"",
      "In 2023, JPMorgan Chase reached a\u00a0$290 million settlement with Epstein's victims over allegations the bank overlooked his crimes because of the profits it earned from him. At the time of the settlement, JPMorgan said it regretted its association with Epstein and that it \"would never have continued to do business with him if we believed he was using our bank in any way to help commit heinous crimes.\"",
      "The lawsuit against Bank of America is seeking class-action status on behalf of other women abused by Epstein. The attorney representing Jane Doe is David Boies of law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, who represented Epstein's victims in the settlement with JPMorgan."

      "\"The entire fourth quarter, the fall break, Thanksgiving, Christmas, they're all likely to set records with strong demand,\" Kirby told CBS News last month. \"At the beginning of July, it was like a light switch got flipped on and demand started to come back.\"",

    "story": [
      "America's population of seniors is expected to surge by 40% over the next 25 years \u2014 a shift that could spark a crisis of aging, as most people remain unprepared for longer lives, according to new research from the MIT AgeLab and insurance company John Hancock.",
      "Americans are lagging in readiness to handle the demands of greater longevity, ranging from managing the cost of a longer retirement to maintaining their health in old age, according to the inaugural Longevity Preparedness Index, or LPI, from the MIT AgeLab, a research institute focusing on improving the quality of life for older people, and John Hancock.",
      "The problem goes well beyond saving for retirement \u2014 another area where Americans are known to fall short \u2014 and touches nearly every aspect of aging, from building community in later life to preparing for care when people can no longer look after themselves. Some people may fail to plan simply because they underestimate their own longevity, with\u00a0earlier research by Stanford University retirement expert Annamaria Lusardi finding that Americans generally believe they'll die younger than statistics predict.",
      "\"Believe it or not, longevity is quite new \u2014 we've always had older people, but never this many older people living this long,\" Joe Coughlin, founder and director of the MIT AgeLab, told CBS News. \"We can't look to our parents, saying 'This is how they did it.'\"",
      "Preparing for a long old age isn't all about money, although that remains an important part of retirement readiness, said Brooks Tingle, CEO of John Hancock, told CBS. While Americans are living longer, they're spending more years in poorer health, which raises additional issues around preparing for longer retirements than prior generations, he noted.",
      "A 65-year-old woman has a 40% chance of living to age 90, while men the same age have a 30% chance of reaching that age, according to Lusardi's research.",
      "The study analyzed eight aspects of longevity preparedness:",
      "Social connection: Relationships with family, friends and community.Finance: Having enough saved for retirement and old age.\u00a0Daily activities: Keeping busy with meaningful daily activities.\u00a0Care: Identifying who will care for you if you need assistance, understanding the costs of care and having advance directives in place.\u00a0Home: Modifying your home to prolong independence in old age.\u00a0Community: Access to health care, stores, recreation and transportation.\u00a0Health: Developing positive physical, mental, and cognitive behavioral habits to maintain health as you age.Life transitions: Preparing for major changes like retirement, the death of a loved one and more.",
      "Social connection: Relationships with family, friends and community.",
      "Finance: Having enough saved for retirement and old age.",
      "Daily activities: Keeping busy with meaningful daily activities.",
      "Care: Identifying who will care for you if you need assistance, understanding the costs of care and having advance directives in place.",
      "Home: Modifying your home to prolong independence in old age.",
      "Community: Access to health care, stores, recreation and transportation.",
      "Health: Developing positive physical, mental, and cognitive behavioral habits to maintain health as you age.",
      "Life transitions: Preparing for major changes like retirement, the death of a loved one and more.",
      "U.S. adults scored an average of 60 out of 100 across the eight areas, which MIT and John Hancock said signifies that Americans' general longevity preparedness is low.",
      "\"Preparedness is, yes, about saving money, but really it's practically being aware of other things you'll have to do, like 'What should I do, who am I going to live with,'\" Coughlin said. \"Your Zip code is probably your bigger predictor of quality of life, not your 401(k).\"",
      "Care emerged as Americans' weakest area of preparedness, with an average score of 42 out of 100 on the LPI. The strongest domain was community, where people scored 70, suggesting greater readiness for maintaining access to stores, health care and recreation as they age.",
      "The price of long-term care, such as assisted living facilities, can easily cost $6,000 per month or more, placing it out of reach for many Americans. But smaller, less costly steps can also make a difference, such as identifying friends or family members who could step in to help if you ever need extra support, Tingle noted.",
      "\"It's not just, 'Will I need intensive care?' but 'Who is going to change the lightbulb for me when I'm 91?,'\" Tingle said. \"A big takeaway is just to start these conversations.\"",
      "He added, \"Most families don't ever talk about these things.\"",
      "To be sure, saving for retirement can ease many of these issues, ranging from having the resources to pay for long-term care to modifying your home with grab bars and other additions that can prolong independent living. On average, Americans scored a 64 for financial preparedness, but the study found a large gap between those with few assets and people with wealth.",
      "Those with less than $50,000 in investible assets had an overall longevity preparedness score of 56, while those with more than $3 million in assets scored 65, the survey found. People with financial advisers scored a 65, while those without ranked 7 points lower, it noted.",
      "\"Those who had financial advisers had better scores \u2014 of course they did better. The better financial advisers don't just advise you on your wealth, they help you anticipate what will come tomorrow,\" Coughlin noted. \"You have someone who is asking you to think about what those future plans are.\"",
      "He added, \"Most of us are hacking longevity, and we figure it out day after day.\" But he said he hopes the LPI will \"change the cultural narrative\" about aging by shifting the conversation beyond money to include how people can plan how to live and find purpose in their later years."

The \"violent, forced labor camps\" consisted of vast dormitories surrounded by high walls and barbed wire, according to the Justice Department.",

    "story": [
      "The shortage of air traffic controllers at some airports during the U.S. government shutdown may have travelers wondering if they have anything to worry about as they board their flight.",
      "Flight delays\u00a0in some parts of the U.S. have ticked up since federal funding lapsed on Oct. 1, even as controllers, Transportation Security Administration officers and other air safety personnel are required to work without pay. Previous shutdowns have resulted in a spike in TSA officers and air traffic controllers calling out sick from work, contributing to delays and flight cancellations.",
      "Despite such inconveniences, aviation experts are confident that air travel remains safe. \"There is no slacking. FAA safety standards don't go on hiatus just because the government is shut down,\" Henry Harteveldt, founder and president of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel advisory firm, told CBS News.",
      "Flight delays due FAA staffing issues are rising because the agency is taking steps to ensure air travel remains as safe as before the shutdown, said Katy Nastro, an air travel expert at trip booking site Going.com.",
      "\"People should feel comfort that traffic is slowing, and ground delays are being put into place as an extra layer of safety, as a precautionary measure,\" she said. \"It shouldn't raise a red flag in any way.\"",
      "The bigger question for travelers, Nastro added, is \"What is your tolerance in terms of facing delays and such?\"",
      "Despite several aircraft collisions and some close calls this year, research shows that airline travel has become safer in recent years. The risk of a fatality from commercial air travel was 1 in every 13.7 million passenger boardings globally from 2018 to 2022, according to a 2024 MIT\u00a0study. That compares with 1 fatality for every in 7.9 million worldwide boardings from 2008 to 2017.",
      "\"We slow it down\"",

      "He also alluded to the air traffic control staffing issues and highlighted the wider impact of just a few people not showing up for work. \"If you have a few controllers that call in sick, it will ricochet through the airspace, and we have delays because we are not overstaffed,\" he said, adding that controllers are \"incredibly frustrated\" by the shutdown.",
      "Sheldon Jacobson, an aviation security expert and professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said flight delays stemming from controller shortages are inconvenient, but do not point to a safety risk for travelers.",
      "\"I don't think safety is being compromised, but service is definitely being compromised,\" Jacobson told CBS News.",
      "Still, Laura Einsetler, a captain for a U.S. airline, worries that a prolonged government shutdown could eventually affect the performance of air traffic controllers as they work without pay.",
      "\"How long can they go until they are distracted with stress about how they're going to pay for rent, their mortgage or put food on table for their families?\" she told CBS News. \"The more they don't get paid, the more distractions there are, and that raises the safety threat from a performance point of view.\"",
      "Trusting pilots",
      "Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, said some anxiety around hopping on a plane during the government shutdown is understandable. \"A lot of us have an innate fear of being 30,000 feet above the ground, so any justification we can find for why flying might be more risky now is understandable,\" he said.",
      "But he emphasized that pilots have final say on whether it is unsafe to fly for whatever reason, including poor weather, mechanical problems or staffing shortages.",
      "\"They are entrusted to give that last line of authority and say things are safe to fly, and they are in constant communication with air traffic control, monitoring weather systems, and what the entire flying environment looks like,\" Keyes said.",
      "\"The risk of delays and cancellations is higher today than it was before, but I don't think that translates into a higher risk of safety accidents,\" he added.",
      "Harteveldt agreed that airline pilots \u2014 who aren't federal employees \u2014 wouldn't take off given any safety concerns.",
      "\"When a plane departs the gate, it's the airline pilot inspecting the plane and saying, 'Yes, this plane is clear to go.' FAA inspectors, or the shutdown, have nothing to do with that,\" he said.",
      "Airlines for America, a lobbying group representing major airlines, last week sought to reassure the public that flying during the shutdown is safe, while acknowledging that control tower staffing shortages could lead to delays.",
      "\"It is safe to fly, but ATC staffing shortages strain the system and cause flights to be spaced out, slowing down everything. In some cases, flights may be delayed or even cancelled,\" the group said in a statement. \"The bottom line is that anyone heading to the airport right now is encouraged to pack their patience.\""

      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News."

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/government-shutdown-mortgage-loans-flood-insurance/",
    "published": "Wed, 15 Oct 2025 09:01:49 -0400",
    "summary": "Some people taking out a home loan and purchasing flood insurance could face delays during the U.S. government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Americans worried that the U.S. government shutdown could derail their plans to take out a mortgage or refinance their home loan can breathe easy \u2014 mostly. Housing experts says lenders will continue processing mortgages as usual even if federal agencies close shop, while noting that a shutdown could lead to hitches for borrowers applying for government-backed loans.",
      "\"If you're expecting to close in a week or a month, there could be some slight delay,\" said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. \"But I think for most people, it's probably going to be a blip more than a real deal killer.\"",
      "The bulk of the mortgage market consists of loans originated by private lenders. But some government agencies have a hand in the process, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insuring private loans or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) managing flood insurance policies.",
      "Impact on government-backed loans",
      "Borrowers applying for a conventional mortgage issued by a bank, credit union or other private lender are unlikely to encounter problems if the government closes shop. However, those applying for government-backed loans from agencies like the FHA, Department of Veteran Affairs an Department of Agriculture (USDA) could face minor delays lining up their mortgages, Holden Lewis, a senior writer at NerdWallet, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) notes in an online\u00a0explainer\u00a0that the FHA will continue to approve most single-family mortgage loans in the event of a shutdown. The VA will also continue to guarantee home loans, but worker furloughs at the agency could lead to processing delays, the group said.",
      "\"It creates a little bit of extra stress and uncertainty, but I haven't seen a shutdown in either of those programs\" when politics led the government to shut it doors in the past, Ostrowski said.",
      "The VA and FHA account for up to a quarter of all mortgage applications, according to\u00a0Redfin. NAR\u00a0advises\u00a0U.S. veterans applying for or refinancing a government-backed loan to check with their lender on how long it will take to complete the process if the government shuts down.",
      "Another segment of the housing market that could feel the impact of the shutdown are people applying for mortgages through the USDA, which issues loans to buyers in eligible towns and rural areas. NAR\u00a0said the USDA will halt issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans during a shutdown. Pre-scheduled direct\u2011loan closings will also be postponed.",
      "The USDA did not respond to a request for comment. The VA referred CBS News to its shutdown contingency plan, which says the agency will continue issuing \"housing benefits.\"",
      "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities that support roughly 70% of the mortgage market, don't rely on federal funding and have continued to operate during past shutdowns. However, they could face bottlenecks if federal agencies close down this week, said Anthony Smith, an applied economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"They rely on other federal processes like the IRS for tax transcript verifications,\" he said. \"So if the IRS shuts down or significantly cuts back on its transcript services, then Fannie and Freddie might be able to approve a loan, but they can't get the final verification piece.\"",
      "Possible flood insurance delays",
      "People purchasing a house in a flood zone could also face delays during a government shutdown, experts told CBS News. That's because homebuyers applying for a federally backed mortgage in high-risk flood areas are required to get flood insurance. A shutdown could hamper the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program, which underwrites more than 4 million flood insurance policies in the U.S.",
      "\"The government shutdown could complicate your closing because it might be harder to just secure flood insurance,\" Ostrowski told CBS News.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "According to the White House, the flood insurance program cannot sell new or renewal insurance policies during a government shutdown.\"A potential lapse of the NFIP authorization would negatively impact many thousands of Americans who would be left unable to renew/transfer their coverage or to buy the required coverage for their homes,\" a White House official said in an email."

While the president did not offer additional details, the White House Office of Management and Budget told the Associated Press it would use Pentagon research and development funds to pay troops \"in the event the funding lapse continues past October 15th.\"",
      "Still, for some service member families, even the possibility of missing a single paycheck is fueling concerns about money.",
      "\"We were already living paycheck to paycheck, so this doesn't help at all,\" Pyle told CBS News. \"We have to pick and choose which bills to pay now.\"",
      "The family's income comes to around $1,200 a week, Pyle said. Between the cost of rent, utilities, her 10-year-old daughter's braces and therapy for her 5-year-old autistic son, paring the family's budget is difficult, she noted. Even her own dental care is on hold for now.",
      "\"It shouldn't take everything out of us just to survive,\" Pyle said. \"We sacrifice so much \u2014 and having to deal with being a special needs parent alone \u2014 it's all piling up, and this was one more thing that didn't need to happen.\"",
      "The White House referred a request for comment to the Office of Management and Budget. The agency did not respond to CBS News' inquiry.",
      "\"Extremely stressful\"",
      "One in 6 active-duty military families was already experiencing food insecurity before the shutdown, according to a 2023\u00a0survey\u00a0from Blue Star Families. The advocacy group also\u00a0found\u00a0that roughly a third of service member households have less than $3,000 in savings, leaving them vulnerable to financial emergencies.",
      "As a result, missing a paycheck can have \"a devastating impact,\" said Kathy Roth-Douquet, CEO of Blue Star Families.",
      "\"There is a financial impact first and foremost, but there is a big psychological impact, too, that is in some ways equally damaging,\" she added.",
      "Roth-Douquet noted that many military families depend on a single income because frequent relocations make it difficult for spouses to find steady work. \"That means families depend on one paycheck, and if they don't get it, it can tip them into disaster,\" she said.",
      "Misty Gilbert, whose husband is a member of the U.S. Coast Guard, earns a second income as a sixth-grade special education teacher in San Diego. Her salary isn't substantial enough to support her family even for a short period of time, she told CBS News.",
      "\"My check alone would barely cover the rent,\" she said.",
      "She added that the uncertainty caused by the government shutdown has been \"extremely stressful\" for her family.",
      "\"The holidays are coming up \u2014 a lot of times we like to travel to see family. I don't know if that would be an option if this continues, if we can justify those types of expenses of seeing family and holiday expenses in general,\" she said."

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's new tariffs on imported furniture, kitchen cabinets and other housewares, along with lumber, took effect Tuesday, added costs that economists say could push up prices for consumers.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the trade measures on Sept. 29, saying the levies are intended to prevent such products manufactured abroad from \"flooding\" the U.S.",
      "\"It is a very unfair practice, but we must protect, for National Security and other reasons, our Manufacturing process,\" Mr. Trump\u00a0wrote\u00a0on social media at the time.",
      "The levies on imported wood products and furniture range from 10% to 50%.",
      "Although Trump administration officials maintain that tariffs are largely paid by overseas exporters, most economists say Americans bear the brunt of the additional costs.",
      "If recently imposed and future tariffs have the same impact on domestic prices as the U.S. levies applied earlier this year, then consumers would eventually absorb about 55% of the added costs, Goldman Sachs estimated in an analysis this week. U.S. businesses would swallow 22% of the extra costs, while foreign exporters would absorb 18% of the expenses, economists with the investment bank said.",
      "President Trump has said higher import duties will restore fairness in global trade, energize American manufacturing and raise federal revenue. White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS News on Tuesday that stiffer U.S. tariffs are already benefiting the economy by spurring companies to expand in the U.S.",
      "\"The president and administration's position has always been clear: While Americans may face a transition period from tariffs upending a broken status quo that has put America last, the cost of tariffs will ultimately be borne by foreign exporters,\" Desai said in a statement. \"Companies are already shifting and diversifying their supply chains in response to tariffs, including by onshoring production to the United States.\"",
      "The Trump administration's tariffs have so far proved less disruptive than expected, the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday, though the full impact of those policies may not be felt for some time.

    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday emphasized that a sharp slowdown in hiring poses a growing risk to the U.S. economy, a sign that the central bank will likely cut its key interest rate twice more this year.",
      "Powell, who spoke today before the National Association of Business Economics in Philadelphia, said that despite the federal government shutdown cutting off official economic data, \"the outlook for employment and inflation does not appear to have changed much since our September meeting,\" when the Fed reduced its key rate for the first time this year.",
      "Fed officials at the September meeting also forecast that the central bank would reduce its rate twice more this year and once in 2026. Lower rates from the Fed could\u00a0reduce borrowing costs for consumer and business loans, making it cheaper for businesses to expand operations and hire new workers, and for Americans to buy houses, autos and other items.",
      "\"Holding rates higher presents risks to the job market. Job creation is below trend given the pace of economic growth,\" noted Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at investment firm Global X, in an emailed response to Powell's comments. \"The Fed is still likely to cut rates in October and December, but investors should be prepared for a range of outcomes as Powell is trying to leave all options open.\"",
      "The Fed's next rate decision will be made at its Oct. 29 meeting. Following that, the central bank has one more rate decision meeting scheduled in 2025, set for Dec. 10.",
      "Powell reiterated a message he first delivered after the September meeting, when he signaled that the Fed is slightly more worried about the job market than its other congressional mandate, which is to keep prices stable. Tariffs have lifted the Fed's preferred measure of inflation to 2.9%, he said, but outside the duties there aren't \"broader inflationary pressures\" that will keep prices high.",
      "\"Rising downside risks to employment have shifted our assessment of the balance of risks,\" he said.",
      "Powell also said that the central bank may soon stop shrinking its roughly $6.6 trillion balance sheet. The Fed has been allowing roughly $40 billion of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to mature each month without replacing them. The shift could weigh on longer-term Treasury interest rates.",
      "Separately, Powell spent most of his speech defending the Fed's practice of buying longer-term Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities in 2020 and 2021, which were intended to lower longer-term interest rates and support the economy during the pandemic.",
      "Yet those purchases have come under a torrent of criticism from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, as well as some of the\u00a0candidates\u00a0floated by the Trump administration to replace Powell when his term as Chair ends next May.",
      "Bessent said in an extended critique\u00a0published earlier this year\u00a0that the huge purchases of bonds during the pandemic worsened inequality by boosting the stock market, without providing noticeable benefits to the economy.",
      "Other critics have long argued that the Fed kept implementing the purchases for too long, keeping interest rates low even as inflation began to spike in late 2021. The Fed beginning in 2021 stopped the purchases and then sharply boosted borrowing costs to combat inflation.",
      "\"With the clarity of hindsight, we could have\u2014and perhaps should have\u2014stopped asset purchases sooner,\" Powell said. \"Our real-time decisions were intended to serve as insurance against downside risk.\"",
      "Powell also said the purchases were intended to avoid a breakdown in the market for Treasury securities, which could have sent interest rates much higher."

      "The Trader Joe's product accused of being an Uncrustables knockoff is described on packaging as \"crustless peanut butter & strawberry jam sandwiches.\" The round pocket-sized sandwiches come in a bright blue box with a stack of the sandwiches depicted on the front, with a small bite taken out of the top sandwich, revealing the filling.",
      "Smucker's alleges that Trader Joe's packaging closely mimics that of the Uncrustables, by prominently featuring the same color blue Smucker's uses in its own branding. On Smucker's packaging, the word \"Uncrustables\" appears in a blue font, the lawsuit notes.",
      "Smucker's alleges Trader Joe's decision to use a similar design will deceive and cause confusion among customers. It will also claims that \"irreparable injury\" will be caused to the Smucker's brand unless the court takes action to limit Trader Joe's \"wrongful acts\" according to the lawsuit.",
      "Smucker's has requested in its complaint that Trader Joe's stop using branding its says imitates that of the \"Uncrustables Design Marks.\" It calls on Trader Joe's to deliver the affected products \u2014 including containers, labels, packaging and more \u2014 for destruction. It also asks the grocery chain to pay Smucker's \"gains, profits, and advantages Defendant has obtained\" as a result of the alleged trademark infringement, as well as legal fees."

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/government-shutdown-2025-travel-tsa-faa/",
    "published": "Tue, 14 Oct 2025 10:56:26 -0400",
    "summary": "A prolonged government shutdown, as occurred in 2018, could lead to long lines at TSA checkpoints and economic losses, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",
      "Passport services are also deemed essential and would be expected to operate during a government shutdown."

    "summary": "Leaf-peeping season has arrived in the Northeast and beyond, but weeks of drought have dulled this year's autumn colors and sent leaves fluttering to the ground earlier than usual.",
    "story": [
      "Portland, Maine \u2014 Leaf-peeping season has arrived in the Northeast and beyond, but weeks of drought have dulled this year's autumn colors and sent leaves fluttering to the ground earlier than usual.",
      "Soaking in the fall foliage is an annual tradition in the New England states as well as areas such as the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina and Upper Peninsula of Michigan. As the days shorten and temperatures drop, chlorophyll in leaves breaks down, and they turn to the autumn tones of yellow, orange and red.",
      "But dry weather in summer and fall can change all that because the lack of water causes leaves to brown and fall more quickly. And that's happening this year, as more than 40% of the country was considered to be in a drought in early October, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.",
      "That's more than twice the average, said Brad Rippey, a U.S. Department of Agriculture meteorologist and an author of the drought monitor, which is a partnership between the federal government and University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Drought has hit the Northeast and western U.S. especially hard, he said.",
      "It all adds up to fewer leaves to peep.",
      "\"I think it might be a little bit of a short and less colorful season, for the most part,\" Rippey said. \"The color is just not going to be there this year for some hillsides.\"",
      "Despite the gloomy forecast, autumn enthusiasts said it's still a great year to get out and enjoy nature's fireworks display. There is still a lot of color in New England's trees, said Andy Finton, senior conservation ecologist with The Nature Conservancy in Massachusetts.",
      "Climate change is stressing forests with severe weather and heat waves, but autumn in New England remains a beautiful time of year to experience the wonderment of forest ecosystems firsthand, he said.",
      "\"Our trees and our forests have an inherent resilience,\" Finton said. \"They are still very resilient, and I am constantly surprised at how wonderful the fall season is despite these stresses.\"",
      "Leaf-peepers undeterred for most part",
      "The tourism business built around leaf peeping has also proven resilient. At the Mills Falls Resort Collection at the Lake in Meredith, New Hampshire, general manager Barbara Beckwith said business is good at the four inns that have 170 rooms. The number of Canadian tourists is down, Beckwith acknowledged, but she said that's been made up with domestic leaf peepers, mostly from New England.",
      "Beckwith said her properties were booked solid on weekends through mid-October and had been for weeks.",
      "\"This year is actually going to be better than last year,\" Beckwith said. \"Last year was an election and that put a lot of trepidation in people. Now, they are traveling. The uncertainty of the election is over. We all know whose president now and we are traveling.\"",
      "Chris Proulx, executive director of the Mount Washington (New Hampshire) Valley Chamber of Commerce, said the decline in Canadian tourists by as much as 80% seen this summer has continued into the fall. But the region is faring better, he said, thanks to an uptick in travelers from other countries and its reputation for having one of the country's best leaf peeping seasons.",
      "\"This is the one season where people make plans in advance to come in addition to travelers from all of the country and all over the world,\" Proulx said.",
      "Leaf peeping was so popular in Colorado's Rocky Mountains this year that one town temporarily closed its highway offramp to alleviate gridlock. The area put on a display of yellow aspen trees dotting the mountains between evergreens, their delicate leaves vibrating in the wind.",
      "But there were signs of a dry spring in the central part of the state, one that is more severe the farther west you travel, said Colorado State Forest Service entomologist Dan West, who spends many fall days in a plane looking at how insect infestations are affecting tree health.",
      "Crispy edges, muted colors, and dropping leaves before they can take on a red or purple hue are all signs of drought stress, West said.",
      "\"The tree is shutting down processes early and we basically just see this muted kind of a show for the fall,\" he said.",
      "In Denver, arborist Michael Sundberg also said he's seeing less vibrant color than usual, and autumn feels like it arrived earlier than usual this year. It's still a beautiful time of year, but there might be less of it to enjoy, he said.",
      "\"It's weird to have color peaking this early in the mountains and then for Denver to be peaking at the same time,\" he said. \"Usually we're later in October before we really go off.\""

      "Amazon's hiring spree comes as the overall number of seasonal jobs this year is expected to fall to its lowest level since 2009, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

    "story": [
      "The U.S. economy could be on the upswing even if tariffs and stubborn inflation continue to weigh on growth, according to a new analysis.",
      "The National Association for Business Economics (NABE) said Monday it expects the nation's gross domestic product \u2014 a measure of the total value of goods and services \u2014 to rise 1.8% in 2025, up from the group's previous estimate in June of 1.3%.",

NABE also expects the economy to expand at a faster pace in 2026, at 1.7%, higher than its June forecast of 1.4%.",
      "The report is the latest signal that economic growth continues to hold up despite rising inflation and a recent slowdown in the labor market. After\u00a0economic activity shrank in the first three months of 2025, growth has accelerated over the rest of the year, EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco, vice president of NABE, told CBS News. The outlook for business investment in particular has improved, he noted.",
      "The economy could get a further boost this year from the Federal Reserve. NABE expects Fed officials, who trimmed their benchmark rate in September for the first time since 2024, to lower borrowing costs by another quarter of a percentage point by year-end and by a total of three-quarters of percentage point in 2026.",
      "Pain points remain",
      "While the economy has performed better than many experts predicted earlier this year, there are still signs of weakness. Government data indicates that job growth has deteriorated since the first half of the year.",
      "As hiring cools, meanwhile, the percentage of long-term job seekers \u2014 people unemployed for 27 weeks or longer \u2014 has risen to 26% of the total unemployed population, the highest in more than three years, labor data shows.",
      "Layoffs are also climbing. Through September, employers this year have cut nearly 950,000 jobs, the largest number of layoffs since 2020, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Looking ahead, NABE expects the job market to remain fragile. Economists predict average monthly payroll gains of 60,000 for the rest the year, down from the 87,000 the group forecasted in June. From January to August, employers added an average of around 75,000 jobs per month, according to government data.",
      "NABE projects that the nation's unemployment rate,\u00a04.3 % as of August, will rise to 4.5% in 2026.",
      "Another lingering pain point for the economy is inflation, which remains above the Fed's 2% annual target. NABE expects inflation as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditure index \u2014 the Fed's preferred measure of inflation \u2014 to rise at an annualized rate of 3% over the rest of 2025.",
      "Nearly all of those surveyed \u2014 95% \u2014 expect U.S. tariffs to drive up consumer prices over the rest of the year, according to NABE, although the group now expects stepped-up duties on imports to have less of an inflationary impact than it previously predicted. As a result, inflation is projected to cool to 2.5% by the end of 2026, according to the panel of economists.",
      "A recession is unlikely, according to NABE. Most of the economists polled by the group put the odds of a slump in the next 12 months at between 20% and less than 40%."

    "summary": "DealBook founder and Squawk Box co-host Andrew Ross Sorkin takes a look at the crash of 1929 in his new book. He tells 60 Minutes what may it may indicate about today's stock market.",
    "story": [
      "After nearly a decade spent studying the most famous stock market crash in history, financial journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin warns that the Wall Street of today echoes the market of 1929, when highs preceded a massive slump, leading to the Great Depression.",
      "Artificial intelligence and technology have contributed to a remarkable boom in recent years. But, Sorkin said, today's economy is being propped up by the AI boom, and it's too soon to tell if this is a sugar rush, a short-term and unsustainable boost to the markets. But, Sorkin is positive there's a crash coming.",
      "\"I just can't tell you when, and I can't tell you how deep,\" he said. \"But I can assure you, unfortunately, I wish I wasn't saying this, we will have a crash.\"",
      "The Roaring '20s",
      "Despite a tumble this Friday, stocks on Wall Street have shot up in recent months. Still, some investors are getting weak in the knees, fearing stocks are overheated. Sorkin, author of \"1929: Inside the Greatest Crash in Wall Street History \u2013 and How It Shattered a Nation,\" out Oct. 14, says the U.S. is in a new roaring 20s, the 2020s, with stocks pushing to record highs, just as they were in the 1920s.",
      "Market highs today have him feeling anxious.",
      "\"I'm anxious that we are at prices that may not feel sustainable. And what I don't know is we are either living through some kind of remarkable boom and part of that's artificial intelligence and technology, and all of that, or everything's overpriced,\" he said.",
      "The market of 1929 was fueled by rampant speculation, including by ordinary investors unaware of the mounting risks, and of heavy borrowing. People of modest means were lured by Wall Street bankers and other stock market touts to invest using what was then a newfangled concept: credit. It was called buying on a margin. You only had to put down 10% of the stock price, borrowing the rest from your banker.",
      "Before 1919, most people did not take on credit or debt, influenced by religious views and moral norms against borrowing money, Sorkin said. That changed when General Motors, in 1919, started lending people money so they could afford to buy the company's cars. It changed out Americans shopped.",
      "\"And then the bankers realize what's happening, and they realize that they can lend out money so that more folks can buy stocks. It was all sort of wrapped in the flag of democratizing access,\" Sorkin said. \"And in good times, when the stock is going up, it's like free money. In bad times, you're on the hook, and you're on the hook in a very bad way.\"",
      "Today, it's hundreds of billions being invested in AI, with some investment pros warning of a possible bubble as stocks soar to stratospheric heights even amid significant economic uncertainty, such as Friday's slide after President Trump\u00a0 threatened more China tariffs.",
      "\"I think it's hard to say we're not in a bubble of some sort,\" Sorkin said. \"The question is always when is the bubble going to pop?\"",
      "Protecting consumers in the market",
      "When things got out of control in 1929, frightened traders dumped stocks as investors lost their businesses and homes. In the years since, laws, regulations and agencies have been put in place to protect investors.",
      "Some of those barriers to prevent exploitation are now coming down, Sorkin said. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules have become less stringent and \"the Consumer Protection Bureau practically doesn't exist anymore.\"",
      "\"That's what concerns me,\" Sorkin said. \"It's not that we're going off a cliff tomorrow. It's that there's speculation in the market today, there's an increasing amount of debt in the market today, and all of that's happening against the backdrop of the guardrails coming off.\"",
      "Those guardrails include ones that allow only the wealthy to invest directly in private companies that have fewer regulations, like AI startups before they go public.",
      "In recent decades, people who could invest in private equity and venture capital outperformed investors who did not. Those kinds of assets, generally restricted to wealthy investors, are potentially more rewarding, but also riskier.",
      "\"Public companies, after the SEC was created, were required to have all sorts of disclosure rules so that the public could understand what's going on inside them. Private companies don't have that,\" Sorkin said. \"But historically, the average ordinary American wasn't really allowed to invest in the private companies. But in this flag of democratizing finance, there's a lot of people who want access to that.\"",
      "Some people feel elite investors have better access, while others are unable to get in early on opportunities, Sorkin said. There's been a push by both the Trump administration and the financial sector to open up the market to more people.",
      "But that would also require moving the guardrails designed to protect people.",
      "\"They have protected a lot of people, but some people would say they protected people from getting rich,\" Sorkin said.",
      "Push today for democratizing investing",
      "In his latest annual letter to investors, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink suggested opening retirement 401(k)s to riskier private investments in the name of democratizing investing. He said there were opportunities for investing in AI or data centers.",
      "Right now money managers are precluded from investing in those types of assets in many retirement products, but the Trump administration is in the process of changing that, Fink explained.",
      "The new investment opportunity comes with risk.",
      "\"But everything is risky other than keeping your money in a bank account overnight,\" Fink said.",
      "Fink, who once called bitcoin the domain of money launderers and thieves, also wants to add crypto to investment portfolios.",
      "\"The markets teach you, you have to always relook at your assumptions,\" he said. \"There is a role for crypto in the same way there is a role for gold \u2014 that is, it's an alternative.\"",
      "He sees it, as he does AI, as an opportunity to add diversity to a portfolio.",
      "But Sorkin says some crypto products, like meme coins, can be abused in ways similar to 1929, with speculators sending the value of cryptocurrencies soaring before they come crashing down. Sorkin has his own personal example involving a television appearance with Fink.",
      "\"He makes a joke, I think, about how there should be a Sorkin coin. Well, two hours later, somebody makes a Sorkin coin. And all of a sudden, this Sorkin coin is now worth millions of dollars. And I'm watching it,\" Sorkin said.",
      "The Sorkin coin peaked at $170 million worth of trading in a day.",
      "\"And I think today it does something like $20 or $21 a day,\" Sorkin said."

    "summary": "President Trump said Friday he will impose an additional 100% tariff on imports from China starting next month \u2014 marking a significant escalation in the U.S.-China trade war.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Friday he will impose an additional 100% tariff on imports from China starting next month, citing new Chinese export controls \u2014 marking a significant escalation in the U.S.-China trade war.",
      "The new 100% tariffs will add on to any existing import taxes on Chinese goods, the president wrote in a Truth Social post. Tariffs on Chinese imports currently stand at 30%. Mr. Trump said the U.S. will also impose export controls on \"any and all critical software\" starting next month.",
      "The tariffs could be imposed on Nov. 1 or sooner, \"depending on any further actions or changes taken by China,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "On Sunday, China signaled that it would not back down in the face of the tariff threat and urged the U.S. to resolve differences through negotiations instead of threats.",
      "\"China's stance is consistent,\" the Commerce Ministry said in a statement posted online Sunday. \"We do not want a tariff war but we are not afraid of one.\"",
      "It was China's first official comment on Mr. Trump's threat to jack up the tax on imports from China by Nov. 1 in response to new Chinese restrictions on the export of rare earths, which are vital to a wide range of consumer and military products.",
      "The president's announcement came hours after he threatened steeper duties on China. He pointed to new Chinese rules that require companies to get special approval to export products containing even trace amounts of rare earths from China, even if they were manufactured outside of the country. China mines and processes most of the world's rare earth metals, which are\u00a0critical minerals used to manufacture products including semiconductors, electric car batteries, jet engines and defense weapons.",
      "\"It is impossible to believe that China would have taken such an action, but they have, and the rest is History,\" the president wrote in his Friday message announcing the tariffs, calling China's export controls \"extraordinarily aggressive\" and a \"moral disgrace.\"",
      "Separately on Friday, China\u00a0imposed port fees on U.S.-owned ships that dock in the country, retaliating against what Beijing called a \"discriminatory\" U.S. port fee on Chinese ships.",
      "Major stock indexes fell sharply on Friday after Mr. Trump's initial tariff threat. The S&P 500 dropped 2.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.8% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite 3.6%.",
      "The new tariffs and export restrictions could inflame trade talks between China and the Trump administration. Mr. Trump is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month, but the U.S. president said earlier Friday, \"there seems to be no reason\" for the meeting to take place.",
      "China is the United States' third-largest trading partner after Mexico and Canada, with the U.S. importing $438.9 billion worth of Chinese goods and China buying $143.5 billion in U.S. goods last year, according to federal statistics.",
      "But China and the U.S. have had a rocky relationship on trade in recent months. Over the spring, American tariffs on Chinese goods spiked to 145% and Chinese tariffs on U.S. imports soared to 125%, following a set of tit-for-tat hikes that began with import duties unveiled by the Trump administration. In May, the U.S. and China agreed to slash their tariffs to 30% and 10%, respectively, while the two sides pursued a broader trade deal.",
      "The U.S.-China economic relationship has other complexities, too. The Trump administration needs Beijing's permission to close a deal to transfer ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations away from China-based parent company ByteDance. China has also chafed at some of the administration's restrictions on international students."

      "Travelers planning to fly into or out of U.S. airports could feel the impact of staffing issues, which continue to build as the government shutdown\u00a0reached its 10th day Friday.",
      "The \"national picture today looks a little messy,\" CBS News senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave said from Los Angeles International Airport on Friday.",
      "Across the U.S., roughly 52,000 flights are scheduled ahead of the\u00a0Columbus Day\u00a0weekend, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.",
      "Tasked with keeping travelers safe on the ground and in the air, TSA officers and air traffic controllers are\u00a0deemed essential\u00a0by the government, requiring them\u00a0to keep working\u00a0during the shutdown without immediate pay.",
      "However, an uptick in workers calling out sick has led to sporadic flight delays and cancellations, raising concerns over staffing shortages. The scheduling irregularities come as\u00a0potential weather disruptions\u00a0are expected across the East Coast and in Phoenix.",
      "\"On top of that you have uncertainty that's been injected into basically everyone's travels because of the staffing situation that we're seeing pop up sporadically throughout the air traffic control system,\" Van Cleave said.",
      "Typically, air traffic controller shortages drive about 5% of all flight delays. That figure is currently 53%, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told Fox Business.",
      "\"It doesn't look like its a coordinated or targeted sick out per se, but you're seeing more sick calls than you would normally see, and so, everyday, particularly as we get into the afternoon and evening hours, multiple FAA facilities have what are called staffing triggers, where they are short-staffed basically,\" Van Cleave said.",
      "\"And some of those don't result in a whole lot of disruption, and then we've seen others that have been pretty disruptive,\" he added.",
      "For example, at Nashville International Airport in Tennessee on Thursday, roughly 40,000 flyers were inconvenienced by an air traffic controller shortage. \"So it's not nothing, even if the vast majority off air traffic controllers are working,\" Van Cleave said.",
      "Air traffic controllers who violate agency sick leave policies will face repercussions, Secretary Duffy said this week.",
      "The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union representing such workers, said in a statement on its\u00a0website\u00a0that it does not condone their members taking actions that would compromise the safety of the nation's airspace. The union also urged workers to keep showing up on the job, despite not being paid on schedule.",
      "\"At this critical juncture, it is more important than ever that we rise to the occasion and continue delivering the consistent, high-level of public service we provide every day,\" tNATCA stated.",
      "Still, the impact of staffing shortages on flights so far has been minimal, reported Van Cleave, but delays could worsen as staffing shortages continue.",
      "\"While delays and cancellations have been within historic norms this week, and the vast majority of fights are leaving on time, the amount of delays because of air traffic controllers staffing is up,\" he said."

    "story": [
      "President Trump confirmed Wednesday that he has authorized the CIA to go into Venezuela and conduct covert operations.",
      "Asked by CBS News senior White House correspondent Ed O'Keefe why he did so, the president said he had two reasons: First, \"they have emptied their prisons into the United States of America\" and \"allowed thousands and thousands of prisoners\" and \"people from mental institutions, insane asylums\" into the U.S. Trump has frequently alleged \u2014 without citing evidence \u2014 that other countries are deliberately sending people from prisons and mental institutions to the southern border.",
      "He also cited the \"drugs coming in from Venezuela.\"",
      "\"A lot of the Venezuelan drugs come in from the sea. You get to see that,\" he told reporters at the White House in what seemed to be a reference to his administration's military airstrikes against suspected drug traffickers in waters off the coast of Venezuela. \"But we're gonna stop them by land, also.\"",
      "The New York Times first reported the president's authorization of CIA operations in Venezuela. Top Trump administration officials have accused Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of controlling the drug cartel Tren de Aragua, which Maduro denies, and the Justice Department has offered a reward for information leading to his capture. In August, the department doubled the bounty to\u00a0$50 million.",
      "Asked Wednesday whether the CIA had the authority to target Maduro, Mr. Trump said it would be \"a ridiculous question for me to answer,\" but \"I think Venezuela is feeling heat.\"",
      "The Venezuelan government condemned Mr. Trump's \"warmongering and extravagant\" comments in a statement, and accused the U.S. of seeking \"regime change\" in Venezuela.",
      "On Tuesday, the president said that the U.S. had struck another small boat off the coast of Venezuela, killing six people. It was the fifth\u00a0such strike in the Caribbean, where the Trump administration has asserted its authority to treat alleged drug traffickers as unlawful combatants who may be attacked with military force. At least 27 people have been killed in the five strikes, according to figures released by the administration.",
      "Mr. Trump has also deployed eight warships, a nuclear-powered submarine and fighter jets to the region as part of what he has said is as an operation to combat drug smuggling into the United States. After the U.S.' latest boat strike, Maduro\u00a0on Wednesday ordered military exercises in the country's biggest shantytowns.",
      "The strikes on alleged drug boats have drawn pushback from lawmakers in both parties. Critics note that Congress hasn't authorized military force against drug traffickers, and argue the Trump administration hasn't provided enough evidence about who was on the boats and what narcotics they were carrying.",
      "Asked by O'Keefe about those concerns, Mr. Trump said lawmakers \"are given information that they were loaded up with drugs, and that's the thing that matters.\" He alleged that \"fentanyl dust\" has been found on the boats after the strikes.",
      "\"When they're loaded up with drugs, they're fair game, and every one of those ships were,\" the president said."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration will continue paying FBI agents despite the ongoing government shutdown that has frozen paychecks for nearly all federal workers, FBI Director Kash Patel announced Wednesday.",
      "\"You've found a way to get these individuals paid during a government shutdown,\" Patel said to President Trump during an unrelated Oval Office event. \"On behalf of the FBI, it's a great debt that we owe you.\"",
      "Patel did not specify the source of the funds that would be used to pay the agents.",
      "The announcement follows recent moves by the administration to ensure members of the military receive paychecks this week despite most federal workers going without pay until the government reopens.",
      "\"We got the people that we want paid, paid,\" Mr. Trump told CBS News senior White House reporter Jennifer Jacobs. \"We want the FBI paid and we want the military paid.\"",
      "Military service members were set to be paid Wednesday after Mr. Trump issued a memo directing the Pentagon to use other unspent funds to make payroll. Around $8 billion in funds from the previous fiscal year had been identified to cover the mid-month paychecks, a Pentagon official said earlier. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem also said the Coast Guard, which falls under the purview of her department, would receive paychecks this week from funds in the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" that passed earlier this year.",
      "When funding lapsed on Oct. 1, agencies began implementing shutdown procedures to send hundreds of thousands of workers home on furlough. While essential employees and those whose duties are funded through other means stayed on the job, almost no federal workers had been expected to be paid until Congress reopens the government. Workers are expected to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "Under the Justice Department's shutdown plans, no FBI agents were placed on furlough, and only about 10% of department employees overall were expected to be sent home.",
      "The FBI Agents Association thanked Mr. Trump for ensuring agents are paid, but noted that the FBI's workforce also includes people other than agents, including analysts and professional staff. The group called for Congress to reopen the government.",
      "\"If the shutdown continues, the Bureau will be forced to curtail travel, training, hiring, and other vital operations, slowing investigations and weakening coordination with law enforcement partners,\" the group said in a statement.",
      "The administration's moves to pay certain federal workers has prompted questions about its legal authority to do so, since Congress appropriates funds and gives agencies a limited scope for what they can be used for. In previous shutdowns, Congress has voted on stand-alone measures to pay the military. And the Oct. 15 deadline for military paychecks had been widely viewed as a possible off-ramp in the shutdown amid an impasse between the parties that has extended into a third week. But the moves to unilaterally fund the mid-month paychecks took the pressure off lawmakers, at least temporarily.",
      "Republican leaders in Congress tried to resume that pressure on Democrats to reopen the government and pay the military Wednesday. House Speaker Mike Johnson warned that members of the military are in danger of missing their next paycheck later this month if the shutdown continues, calling the administration's move to pay service members a \"temporary fix.\"",
      "Johnson, asked about funds for law enforcement, said he spoke with Mr. Trump and OMB Director Russ Vought at the White House on Tuesday. He said \"they're having to triage federal spending,\" and must determine \"what are the most essential services, personnel, policies and what are not.\"",
      "\"When we look at that, we prioritize troops and law enforcement,\" Johnson said.",
      "Separately, the Trump administration has sought to lay off thousands of federal employees during the shutdown, drawing\u00a0pushback from some Republican lawmakers and prompting a court ruling on Wednesday\u00a0temporarily halting the firings. Mr. Trump said his administration is \"terminating tremendous numbers of Democrat projects.\"",
      "\"We're getting rid of a lot of things that we never wanted because of the fact that they made this stupid move,\" the president told reporters."

      "Following a two-day manhunt, a 22-year-old Utah man identified as Tyler Robinson was arrested in the killing. State prosecutors have charged Robinson with aggravated murder.",
      "The revocations are part of a wider crackdown on comments that mock or celebrate Kirk's death. The Pentagon and the Secret Service have sidelined service members or agents who wrote negative social media posts about Kirk, and Vice President JD Vance has encouraged people to call the employers of anybody who celebrates Kirk's killing.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to revoke visas in other circumstances, too. It is pushing to deport several international students who are linked to campus protests against Israel's war in the Gaza Strip, accusing them of antisemitic rhetoric \u2014 which the students have denied. And it revoked Colombian President Gustavo Petro's visa last month for encouraging U.S. troops to disobey President Trump's orders during a protest in New York.",
      "The government's legal power to deny or revoke visas on speech grounds is an unresolved question, Eugene Volokh, a UCLA professor emeritus of law who has written extensively about the First Amendment, told CBS News last month. The Supreme Court has ruled that the government has broad latitude to refuse to admit people into the country, but whether federal officials can deport people who are already in the U.S. due to their speech is less clear.",
      "Volokh said noncitizens \"have the same First Amendment protections against, say, criminal punishment or civil liability as citizens do.\"",

      "Netanyahu spoke to CBS News days after Hamas released the last 20 living hostages taken on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel's military withdrew from parts of the Gaza Strip, in the first phase of a peace plan brokered by President Trump and Arab states. He weighed in on the future of Gaza, how Israel will react if Hamas doesn't disarm and the criticism Israel has faced during the war.",
      "Here are the highlights:",
      "Could Netanyahu regret releasing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the Israeli hostages?",
      "Netanyahu took a longer view when Dokoupil, in reference to the release of almost 2,000 Palestinian detainees and prisoners in exchange for both the living and deceased Israeli hostages, asked him, \"Are you going to regret this decision?\"",
      "He responded that now, Israel is in a \"much better position\" to pursue Hamas if it fails to abide by the peace plan because there are no longer 20 Israeli hostages \"with their head on the chopping block.\"",
      "Dokoupil noted that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind of the Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack, was released in an exchange with Israel in 2011.",
      "Netanyahu acknowledged that the decision to release thousands of people \u2014 including 250 who were serving life sentences in Israeli prisons \u2014 was \"very painful.\"",
      "\"It's true that the worst ones among them we didn't release, but that's small comfort if your son or daughter was murdered by one of these people who were freed,\" he said.",
      "Releasing the Palestinian prisoners came with the understanding that \"there's an enormous price to pay for the commitment that Israel has to bring our hostages or captives held by the enemy,\" Netanyahu said.",
      "Netanyahu claims ratio of civilians to combatants killed in Gaza is \"less than 2 to 1\"",
      "Asked by Dokoupil about the criticism that he's been \"negligent with civilian life in Gaza\" and whether his count of civilian deaths differed from that of the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health, Netanyahu estimated \"20,000 Hamas terrorists\" had been killed by Israel.",
      "He added that that was the number \"if you take away the people who die anyway from disease or old age.\"",

There are also an estimated 11,000 Gazans still missing, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, presumed to be buried beneath the rubble.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Sunday that he believes roughly 60,000 people have died in Gaza.",
      "Netanyahu says finishing war \"as speedily as possible\" is \"first fix\" to combat young Americans' negative views of Israel",

A Pew poll in late September found only 35% of the respondents had a positive opinion of Israel's government, down from 47% in 2022, before the war started. Among Americans under 30, only 13% said the U.S. was providing \"about the right amount of aid to Israel.\"",
      "\"The first fix is to finish the war as speedily as possible, something that I have sought to do against all this contrarian propaganda,\" he said.",
      "Netanyahu also blamed social media for fueling the outrage against Israel, saying that \"lies\" about the nation \"obviously does its damage.\"",
      "\"In the TikTok age and in the television age \u2026 letting wars go on too long is going to cost you precisely what it costs you.\" But he added, \"That can recover at least partly when you finish the war and you move on to what I hope will be the era of peace.\"",

      "In remarks to the Knesset on Monday, Mr. Trump said Netanyahu is \"not the easiest guy to deal with, but that's what makes him great.\"",
      "Netanyahu appeared to take pride in the characterization.",
      "\"I hope he says that, because I'm very tough on the matters that pertain to my country's future,\" he told Dokoupil. \"My job is to protect the Jewish state and assure the future of the Jewish people.\"",
      "Netanyahu says Hamas must disarm or \"all hell breaks loose\"",
      "\"We agreed to give peace a chance,\" Netanyahu said. But he also maintained that the conditions in Mr. Trump's 20-point peace plan for Gaza are \"very clear:\" Hamas must give up its arms and demilitarize, or \"all hell breaks loose.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has warned that if Hamas does not disarm, \"We will disarm them.\"",
      "\"And it'll happen quickly and perhaps violently,\" the president said. \"But they will disarm.\"",
      "Netanyahu told Dokoupil, \"I hope we can do this peacefully. We're certainly ready to do so.\"",
      "How will the Gaza Strip be governed?",
      "A major unresolved question is who will control the Gaza Strip as Israeli forces withdraw.",
      "Mr. Trump's peace plan calls for control over the territory to be handed over to a technocratic committee made up of Palestinians, overseen by a \"Board of Peace\" that includes Mr. Trump and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Hamas is not supposed to play any role in governance. But beyond that, it's unclear.",
      "Netanyahu said the exact structure for how the territory will be run is unsettled.",
      "Asked by Dokoupil if Blair would run Gaza himself, Netanyahu replied, \"I doubt it.\"",
      "\"But I think that this is a transitional period, and we want to fashion a governance that works, that is not made of people who are committed to our destruction,\" he said. \"We don't want to have the October 7th massacre repeated.\"",
      "Netanyahu has ruled out the idea of allowing an independent Palestinian state, the solution that has been advocated by U.S. allies in Europe and the Arab world.",
      "He told Dokoupil that he supports Palestinians having the power to govern themselves, but would not support a Palestinian state with \"military power.\" \"That sovereign power of security must remain with Israel,\" the prime minister continued.",
      "The Israeli leader said the path forward should involve deradicalization and changes to the Palestinian education system. He also noted that many Gazans are opposed to Hamas or hold the group responsible for inflicting \"horrific misery\" on them.",
      "\"The most important thing in destroying fanaticism is to destroy a certain hope, the hope that the fanaticism will achieve its results,\" Netanyahu said. \"When people know Israel is here to stay, you're not going to destroy the Jewish state, Israel is too strong, that prepares the ground for a change of heart.\""

    "story": [
      "Days after hundreds of\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention employees\u00a0were laid off, former CDC officials are warning it has left the agency more unprepared to keep Americans healthy and safe.",
      "While 1,300 CDC employees initially received reduction-in-force notices on Friday, about 700 were later notified their terminations were revoked,\u00a0union officials said. Some of the RIF notices had been sent to CDC employees due to a coding error, a Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson said.",
      "But, about 600 staff members remained terminated.",
      "In a press conference Wednesday, the former CDC officials,\u00a0who resigned earlier this year in protest after what they described as growing political interference in the agency's scientific work, shared their concerns about the recent cuts, which come after multiple rounds of layoffs already this year.",
      "The CDC \"cannot protect all of us in the U.S. if they continue to have staff and resource cuts,\" former Chief Medical Officer\u00a0Debra Houry\u00a0said. \"When you look at what was eliminated and still eliminated, it's concerning for how the agency is going to function.\"",
      "Demetre Daskalakis, who was the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said the \"silencing and the downsizing of CDC means that we're not prepared for daily public health as well as for emergencies.\"",
      "An HHS spokesperson blamed the latest layoffs on the ongoing government shutdown and said, \"The Department is focused on restoring accountability, efficiency, and scientific integrity across all its agencies.\"",
      "\"The current reduction-in-force actions are a direct consequence of the Democrat-led government shutdown. Under the Biden administration, HHS became a bloated bureaucracy-expanding its budget by 38 percent and its workforce by 17 percent,\" the spokesperson said. \"All employees receiving reduction-in-force notices were designated non-essential by their respective divisions. HHS continues to eliminate wasteful and duplicative entities, including those inconsistent with the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda.\"",
      "According to Houry, the cuts include the Institutional Review Board, which reviews research studies; the ethics office, which reviews conflicts of interest; and the technology transfer office, which looks at patents.",
      "Some communication and policy offices were also cut, making it more difficult to communicate health threats to the public, Houry said.",
      "Another eliminated program Houry noted is the Employee Assistance Program, which provides counseling and support for staff.",
      "\"The CDC staff were\u00a0attacked and shot at two months ago, and still require counseling. And certainly job insecurity can lead to mental health issues and suicidal thoughts, and this is a time when you certainly need services like EAP,\" she said.",
      "HHS did not immediately respond when asked to confirm which offices were affected by cuts.",
      "The new layoffs are on top of cuts made to federal health agencies earlier this year as part of Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s reorganization, which has been challenged in court.",
      "\"We were at like 13,600 and then with the several reductions in force, about 3,000 or so have been lost. And with these reductions in force, I anticipate they'll be just below 10,000 people,\" Houry said.",
      "Daskalakis echoed that \"we're really unprepared\" due to the cuts.",
      "\"We've gotten to a point where so much muscle has been cut from CDC that in order to respond to a medium or large event, it will be extremely disruptive. We may not have all of the expertise needed because of some of the previous reductions in force, and we'll have some problems with the infrastructure that's needed to do the work,\" he explained."

    "published": "Wed, 15 Oct 2025 16:03:35 -0400",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court heard arguments on whether Louisiana's intentional creation of a second majority-Black district violates the 14th and 15th Amendments.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Members of the Supreme Court's conservative majority appeared open Wednesday to raising the bar for successfully challenging voting maps under a key pillar of the Voting Rights Act, a decision that would weaken the landmark law and limit the consideration of race in the drawing of congressional districts.",
      "The high court appeared sharply divided in the\u00a0long-running legal fight over Louisiana's congressional map, which was before the justices for a second time Wednesday. The high court first heard arguments in March over whether Louisiana lawmakers relied too much on race when it crafted new House district lines last year. But the justices declined to issue a decision then, and in August, it posed a new question for consideration: Whether state lawmakers' intentional drawing of a second majority-minority district \u2014 which was undertaken to remedy a likely violation of Section 2 \u2014 runs afoul of the 14th and 15th Amendments.",
      "The dispute is likely to have significant ramifications not just for political representation in Louisiana, but also for its potential to upend Section 2, which has become a crucial tool in recent years for minority voters seeking to ensure they have equal opportunity to elect their preferred candidates.",
      "Following more than two hours of oral argument, it appears that Louisiana's current congressional map, which includes four majority-White districts and two majority-Black districts, will not stand. But less clear is how far the Supreme Court's conservative majority will go with a decision.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh's votes in the case are key, as they joined with the three liberal justices two years ago to reaffirm Section 2 and the framework, in place since 1986, for proving vote dilution under the civil rights law. During the arguments, Kavanaugh seemed open to the Trump administration's position, which calls for tightening the standards for proving a violation of Section 2.",
      "Kavanaugh called part of their proposed new standard an \"innovation.\" But he repeatedly pressed lawyers for both sides on a possible end-point for race-based remedies for Section 2 violations, which has involved the drawing of majority-minority districts. In the 2023 case, Kavanaugh wrote in a concurring opinion that \"the authority to conduct race-based redistricting cannot extend indefinitely into the future.\" On Wednesday, he probed whether\u00a0there should be a time limit as to \"the particular application of the statute that entails the intentional, deliberate use of race to sort people.\"",
      "But he also appeared uncomfortable with the use of race in redistricting, quoting from a 1994 concurring opinion by then-Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote, \"the sorting of persons with an intent to divide by reason of race raises the most serious constitutional questions.\"",
      "Justice Amy Coney Barrett clarified during the proceedings that the argument pressed by the Justice Department would mark a \"modification\" of the preconditions used in vote-dilution cases since 1986.",
      "But Justice Sonia Sotomayor argued that under the framework proposed by the Justice Department, \"the bottom line is just get rid of Section 2,\" and Janai Nelson, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, said the Trump administration's proposal would \"swallow Section 2 whole.\"",
      "When the Supreme Court considered Louisiana's map in March, it originally focused on a more narrow set of issues about the House district lines. But after agreeing to hear the case again, it asked Louisiana officials and voters involved in the challenge to address whether race-based redistricting comports with the Constitution.",
      "That new question upped the stakes of the case, as Republicans in Louisiana urge the Supreme Court to forbid the consideration of race in the drawing of voting lines. Benjamin Aguinaga, Louisiana's solicitor general, told the justices that race-based redistricting is \"fundamentally contrary to our Constitution.\" A decision in the state's favor could erode Section 2 and deal another blow to the landmark voting rights law more than 10 years after the Supreme Court gutted one of its other provisions.",
      "The legal fight over Louisiana's congressional map dates back to 2022, when GOP lawmakers in the state drew new House district lines after the 2020 Census. That map consisted of five majority-White districts and one majority-Black district. Nearly one-third of Louisiana's population is Black, according to Census data.",
      "A group of African American voters challenged the map as a violation of Section 2 because it diluted Black voting strength, they argued. A judge in Baton Rouge agreed, finding the map deprived Black voters of the chance to elect their preferred candidate, and she ordered the state to put a remedial map in place with a second majority-minority congressional district.",
      "The new plan adopted by the Louisiana legislature in 2024 reconfigured the state's 6th Congressional District, which state lawmakers said was in an effort to bring it into compliance with the Voting Rights Act. The new District 6 has a Black voting-age population of roughly 51% and stretches across the state from Shreveport, in Louisiana's northwest corner, to Baton Rouge, in the southeast. Congressman Cleo Fields, a Democrat who is Black, was elected to represent the district last November.",
      "State lawmakers said they had a political goal in mind, too, when recrafting the voting boundaries: to protect key Republican incumbents in the House, namely House Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Rep. Julia Letlow, who sits on the powerful Appropriations panel.",
      "But after the new map was adopted, a group of 12 self-described \"non-African-American\" voters challenged the boundaries, alleging the new District 6 was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. A divided panel of three judges in Shreveport sided with the voters and found that the state legislature relied too much on race when it crafted the new map.",
      "The case landed before the Supreme Court in its last term, and Louisiana Republicans joined with Black voters and voting rights groups in urging the justices to leave the new congressional map in place. But with the case set to be reargued, and the focus now on the constitutionality of race-based redistricting, state GOP lawmakers are no longer defending their district lines.",
      "Instead, state officials are arguing that the there should be \"zero tolerance for any consideration of race.\"",
      "\"[R]ace-based redistricting mandated by Section 2 is unconstitutional because it violates basic equal protection principles: It uses race as a stereotype, uses race as a negative, and has no logical end point,\" Louisiana Attorney General Elizabeth Murrill, a Republican, wrote in a\u00a0filing. \"Accordingly, Section 2 is unconstitutional insofar as it requires race-based redistricting. \"",
      "The Trump administration is backing Louisiana and the \"non-African-American\" voters in the case and has urged the Supreme Court to tighten the standards for proving unlawful vote dilution under Section 2. The framework in place since 1986 requires plaintiffs to show racial polarization in voting, in addition to other preconditions.",
      "\"Too often, Section 2 is deployed as a form of electoral race-based affirmative action to undo a State's constitutional pursuit of political ends. That misuse of Section 2 is unconstitutional,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing.",
      "But lawyers for the voters who challenged the initial district lines, which were then redrawn to include a second majority-Black district, argue the new map largely prioritized Republicans' political goals of protecting key incumbents. Any consideration of race, they said, was limited and driven by a compelling interest in addressing a violation of the Voting Rights Act.",
      "Nelson, who argued on behalf of Black voters defending the current map, warned that if the Supreme Court were to side with Louisiana and the White voters, it would be a \"staggering reversal of precedent that would throw maps across the country into chaos.\"",
      "She told the justices that if Louisiana's current map is \"unsatisfactory,\" they should send the case back to the lower courts to adopt another map that addresses the Section 2 violations and satisfies the Constitution.",
      "\"[T]he notion that the sun has set on the need for race-conscious remedial redistricting for identified instances of racial vote dilution is contrary to both the fact of ongoing discrimination in Louisiana and the text and purpose of [Section 2] as it was amended in 1982 and has been consistently interpreted by this Court ever since,\" lawyers for the Black Louisianans wrote in a filing.",
      "They warned that removing Section 2's protections for minority voters in Louisiana \"will not end discrimination there or lead to a race-blind society, but it may well lead to a severe decrease in minority representation at all levels of government in many parts of the country.\"",
      "Without the provision, \"jurisdictions could simply eliminate minority opportunity districts even where they remain necessary for voters of color to have any opportunity to elect candidates of choice, wiping out minority representation and re-segregating legislatures, city councils, and school boards \u2014 as some have recently attempted to do,\" lawyers wrote.",
      "In response to questioning from Kavanaugh about an end-point for race-based redistricting, Nelson said there's no precedent to suggest that a statute must dissolve on its own because race is part of the remedy. And she argued that the nondiscrimination element of the 15th Amendment is \"a permanent right, and so should be the protection that Section 2 affords.\"",
      "Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson suggested that Nelson was saying that Section 2 is itself not a remedy that should have an end point, but was instead more of a mechanism \u2014 a kind of \"check-in\" on \"where we might need to do work.\" She compared it to a \"tape measure\" that \"doesn't need a life cycle.\" Nelson agreed and noted that the number of successful challenges to maps under Section 2 cases have fallen in the last decade.",
      "Justice Samuel Alito asked Nelson about the differences between racial voting and partisan voting. If drawing districts to protect incumbents is reasonable, isn't seeking partisan advantage something that legislatures can seek? he asked.",
      "No, Nelson replied, not under the 14th and 15th Amendments. Redistricting on a partisan basis, she said can't come \"at the cost of the equal protection principle.\"",
      "Alito suggested that racially polarized voting could easily be identified through statistical analysis, and it could be seen whether White Democrats vote for Black Democrats at a lower rate, for instance.",
      "Nelson told him that White Democrats were not voting for Black candidates \u2014 whether they were Democrats or not. She said there was no question that even if there is some correlation, that race was the driving factor.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch repeatedly suggested allowing race to be taken into account during the drawing of district lines is a way to \"intentionally discriminate.\"",
      "\"Is it acceptable under Section 2 as, as you understand it, given our precedents, for a court to intentionally discriminate in a remedial map on the basis of race?\" he asked Nelson. \"One argument is often, well, once you've found a Section 2 violation, you've got a compelling interest to go ahead and discriminate on the basis of race in your remedial map. And I'm just wondering, do you endorse that view or do you reject that view?\"",
      "The Supreme Court is re-hearing the case involving Louisiana's map just over two years after it upheld Section 2 and reaffirmed the framework for proving vote dilution set out in the 1986 ruling. The high court split 5-4 in that 2023 case, which involved a challenge to Alabama's congressional map, with Roberts and Kavanaugh joining the three liberal justices in the majority.",
      "The two justices also voted to outlaw the use of race as a factor in college admissions, a decision that came down in the same term as the Alabama voting rights dispute.",
      "Roberts, in particular, has long denounced racial classifications. In a 2006 concurring opinion, the chief justice wrote, \"it is a sordid business, this divvying us up by race.\" He also authored the 2013 majority opinion that dismantled Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, writing, \"our country has changed, and while any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions.\"",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June or early July."

    "story": [
      "President Trump's administration for now must stop firing workers during the government shutdown, a federal judge ordered on Wednesday.",
      "U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco said the cuts appeared to be politically motivated and were being carried out without much thought.",
      "\"It's very much ready, fire, aim on most of these programs, and it has a human cost,\" she said. \"It's a human cost that cannot be tolerated.\"",
      "She granted a temporary restraining order blocking the job cuts, saying she believed the evidence would ultimately show the cuts were illegal and in excess of authority.",
      "The judge's decision came after federal agencies on Friday started issuing layoff notices aimed at reducing the size of the federal government. The layoff notices are part of an effort by the Trump administration to exert more pressure on Democratic lawmakers as the government shutdown continues. Russell Vought, the head of the White House Office of Management and Budget,\u00a0said earlier Wednesday that the number of layoffs could reach more than 10,000.",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees and other federal labor unions had asked Illston to block the administration from issuing new layoff notices and implementing those that were already sent out. The unions said the firings were an abuse of power designed to punish workers and pressure Congress.",
      "Illston's order came as the shutdown, which started Oct. 1, entered its third week. Democratic lawmakers are demanding that any deal to reopen the federal government address their health care demands. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson predicted the shutdown may become the longest in history, saying he \"won't negotiate\" with Democrats until they hit pause on those demands and reopen.",
      "Democrats have demanded that health care subsidies, first put in place in 2021 and extended a year later, be extended again. They also want any government funding bill to reverse the Medicaid cuts in Mr. Trump's tax break and spending cut bill passed this summer.",
      "The Trump administration has been paying the military and pursuing its crackdown on immigration while slashing jobs in health and education, including in special education and after-school programs. Mr. Trump said programs favored by Democrats are being targeted and \"they're never going to come back, in many cases.\"",
      "In a court filing, the administration initially said it planned to fire more than 4,100 employees across eight agencies, but Vought said that number was a \"snapshot\" that was likely to grow.",
      "The unions said the layoff notices are an illegal attempt at political pressure and retribution and are based on the false premise that a temporary funding lapse eliminates Congress' authorization of agency programs.",
      "The government said the district court lacks jurisdiction to hear employment decisions made by federal agencies."

      "Smith, who investigated and prosecuted President Trump before his reelection, accused Attorney General Pam Bondi of being \"driven to achieve certain outcomes, no matter what,\" particularly in the case against Comey, who is accused of lying to Congress.",
      "Smith led the Justice Department probes of Mr. Trump related to his conduct after the 2020 presidential election, and to his handling of classified records after his first term ended. The cases both resulted in criminal charges against Mr. Trump, and he pleaded not guilty to all charges and denied wrongdoing.",
      "The interview with Weissman, was posted online Tuesday but recorded on Oct. 8, before New York Attorney General Letitia James was also indicted for mortgage fraud by the same U.S. attorney's office that brought charges against Comey in late September.",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The U.S. government shut down Wednesday, October 1, after President Trump and congressional Republicans at odds with Democrats over the path forward were unable to\u00a0avert a lapse in federal funding.",
      "Mr. Trump had said Sunday that a shutdown was likely, rejecting Democrats' push for Congress to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year. The president met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at the White House on Monday, but the meeting ended without a breakthrough.",
      "The president canceled an earlier meeting with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders set for last week, calling their demands \"unserious and ridiculous,\" and House Republicans left Washington, D.C., earlier this month after approving a stopgap measure that kept the government funded until Nov. 21. But the proposal failed to garner the necessary support in the Senate. A Democrat-backed counter-plan to extend funding through Oct. 31, which included other party priorities, also failed in the upper chamber.",
      "In an effort to ramp up the pressure on Democrats to go along with Republicans' funding measure, the White House budget office sent a memo to federal agencies last week telling them to consider reduction-in-force plans for mass layoffs of certain federal workers during a shutdown.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to feel the impacts of a shutdown if a deal isn't reached this time around.",

      "What happened:\u00a0On Nov. 20, 1981, the Senate approved legislation that fell short of spending cuts Reagan had sought. The bill differed from a version passed in the House and funding technically lapsed at midnight, but since Nov. 21 fell on a Saturday, the effects weren't felt immediately. House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",
      "On Monday, Reagan vetoed the plan and ordered the government to shut down, placing 250,000 federal employees on furlough. Later in the day, lawmakers passed a stopgap bill to keep the government funded and allow more time for talks on a deal. Workers returned the next day.",

      "Congress walked away from the jobs provision but included money for legal support for low-income Americans. Lawmakers also declined to fund the missile program, but Reagan still signed the legislation to end the shutdown.",

      "What happened:\u00a0The shutdown stemmed from Democrats adding roughly $1 billion in education spending, and cutting foreign aid. House Democrats ended up decreasing their request for education spending to $100 million and provided money for the MX missile, which Reagan wanted. Democrats kept their cuts to foreign aid and defense.",

      "Senate control: Democrats",
      "House control: Democrats",

The rule was repealed in 1987.",

      "What happened:\u00a0The shutdowns that occurred during Clinton's presidency centered around his dispute with congressional Republicans of their pledge to balance the budget and repeal the president's 1993 tax increases. The GOP, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, took control of the House for the first time in 40 years in 1995 in what would be remembered as the \"Republican Revolution.\"",
      "The GOP-led Congress passed a short-term continuing resolution that sought to boost Medicare premiums and required the president to balance the budget within seven years, among other measures. But Clinton vetoed the legislation, which led to a shutdown.",

      "The issue was which agency's budget projections, the Congressional Budget Office or the Office of Management and Budget, the White House should use to show that the budget was balanced within seven years. In the end, Republicans backed down: then-Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole indicated in a floor speech on New Year's Eve that \"we ought to end this.

      "What happened:\u00a0The fight began over the Affordable Care Act and a push by Republicans to dismantle key parts of Obama's signature health care law. The GOP-led House passed two spending bills, one of which would've delayed implementation of Obamacare, which were both rejected by the Democratic-led Senate.",
      "Obama called for a spending bill with no conditions attached, but Republicans ultimately opted to shut down the government over their opposition to the landmark health care law.",
      "House Republicans led by Speaker John Boehner in the end ceded to Democrats and approved a short-term spending bill that didn't include changes to Obamacare.",

      "What happened:\u00a0The shutdown, which officially began on the one-year anniversary of Trump's inauguration, stemmed from a fight over immigration, and specifically Democrats' demands for protections for \"Dreamers,\" undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children.",
      "The White House, however, said it would not engage in negotiations over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which extended legal protections for Dreamers, while the government was shut down.",
      "In the end, Democrats relented after Republicans pledged to work toward a deal addressing DACA, and Trump signed a short-term funding bill that reopened the government.",

      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Republicans/Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0Months later, immigration was again at the center of the government funding fight, though this shutdown involved Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to pay for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "As the shutdown stretched to become the longest in history and Democrats took control of the House, the former president ended up signing a bill to reopen agencies for three weeks and did not include money for the border wall. Weeks later, Congress averted another shutdown by passing a measure that included $1.375 billion for the border wall, far less than the $5.7 billion Trump requested."

    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",
      "Benefit verificationsEarnings record corrections and updates unrelated to the adjudication of benefitsPayee accountingsPrisoner activities \u2014 suspensionRequests from third parties for queriesFreedom of Information Act requestsIT enhancement activities, public relations and trainingReplacement Medicare cardsOverpayments processing",

      "Freedom of Information Act requests",
      "IT enhancement activities, public relations and training",
      "Replacement Medicare cards",
      "Overpayments processing",
      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News."

      "During a government shutdown, all active-duty personnel, as well as National Guard who are currently deployed, must carry out their assigned duties with their pay delayed until the shutdown is over. Civilian personnel whose work the Defense Department considers essential, or \"excepted,\" will also continue to work, while other civilians are furloughed for the duration of the shutdown.",
      "\"After the government shutdown, all government employees will automatically receive back pay, based on the terms of the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019,\" said Seamus Daniels, a fellow for Defense Budget Analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "Active-duty service members won't get paid on time unless Congress passes a separate piece of legislation, as it did in 2013 with the \"Pay Our Military Act,\" which ensured military pay and allowances continued during a government shutdown.",
      "Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia introduced a bill earlier this month with bipartisan support, the \"Pay Our Troops Act of 2026,\" which would keep members of the military and Coast Guard paid during a shutdown, but it did not pass in time because the House is out of session until Oct 7.",
      "During the last shutdown in 2019, the Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA offered special loans to members of the military, and they plan to do so again if there's a shutdown in October. The Navy Federal Credit Union said in a\u00a0press release\u00a0it would \"offer 0% APR loans to eligible members whose pay may be affected, continuing a tradition of assistance seen during previous shutdowns in 2011, 2013 and 2018-2019, when nearly 20,000 members received support.\" USAA plans to offer eligible members who have accounts with the bank a \"no-interest loan equal to the amount of one net paycheck.\"",
      "The Defense Department published contingency guidance on Friday, outlining its priority missions and stating that unused funds passed in the reconciliation bill over the summer could be considered to support them. The list includes, in order: operations to secure the U.S. Southern Border, Middle East operations, the U.S. missile defense project Golden Dome for America, depot maintenance, shipbuilding and critical munitions.",
      "The guidance estimates about 406,000 of the department's 741,000 civilian employees will be required to work in the event of a shutdown because their mission is critical and not easily carried out by any U.S. service member.",
      "While a memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget said some civilians could be laid off during the shutdown, the guidance released by the Defense Department outlines furloughs but no cuts to the civilian workforce.",
      "During the shutdown, medical care and dental care will be excepted, according to the contingency guidance, but elective surgeries and other elective procedures would be delayed unless they're necessary for military readiness. Private health care using the Defense Department's TRICARE medical insurance would continue uninterrupted."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs, since a government shutdown went into effect on Wednesday, Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change."

Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",

      "Here's what to know about what happens during the government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",

      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich."

    "summary": "New York City Republican mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa told CBS News President Trump should stay out of the race \u2014 arguing that he's strengthening Zohran Mamdani.",
    "story": [
      "Republican New York City mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa argues the outcome of the city's election could have implications beyond the five boroughs.",
      "In an interview Tuesday with CBS News, Sliwa drew a sharp contrast between himself and his two main opponents, Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo.",
      "\"New York City is the epicenter of capitalism in the world,\" said Sliwa.",
      "And, he argues, if voters elect Mamdani, \"it will encourage other young democratic socialists of America\" to \"take over their city government legally by winning in the ballot box.\"",
      "Throughout the campaign, Sliwa has routinely criticized Mamdani's proposed policies and association with the Democratic Socialists of America.",
      "Sliwa also had harsh words for Cuomo on Tuesday, blaming \"horrific increases in crime\" in the city on Cuomo's policies as governor, including state laws that ended cash bail for some criminal charges and raised the age of criminal responsibility.",
      "Said Sliwa: \"I'm the only one standing between Zohran Mamdani and Andrew Cuomo, who I call Zohran lite.\"",
      "A Republican candidate hasn't won a mayoral election in deep-blue New York City in 20 years. But in this year's race, the GOP nominee could play an outsized role. Mamdani defeated Cuomo in the Democratic primary, but Cuomo stayed in the race on a third-party ticket. Since then, Cuomo and his allies have called on Sliwa to drop out, arguing that the two candidates are splitting the anti-Mamdani vote \u2014 a charge Sliwa has pushed back on.",
      "In an Oct. 9 poll from Quinnipiac University, Mamdani led with 46% support, followed by Cuomo with 33% and Sliwa with 15%. The poll was taken after incumbent New York City Mayor Eric Adams dropped out of the race.",
      "The race has drawn the attention of President Trump. Sliwa has also faced criticism from the president, who said in September, \"Curtis is not exactly prime time,\" and poked fun at Sliwa's dozens of rescue cats. Mr. Trump has railed against Mamdani, too, calling him a \"communist\" and implying that federal funding to the city could be cut if he wins.",
      "\"I wouldn't be generous to a communist,\" the president said this week.",
      "In response to the president's criticisms of him, Sliwa advised Mr. Trump \u2014 another native New Yorker \u2014 to stay focused on international crises, rather than New York City.",
      "\"Every time he gets involved in this mayoral election, he strengthens Zohran Mamdani,\" said Sliwa. \"They don't want to campaign against me or Andrew Cuomo. They want to campaign against Donald Trump.\"",
      "The Trump administration has taken aim at the city and New York state, accusing local leaders of failing to cooperate with Mr. Trump's immigration agenda and of following diversity, equity and inclusion practices that the administration alleges are unconstitutional. The federal government froze $18 billion earmarked for two high-profile Manhattan tunnel projects, citing DEI, and it attempted to revoke millions in counterterrorism grants for the city's subway system.",
      "Separately, the Trump-backed \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" restricts Medicaid and food stamps, which could hit locales throughout the country.",
      "Sliwa warned, \"There will be cuts,\" but that he would try to \"limit the negative impact.\"",
      "\"We just have to make sure they don't hurt people who are desperately in need,\" Sliwa said.",
      "This is Sliwa's second consecutive campaign for mayor, but it follows decades in the public eye as an activist, a radio host and the founder of Guardian Angels anti-crime group. He's known on the campaign trail for his trademark red beret, which has long symbolized his Guardian Angels roots \u2014 but he said he's willing to put it aside.",
      "\"If that were the only reason not to elect me,\" he said, \"I'll take the red beret, put it in storage, and I'll never wear it again. But you gotta elect me mayor first.\""

      "In the post, Bondi said the page was part of an effort to \"dox and target\" the ICE agents.",
      "Some 200 ICE agents are there as part of President Trump's immigration enforcement drive. Doxxing is the sharing of personal information about people online.",
      "Meta said in a statement that the group \"was removed for violating our policies against coordinated harm.\"",
      "Meta is the latest tech company to restrict tools used to track ICE agents on its platform. Earlier this month, Apple and Google blocked downloads of phone apps that flag sightings of U.S. immigration agents, just hours after the Trump administration demanded that one particularly popular iPhone app be taken down.",
      "Bondi has said such tracking puts ICE agents at risk. But users and developers of the apps say it's their First Amendment right to capture what ICE is doing in their neighborhoods, and they maintain that most users turn to these platforms in an effort to protect their own safety as Mr. Trump steps up aggressive immigration enforcement across the country.",
      "While a Facebook group for ICE sightings in Chicago does appear to have been taken down, as of Tuesday evening, dozens of other groups, some with thousands of members, remained visible on Facebook."

      "The medal was accepted by Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, who now leads Turning Point USA. During an emotional speech, she called the medal \"the best birthday gift he could ever have\" and said at one point: \"Surprisingly enough, he did pray for his enemies\" \u2014 after Mr. Trump said earlier that the activist \"didn't necessarily love those enemies so much.\"",
      "The president and Kirk were allies for almost a decade. Kirk was a staunch supporter of Mr. Trump during all three of his presidential campaigns. Kirk worked closely with Donald Trump Jr. in 2016. He remained close to Mr. Trump following his loss to President Joe Biden in 2020 and helped lead grassroots organizing efforts in 2024.",
      "Kirk also helped to shape last year's presidential ticket, and by extension, the second Trump administration. He encouraged Mr. Trump to pick Vice President JD Vance as his running mate, and he brokered an alliance between Mr. Trump and former Democrat Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Mr. Trump announced plans to give Kirk the Medal of Freedom one day after the shooting at Utah Valley University. The president also spoke at an Arizona memorial service for Kirk last month, where he called the assassination \"an attack on our entire nation.\"",
      "Prosecutors in Utah last month charged 22-year-old Tyler Robinson with aggravated murder in Kirk's death and have signaled plans to seek the death penalty.",
      "Kirk is the first person to formally receive the Medal of Freedom in Mr. Trump's second term. The president has also promised to give the award to former New York City mayor and former Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani.",
      "Some 670 people have been awarded the Medal of Freedom since its inception 80 years ago, according to the Congressional Research Service. Mr. Trump granted the award to 24 people during his first term, including conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, professional golfer Tiger Woods and, posthumously, Elvis Presley, Babe Ruth and Antonin Scalia."

      "The five major broadcast networks released a joint statement Tuesday, saying, \"Today, we join virtually every other news organization in declining to agree to the Pentagon's new requirements, which would restrict journalists' ability to keep the nation and the world informed of important national security issues.\"",
      "\"The policy is without precedent and threatens core journalistic protections. We will continue to cover the U.S. military as each of our organizations has done for many decades, upholding the principles of a free and independent press,\" the networks said.",
      "CBS News is among an array of media organizations \u2014 including Newsmax, The New York Times, The Washington Post, NewsNation, The Hill and Fox News, which previously employed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as an on-air host \u2014 that say they will not sign the new Pentagon restrictions.",
      "The Defense Department sent reporters a memo in September mandating they sign an agreement acknowledging they would need formal authorization to publish either classified or controlled unclassified information. The department said in the memo that \"information must be approved before public release \u2026 even if it is unclassified.\"",
      "Journalists covering the Pentagon were instructed to sign the agreement by 5 p.m. Tuesday. CBS News national security correspondent David Martin said, \"Walking the halls of the Pentagon was my M.O. for 40 years. I don't know how else to cover a story except by being there.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 14 Oct 2025 15:59:56 -0400",
    "summary": "Citing the shutdown, the Social Security Administration postponed its announcement of the annual payment bump beneficiaries will receive in 2026.",
    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration's annual announcement setting next year's cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, will be delayed because of the\u00a0government shutdown, the agency said.",
      "Each year, the Social Security Administration adjusts benefits for its 75 million recipients based on recent inflation data, which ensures that seniors, disabled Americans and other beneficiaries don't lose purchasing power as prices rise.",
      "Social Security had planned to announce the new COLA on Oct. 15, the same day the Labor Department was scheduled to release September Consumer Price Index data, a key measure of inflation. The COLA is determined by inflation figures for the third quarter, which covers July through September.",
      "With much of the government's economic data on hold until Congress approves federal funding, the Bureau of Labor Statistics now plans to release its latest CPI figures on Oct. 24, about nine days later than planned. The Social Security Administration told CBS News it plans to issue its COLA announcement that same day.",
      "\"The Bureau of Labor Statistics has announced they will issue the September 2025 Consumer Price Index on October 24,\" the Social Security Administration said in an Oct. 14 email. \"The Social Security Administration will use this release to generate and announce the 2026 cost-of-living adjustment on October 24 as well.\"",
      "The new COLA will take effect starting Jan. 1, 2026, without any delays due to the ongoing shutdown, the agency added.",
      "How much of a living adjustment?",
      "According to an estimate published last month by the Senior Citizens League, the annual COLA for 2026 could be around 2.7%, slightly higher than the 2.5% increase beneficiaries\u00a0received\u00a0in 2025.",
      "The League, an advocacy group for older Americans, based its most recent projection on\u00a0August inflation data\u00a0from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Because the SSA will also include September inflation data in its COLA rate, that number could change when it's announced later this month.",
      "AARP, another advocacy group for older people, expects the 2026 COLA to range from 2.6% to 2.9%. A 2.7% boost in benefits would lift the average monthly payment for retired workers by $54, from $2,008 to $2,062.",
      "Where is inflation now?",
      "The September CPI is forecast to rise to an annual rate of 3.1% up from 2.9% in August, according to economists polled by FactSet.",
      "According to economists, inflation is edging higher due partly to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, which have hit imports from across the globe, such as clothing, food, steel and toys. While some businesses stockpiled imported goods earlier this year to avoid raising rising prices, some are now passing the import taxes\u00a0on to their customers.",
      "\"Core goods pressures have started to heat up, marking the beginning of a delayed tariff passthrough,\" RBC economists Michael Reid and Carrie Freestone said in an Oct. 14 report. \"Concerningly, the breadth of inflationary pressures has widened \u2014 45% of CPI basket items are now reporting price growth at or above 3%, compared to roughly two-thirds pre-pandemic.\"",
      "Some retirees could face a financial pinch if prices continues to climb and their 2026 Social Security adjustment fails to keep pace with inflation. The Federal Reserve\u00a0forecasts\u00a0that the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, its favored measure of inflation, will rise to 3.1% this year before receding to 2.6% in 2026."

    "story": [
      "Portland, Maine \u2014 Leaf-peeping season has arrived in the Northeast and beyond, but weeks of drought have dulled this year's autumn colors and sent leaves fluttering to the ground earlier than usual.",
      "Soaking in the fall foliage is an annual tradition in the New England states as well as areas such as the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina and Upper Peninsula of Michigan. As the days shorten and temperatures drop, chlorophyll in leaves breaks down, and they turn to the autumn tones of yellow, orange and red.",
      "But dry weather in summer and fall can change all that because the lack of water causes leaves to brown and fall more quickly. And that's happening this year, as more than 40% of the country was considered to be in a drought in early October, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.",
      "That's more than twice the average, said Brad Rippey, a U.S. Department of Agriculture meteorologist and an author of the drought monitor, which is a partnership between the federal government and University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Drought has hit the Northeast and western U.S. especially hard, he said.",
      "It all adds up to fewer leaves to peep.",
      "\"I think it might be a little bit of a short and less colorful season, for the most part,\" Rippey said. \"The color is just not going to be there this year for some hillsides.\"",
      "Despite the gloomy forecast, autumn enthusiasts said it's still a great year to get out and enjoy nature's fireworks display. There is still a lot of color in New England's trees, said Andy Finton, senior conservation ecologist with The Nature Conservancy in Massachusetts.",
      "Climate change is stressing forests with severe weather and heat waves, but autumn in New England remains a beautiful time of year to experience the wonderment of forest ecosystems firsthand, he said.",
      "\"Our trees and our forests have an inherent resilience,\" Finton said. \"They are still very resilient, and I am constantly surprised at how wonderful the fall season is despite these stresses.\"",
      "Leaf-peepers undeterred for most part",
      "The tourism business built around leaf peeping has also proven resilient. At the Mills Falls Resort Collection at the Lake in Meredith, New Hampshire, general manager Barbara Beckwith said business is good at the four inns that have 170 rooms. The number of Canadian tourists is down, Beckwith acknowledged, but she said that's been made up with domestic leaf peepers, mostly from New England.",
      "Beckwith said her properties were booked solid on weekends through mid-October and had been for weeks.",
      "\"This year is actually going to be better than last year,\" Beckwith said. \"Last year was an election and that put a lot of trepidation in people. Now, they are traveling. The uncertainty of the election is over. We all know whose president now and we are traveling.\"",
      "Chris Proulx, executive director of the Mount Washington (New Hampshire) Valley Chamber of Commerce, said the decline in Canadian tourists by as much as 80% seen this summer has continued into the fall. But the region is faring better, he said, thanks to an uptick in travelers from other countries and its reputation for having one of the country's best leaf peeping seasons.",
      "\"This is the one season where people make plans in advance to come in addition to travelers from all of the country and all over the world,\" Proulx said.",
      "Leaf peeping was so popular in Colorado's Rocky Mountains this year that one town temporarily closed its highway offramp to alleviate gridlock. The area put on a display of yellow aspen trees dotting the mountains between evergreens, their delicate leaves vibrating in the wind.",
      "But there were signs of a dry spring in the central part of the state, one that is more severe the farther west you travel, said Colorado State Forest Service entomologist Dan West, who spends many fall days in a plane looking at how insect infestations are affecting tree health.",
      "Crispy edges, muted colors, and dropping leaves before they can take on a red or purple hue are all signs of drought stress, West said.",
      "\"The tree is shutting down processes early and we basically just see this muted kind of a show for the fall,\" he said.",
      "In Denver, arborist Michael Sundberg also said he's seeing less vibrant color than usual, and autumn feels like it arrived earlier than usual this year. It's still a beautiful time of year, but there might be less of it to enjoy, he said.",
      "\"It's weird to have color peaking this early in the mountains and then for Denver to be peaking at the same time,\" he said. \"Usually we're later in October before we really go off.\""

    "story": [
      "Arctic seals are being pushed closer to extinction by climate change and more than half of bird species around the world are declining under pressure from deforestation and agricultural expansion, according to an annual assessment from the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "One bright spot is green sea turtles, which have recovered substantially thanks to decades of conservation efforts, the IUCN said Friday as it released its latest Red List of Threatened Species.",
      "While many animals are increasingly at risk of disappearing forever, the updated list shows how species can come back from the brink with dedicated effort, Rima Jabado, deputy chair of the IUCN Species Survival Commission, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"Hope and concern go hand in hand in this work,\" Jabado wrote by email. \"The same persistence that brought back the green sea turtle can be mirrored in small, everyday actions \u2014 supporting sustainable choices, backing conservation initiatives, and urging leaders to follow through on their environmental promises.\"",
      "The list is updated every year by teams of scientists assessing data on creatures around the world. The scope of the work is enormous and important for science, said Andrew Farnsworth, a visiting scientist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology who studies bird migration and wasn't involved with the IUCN report.",
      "\"Every time one is done and every time there's revision, there's more information, and there's more ability to answer questions\" on species, some of which are still largely a mystery to researchers, Farnsworth said.",
      "Sea ice loss",
      "Because all the marine mammals native to the Arctic \u2014 seals, whales and polar bears \u2014 rely on the habitat provided by sea ice, they're all at risk as it diminishes because of human-caused climate change, said Kit Kovacs, co-chair of IUCN's Species Survival Commission Pinniped Specialist Group, which focuses on seals.",
      "The three species highlighted in the latest IUCN report \u2014 harp, hooded and bearded seals \u2014 have been moved up to a designation of greater concern in the latest update, indicating they are increasingly threatened by extinction, Kovacs said.",
      "The same melting of glaciers and sea ice destroying seal habitats also \"generally will bring escalation in extreme weather events, which are already impacting people around the globe,\" wrote Kovacs.",
      "\"Acting to help seals is acting to help humanity when it comes to climate change,\" Kovacs said.",
      "Global bird decline",
      "The update also highlighted Madagascar, West Africa and Central America, where Schlegel's asity, the black-casqued hornbill and the tail-bobbing northern nightingale-wren were all moved to near-threatened status. Those are three specific birds in trouble, but numbers are dropping for around three-fifths of birds globally.",
      "\"That three in five of the world's bird species have declining populations shows how deep the biodiversity crisis has become and how urgent it is that governments take the actions they have committed to under multiple conventions and agreements,\" said Ian Burfield, global science coordinator at BirdLife International.",
      "Deforestation of tropical forests is one of a \"depressing litany of threats\" to birds, a list that includes agricultural expansion and intensification, competition from invasive species and climate change, said Stuart Butchart, chief scientist at BirdLife International.",
      "\"The fact that 61% of the world's birds are declining is an alarm bell that we can't afford to ignore,\" Butchart said.",
      "The annual U.N. climate summit will be held in November in Belem, Brazil, with much attention on the Amazon and the value of tropical forests to humans and animals. But Farnsworth, of Cornell, said he was \"not so confident\" that world's leaders would take decisive action to protect imperiled bird species.",
      "\"I would like to think things like birds are nonpartisan, and you can find common ground,\" he said. \"But it's not easy.\"",
      "Green sea turtles",
      "One success story is the rebound of green sea turtles in many parts of the world's oceans. Experts see that as a bright spot because it shows how effective human interventions, like legal protections and conservation programs, can be.",
      "Still, \"it's important to note that conservation efforts of sea turtles can take decades before you realize the fruits of that labor,\" said Justin Perrault, vice president of research at Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach, Florida, who wasn't involved with the IUCN report.",
      "The overall success with green sea turtles should be celebrated and used as an example with other species, some of which, like hawksbills and leatherbacks, aren't doing nearly as well, said Nicolas Pilcher, executive director of the Marine Research Foundation.",
      "And even for green sea turtles, areas still remain where climate change and other factors like erosion are damaging habitats, Pilcher said, and some of those are poorer communities that receive less conservation funding.",
      "But in the places where they have recovered, it's \"a great story of, actually, we can do something about this,\" Pilcher said. \"We can. We can make a difference.\"",
      "Extinct species",
      "The latest Red List notes that six species have moved to the extinct category. The IUCN says those species include the Christmas Island shrew and the slender-billed curlew, a migratory shorebird.",

      "While ORCs detected in the past looked like one bright circle, this one consisted of two intersecting rings, which is rare. Previously, research into ORCs suggested the rings could be caused by shockwaves that were triggered by the merging of supermassive black holes or galaxies, but the latest findings propose that they actually could be linked to \"superwind\" flowing out of their host galaxies, the Royal Astronomical Society said.",

      "A weak spot in the Earth's magnetic field is growing over the South Atlantic Ocean, according to more than a decade's worth of satellite data collected by scientists.",
      "The magnetic field surrounding Earth protects the planet from cosmic radiation and particles charged by the sun. Scientists believe it is generated by the outer core of the Earth, according to a news release from the European Space Agency. The ESA said the \"global ocean of molten, swirling liquid iron\" in that layer of the planet creates electrical currents that generate the magnetic field.",
      "The weak spot, known as the South Atlantic Anomaly, was first identified in the 19th century, the ESA said. It is southeast of South America and southwest of Africa. In this area, the planet's magnetic field dips down, according to NASA. Satellites that pass over it are hit with higher doses of incoming radiation, which can cause technical issues and even blackouts.",
      "The ESA studied the spot for 11 years, from 2014 to 2025. Three different satellites, known as Swarm, precisely measured the planet's magnetic signals during that period. The data was published in the journal Science Direct.",
      "The satellite data showed that the South Atlantic Anomaly had expanded by an area \"nearly half the size of continental Europe,\" or about two million square miles. The speed of the area's weakening has increased since 2020, the ESA said, with different parts of the anomaly changing at different rates.",
      "\"The South Atlantic Anomaly is not just a single block,\" says lead author Chris Finlay, Professor of Geomagnetism at the Technical University of Denmark, in the ESA's news release. \"It's changing differently towards Africa than it is near South America. There's something special happening in this region that is causing the field to weaken in a more intense way.\"",
      "Finlay said that magnetic field lines emitting from the core are bouncing back into it. It's not clear why this is happening, but it is contributing to the anomaly's weakening in those areas, the ESA said.",
      "The ESA satellites found other changes in the Earth's magnetic field. In the southern hemisphere, there is another area where the magnetic field is particularly strong. Two other anomalies exist in the northern hemisphere: One near Canada and one over Siberia. Both are stronger than the rest of the field. However, the one near Canada has shrunk by an area the size of India, while the one over Siberia has grown by an area the size of Greenland, the ESA said.",

      "\"It's really wonderful to see the big picture of our dynamic Earth thanks to Swarm's extended timeseries,\" Swarm Mission manager Anja Stromme said in a statement. \"The satellites are all healthy and providing excellent data, so we can hopefully extend that record beyond 2030, when the solar minimum will allow more unprecedented insights into our planet.\""

    "summary": "The new restrictions for teen users are gradually rolling out starting Tuesday and will be fully implemented by the end of the year, Meta said.",
    "story": [
      "Instagram-parent Meta announced Tuesday that teen users will now see content on Instagram that's similar to what they might see while watching a film with a PG-13 rating.",
      "That's because new content settings for Instagram users under 18 will adhere to the same regulations. The new automatic protections are being rolled by the company starting Tuesday and will be fully implemented by the end of the year, according to Meta.",
      "\"We hope this update reassures parents that we're working to show teens safe, age-appropriate content on Instagram by default, while also giving them more ways to shape their teen's experience,\" the company said in the announcement.",
      "PG-13, a rating used in the media industry, indicates that parental guidance is suggested when watching content, particularly for children under 13.",
      "What are the new restrictions?",
      "The accounts of Instagram users under 18 will now be automatically be placed under a 13+ setting. Opting out of the setting will require parental permission.",
      "Teens with the setting will be blocked from seeing search results for terms like \"alcohol\" or \"gore.\" This adds to list of search topics from which Meta said it already shields teens, such as suicide, self-harm and eating disorders.",
      "Teens will also be prevented from following accounts that regularly posts content deemed age-inappropriate. Instagram users under 18 who already follow such accounts, will no longer be able to see or interact with their content, send them DMs, or see their comments under anyone's posts.",
      "Meta is also applying the new regulations to its artificial intelligence technology which is integrated into Instagram to help answer users' questions. \"A.I.s should not give age-inappropriate responses that would feel out of place in a PG-13 movie,\" Meta said Tuesday.",
      "The social media company is also unveiling a separate setting for parents who prefer a \"more restrictive experience for their teen.\" That setting, called \"Limited Content,\" filters more content out from teens' feeds while also restricting their ability to see, leave or receive comments on posts.",
      "Meta introduced \"Teen Accounts\" last year, billing the move as a way to protect the safety of its younger user base. The company's new teen restrictions follow similar announcements by\u00a0YouTube\u00a0and\u00a0OpenAI."

      "\"At a certain point it was, 'tell me what your address is' and when he said no, he's like, 'Well, I have these photos of you, I'll tell your parents,'\" Steven said of the interaction between the predator and his son back in July 2024. \"He was 30 feet down the hall from us and just\u2014 felt too trapped to \u2026 come and talk to us.\"",

    "summary": "David Pogue looks at our nation's tradition of pioneering inventors, from Thomas Edison's R&amp;D facility in Menlo Park, N.J., to today's entrepreneurs pitching their ideas to \"Shark Tank.\"",
    "story": [
      "If you plot the origins of the greatest inventions in history, you start to notice a pattern: The light bulb, the phonograph, the airplane, air conditioning, the zipper, the microwave, lasers, transistors, the personal computer, the internet, GPS, the smartphone \u2026 No country on Earth has as rich a history of modern invention as this one.",
      "But my question is, why is that? Well, the answer may start with a guy from Ohio: Thomas Edison, who we know as the inventor of the light bulb.",
      "\"Kind of,\" notes Hal Wallace, a curator at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. \"What we like to say is, Thomas Edison invented a commercially practical light bulb.\"",
      "Wallace says the light bulb was just one component of Edison's achievement: \"He was inventing new dynamoes, cables, switches, sockets, meters. If you're gonna sell electricity, you gotta have a meter. So, it's a systems approach.\"",
      "On New Year's Eve 1879, Edison gave an unforgettable demo in Menlo Park, New Jersey. Wallace said, \"He lit up the grounds, he lit up the laboratory, he lit up an office building with about a hundred of these light bulbs, and invited the press: 'Come out to Menlo Park and see what we've done.' He especially invited his investors!",
      "\"When the lights come on, it's almost a mystical experience, because these are not candles, they're not gas lights, they don't hiss, they don't smoke, they don't create noxious odors. You turn it on, it just sits and it glows.\"",
      "Edison's portfolio also included motion pictures, Portland cement, and even a talking doll, \"which is one of his famous flops,\" said Wallace.",
      "Steven Johnson, who has written 14 books about innovation and also co-founded a new Google AI tool for research called NotebookLM, says there are two archetypes many people use that are almost always wrong: \"They are the kind of lone genius coming up with a brilliant idea, and having that idea in a moment of sudden inspiration,\" he said. \"That is almost never the case.",
      "\"Edison gave a lot of credit to the crew,\" Johnson said. \"He has a famous line where he's like, 'I'm not so much a generator of ideas as I am a sponge.'\"",
      "Edison called Menlo Park \"the invention factory.\" He employed engineers, chemists, glassblowers, and mathematicians. Johnson said, \"He came up with this idea that if you got these interesting people together and put them in the same room together, that you could create a kind of a factory for new ideas. And that's what Menlo Park became.\"",
      "The pioneering spirit",
      "Today, Americans come up with more inventions than ever. Over the years, hundreds of entrepreneurs have appeared on ABC's \"Shark Tank,\" where they pitch a panel of potential investors, including real estate mogul Barbara Corcoran, Kind Bar founder Daniel Lubetzky, fashion pioneer Daymond John, and venture capitalist Rashaun Williams.",
      "\"They think their idea is always terrific,\" said Corcoran. \"It very often isn't. Anybody could come up with an idea, and everybody has at least a dozen. Really, everybody's got an idea, But building a business? Not many people can do it.\"",
      "She says most people coming into \"Shark Tank\" appreciate that the hard part is still ahead. But Lubetzky responded, \"It's not necessarily bad that entrepreneurs don't know how hard it will be.\"",
      "\"I would've never done what I've done, never,\" said John.",
      "Asked what it is about America that fosters such ingenuity, John replied, \"I think the people that founded the country went against all odds to come here. So, we got the cream of the crop of the world.\"",
      "Lubetzky added, \"You see also the pioneering spirit of all the immigrants and all the people that tried things out, and bring that spirit of risk-taking.\"",
      "\"And they bring that spirit on,\" said John. \"And then you have the top people around the world who left for either famine, atrocities, whatever, they made it over here, and they had a goal to make it over here. So they, first if all, are 1% of where they're from.\"",
      "Williams said, \"I think we have to give this government a lot of credit, too. A lot of the original venture capital funds were funded by government entities.\"",
      "Lubetzky said America's financial ecosystem \"allows ideas to be financed. Venture capital is much, much less developed in most other countries.\"",
      "And, Williams said, \"We also glamorize the successful entrepreneur in this country, just like we glamorize the professional athlete or entertainer. If you start a company and you sell it for $1 billion and you scale it, you're on the cover of every magazine. You're a superstar in this country.\"",
      "And, as for failure, Lubetzky said, \"In most of the world, if you fail, it's a negative mark on your family. And you are, you know -- it's horrible. You're an outcast. In the United States, you shrug it off and you try again.\"",
      "Corcoran said, \"The real question is, what do the successful entrepreneurs have in common? And I say what they have in common is the ability to get back up, take rejection.\"",
      "\"A pretty powerful combination\"",
      "According to Google's Steven Johnson, history is periodically upended by huge, foundational, technological breakthroughs.",
      "\"Edison realized that for the light bulb to work, he had to build an electrical grid,\" he said. \"But it was the grid that really changed everything, because once you had power to your homes, yeah, you could turn on a light, but you could also build a dishwasher, and you could have a television, and you could have a radio.\"",
      "The personal computer launched another huge round of innovation, and then the internet, and now artificial intelligence. All of it \u2026 invented in America.",
      "Johnson said, \"Openness to new ideas, willingness for consumers to experiment, that mix of a capitalist model with venture capital, [plus] government support and academic support, you put all those things together, and it's a pretty powerful combination.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump confirmed Wednesday that he has authorized the CIA to go into Venezuela and conduct covert operations.",
      "Asked by CBS News senior White House correspondent Ed O'Keefe why he did so, the president said he had two reasons: First, \"they have emptied their prisons into the United States of America\" and \"allowed thousands and thousands of prisoners\" and \"people from mental institutions, insane asylums\" into the U.S. Trump has frequently alleged \u2014 without citing evidence \u2014 that other countries are deliberately sending people from prisons and mental institutions to the southern border.",
      "He also cited the \"drugs coming in from Venezuela.\"",
      "\"A lot of the Venezuelan drugs come in from the sea. You get to see that,\" he told reporters at the White House in what seemed to be a reference to his administration's military airstrikes against suspected drug traffickers in waters off the coast of Venezuela. \"But we're gonna stop them by land, also.\"",
      "The New York Times first reported the president's authorization of CIA operations in Venezuela. Top Trump administration officials have accused Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of controlling the drug cartel Tren de Aragua, which Maduro denies, and the Justice Department has offered a reward for information leading to his capture. In August, the department doubled the bounty to\u00a0$50 million.",
      "Asked Wednesday whether the CIA had the authority to target Maduro, Mr. Trump said it would be \"a ridiculous question for me to answer,\" but \"I think Venezuela is feeling heat.\"",
      "The Venezuelan government condemned Mr. Trump's \"warmongering and extravagant\" comments in a statement, and accused the U.S. of seeking \"regime change\" in Venezuela.",
      "On Tuesday, the president said that the U.S. had struck another small boat off the coast of Venezuela, killing six people. It was the fifth\u00a0such strike in the Caribbean, where the Trump administration has asserted its authority to treat alleged drug traffickers as unlawful combatants who may be attacked with military force. At least 27 people have been killed in the five strikes, according to figures released by the administration.",
      "Mr. Trump has also deployed eight warships, a nuclear-powered submarine and fighter jets to the region as part of what he has said is as an operation to combat drug smuggling into the United States. After the U.S.' latest boat strike, Maduro\u00a0on Wednesday ordered military exercises in the country's biggest shantytowns.",
      "The strikes on alleged drug boats have drawn pushback from lawmakers in both parties. Critics note that Congress hasn't authorized military force against drug traffickers, and argue the Trump administration hasn't provided enough evidence about who was on the boats and what narcotics they were carrying.",
      "Asked by O'Keefe about those concerns, Mr. Trump said lawmakers \"are given information that they were loaded up with drugs, and that's the thing that matters.\" He alleged that \"fentanyl dust\" has been found on the boats after the strikes.",
      "\"When they're loaded up with drugs, they're fair game, and every one of those ships were,\" the president said."

    "story": [
      "A Mississippi man convicted of kidnapping, raping and killing a 20-year-old community college student in 1993 was executed Wednesday.",
      "Charles Crawford, 59, was pronounced dead at 6:15 p.m. following a lethal injection at the Mississippi State Penitentiary in Parchman.",
      "Crawford had spent more than 30 years on death row. His execution comes several months after the execution of Mississippi's longest-serving death row inmate in a year of increasing executions nationwide. There have been 37 executions this year, not including Crawford, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.",
      "Crawford was convicted of abducting Kristy Ray from her parents' home in northern Mississippi's Tippah County on Jan. 29, 1993. According to court records, when Ray's mother came home, her daughter's car was gone, and a handwritten ransom note had been left on the table.",
      "On the same day, a different ransom note, made from magazine cutouts and concerning a woman named Jennifer, was found in the attic of Crawford's former father-in-law. The note was turned over to law enforcement, who began searching for Crawford. He was arrested a day later and said he was returning from a hunting trip.",
      "He later told authorities he blacked out and did not recall killing Ray.",
      "At the time of that arrest, Crawford was days away from going to trial on a separate assault charge. The trial stemmed from an attack in 1991 in which Crawford was accused of raping a 17-year-old girl and hitting her friend with a hammer.",
      "Despite his assertions that he had experienced blackouts and did not remember committing either the rape or the hammer attack, Crawford was found guilty of both charges in two separate trials.",
      "His prior rape conviction was considered an \"aggravating circumstance\" by jurors in Crawford's capital murder trial, paving the way for his death sentence.",
      "Given the chance to make a final statement, Crawford said, \"To my family, I love you. I'm at peace. I've got God's peace,\" and added, \"I'll be in heaven.\"",
      "He also addressed Ray's family, saying, \"To the victim's family, true closure and true peace, you cannot reach that without God.\"",
      "Over the past three decades, Crawford tried unsuccessfully to overturn his death sentence.",
      "In an order issued minutes before the execution was scheduled to take place, the U.S. Supreme Court declined without explanation to stop the execution. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a dissent that was joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.",
      "His lawyers had appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing Crawford should be granted a new trial because his Sixth Amendment rights were violated in his 1994 trial.",
      "The appeal alleged that Crawford's lawyers admitted his guilt in the capital murder trial and pursued an insanity defense despite Crawford's repeated objections. The argument relies on a 2018 Supreme Court ruling, which ordered a new trial for a death row inmate and established that a lawyer for a criminal defendant cannot override a client's wish to maintain innocence at trial.",
      "\"It's almost like he didn't even get the chance to have innocent or guilty matter because his attorney just overrode his wishes from the outset,\" said Krissy Nobile, the director of the Mississippi Office of Capital Post-Conviction Relief, who represented Crawford.",
      "The Mississippi Supreme Court dismissed the argument in September, writing that Crawford should have brought the appeal sooner and did not present adequate reasoning why the 2018 Supreme Court ruling should be retroactive.",
      "After the Mississippi Supreme Court set his execution date in September, Nobile said Crawford expressed both disappointment and resolution.",
      "Nobile characterized Crawford as a respected, uplifting presence on death row. She said he worked inside the prison and advocated for other inmates.",
      "Marc McClure, the chief superintendent of operations for the Mississippi Department of Corrections, said during a press conference that Crawford visited with his family and a preacher Wednesday afternoon.",
      "The Associated Press made multiple attempts to contact Ray's relatives, but did not receive a response. Crawford also did not return requests for comment.",
      "The lethal injection was the third in two days in the U.S. after executions Tuesday in Florida and Missouri. A total of 38 men have died by court-ordered execution so far this year in the United States.",
      "In Florida, Samuel Lee Smithers, 72, was put to death for the 1996 killings of two women whose bodies were found in a rural pond. In Missouri, Lance Shockley was executed\u00a0by lethal injection after the state's governor denied his clemency petition. Shockley was convicted of first-degree murder for fatally shooting a Missouri state trooper in 2005.",
      "There are six more executions scheduled to take place in 2025, the next being that of Richard Djerf, who was convicted of killing four members of a family in Arizona over 30 years ago.",
      "Alabama inmate\u00a0Anthony Boyd is scheduled to be executed later this month for a 1993 murder. He continues to maintain his innocence, saying, \"I didn't kill anybody. I didn't participate in any killing.\" He was convicted in 1995 of capital murder and kidnapping in the death of George Huguley, and a jury voted 10-2 to recommend that he receive the death penalty."

      "The revocations are part of a wider crackdown on comments that mock or celebrate Kirk's death. The Pentagon and the Secret Service have sidelined service members or agents who wrote negative social media posts about Kirk, and Vice President JD Vance has encouraged people to call the employers of anybody who celebrates Kirk's killing.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to revoke visas in other circumstances, too. It is pushing to deport several international students who are linked to campus protests against Israel's war in the Gaza Strip, accusing them of antisemitic rhetoric \u2014 which the students have denied. And it revoked Colombian President Gustavo Petro's visa last month for encouraging U.S. troops to disobey President Trump's orders during a protest in New York.",
      "The government's legal power to deny or revoke visas on speech grounds is an unresolved question, Eugene Volokh, a UCLA professor emeritus of law who has written extensively about the First Amendment, told CBS News last month. The Supreme Court has ruled that the government has broad latitude to refuse to admit people into the country, but whether federal officials can deport people who are already in the U.S. due to their speech is less clear.",
      "Volokh said noncitizens \"have the same First Amendment protections against, say, criminal punishment or civil liability as citizens do.\"",
      "\"But when it comes to the question of deportation or exclusion from the country in the first place, the rules turn out to be unsettled,\" he said."

    "summary": "Consumer demand for cannabis-infused beverages is growing even as Americans drink less booze, with major brands testing the waters.",
    "story": [
      "Americans are still cracking open cold ones, but what's inside their cans is changing.",
      "More people are now reaching for cannabis beverages, nonalcoholic drinks infused with tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the main ingredient in marijuana that makes you feel high. Some varieties also include cannabidiol, or CBD, a chemical compound found in marijuana or hemp that proponents say helps relieve pain, anxiety and other health symptoms. The drinks come in different forms including seltzers, juices, sodas and teas.",
      "Consumer demand for cannabis beverages is growing as Americans drink less booze. According to a July Gallup survey, the percentage of U.S. adults who say they consume alcohol fell to 54%, the lowest level since 1939, when the polling organization first started tracking people's drinking behavior. More Americans also believe even moderate alcohol consumption is unhealthy, the poll found.",
      "Hundreds of brands small and large now hawk cannabis beverages, many promising to help take the edge off in social settings.",
      "\"There's a replacement factor going on between THC beverages and wine and beer and distilled spirits,\" said Beau Whitney, chief economist at Whitney Economics, an Oregon-based consultancy focused on the cannabis and hemp industry.",
      "THC beverage sales in the U.S. are expected to grow from $1.1 billion last year to nearly $5.6 billion by 2035, according to Whitney Economics.",
      "\"The remarkable growth and innovation we're seeing in the hemp-derived beverage space is a clear sign of consumer enthusiasm and entrepreneurial success,\" Michelle Rutter Friberg, director of government relations at the National Cannabis Industry Association, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Potential health impacts, side effects",
      "Several THC beverage brands market themselves as nonalcoholic alternatives and say their drinks contain zero calories and zero sugar. Doctors, however, warn that cannabis beverages can come with side effects.",
      "Whether smoked or ingested as an edible or drink, cannabis can affect the brain, heart, lungs and mental health, CBS News medical contributor Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder said, adding that the drug can trigger anxiety, paranoia, elevated heart rate and, in rare cases, psychosis.",
      "Potential short-term effects of cannabis include issues with memory, focus and coordination, said Gounder.",
      "\"People may have trouble remembering new information, paying attention or moving smoothly,\" she said. \"This can slow reaction time, cause slurred speech, and raise the risk of car crashes by 30%-40%. The effects depend on how much cannabis is used, how it's taken and how used to it someone is.\"",
      "Heavy or long-term intake of the drug, especially in teens, can lead to lasting issues with memory, attention and decision-making, said Gounder. Long-term use, she added, can also lead to cannabis-use disorder, which is a clinical term for addiction,\u00a0defined\u00a0by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as when users are unable to stop using cannabis even though it's causing them health and social problems.",
      "Some heavy users may also develop severe nausea and vomiting, Gounder said. Those most at risk are pregnant individuals, teens, and people with mental or heart conditions, she added.",
      "The potential effects of a cannabis-infused drink can be felt in as little as 15 to 20 minutes, compared with 30 to 90 minutes for an edible, according to Dr. Staci Gruber, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, in a recent article on the school's website.",
      "\"If you are interested in trying it and it is legal for you to do so, be mindful about controlling the experience until you know how a particular product affects you,\" Gruber said.",
      "Target eyes THC segment",
      "The U.S. has a patchwork of regulations governing the sale of cannabis products, with states offering varying degrees of restrictions, including minimum-age requirements. THC beverages can be legally sold in 44 states in total, \u00a037 of which allow sales outside of the marijuana dispensary systems according to Whitney.",
      "In those areas, the beverages can commonly be found at restaurants, bars, grocery stores and liquor stores.",
      "In Atlanta, for example, Scofflaw Beverage Company \u2014 previously a brewery fighting for its financial life after the pandemic \u2014 revived its business by canning drinks without alcohol that contain 5 to 10 milligrams of hemp-derived THC, CBS News Atlanta reports. Cannabis products are legal in Georgia and can be shipped across the U.S.",
      "\"It's really been an almost seismic shift in customer preference,\" Scofflaw co-founder Matt Shirah told CBS News Atlanta. \"The THC infused business has the potential to be 10 to 20 times the size of beer business.\"",
      "Cannabis beverages have even caught the attention of major retailers like Target. The Minneapolis-based chain confirmed to CBS News that it is testing the sale of THC beverages at certain Target liquor stores in Minnesota. While other retailers, such as Total Wine & More, already sell cannabis beverages, Target is the first big-box player to explore the THC beverage market.",
      "\"At Target, we're always exploring new ways to meet our guests' evolving preferences and needs,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "Whitney Economics estimates there are 500 to 750 brands marketing cannabis drinks. Of those, roughly 30 are sizable labels with national distribution, while the rest are regional and local brands, according to Diana Eberlein, chair of the Coalition for Adult Beverage Alternatives Retailers, a group that represents stakeholders in the hemp and alcohol industries.",
      "Better-known names in the space include Cycling Frog, which makes THC seltzers and edibles; Cann, which markets itself as a \"social beverage\"; and Nowadays, which employs the motto \"the future of drinking is here.\"",
      "Mainstream alcohol brands are also testing the waters. Beer makers Lagunitas Brewing and Pabst have come up with their own THC-infused beverages.",
      "Whitney and Eberlein said the cannabis drink sector is growing most rapidly among women in their 30s and early 40s who are looking for more accessible, and less caloric, alternatives to alcoholic beverages.",
      "\"They still want to have a beverage, but they don't want the high amount of calories. They don't want the alcohol, they don't want the sugar, and they don't want to have a hangover the next morning,\" Whitney said. \"They're replacing their evening glass of wine with THC beverages.\""

    "summary": "A new lawsuit alleges Bank of America profited from its dealings with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "story": [
      "Bank of America was sued Wednesday over its alleged financial ties with Jeffrey Epstein, with the lawsuit claiming the financial giant facilitated and also benefited from his alleged sex trafficking venture.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in federal court on behalf of a Jane Doe, alleges Epstein committed his crimes \"through access to funding and financial support from both individuals and institutions, including Bank of America.\" Epstein died in 2019 in jail while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges.",
      "\"Egregiously, Bank of America had a plethora of information regarding Epstein's sex trafficking operation but chose profit over protecting the victims,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Bank of America said it has no immediate comment on the lawsuit.",
      "The lawsuit comes after Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland and the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, opened an investigation into four large banks, including Bank of America, over their business relationship with Epstein. The probe is seeking more information about roughly $1.5 billion in financial transactions handled by the banks on behalf of Epstein.",
      "Suspicious activity?",
      "Jane Doe was living in Russia when she met Epstein in 2011, and was sexually abused and trafficked by him until 2019, the lawsuit alleges. It claims Epstein relied on force, threats, fraud and coercion to control her.",
      "In 2013, Epstein's accountant instructed her to open a Bank of America account, where money could be wired, purportedly to generate records for U.S. immigration authorities and to cover her rent, according to the lawsuit. The banking transactions should have raised red flags with the bank, the complaint alleges.",
      "\"A review of Jane Doe's account history will show incredibly alarming and erratic banking behavior, as Epstein, through one of his loyal employees, would utilize Jane Doe's account, often without her knowledge, to conduct business in amounts that were not typical for Jane Doe, and that would have in fact been impossible based on Jane Doe's income or typical pattern of deposit,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Banks are required by law to report suspicious activity in customer accounts to federal authorities in order to flag potential criminal activity, such as money laundering or fraud. The complaint alleges that Bank of America failed to file suspicious activity reports, known as SARs, until after Epstein's death in 2019.",
      "According to the New York Times, Bank of America\u00a0filed two SARs in 2020 related to $170 million in payments made to Epstein by billionaire investor Leon Black. The timing of the SARs was questioned by Raskin in an October 2025 letter to Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan.",
      "\"These SARs not only were untimely \u2014 filed years after the transactions in question \u2014 but Bank of America processed the payments without asking for information as to the nature of the transactions,\" Raskin wrote. \"Financial institutions are often the first line of defense in detecting serious federal crimes, especially the ones that involve significant flows of money like sex trafficking.\"",
      "He added, \"Flagging and detecting Mr. Epstein's suspicious withdrawals may well have stopped his crimes years earlier.\"",
      "The Oct. 15 lawsuit claims that \"Bank of America's failure to timely file SARs about Epstein's sex-trafficking venture, in spite of numerous red flags, was wrongful and purposeful.\"",
      "The complaint also alleges that Epstein would not have been able to expand his illegal operations \"without complicit financial banking institutions that would ignore red flags and assist him in his sex-trafficking scheme.\"",
      "JPMorgan's settlement",
      "In exchange for looking the other way, the suit alleges, Bank of America profited by earning \"interest, commissions, service fees, and other financial benefits directly from its connection with Epstein, Epstein-related entities, and others acting in concert with Epstein.\"",
      "In 2023, JPMorgan Chase reached a\u00a0$290 million settlement with Epstein's victims over allegations the bank overlooked his crimes because of the profits it earned from him. At the time of the settlement, JPMorgan said it regretted its association with Epstein and that it \"would never have continued to do business with him if we believed he was using our bank in any way to help commit heinous crimes.\"",
      "The lawsuit against Bank of America is seeking class-action status on behalf of other women abused by Epstein. The attorney representing Jane Doe is David Boies of law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, who represented Epstein's victims in the settlement with JPMorgan."

      "The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on Wednesday issued a sweeping emergency order directing all federal agencies to immediately patch critical vulnerabilities in certain devices and software made by F5, a technology vendor, after confirming a nation-state cyber actor gained unauthorized access to F5's source code.",
      "CISA \u2014 a part of the Department of Homeland Security which manages risks to the U.S.'s cyber and physical infrastructure \u2014 issued\u00a0Emergency Directive 26-01\u00a0following the company's disclosure that a foreign threat actor had maintained long-term, persistent access to its internal development and engineering environments using source code.",
      "Officials warned that attackers could exploit the vulnerabilities to steal credentials, move laterally through networks, and potentially take full control of targeted systems. F5 said they first discovered the attack in August but did not disclose exactly when it began.",
      "\"This directive addresses an imminent risk,\" said Nick Anderson, CISA's Executive Assistant Director for Cybersecurity, during a news briefing Wednesday. \"A nation-state actor could exploit these flaws to gain unauthorized access to embedded credentials and API keys. That's an unacceptable risk to federal networks.\"",
      "F5 is a publicly traded American technology company headquartered in Seattle, Washington.",
      "Justice Department delayed breach announcement",
      "Earlier Wednesday, F5 disclosed the breach in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "In the SEC 8-K report, F5 said the Justice Department on Sept. 12 \"determined that a delay in public disclosure was warranted.\" It's one of the first times a company has publicly acknowledged DOJ intervention under the SEC's\u00a0cybersecurity disclosure rules.",
      "The rules were adopted in July 2023 and require companies to report cybersecurity incidents within four business days of determining that a material event has occurred.",
      "F5 CEO Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou signed the filing, which said the company learned of the attack on Aug. 9 and launched an investigation alongside cybersecurity firms CrowdStrike, Mandiant, and others, with assistance from federal law enforcement and unnamed \"government partners.\"",
      "\"During the course of its investigation, the Company determined that the threat actor maintained long-term, persistent access to certain F5 systems, including the BIG-IP product development environment and engineering knowledge management platform,\" F5 wrote in its filing.",

      "The federal agencies need to evaluate if their networks are accessible from the public internet, and apply newly released updates from F5 by Oct. 22, the emergency order said. They must also complete scoping reports identifying affected devices by Oct. 29.",
      "There are currently thousands of F5 devices in use across federal networks, Anderson told CBS News. The cybersecurity agency said it expects to know more about the scope of exposure by the end of the month.",
      "CISA Acting Director Madhu Gottumukkala said in a statement that the agency remains \"steadfast\" in its mission to defend U.S. networks, even amid the ongoing government shutdown and the lapse of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015.",
      "\"The alarming ease with which these vulnerabilities can be exploited demands immediate and decisive action,\" Gottumukkala said. \"These same risks extend beyond federal systems \u2014 to any organization using this technology.\"",
      "No confirmed compromises yet, but broader campaign underway",
      "Anderson confirmed that CISA is not aware of any current data breaches within federal agencies, though the directive is designed to uncover any potential compromises. He said the campaign appears to be part of a broader nation-state effort targeting elements of the U.S. technology supply chain, not just one vendor.",
      "\"The broader goal here is persistent access \u2014 to gather intelligence, hold infrastructure hostage, or position themselves for future attacks,\" Anderson told CBS News during Wednesday's briefing.",
      "CISA declined to name the country behind the attack, citing ongoing investigations.",
      "\"The U.S. government is not making a public attribution at this time,\" said Marcy McCarthy, CISA's Director of Public Affairs.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the Head of Threat Intelligence for Unit 42, a team of cybersecurity experts and researchers at Palo Alto Networks, said the theft of F5 BIG-IP source code is \"significant, as it potentially facilitates rapid exploitation of vulnerabilities.\"",
      "\"Generally, if an attacker steals source code, it takes time to find exploitable issues,\" said Unit 42 Chief Technology Officer Michael Sikorski. \"In this case, they also stole information on undisclosed vulnerabilities that F5 was actively working to patch. This provides the ability for threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities that have no public patch, potentially increasing speed to exploit creation.\"",
      "Working through the government shutdown",
      "Pressed on the government's ability to respond amid furloughs and staffing reductions at CISA, Anderson acknowledged the agency's challenges but said it remains operational.",
      "\"We're sustaining essential functions and providing timely guidance like this to mitigate risk,\" he said. \"This is core mission work for CISA \u2014 exactly what we should be doing.\"",
      "Anderson also said the lapse of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, a law that had governed federal-private sector cyber information sharing before sunsetting, did not delay coordination with F5 or impact the agency's response.",
      "While the directive applies only to federal agencies, CISA is strongly urging state, local, and private sector organizations using F5 technologies to follow the same patching and mitigation steps. F5's products, including its BIG-IP line, are widely used in both government and commercial networks to manage internet traffic and security."

    "summary": "The Supreme Court heard arguments on whether Louisiana's intentional creation of a second majority-Black district violates the 14th and 15th Amendments.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Members of the Supreme Court's conservative majority appeared open Wednesday to raising the bar for successfully challenging voting maps under a key pillar of the Voting Rights Act, a decision that would weaken the landmark law and limit the consideration of race in the drawing of congressional districts.",
      "The high court appeared sharply divided in the\u00a0long-running legal fight over Louisiana's congressional map, which was before the justices for a second time Wednesday. The high court first heard arguments in March over whether Louisiana lawmakers relied too much on race when it crafted new House district lines last year. But the justices declined to issue a decision then, and in August, it posed a new question for consideration: Whether state lawmakers' intentional drawing of a second majority-minority district \u2014 which was undertaken to remedy a likely violation of Section 2 \u2014 runs afoul of the 14th and 15th Amendments.",
      "The dispute is likely to have significant ramifications not just for political representation in Louisiana, but also for its potential to upend Section 2, which has become a crucial tool in recent years for minority voters seeking to ensure they have equal opportunity to elect their preferred candidates.",
      "Following more than two hours of oral argument, it appears that Louisiana's current congressional map, which includes four majority-White districts and two majority-Black districts, will not stand. But less clear is how far the Supreme Court's conservative majority will go with a decision.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh's votes in the case are key, as they joined with the three liberal justices two years ago to reaffirm Section 2 and the framework, in place since 1986, for proving vote dilution under the civil rights law. During the arguments, Kavanaugh seemed open to the Trump administration's position, which calls for tightening the standards for proving a violation of Section 2.",
      "Kavanaugh called part of their proposed new standard an \"innovation.\" But he repeatedly pressed lawyers for both sides on a possible end-point for race-based remedies for Section 2 violations, which has involved the drawing of majority-minority districts. In the 2023 case, Kavanaugh wrote in a concurring opinion that \"the authority to conduct race-based redistricting cannot extend indefinitely into the future.\" On Wednesday, he probed whether\u00a0there should be a time limit as to \"the particular application of the statute that entails the intentional, deliberate use of race to sort people.\"",
      "But he also appeared uncomfortable with the use of race in redistricting, quoting from a 1994 concurring opinion by then-Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote, \"the sorting of persons with an intent to divide by reason of race raises the most serious constitutional questions.\"",
      "Justice Amy Coney Barrett clarified during the proceedings that the argument pressed by the Justice Department would mark a \"modification\" of the preconditions used in vote-dilution cases since 1986.",
      "But Justice Sonia Sotomayor argued that under the framework proposed by the Justice Department, \"the bottom line is just get rid of Section 2,\" and Janai Nelson, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, said the Trump administration's proposal would \"swallow Section 2 whole.\"",
      "When the Supreme Court considered Louisiana's map in March, it originally focused on a more narrow set of issues about the House district lines. But after agreeing to hear the case again, it asked Louisiana officials and voters involved in the challenge to address whether race-based redistricting comports with the Constitution.",
      "That new question upped the stakes of the case, as Republicans in Louisiana urge the Supreme Court to forbid the consideration of race in the drawing of voting lines. Benjamin Aguinaga, Louisiana's solicitor general, told the justices that race-based redistricting is \"fundamentally contrary to our Constitution.\" A decision in the state's favor could erode Section 2 and deal another blow to the landmark voting rights law more than 10 years after the Supreme Court gutted one of its other provisions.",
      "The legal fight over Louisiana's congressional map dates back to 2022, when GOP lawmakers in the state drew new House district lines after the 2020 Census. That map consisted of five majority-White districts and one majority-Black district. Nearly one-third of Louisiana's population is Black, according to Census data.",
      "A group of African American voters challenged the map as a violation of Section 2 because it diluted Black voting strength, they argued. A judge in Baton Rouge agreed, finding the map deprived Black voters of the chance to elect their preferred candidate, and she ordered the state to put a remedial map in place with a second majority-minority congressional district.",
      "The new plan adopted by the Louisiana legislature in 2024 reconfigured the state's 6th Congressional District, which state lawmakers said was in an effort to bring it into compliance with the Voting Rights Act. The new District 6 has a Black voting-age population of roughly 51% and stretches across the state from Shreveport, in Louisiana's northwest corner, to Baton Rouge, in the southeast. Congressman Cleo Fields, a Democrat who is Black, was elected to represent the district last November.",
      "State lawmakers said they had a political goal in mind, too, when recrafting the voting boundaries: to protect key Republican incumbents in the House, namely House Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Rep. Julia Letlow, who sits on the powerful Appropriations panel.",
      "But after the new map was adopted, a group of 12 self-described \"non-African-American\" voters challenged the boundaries, alleging the new District 6 was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. A divided panel of three judges in Shreveport sided with the voters and found that the state legislature relied too much on race when it crafted the new map.",
      "The case landed before the Supreme Court in its last term, and Louisiana Republicans joined with Black voters and voting rights groups in urging the justices to leave the new congressional map in place. But with the case set to be reargued, and the focus now on the constitutionality of race-based redistricting, state GOP lawmakers are no longer defending their district lines.",
      "Instead, state officials are arguing that the there should be \"zero tolerance for any consideration of race.\"",
      "\"[R]ace-based redistricting mandated by Section 2 is unconstitutional because it violates basic equal protection principles: It uses race as a stereotype, uses race as a negative, and has no logical end point,\" Louisiana Attorney General Elizabeth Murrill, a Republican, wrote in a\u00a0filing. \"Accordingly, Section 2 is unconstitutional insofar as it requires race-based redistricting. \"",
      "The Trump administration is backing Louisiana and the \"non-African-American\" voters in the case and has urged the Supreme Court to tighten the standards for proving unlawful vote dilution under Section 2. The framework in place since 1986 requires plaintiffs to show racial polarization in voting, in addition to other preconditions.",
      "\"Too often, Section 2 is deployed as a form of electoral race-based affirmative action to undo a State's constitutional pursuit of political ends. That misuse of Section 2 is unconstitutional,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing.",
      "But lawyers for the voters who challenged the initial district lines, which were then redrawn to include a second majority-Black district, argue the new map largely prioritized Republicans' political goals of protecting key incumbents. Any consideration of race, they said, was limited and driven by a compelling interest in addressing a violation of the Voting Rights Act.",
      "Nelson, who argued on behalf of Black voters defending the current map, warned that if the Supreme Court were to side with Louisiana and the White voters, it would be a \"staggering reversal of precedent that would throw maps across the country into chaos.\"",
      "She told the justices that if Louisiana's current map is \"unsatisfactory,\" they should send the case back to the lower courts to adopt another map that addresses the Section 2 violations and satisfies the Constitution.",
      "\"[T]he notion that the sun has set on the need for race-conscious remedial redistricting for identified instances of racial vote dilution is contrary to both the fact of ongoing discrimination in Louisiana and the text and purpose of [Section 2] as it was amended in 1982 and has been consistently interpreted by this Court ever since,\" lawyers for the Black Louisianans wrote in a filing.",
      "They warned that removing Section 2's protections for minority voters in Louisiana \"will not end discrimination there or lead to a race-blind society, but it may well lead to a severe decrease in minority representation at all levels of government in many parts of the country.\"",
      "Without the provision, \"jurisdictions could simply eliminate minority opportunity districts even where they remain necessary for voters of color to have any opportunity to elect candidates of choice, wiping out minority representation and re-segregating legislatures, city councils, and school boards \u2014 as some have recently attempted to do,\" lawyers wrote.",
      "In response to questioning from Kavanaugh about an end-point for race-based redistricting, Nelson said there's no precedent to suggest that a statute must dissolve on its own because race is part of the remedy. And she argued that the nondiscrimination element of the 15th Amendment is \"a permanent right, and so should be the protection that Section 2 affords.\"",
      "Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson suggested that Nelson was saying that Section 2 is itself not a remedy that should have an end point, but was instead more of a mechanism \u2014 a kind of \"check-in\" on \"where we might need to do work.\" She compared it to a \"tape measure\" that \"doesn't need a life cycle.\" Nelson agreed and noted that the number of successful challenges to maps under Section 2 cases have fallen in the last decade.",
      "Justice Samuel Alito asked Nelson about the differences between racial voting and partisan voting. If drawing districts to protect incumbents is reasonable, isn't seeking partisan advantage something that legislatures can seek? he asked.",
      "No, Nelson replied, not under the 14th and 15th Amendments. Redistricting on a partisan basis, she said can't come \"at the cost of the equal protection principle.\"",
      "Alito suggested that racially polarized voting could easily be identified through statistical analysis, and it could be seen whether White Democrats vote for Black Democrats at a lower rate, for instance.",
      "Nelson told him that White Democrats were not voting for Black candidates \u2014 whether they were Democrats or not. She said there was no question that even if there is some correlation, that race was the driving factor.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch repeatedly suggested allowing race to be taken into account during the drawing of district lines is a way to \"intentionally discriminate.\"",
      "\"Is it acceptable under Section 2 as, as you understand it, given our precedents, for a court to intentionally discriminate in a remedial map on the basis of race?\" he asked Nelson. \"One argument is often, well, once you've found a Section 2 violation, you've got a compelling interest to go ahead and discriminate on the basis of race in your remedial map. And I'm just wondering, do you endorse that view or do you reject that view?\"",
      "The Supreme Court is re-hearing the case involving Louisiana's map just over two years after it upheld Section 2 and reaffirmed the framework for proving vote dilution set out in the 1986 ruling. The high court split 5-4 in that 2023 case, which involved a challenge to Alabama's congressional map, with Roberts and Kavanaugh joining the three liberal justices in the majority.",
      "The two justices also voted to outlaw the use of race as a factor in college admissions, a decision that came down in the same term as the Alabama voting rights dispute.",
      "Roberts, in particular, has long denounced racial classifications. In a 2006 concurring opinion, the chief justice wrote, \"it is a sordid business, this divvying us up by race.\" He also authored the 2013 majority opinion that dismantled Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, writing, \"our country has changed, and while any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions.\"",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June or early July."

    "published": "Wed, 15 Oct 2025 15:38:10 -0400",
    "summary": "The U.S. population of people over 65 is expected to surge by 40% over the next 25 years, but many aren't prepared for longevity, a new study says.",
    "story": [
      "America's population of seniors is expected to surge by 40% over the next 25 years \u2014 a shift that could spark a crisis of aging, as most people remain unprepared for longer lives, according to new research from the MIT AgeLab and insurance company John Hancock.",
      "Americans are lagging in readiness to handle the demands of greater longevity, ranging from managing the cost of a longer retirement to maintaining their health in old age, according to the inaugural Longevity Preparedness Index, or LPI, from the MIT AgeLab, a research institute focusing on improving the quality of life for older people, and John Hancock.",
      "The problem goes well beyond saving for retirement \u2014 another area where Americans are known to fall short \u2014 and touches nearly every aspect of aging, from building community in later life to preparing for care when people can no longer look after themselves. Some people may fail to plan simply because they underestimate their own longevity, with\u00a0earlier research by Stanford University retirement expert Annamaria Lusardi finding that Americans generally believe they'll die younger than statistics predict.",
      "\"Believe it or not, longevity is quite new \u2014 we've always had older people, but never this many older people living this long,\" Joe Coughlin, founder and director of the MIT AgeLab, told CBS News. \"We can't look to our parents, saying 'This is how they did it.'\"",
      "Preparing for a long old age isn't all about money, although that remains an important part of retirement readiness, said Brooks Tingle, CEO of John Hancock, told CBS. While Americans are living longer, they're spending more years in poorer health, which raises additional issues around preparing for longer retirements than prior generations, he noted.",
      "A 65-year-old woman has a 40% chance of living to age 90, while men the same age have a 30% chance of reaching that age, according to Lusardi's research.",
      "The study analyzed eight aspects of longevity preparedness:",
      "Social connection: Relationships with family, friends and community.Finance: Having enough saved for retirement and old age.\u00a0Daily activities: Keeping busy with meaningful daily activities.\u00a0Care: Identifying who will care for you if you need assistance, understanding the costs of care and having advance directives in place.\u00a0Home: Modifying your home to prolong independence in old age.\u00a0Community: Access to health care, stores, recreation and transportation.\u00a0Health: Developing positive physical, mental, and cognitive behavioral habits to maintain health as you age.Life transitions: Preparing for major changes like retirement, the death of a loved one and more.",
      "Social connection: Relationships with family, friends and community.",
      "Finance: Having enough saved for retirement and old age.",
      "Daily activities: Keeping busy with meaningful daily activities.",
      "Care: Identifying who will care for you if you need assistance, understanding the costs of care and having advance directives in place.",
      "Home: Modifying your home to prolong independence in old age.",
      "Community: Access to health care, stores, recreation and transportation.",
      "Health: Developing positive physical, mental, and cognitive behavioral habits to maintain health as you age.",
      "Life transitions: Preparing for major changes like retirement, the death of a loved one and more.",
      "U.S. adults scored an average of 60 out of 100 across the eight areas, which MIT and John Hancock said signifies that Americans' general longevity preparedness is low.",
      "\"Preparedness is, yes, about saving money, but really it's practically being aware of other things you'll have to do, like 'What should I do, who am I going to live with,'\" Coughlin said. \"Your Zip code is probably your bigger predictor of quality of life, not your 401(k).\"",
      "Care emerged as Americans' weakest area of preparedness, with an average score of 42 out of 100 on the LPI. The strongest domain was community, where people scored 70, suggesting greater readiness for maintaining access to stores, health care and recreation as they age.",
      "The price of long-term care, such as assisted living facilities, can easily cost $6,000 per month or more, placing it out of reach for many Americans. But smaller, less costly steps can also make a difference, such as identifying friends or family members who could step in to help if you ever need extra support, Tingle noted.",
      "\"It's not just, 'Will I need intensive care?' but 'Who is going to change the lightbulb for me when I'm 91?,'\" Tingle said. \"A big takeaway is just to start these conversations.\"",
      "He added, \"Most families don't ever talk about these things.\"",
      "To be sure, saving for retirement can ease many of these issues, ranging from having the resources to pay for long-term care to modifying your home with grab bars and other additions that can prolong independent living. On average, Americans scored a 64 for financial preparedness, but the study found a large gap between those with few assets and people with wealth.",
      "Those with less than $50,000 in investible assets had an overall longevity preparedness score of 56, while those with more than $3 million in assets scored 65, the survey found. People with financial advisers scored a 65, while those without ranked 7 points lower, it noted.",
      "\"Those who had financial advisers had better scores \u2014 of course they did better. The better financial advisers don't just advise you on your wealth, they help you anticipate what will come tomorrow,\" Coughlin noted. \"You have someone who is asking you to think about what those future plans are.\"",
      "He added, \"Most of us are hacking longevity, and we figure it out day after day.\" But he said he hopes the LPI will \"change the cultural narrative\" about aging by shifting the conversation beyond money to include how people can plan how to live and find purpose in their later years."

    "story": [
      "President Trump's administration for now must stop firing workers during the government shutdown, a federal judge ordered on Wednesday.",
      "U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco said the cuts appeared to be politically motivated and were being carried out without much thought.",
      "\"It's very much ready, fire, aim on most of these programs, and it has a human cost,\" she said. \"It's a human cost that cannot be tolerated.\"",
      "She granted a temporary restraining order blocking the job cuts, saying she believed the evidence would ultimately show the cuts were illegal and in excess of authority.",
      "The judge's decision came after federal agencies on Friday started issuing layoff notices aimed at reducing the size of the federal government. The layoff notices are part of an effort by the Trump administration to exert more pressure on Democratic lawmakers as the government shutdown continues. Russell Vought, the head of the White House Office of Management and Budget,\u00a0said earlier Wednesday that the number of layoffs could reach more than 10,000.",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees and other federal labor unions had asked Illston to block the administration from issuing new layoff notices and implementing those that were already sent out. The unions said the firings were an abuse of power designed to punish workers and pressure Congress.",
      "Illston's order came as the shutdown, which started Oct. 1, entered its third week. Democratic lawmakers are demanding that any deal to reopen the federal government address their health care demands. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson predicted the shutdown may become the longest in history, saying he \"won't negotiate\" with Democrats until they hit pause on those demands and reopen.",
      "Democrats have demanded that health care subsidies, first put in place in 2021 and extended a year later, be extended again. They also want any government funding bill to reverse the Medicaid cuts in Mr. Trump's tax break and spending cut bill passed this summer.",
      "The Trump administration has been paying the military and pursuing its crackdown on immigration while slashing jobs in health and education, including in special education and after-school programs. Mr. Trump said programs favored by Democrats are being targeted and \"they're never going to come back, in many cases.\"",
      "In a court filing, the administration initially said it planned to fire more than 4,100 employees across eight agencies, but Vought said that number was a \"snapshot\" that was likely to grow.",
      "The unions said the layoff notices are an illegal attempt at political pressure and retribution and are based on the false premise that a temporary funding lapse eliminates Congress' authorization of agency programs.",
      "The government said the district court lacks jurisdiction to hear employment decisions made by federal agencies."

      "In an interview with former federal prosecutor Andrew Weissman at the University College London, Smith said, \"The apolitical prosecutors who analyzed this said there wasn't a case, and so they brought somebody in who had never been a criminal prosecutor on days' notice to secure an indictment a day before the statute of limitations ended.\"",
      "Smith, who investigated and prosecuted President Trump before his reelection, accused Attorney General Pam Bondi of being \"driven to achieve certain outcomes, no matter what,\" particularly in the case against Comey, who is accused of lying to Congress.",
      "Smith led the Justice Department probes of Mr. Trump related to his conduct after the 2020 presidential election, and to his handling of classified records after his first term ended. The cases both resulted in criminal charges against Mr. Trump, and he pleaded not guilty to all charges and denied wrongdoing.",
      "The interview with Weissman, was posted online Tuesday but recorded on Oct. 8, before New York Attorney General Letitia James was also indicted for mortgage fraud by the same U.S. attorney's office that brought charges against Comey in late September.",
      "On the Justice Department's decision to direct federal prosecutors to drop their corruption case against New York Mayor Eric Adams in exchange for his cooperation with the administration's immigration policies, Smith said, \"Nothing like it has ever happened that I've ever heard of.\"",

      "The former special counsel also defended his investigations into Mr. Trump and denied any suggestion that they had been driven by partisan politics.",
      "\"The idea that politics played a role in who worked on that case or who got chosen [to work on the case] is ludicrous,\" Smith said, noting that his entire team of investigators and staff had been fired by the Trump administration.",
      "\"Everybody who worked on my team was fired, not just the lawyers, but the administrative staff as well,\" Smith said, adding that hundreds of Justice Department attorneys and staff have left because they are \"being asked to do things that they think are wrong, and because they're not political people, they're not going to do them.\"",
      "In August, the Office of the Special Counsel \u2014 which is not affiliated with Smith's former position \u2014 launched an ethics probe into his handling of the investigations. His attorneys say there's no basis for the investigation.",
      "Smith's two cases against Mr. Trump were ultimately closed last year after he won the presidential election because under Justice Department policy, sitting presidents are not prosecuted. Smith left the Justice Department shortly afterwards."

      "Shockley was convicted of first-degree murder for fatally shooting a Missouri state trooper in 2005, court records show. Shockley had maintained his innocence for the last 20 years, as his lawyers argued in multiple rounds of appeals that their client did not receive a fair trial or sentencing, claims that the state repeatedly refuted.",
      "Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe on Monday announced his decision to reject Shockley's plea to stay the execution, allowing the corrections department to proceed as planned with his lethal injection at the state prison in Bonne Terre.",
      "\"Mr. Shockley has received every legal protection afforded to him under the Missouri and United States Constitutions, and his conviction and sentence will remain for his brutal and deliberate crime,\" said Kehoe in the announcement. \"The State of Missouri has\u2014and will continue to\u2014pursue justice to the fullest extent of the law. Carrying out Lance Shockley's sentence is evidence of our commitment to the pursuit of justice.\"",
      "A jury unanimously convicted Shockley in the death of Missouri State Highway Patrol Sgt. Carl Graham, who was killed at his home on March 20, 2005, according to court records. Prosecutors had said during Shockley's trial that before Graham's murder, the patrolman was investigating Shockley for manslaughter, in connection with a car accident that took place in November 2004 and resulted in the death of a passenger, who was Shockley's friend, the records said.",
      "Prosecutors said Shockley murdered Graham in an effort to stop his investigation into the wreck. Prosecutors alleged he drove to the patrolman's house, waited for Graham to return home, and, as he was exiting his vehicle, shot the state trooper multiple times before leaving the scene.",
      "The prosecution said Shockley had borrowed a red Pontiac Grand Am from his grandmother on the day of the murder, and witnesses reported seeing a red car parked near Graham's home around the time it happened, according to court records. They also said bullet fragments found at the property of Shockley's uncle matched those recovered at the scene of the shooting.",
      "But Shockley's attorneys have argued the state's case against him relied predominantly on circumstantial evidence. They also say the state failed to conduct DNA testing on \"numerous pieces of critical evidence\" found at the site of Graham's murder.",
      "\"From the beginning, this case has suffered from a failure of due diligence,\" said Jeremy Weis, one of Shockley's attorneys, in a July statement released through a website advocating for his client's clemency.",
      "\"There are significant issues with the prosecution's timeline. Several other viable suspects were overlooked and to this day, numerous pieces of critical evidence, up to 16 items, have never been tested for DNA,\" Weis' statement continued. \"These items could hold the key to the truth to what really happened on March 20, 2005. Despite these facts, the court denied our motion to conduct DNA testing.\"",
      "Although jurors convicted Shockley in Graham's murder, they could not agree on whether to sentence him to life in prison or impose capital punishment, court records show. Because of the deadlock, a trial court judge presiding over Shockley's case decided the sentence, and sentenced him to death.",
      "Missouri and Indiana are the only two states in the U.S. where a judge can impose a death sentence in situations where the jury deadlocks on sentencing, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit organization that shares data and other resources about capital punishment but does not take a position on the issue."

    "summary": "Citing the shutdown, the Social Security Administration postponed its announcement of the annual payment bump beneficiaries will receive in 2026.",
    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration's annual announcement setting next year's cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, will be delayed because of the\u00a0government shutdown, the agency said.",
      "Each year, the Social Security Administration adjusts benefits for its 75 million recipients based on recent inflation data, which ensures that seniors, disabled Americans and other beneficiaries don't lose purchasing power as prices rise.",
      "Social Security had planned to announce the new COLA on Oct. 15, the same day the Labor Department was scheduled to release September Consumer Price Index data, a key measure of inflation. The COLA is determined by inflation figures for the third quarter, which covers July through September.",
      "With much of the government's economic data on hold until Congress approves federal funding, the Bureau of Labor Statistics now plans to release its latest CPI figures on Oct. 24, about nine days later than planned. The Social Security Administration told CBS News it plans to issue its COLA announcement that same day.",
      "\"The Bureau of Labor Statistics has announced they will issue the September 2025 Consumer Price Index on October 24,\" the Social Security Administration said in an Oct. 14 email. \"The Social Security Administration will use this release to generate and announce the 2026 cost-of-living adjustment on October 24 as well.\"",
      "The new COLA will take effect starting Jan. 1, 2026, without any delays due to the ongoing shutdown, the agency added.",
      "How much of a living adjustment?",
      "According to an estimate published last month by the Senior Citizens League, the annual COLA for 2026 could be around 2.7%, slightly higher than the 2.5% increase beneficiaries\u00a0received\u00a0in 2025.",
      "The League, an advocacy group for older Americans, based its most recent projection on\u00a0August inflation data\u00a0from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Because the SSA will also include September inflation data in its COLA rate, that number could change when it's announced later this month.",
      "AARP, another advocacy group for older people, expects the 2026 COLA to range from 2.6% to 2.9%. A 2.7% boost in benefits would lift the average monthly payment for retired workers by $54, from $2,008 to $2,062.",
      "Where is inflation now?",
      "The September CPI is forecast to rise to an annual rate of 3.1% up from 2.9% in August, according to economists polled by FactSet.",
      "According to economists, inflation is edging higher due partly to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, which have hit imports from across the globe, such as clothing, food, steel and toys. While some businesses stockpiled imported goods earlier this year to avoid raising rising prices, some are now passing the import taxes\u00a0on to their customers.",
      "\"Core goods pressures have started to heat up, marking the beginning of a delayed tariff passthrough,\" RBC economists Michael Reid and Carrie Freestone said in an Oct. 14 report. \"Concerningly, the breadth of inflationary pressures has widened \u2014 45% of CPI basket items are now reporting price growth at or above 3%, compared to roughly two-thirds pre-pandemic.\"",
      "Some retirees could face a financial pinch if prices continues to climb and their 2026 Social Security adjustment fails to keep pace with inflation. The Federal Reserve\u00a0forecasts\u00a0that the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, its favored measure of inflation, will rise to 3.1% this year before receding to 2.6% in 2026."

      "\"Taxpayers should continue to file, deposit and pay federal income taxes as they normally would,\" an IRS spokesman told CBS News. \"The lapse in appropriations does not change federal income tax responsibilities.\"",
      "In a typical year, about 20 million Americans \u2014 about 13% of all taxpayers \u2014 ask the IRS for a tax filing extension, according to agency data. Extensions, which are provided automatically if a taxpayer requests more time, provide an additional six months to prepare and file federal returns.",
      "An extension can help taxpayers who are facing complex tax situations or who need extra time to get their documents prepared for filing. Even so, an extension doesn't get exempt you from paying taxes you owe to the IRS, as the tax agency expects taxpayers to make good on their debts by the regular April 15 deadline.",
      "Most IRS operations are closed during the government shutdown. About half of the agency's workers have been on furlough since Oct. 8, with essential employees continuing to work in areas such as taxpayer services and submission processing, according to Baker Tilly, a tax advisory company.",
      "When is the tax extension deadline?",
      "The deadline to file your taxes if you've received an extension is 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 15, in your local time zone, which means taxpayers should submit their electronic filing before that time on Wednesday.",
      "Can you get an extension past Oct. 15?",
      "Generally, no, according to the IRS.",
      "However, the agency this year has given some state residents more time beyond Oct. 15 to file their federal returns due to natural disasters in their regions.",

Taxpayers in those states have until Nov. 3 to file their federal returns. Kentucky residents and people living in some West Virginia counties also have until Nov. 3 due to February storms that caused severe damage in those areas.",
      "What are the penalties for missing the filing deadline?",
      "If you miss the Oct. 15 filing date to file your tax return, the IRS will charge 5% of the amount due for each month or part of the month that it is late, up to a maximum of 25%.",
      "But the IRS says\u00a0that it might waive the penalty \"if you have a reasonable explanation for filing late,\" and asks taxpayers to attach an explanation for the late filing with their tax return.",

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he's prepared to \"give peace a chance\" \u2014 but \"the way you purchase peace is through strength,\" he told \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Tony Dokoupil Tuesday in Tel Aviv.",
      "Netanyahu spoke to CBS News days after Hamas released the last 20 living hostages taken on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel's military withdrew from parts of the Gaza Strip, in the first phase of a peace plan brokered by President Trump and Arab states. He weighed in on the future of Gaza, how Israel will react if Hamas doesn't disarm and the criticism Israel has faced during the war.",
      "Here are the highlights:",
      "Could Netanyahu regret releasing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the Israeli hostages?",
      "Netanyahu took a longer view when Dokoupil, in reference to the release of almost 2,000 Palestinian detainees and prisoners in exchange for both the living and deceased Israeli hostages, asked him, \"Are you going to regret this decision?\"",
      "He responded that now, Israel is in a \"much better position\" to pursue Hamas if it fails to abide by the peace plan because there are no longer 20 Israeli hostages \"with their head on the chopping block.\"",
      "Dokoupil noted that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind of the Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack, was released in an exchange with Israel in 2011.",
      "Netanyahu acknowledged that the decision to release thousands of people \u2014 including 250 who were serving life sentences in Israeli prisons \u2014 was \"very painful.\"",
      "\"It's true that the worst ones among them we didn't release, but that's small comfort if your son or daughter was murdered by one of these people who were freed,\" he said.",
      "Releasing the Palestinian prisoners came with the understanding that \"there's an enormous price to pay for the commitment that Israel has to bring our hostages or captives held by the enemy,\" Netanyahu said.",
      "Netanyahu claims ratio of civilians to combatants killed in Gaza is \"less than 2 to 1\"",
      "Asked by Dokoupil about the criticism that he's been \"negligent with civilian life in Gaza\" and whether his count of civilian deaths differed from that of the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health, Netanyahu estimated \"20,000 Hamas terrorists\" had been killed by Israel.",
      "He added that that was the number \"if you take away the people who die anyway from disease or old age.\"",
      "Netanyahu argued, \"Take away the double counting and so on, the ratio is less than 2 to 1, which is unbelievable in urban conflict.\" It's a figure he also cited at the United Nations General Assembly in September, telling world leaders, \"The ratio of non-combatant to combatant casualties is less than 2 to 1 in Gaza.\"",
      "The Gaza Ministry of Health says nearly 70,000 Palestinians have been killed since Oct. 7, 2023. Its numbers do not differentiate between civilians and combatants. There are also an estimated 11,000 Gazans still missing, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, presumed to be buried beneath the rubble.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Sunday that he believes roughly 60,000 people have died in Gaza.",
      "Netanyahu says finishing war \"as speedily as possible\" is \"first fix\" to combat young Americans' negative views of Israel",
      "Netanyahu cited the war's duration as one of the reasons that Americans' have an increasingly negative view of Israel. A Pew poll in late September found only 35% of the respondents had a positive opinion of Israel's government, down from 47% in 2022, before the war started. Among Americans under 30, only 13% said the U.S. was providing \"about the right amount of aid to Israel.\"",
      "\"The first fix is to finish the war as speedily as possible, something that I have sought to do against all this contrarian propaganda,\" he said.",
      "Netanyahu also blamed social media for fueling the outrage against Israel, saying that \"lies\" about the nation \"obviously does its damage.\"",
      "\"In the TikTok age and in the television age \u2026 letting wars go on too long is going to cost you precisely what it costs you.\" But he added, \"That can recover at least partly when you finish the war and you move on to what I hope will be the era of peace.\"",
      "Netanyahu on Trump saying he's hard to work with: \"I'm very tough\"",
      "In remarks to the Knesset on Monday, Mr. Trump said Netanyahu is \"not the easiest guy to deal with, but that's what makes him great.\"",
      "Netanyahu appeared to take pride in the characterization.",
      "\"I hope he says that, because I'm very tough on the matters that pertain to my country's future,\" he told Dokoupil. \"My job is to protect the Jewish state and assure the future of the Jewish people.\"",
      "Netanyahu says Hamas must disarm or \"all hell breaks loose\"",
      "\"We agreed to give peace a chance,\" Netanyahu said. But he also maintained that the conditions in Mr. Trump's 20-point peace plan for Gaza are \"very clear:\" Hamas must give up its arms and demilitarize, or \"all hell breaks loose.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has warned that if Hamas does not disarm, \"We will disarm them.\"",
      "\"And it'll happen quickly and perhaps violently,\" the president said. \"But they will disarm.\"",
      "Netanyahu told Dokoupil, \"I hope we can do this peacefully. We're certainly ready to do so.\"",
      "How will the Gaza Strip be governed?",
      "A major unresolved question is who will control the Gaza Strip as Israeli forces withdraw.",
      "Mr. Trump's peace plan calls for control over the territory to be handed over to a technocratic committee made up of Palestinians, overseen by a \"Board of Peace\" that includes Mr. Trump and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Hamas is not supposed to play any role in governance. But beyond that, it's unclear.",
      "Netanyahu said the exact structure for how the territory will be run is unsettled.",
      "Asked by Dokoupil if Blair would run Gaza himself, Netanyahu replied, \"I doubt it.\"",
      "\"But I think that this is a transitional period, and we want to fashion a governance that works, that is not made of people who are committed to our destruction,\" he said. \"We don't want to have the October 7th massacre repeated.\"",
      "Netanyahu has ruled out the idea of allowing an independent Palestinian state, the solution that has been advocated by U.S. allies in Europe and the Arab world.",
      "He told Dokoupil that he supports Palestinians having the power to govern themselves, but would not support a Palestinian state with \"military power.\" \"That sovereign power of security must remain with Israel,\" the prime minister continued.",
      "The Israeli leader said the path forward should involve deradicalization and changes to the Palestinian education system. He also noted that many Gazans are opposed to Hamas or hold the group responsible for inflicting \"horrific misery\" on them.",
      "\"The most important thing in destroying fanaticism is to destroy a certain hope, the hope that the fanaticism will achieve its results,\" Netanyahu said. \"When people know Israel is here to stay, you're not going to destroy the Jewish state, Israel is too strong, that prepares the ground for a change of heart.\""

      "\"Hamas is required to uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the hostages,\" the IDF said in a statement.",

      "While Hamas returned the 20 living hostages by the Monday deadline, the remains of only four deceased Israeli captives were handed over. Hamas transferred an additional four bodies on Tuesday, but the IDF said one of them was not a hostage. That means the remains of at least 19 hostages are still unaccounted for.",
      "A senior U.S. adviser told reporters on a call Wednesday that \"nobody is getting left behind,\" noting they believe there are still many bodies buried under the mountains of rubble across\u00a0 Gaza.

      "\"It would have been almost impossible for Hamas to mobilize, even if they knew where all the 28 bodies were, to mobilize and get them home,\" one adviser said.",

The adviser also said Turkey has offered to help search for and retrieve remains by sending in expert teams with experience rescuing people from the frequent earthquakes in the country.",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a social media post on Monday that Hamas' initial return of only four bodies constituted \"a violation of the agreement\" and added that \"any delay or deliberate avoidance will be considered a gross violation of the agreement and will be responded to accordingly.\"",
      "During negotiations that led to the deal, Hamas representatives said they did not know the location of all the remains of deceased hostages, according to Israeli media reports. President Trump also said in Egypt on Monday that not all of the bodies of the deceased hostages had been found, adding that unidentified parties were still \"working out\" how to locate an unspecified number of remains.",
      "Both the Israeli Hostages and Missing Families Forum, the group that represents the hostage families, and Israel's defense minister have said the entire peace deal should be shelved until all of the hostages' remains are returned by Hamas.",
      "Senior U.S. advisers who spoke to reporters on Wednesday, citing the difficulties in retrieving the remains still in Gaza, urged patience and said they are not at a point where they feel that the agreement has been violated.",
      "Even if these issues are resolved, the 20-point peace plan still faces other considerable hurdles. Hamas wants the Israeli military\u2013which still occupies more than half of Gaza\u2013to withdraw entirely. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Tony Dokoupil on Tuesday that the conditions of the plan \"are very clear \u2014 it's not only that we get the hostages out without getting our military out, but that we would subsequently have both demilitarization and disarmament. They're not the same thing. First, Hamas has to give up its arms. And second, you want to make sure that there are no weapons factories inside Gaza. There's no smuggling of weapons into Gaza.\"",
      "But Hamas has rejected calls to disarm, and, since the start of the ceasefire, CBS News' team in Gaza has seen Hamas back on the streets, still armed, and reportedly confronting rival groups. Mr. Trump on Tuesday warned that if Hamas does not disarm, \"we will disarm them,\" adding: \"It'll happen quickly and perhaps violently. But they will disarm.\"",
      "Netanyahu said he heard Mr. Trump's remarks, paraphrasing them as \"all hell breaks loose.\"",

      "Drone footage captured by photographer Vadim Makhorov shows the large bears getting comfortable in the remains of a Soviet-era weather station on Kolyuchin Island. The tiny island is about seven miles from the coast of the Chukotka Peninsula, which faces Alaska, the Associated Press said. The station was abandoned in the 1990s, after the Soviet Union fell,\u00a0the BBC reported.",

      "\"Bears are no strangers to the feeling of comfort and coziness,\" Makhorov said in the post. \"They perceive homes as shelter.\"",
      "Makharov said that there were about 20 bears in the area, with a bed of walruses near the research station. A birds-eye photo shows several structures in various states of disrepair, with some debris scattered around the area. Other images show the bears resting outside. One bear tried to catch Makhorov's drone as it approached, video showed.",
      "\"Polar bears are extremely dangerous predators, but why do they look so cute and friendly in photos?\" he added in another post.",
      "It's not the first time polar bears have been intrigued by human settlements. In 2016, a group of seven bears besieged five researchers at a weather station on a\u00a0Russian island in the Arctic. A passing ship delivered flares and deployed a helicopter to chase away the animals, which had killed one of the station's two dogs and smashed windows at the research site. The bears were eventually driven away.",
      "Hungry polar bears have also approached residential areas and even airports while searching for food. The animals are considered a protected species and rarely pose a threat to humans, but can be deadly. A worker at a remote government radar site in the Canadian Arctic was\u00a0killed by a pair of polar bears in 2024.",
      "Warming temperatures in the Arctic is changing polar bears' behavior, experts told CBS News. Scientists from Polar Bear International told CBS News that melting sea ice and other environmental changes are keeping bears closer to humans and farther from the seal lairs they typically prey on. The species is also experiencing a loss in genetic diversity as the species inbreeds in a fight to survive. A 2020 study found that polar bears\u00a0could be extinct\u00a0by 2100."

    "summary": "Cross-border fighting between Pakistan and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan reached a fever pitch, with Pakistan carrying out airstrikes in Kabul.",
    "story": [
      "Afghanistan's Taliban rulers announced that a ceasefire with neighboring Pakistan would go into effect Wednesday, after a second eruption of cross-border violence in less than a week that has left dozens of people dead and injured and seen Pakistan carry out unprecedented airstrikes on the Afghan capital, Kabul.",
      "Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a social media post that at least 12 civilians were killed and more than 100 others wounded in cross-border attacks by Pakistani security forces along the border in Afghanistan's southern Kandahar province. An international medical charity said at least five people were killed Wednesday amid explosions in Kabul, but the cause of the blasts could not be immediately confirmed.",
      "Mujahid said Taliban forces responded on Wednesday, killing several \"invading Pakistani soldiers.\"",
      "The United Nations mission in Afghanistan, UNAMA, said Wednesday that it had recorded \"scores of killed and injured Afghan civilians as a result of recent cross-border clashes,\" adding that it was still working \"to determine the full scale of civilian harm.\"",
      "The agency called \"on all parties for an immediate end to hostilities to protect civilians and prevent further loss of life.\"",
      "Mujahid said  that under the ceasefire agreement, the fighting would stop, \"at the request and insistence of the Pakistani side,\" at 5:30 p.m. local time (which was 8:30 a.m. Eastern). He said the Taliban had instructed all of its forces to observe the ceasefire, \"as long as no one commits an act of aggression.\"",
      "Speaking to a Taliban-controlled radio television network, Afghan regional army commander Mullah Gulbuddin Ilyas accused Pakistani soldiers of initiating the latest episode of violence.",
      "In a statement, Pakistan's army rejected \"insinuations that the attack was initiated by Pakistan,\" calling them \"outrageous and blatant lies.\"",
      "\"The Armed Forces stand resolute and fully prepared to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan. All acts of aggression against Pakistan will be responded to with full force,\" the army said.",
      "Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan's de-facto Taliban government have deteriorated since the Taliban retook control of the country in the summer of 2021.",
      "The tension escalated on Oct. 9, when the Pakistani air force carried out its first airstrikes in Kabul. The Taliban said Pakistan's air force struck inside Kabul again on Wednesday, destroying a home, before the ceasefire came into effect. There was no immediate word on casualties from that strike.",
      "The international medical charity Emergency said in a statement Wednesday, however, that a facility it runs in Kabul had admitted at least 40 people with \"shrapnel wounds, blunt force trauma and burns. Ten are in critical condition. Unfortunately, five people were already dead on arrival. The numbers of dead and injured are still provisional.\"",
      "\"We started receiving ambulances filled with wounded people, and we learned that there had been explosions a few kilometres away from our hospital,\" Emergency's country director in Afghanistan, Dejan Panic, said in a statement, adding that women and children were among the wounded.",
      "Emergency did not speculate about what had caused the casualties, and the Taliban also reported the explosion of a fuel tanker in the capital on Wednesday, seemingly unrelated to the Pakistani strikes.",
      "Pakistan said after its first airstrikes that it took the action because the Taliban was providing sanctuary and support for members of Tahrik-e Taliban Pakistani, or the TTP, often referred to as the Pakistani Taliban, inside Afghanistan. The TTP has staged deadly attacks targeting Pakistani security forces and civilians for years.",
      "The Taliban launched a retaliatory offensive against Pakistani positions along the border on Oct. 11, and the violence continued sporadically until Wednesday afternoon."

      "A woman was killed in a grizzly bear attack\u00a0just west of Yellowstone in 2023.",
      "In August, a bear attacked a woman just outside her home in Alaska, leaving her seriously injured. The family said\u00a0she \"simply stepped outside for a jog\" when the bear attacked her, dragging her about 100 feet down a road onto a neighbor's property."

    "published": "Wed, 15 Oct 2025 12:09:04 -0400",
    "summary": "Gaza is in ruins, and the bodies of 21 Israeli hostages are somewhere amid the rubble, along with an estimated 11,000 Gazans.",
    "story": [
      "Israel appeared on Wednesday to be restricting the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza in response to what it says is Hamas' delay in handing over the remains of 21 other hostages still believed to be in the Palestinian territory. Some people fear that may not be possible.",
      "An Israeli security official told CBS News on Wednesday that, \"contrary to reports, the Rafah Crossing did not open today,\" referring to the key portal to Gaza from Egypt, where tons of aid has been stockpiled ready for delivery for weeks.",
      "The official said preparations were ongoing for the crossing to open \"for the exit and entry of Gazans only,\" but not for aid materials. However, the official said an unspecified amount of aid was still being transported into Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing, \"and other crossings after Israeli security inspection.\"",
      "Calls have mounted since the U.S.-brokered ceasefire took effect on Friday for Israel to allow \"full aid\" into Gaza, as specified under the terms of President Trump's 20-point peace plan.",
      "Israeli officials had said that 600 aid trucks per day would be permitted to enter the territory once the U.S.-brokered peace plan took effect. The Israeli government has not given details on the level of aid traffic it has allowed through since then, but there are reports that only half as many trucks have passed into Gaza each day.",
      "Both the Israeli Hostages and Missing Families Forum, the group which represents the hostage families, and Israel's defense minister have said the entire peace deal should be shelved until all of the hostages' remains are returned by Hamas.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces, in multiple statements about the return of hostages since Friday, has said only that \"Hamas is required to make all necessary efforts to return the deceased hostages.\"",
      "Hamas did return four more sets of remains on Tuesday evening, but the Israeli military said Wednesday that one of them was not one of the missing hostages.",
      "That would mean the remains of 21 hostages still lie buried somewhere amid the ruins of Gaza, along with more than 11,000 Gazans who remain missing, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics. Part of the problem is that many of those who oversaw the burial of the deceased hostages are now dead themselves.",
      "\"Many of the Hamas commanders who are responsible for burying these Israeli hostages are no longer alive,\" Israeli hostage negotiator Gershon Baskin told CBS News on Wednesday. \"They were killed by the Israelis.\"",
      "He said there were still \"thousands of Gazans who are unaccounted for, who are believed to be buried underneath the rubble of the buildings Israel bombed,\" too.",
      "During negotiations to seal the Middle East peace deal, Hamas representatives said they did not know the location of all the remains of deceased hostages, according to Israeli media.",
      "On the ground in Gaza, first responders who spent the past two years rushing in to save lives are now searching for the dead. It's a gargantuan task as the Hamas-run territory's government estimates that at least 90% of Gaza's buildings have been damaged or destroyed\u00a0\u2014 and most of the search teams only have rudimentary tools.",
      "\"They are just digging with their hands,\" one man searching for lost loved ones told CBS News' team Gaza. \"We are exhausted from this and don't have the energy anymore.\"",
      "He is just one of thousands of Gazans trying to find missing relatives.",
      "\"It's very likely that there might be Israeli bodies underneath the rubble as well,\" Baskin told CBS News. \"Some of the deceased hostages may never be found, and that's part of the reality, but we have to make sure that Hamas is doing everything possible to do it.\"",
      "\"When I brought this to the attention of [U.S. senior envoy] Mr. Witkoff last night, I told him this is gonna be an issue. The Israelis are already screaming that Hamas is breaching the agreement,\" Baskin said. \"Witkoff said to me, 'we will not allow that to happen.' I know that the Egyptians have taken this very seriously. I understand that there are some Egyptians who entered Gaza today to work with Hamas to try and find the bodies. This has to be resolved, and it has to be resolved quickly.\"",
      "Trump says \"we will disarm\" Hamas, as group reasserts power",
      "The U.S. plan also calls for an interim governing body, headed by President Trump, to administer Gaza for an undefined period before handing over to Palestinian control. But this interim body has yet to be established, and Hamas has already begun to fill the resulting power vacuum.",
      "CBS News has seen armed members of the group back on the streets of Gaza.",
      "Videos have emerged, which CBS News has been unable to verify independently, apparently showing Hamas members executing blindfolded Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israel, in front of crowds of people. There have also been reports of Hamas attacking rival armed groups and gangs.",
      "\"Hamas is killing them because it can,\" Baskin told CBS News. \"Israel has empowered, with weapons and money, gangs of Palestinians who were involved in mostly illegal activities in the past \u2026 and they've empowered them as an alternative to Hamas.\"",
      "President Trump reacted to the videos on Tuesday, saying recently that Hamas \"did take out a couple of gangs, that were very bad gangs, very, very bad \u2026 and that didn't bother me much to be honest with you.\"",
      "\"But we have told them we want to disarm and they will disarm,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And if they don't disarm, we will disarm them, and it'll happen quickly and perhaps violently.\"",
      "Adm. Brad Cooper, the commander of the U.S. military's Central Command, urged Hamas on Wednesday to \"immediately suspend violence and shooting at innocent Palestinian civilians in Gaza \u2014 in both Hamas-held parts of Gaza and those secured by the IDF [Israeli military] behind the Yellow Line.\"",
      "\"This is an historic opportunity for peace. Hamas should seize it by fully standing down, strictly adhering to President Trump's 20-point peace plan, and disarming without delay,\" Cooper said in a statement shared on social media. \"We have conveyed our concerns to the mediators who agreed to work with us to enforce the peace and protect innocent Gaza civilians. We remain highly optimistic for the future of peace in the region.\""

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Coast Guard has seized more than 100,000 pounds of cocaine in the Eastern Pacific Ocean in the past two months, the agency said Tuesday, including narcotics from a suspected drug smuggling boat that was seen capsized in the sea.",
      "The Coast Guard said it has intercepted 34 ships and taken 86 people into custody. The agency has seized an average of 1,600 pounds of cocaine a day, it said. Photos in a news release show multiple seizures, including one that ended with bales of cocaine in the ocean.",
      "The actions are part of Operation Pacific Viper, which accelerated counter-drug operations in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. The Coast Guard has worked with international partners and sent additional assets, including ships, aircraft and tactical teams, to seize boats carrying drugs from Central and South America.",
      "Rear Adm. Jeffrey Novak, deputy commander of U.S. Coast Guard Pacific Area, called the seizures \"a remarkable achievement\" in the news release.",
      "\"When we say the Coast Guard is accelerating counter-narcotics operations, we mean it. Alongside our partners and allies, our maritime fighting force is scouring drug smuggling routes in the Eastern Pacific and dismantling narco-terrorist networks,\" Novak said. \"We are complementing the Coast Guard's unique law enforcement authorities with cutting-edge capabilities to stop the flow of deadly drugs\u202fthat threaten\u202fU.S. communities. As we mark our interdiction of 100,000 pounds, we are already working towards the next milestone.\"",
      "The operations have included the seizure of 8,700 pounds of cocaine from a boat traveling from Panama in early September. Many of the drugs have been offloaded by the Coast Guard in record-breaking amounts in recent weeks. In some instances, the Coast Guard sets the boats transporting the drugs on fire after seizing the narcotics and taking the vessel's occupants into custody. The Coast Guard told CBS News in September that this practice is meant to keep the boats from becoming a hazard to other sailors.",
      "The U.S. has also carried out several drone strikes on boats allegedly carrying drugs. The fifth and most recent strike was carried out on Tuesday, the same day the Coast Guard announced the drug seizure milestone. Six people aboard the boat\u00a0 were killed, according to a post from President Trump on Truth Social. \u00a0In total, 27 people have been killed in the strikes, according to figures released by the Trump administration."

      "\"The only names mentioned are Donald Trump and Tony Blair. Is Tony Blair going to be the president of Gaza?\" asked Dokoupil, referring to the former British leader tapped by Mr. Trump to sit on a transitional \"peace board\" to help administer the enclave and its roughly 2 million inhabitants.",
      "\"I doubt it,\" replied Netanyahu. \"But I think that this is a transitional period and we want to fashion, you know, a governance that works \u2014 that is not made of people who are committed to our destruction. Because if we \u2026 if we put them there, then we just repeat it again and again and again. And we don't want to have the October 7th massacre repeated.\"",
      "Netanyahu acknowledged that while many Gazans, including young men who've endured two years of brutal warfare, may want to continue fighting against Israel, \"Gaza is not uniform.\"",
      "\"There are Gazans who are fighting Hamas and are saying, 'we don't want this anymore' \u2026 a lot of people in Gaza now know that Hamas has brought catastrophic consequences to them because of its fanaticism.\"",
      "\"The most important thing in destroying fanaticism is to destroy a certain hope,\" said Netanyahu. \"The hope that the fanaticism will achieve its results. When people know Israel is here to stay, they're not going to destroy the Jewish state.\"",
      "How best to achieve that ambition remains a topic of intense debate, however.",
      "Netanyahu on the prospect of a two-state solution",
      "The United Nations and many world leaders have long insisted that the only way to secure a lasting peace in the Middle East is to give the Palestinian people something they have not had since the creation of the modern state of Israel almost eight decades ago: An independent state of their own.",
      "Global\u00a0pressure has been building on Israel to accept the creation of a Palestinian state along its borders, a concept long referred to as the two-state solution.",
      "But in recent years, Netanyahu's government has rejected the notion \u2014 and the Trump administration has decisively dropped the U.S. government's long-standing calls for Palestinian statehood.",
      "\"When I talked about it, it wasn't the proposition that people give now,\" Netanyahu told Dokoupil on Tuesday. \"I assume, okay, they're two sovereign states and a sovereign state has, for example, military power, it can make covenants \u2026 The Palestinians should have all the powers in a peaceful day to govern themselves, but they can't have the powers to threaten our survival. That sovereign power of security must remain with Israel.\"",
      "\"Otherwise, the jihadists take over,\" said Netanyahu. \"Iran takes over immediately. And that's what happened every time we vacated territory \u2014 the most extreme fanatics came in.\"",
      "He accepted that ceding some territory to Palestinian authorities, as Israel did in Gaza, did not equate to creating an independent state, but he said it was \"perfectly aligned with the reality\" of circumstances on the ground.",
      "\"It's a reality that if you had Palestinian governance that stopped teaching their kids to destroy the state of Israel \u2026 obviously, if you have that, and they educate them for peace, then I think you can have a different reality,\" said the Israeli leader, adding that it \"could take generations\" to get to that point.",
      "And even if Israel does eventually deem Gaza's leadership and population to be deradicalized, Netanyahu said it would still need to remain \"in control of the military power to prevent our destruction.\""

    "story": [
      "Monday brought tears of joy and of pain in Israel and Gaza, as all of the living Israeli hostages and four of those who died in\u00a0 captivity were handed over by Hamas in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian detainees and prisoners held by Israel. But as the ceasefire brokered by President Trump held on Tuesday, there were a number of unresolved issues testing his plan to turn it into a sustainable peace.",
      "Thousands of desperate Gazans were still waiting for vital humanitarian supplies, and the families of 24 deceased Israeli hostages were still anxiously awaiting the return of their loved ones' remains.",
      "Leaders around the world welcomed Monday's developments as the first step in the U.S. brokered plan. Mr. Trump has said the deal can end not only the two-year war in Gaza, but bring lasting peace to the region after eight decades of conflict and violence.",
      "But there is an enormous amount of work to do, not only in building trust across the Middle East, but to rebuild the coastal Gaza Strip to make it inhabitable for its roughly 2 million Palestinian residents.",
      "Calls to open Gaza's borders for aid to flood in",
      "Mr. Trump's 20-point peace plan said \"full aid\" would \"be immediately sent\" into Gaza as part of the first phase of the deal, but multiple organizations say the flow of aid materials has not ramped up nearly fast enough.",
      "The International Red Cross added its voice Tuesday to the growing chorus of organizations calling for all border crossings into the enclave to be opened immediately to allow in more aid.",
      "\"Not all entry points are open to get humanitarian aid inside Gaza. And that's the main issue right now. And that's what humanitarians, including the ICRC, have been calling for in the last hours, is making sure that because of the huge needs, all entry points can be open,\" Red Cross spokesman Christian Cardon told reporters in Geneva on Tuesday.",
      "Dr. Yahya al-Sarraj, the Mayor of Gaza City, the territory's biggest population center, told CBS News' team in Gaza on Tuesday that the shattered metropolis desperately needs building materials, as well as humanitarian relief and even tents to provide temporary accommodation.",
      "\"Everything is needed here,\" Al-Sarraj, who has recently described himself as politically independent and never as a member of Hamas, told CBS News. \"We need heavy machinery. We need building materials, especially cement \u2026 and all kinds of food for the people to help them counter the starvation that happened during the past two years.\"",

      "\"One of the challenges is the roads are broken. There's ditches. It's hard to drive trucks on those roads,\" said Almadhoun, who also founded the Gaza Soup Kitchen charity. \"I think in the next few days, things will get better. I hope everyone keeps their end of the deal so the Palestinians can catch a break.\"",
      "Remains of deceased hostages yet to be returned",
      "The peace plan called for Hamas to return all hostages, 28 dead and 20 living, but on Monday, Hamas handed over the remains of only four deceased Israeli captives.",
      "The return of the outstanding remains has become a serious sticking point, which could both endanger the ceasefire and progress toward implementing the next phases of Mr. Trump's peace plan.",
      "The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents Israeli hostage families, voiced anger that all of the bodies had not been returned on Monday and called for the suspension of the Israel-Hamas peace agreement \"until every deceased individual is returned.\"",
      "In an open letter to White House Middle East senior envoy Steve Witkoff on Tuesday, the forum called on the U.S. to leave \"no stone unturned in demanding that Hamas fulfil their end of the agreement and bring all of the remaining hostages home.\"",
      "Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz said Monday that Hamas' return of only four bodies, \"constitutes a violation of the agreement,\" in a social media post, adding that \"any delay or deliberate avoidance will be considered a gross violation of the agreement and will be responded to accordingly.\"",
      "During the negotiations that led to the ceasefire, Hamas representatives said they did not know the location of all the remains of deceased hostages, according to Israeli media reports.",
      "Speaking Monday in Egypt, President Trump also said not all of the bodies of the deceased hostages had been found, adding that unidentified parties were still \"working out\" how to locate an unspecified number of remains.",

      "Curry shared that he was having a massage at the time of the stroke and initially wasn't aware that it had occurred. He recalled that he felt \"a little out of sorts\" though he didn't believe that he required medical attention, but his massage therapist insisted on calling 911.",

      "\"I had been very scared when I did not know what was happening to me, because I had no sense of whether tremendous pain was forthcoming,\" Curry wrote. \"But if death comes for me peacefully and I fade gently from light into dark oblivion, why would I be afraid of it? Sometimes, I rather think it would be a comfort.\"",
      "\"I can say that now, because it\u2019s been over a dozen years, which is a sufficient amount of time to be able to reflect back calmly, and perhaps with a healthy dose of disassociation,\" he wrote. \"At the time, if I\u2019m being honest, I was just astonished to be lying there.\"",
      "Tim Curry is pictured attending an event. United States, circa 1990s. (Vinnie Zuffante/Getty Images)",
      "Curry remembered being told that he had experienced a right-sided paralytic stroke. Since the stroke occurred in the right hemisphere of his brain \u2014 the area responsible for motor control on the opposite side \u2014 it resulted in paralysis on the left side of his body.",
      "\"I don't know when the paralysis set in; initially it just felt very strange that the left side of my body had gone numb,\" Curry said.",
      "He wrote that he was transferred two days later to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where his longtime personal assistant and publicist Marcia Hurwitz helped him be admitted under an alias to protect his identity and prevent his stroke from being made public.",
      "\"After regaining consciousness, I could comprehend words but they did not register or settle without effort. Life was exceedingly dull, monotonous, and uncertain for a long while, Curry wrote. \"I was aware of where I was, but it took me a while to fully accept what had happened, as I imagine is the case with many people getting over a stroke and brain surgery.\"",
      "\"My skull had been smashed in to save my life,\" he continued. \"That\u2019s plenty to process. I needed the rest and slept a lot.\"",
      "Curry wrote that he spent months at the hospital before eventually entering a rehabilitation center \"where the real exercises began: to retrieve my ability to speak clearly, to work on smiling and facial expressions, and to try using my hand and adapting to my new normal.\"",
      "\"I was living in a fog. I looked frightful, and I couldn\u2019t speak clearly for ages. That part was exceptionally frustrating, because thoughts were forming again, but articulating them was such a monumental stretch,\" he recalled. \"I felt like there was a massive gulf between my mind and what emerged from my mouth.\"",
      "\"Half sentences here or there would make it, but it took a while \u2014 which amounted to a whole lot of time dwelling in my own head,\" Curry continued. \"Being unable to string together and clearly deliver a sentence was absolute misery for somebody who values words and conversation as much as I do.\"",

      "Curry's stroke was first revealed publicly in May 2013, almost a year after it occurred.

He has been doing great and absolutely can speak and is recovering at this time. He really is doing well.\"",
      "In \"Vagabond,\" Curry noted the secrecy surrounding his stroke and praised Hurwitz for her successful efforts to protect his privacy.",
      "\"Marcia managed to keep my stroke from the press \u2014 not an easy feat anywhere, but especially not in LA, where celebrities are being so closely watched and monitored,\" he wrote. \"I was rather unrecognizable at the time, but it\u2019s still truly remarkable that she succeeded in keeping my condition under wraps for an entire year, giving me the time and space to focus on getting back to myself.\"",
      "\"The Three Musketeers\" star also poked fun at rumors that he had died, writing, \"Contrary to village gossip, I am still very much alive.\"",
      "\"I try to avoid complaining too much. (I prefer doing it just enough.) But I do have the material: as I write this I\u2019m confined to a wheelchair, having never managed to walk again,\" he wrote.",
      "\"Even so, whining is a f---ing bore for everybody involved\u2014and it\u2019s highly unproductive,\" Curry continued. \"I\u2019d rather spend my time focusing on other things.\"",
      "\"The different ways that people cope with pain is quite interesting,\" he added. \"I do not consider it an act of tremendous courage or bravery that I resort to humor in moments of great discomfort. It\u2019s just my go-to. I am sure it\u2019s partially a survival skill I developed a very long time ago, to the extent that humor can be developed.\"",

      "\"It wasn\u2019t something I had practiced before the stroke. I was always a forward-thinker; I never wanted to return to my childhood home, or to the stages, sets, and studios of my past.

      "Road crews may soon get a major assist from artificial intelligence.

This smart material could make costly, disruptive road repairs far more efficient and sustainable.",

      "The system uses a fabric made from flax fibers interwoven with ultra-thin conductive wires. These wires detect minute changes in the asphalt base layer, signaling potential damage before it reaches the surface.",
      "THE ROAD TO PROSPERITY WILL BE PAVED BY\u00a0AUTONOMOUS\u00a0TRUCKING",
      "Fraunhofer researchers test AI sensors that detect road damage beneath the surface.\u00a0 (Fraunhofer Institute)",
      "Once the fabric is laid under the road, it continuously collects data. A connected unit on the roadside stores and transmits this data to an AI system that analyzes it for early warning signs. As vehicles pass over the road, the system measures changes in resistance within the fabric. These changes reveal how the base layer is performing and whether cracks or strain are forming beneath the surface.",
      "Why AI road monitoring matters for future maintenance",
      "Traditional road inspection methods rely on drilling or taking core samples, which are destructive, costly and only provide information for a small section of pavement. This AI-driven system eliminates the need for that kind of invasive testing.",
      "Instead of reacting to surface damage, transportation agencies could predict and prevent deterioration before it becomes expensive to fix. The approach could extend road life, cut down on traffic delays and help governments spend infrastructure funds more efficiently.",

      "The smart flax-fiber fabric measures stress changes in asphalt to spot cracks early. (Fraunhofer Institute)",
      "How AI and sensor data predict road damage early",
      "The real power comes from combining AI algorithms with continuous sensor feedback. Fraunhofer's machine-learning software can forecast how damage will spread, helping engineers prioritize which roads need maintenance first. Data from the sensors is displayed on a web-based dashboard, offering a clear visual of road health for local agencies and planners.",
      "The project, called SenAD2, is currently being tested in an industrial zone in Germany. Early results suggest the system can identify internal damage without disrupting traffic or damaging the road itself.",
      "What this means for you",
      "Smarter road monitoring could lead to fewer potholes, smoother commutes and less taxpayer money wasted on inefficient repairs. If adopted widely, cities could plan maintenance years in advance, avoiding the cycle of patchwork fixes that often make driving a daily headache.",

Recently, a\u00a0father lost $4 billion in Bitcoin to vishing. Though\u00a0AI voice cloning has improved, it\u2019s still flawed. You can spot inconsistencies by verifying the speaker's identity. Ask specific questions that only the real person would know. This can reveal gaps in the scammer's script. The voice, also, at times may sound robotic due to imperfections in voice cloning technology. So the next time, whenever you receive a call that creates a sense of urgency, ask as many questions as you can to verify the identity of the person. You may also consider verifying the claims through the second channel.

      "Fox News' Madison Scarpino reports on the successful Falcon 9 launch and mission.",
      "A Los Angeles-based aerospace startup called Inversion Space has unveiled Arc, its first flagship spacecraft designed to deliver supplies from orbit back to Earth in record time. The reusable reentry vehicle can transport up to 500 pounds of mission-critical cargo to nearly any point on the planet in less than an hour. Founders Justin Fiaschetti and Austin Briggs launched the company in 2021 with a bold vision: to build a space-based logistics network. During an event at the company's factory, they described Arc as the next evolution of global delivery, one that starts in orbit, not on the ground.",

      "How the Arc spacecraft delivers cargo from orbit to Earth",
      "Standing about 8 feet tall and 4 feet wide, Arc is roughly the size of a large tabletop. It's a lifting-body vehicle, meaning it can steer as it reenters the atmosphere. Instead of needing a runway, Arc lands safely under parachutes, using non-toxic propellants that make it safe to handle immediately after landing. The spacecraft features a cross-range of approximately 621 miles, allowing it to target wide landing zones. It can stay in orbit for up to five years, ready to return to Earth when needed. That flexibility means the spacecraft could one day drop off medical supplies, drones or military equipment at hard-to-reach locations.",

      "Why Arc's hypersonic speed could change aerospace testing",
      "Beyond rapid delivery, Arc doubles as a hypersonic testing platform. It can reach speeds over Mach 20, endure extreme heat and survive massive g-forces. Those capabilities have caught the attention of U.S. defense agencies, which are eager to improve hypersonic flight testing. Inversion's participation in the Kratos-led MACH-TB 2.0 program highlights the growing military interest in Arc's reusable design. \"Fully reusable and capable of precise landings for rapid recovery, Arc makes hypersonic testing faster, repeatable, and more affordable,\" the company said.",
      "Arc could deliver mission-critical cargo anywhere on Earth in under an hour. (Inversion Space)",
      "What Inversion learned from its first spacecraft, Ray",
      "Before Arc, Inversion launched a smaller demo craft called Ray on SpaceX's Transporter-12 mission. Ray weighed about 200 pounds and successfully tested propulsion, avionics and solar power systems in orbit. Though a short circuit prevented reentry, it provided valuable data that led to Arc's development. Ray's success convinced the company to push forward with full-scale testing. Inversion has already completed dozens of drop tests and built a full-scale Arc prototype. The startup also partnered with NASA to refine the vehicle's thermal protection system for reentry.",

      "Inversion sees Arc as a bridge between space logistics and national defense. The spacecraft could deliver mission-critical cargo to remote, damaged or denied environments where traditional transport would take days. As Fiaschetti put it, the goal is simple: make a difference the moment it lands. By combining maneuverability, reusability and speed, Arc could reshape both emergency response and battlefield supply chains. It's not just about moving packages, it's about delivering readiness.",

      "Navigation apps have become an essential part of modern life. Whether you are commuting to work, running errands or exploring a new city, relying on accurate directions and real-time traffic updates can make all the difference. Over the past decade, Google Maps, Waze and Apple Maps have emerged as the dominant players in this space, each offering a distinct approach to navigation.",
      "While millions of people rely on these apps daily, choosing the right one can depend on a variety of factors, from interface design to privacy policies.

      "What each app does best",
      "Google Maps is widely regarded as the all-rounder. It combines extensive mapping data with points of interest, public transit information, Street View, Live View AR and detailed business listings. Its versatility makes it a top choice for both daily commuters and travelers.",
      "Google Maps is a great way to explore the world with detailed routes, Street View, and real-time traffic insights. (OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Waze, on the other hand, is designed primarily for drivers. It thrives on community input, offering live updates about traffic jams, road hazards, accidents and even police presence. Since Google owns Waze, many Waze-style real-time alerts have now begun appearing directly inside Google Maps. While Waze still focuses on driving, this integration blurs the lines between the two apps.",
      "Apple Maps\u00a0has made major strides in recent years. Once considered the underdog, it's now a solid choice for iOS users. Its clean interface, privacy-focused design and seamless integration with Siri, CarPlay and Apple Watch make it a convenient pick for those fully in the Apple ecosystem.",
      "INSTAGRAM FRIEND MAP FEATURE SPARKS PRIVACY QUESTIONS",
      "Usability and interface",
      "When it comes to interface, each app approaches design differently.",
      "Google Maps provides a dense but intuitive layout, giving users access to multiple layers of information, including traffic, satellite imagery and public transit routes. Switching between driving, walking, biking and transit is straightforward, and the search functionality is robust, often displaying detailed business profiles, ratings, and hours of operation.",
      "Waze prioritizes active driving support. Its interface is visually bold, with clear alerts for traffic jams, accidents and road hazards submitted by other users. While some may find the screen slightly cluttered, the focus is entirely on driving efficiency, which makes sense given its target audience.",
      "Waze helps to put you on a faster route with live, community-driven alerts that help you dodge traffic jams and road hazards.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Apple Maps offers a minimalist, streamlined interface that emphasizes simplicity. Searching for locations, initiating navigation, and following turn-by-turn instructions is straightforward. The app works seamlessly with iOS features like Siri and CarPlay, providing a smooth and cohesive experience for Apple users.",
      "Navigation accuracy and performance",
      "Accurate routing and timely traffic updates are critical.",
      "Google Maps\u00a0remains the most reliable for precise routing and travel time estimates. It combines AI-enhanced predictive routing with historical and live traffic data to suggest the best route. Its consistency holds strong across urban and rural areas alike.",
      "Waze\u00a0is unmatched for real-time rerouting. Relying heavily on crowd-sourced reports, it often detects slowdowns or hazards before Google Maps does. However, it still struggles when offline or in areas with poor data coverage.",
      "Apple Maps has significantly improved its routing accuracy, especially in cities. Its traffic data is now crowd-sourced from millions of iPhones, processed on-device to protect privacy. In some rural or international regions, though, it can still lag behind Google Maps and Waze.",
      "Apple Maps offers seamless use with your iPhone and CarPlay for smooth and privacy-focused navigation.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Features and ecosystem integration",
      "Beyond basic navigation, each app offers additional tools and integrations.",
      "Google Maps\u00a0offers offline maps, Live View AR navigation, multi-stop routing, EV charger locations and indoor maps for airports and malls. Integration with Gmail, Calendar and Google Assistant creates a seamless travel experience.",
      "Waze\u00a0remains focused on social and driving-specific features. You can report hazards or police sightings and even control Spotify, Audible or podcasts directly from the app without switching screens.",
      "Apple Maps\u00a0leans into privacy and ecosystem benefits. Its \"Look Around\" feature rivals Street View, while EV routing, cycling paths and Siri integration make it ideal for Apple fans. Apple also uses anonymized \"Look Around\" imagery to train its AI models, but with strict privacy safeguards like blurring faces and plates.",
      "YOUR PHONE IS TRACKING YOU EVEN WHEN YOU THINK IT\u2019S NOT",
      "Privacy and data handling",
      "How these apps handle your personal data matters more than ever.",
      "Google Maps\u00a0collects detailed location and usage data to power personalization and advertising. That means better recommendations, but less privacy for users who prefer anonymity.",
      "Waze, also owned by Google, gathers anonymized driving data to enhance community reporting. Its functionality depends on sharing your location in real time, which is necessary for crowd-sourced accuracy.",
      "Apple Maps takes a different approach. It processes most data on-device, uses random identifiers instead of personal accounts and does not associate searches with your Apple ID. That makes it the most privacy-conscious option, though even Apple collects anonymized data for traffic and route improvements.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "There is no single \"best\" navigation app, and the right choice depends on your priorities. Google Maps is ideal if you want a feature-packed, versatile app that works well for a variety of transportation modes and travel scenarios. Its global coverage and rich data make it reliable for everyday use and exploration. Waze is best if your main concern is real-time driving efficiency. Its community-driven traffic alerts and dynamic rerouting help you avoid congestion and save time during daily commutes. Apple Maps suits users deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem who value simplicity, clean design and privacy protections. It may not have as many features as Google Maps or the same real-time edge as Waze, but its seamless integration with iOS makes it convenient.",

      "Ethernet offers direct, wired security without wireless risks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How Ethernet and Wi-Fi differ when it comes to security",
      "Ethernet and Wi-Fi both get you online, but they do it in completely different ways.\u00a0Ethernet\u00a0uses a physical cable that connects your computer directly to the router. Since it is a wired connection, data travels straight through that cable, making it much harder for anyone to intercept it. There is no wireless signal to hijack, no airwaves to eavesdrop on.",
      "Wi-Fi, on the other hand, is built on convenience. It sends your data through the air to and from your router, which is what makes it so easy to connect from anywhere in your home. But that convenience comes with more risk. Anyone within range of your signal could potentially try to break into the network. If your Wi-Fi is protected by a weak password or uses outdated encryption, a skilled attacker might gain access without ever stepping inside your house.",
      "At home, that risk is smaller than in a coffee shop or hotel, but it is not zero. Even a poorly secured smart device on your network can give attackers a way in. Ethernet removes many of those risks simply because it is harder to access a connection that requires physical access to a cable. Check out our steps for setting up a home network like a pro\u00a0here.",
      "DON'T USE YOUR HOME WI-FI BEFORE FIXING CERTAIN SECURITY RISKS",
      "Why one connection might be safer than the other",
      "It is easy to think Ethernet is automatically safer, but that is not the whole story. Your real security depends on how your entire network is set up. For example, a Wi-Fi network with a strong password, up-to-date router firmware, and WPA3 encryption is going to be far more secure than a poorly configured Ethernet setup connected to an outdated router.",
      "There is also the question of who else uses your network. If it is just you and a handful of devices, your risk is low. But if you live in a shared space or run smart home gadgets, that changes the equation. Each device connected to Wi-Fi is a potential entry point. Ethernet reduces the number of devices that can connect, which limits the attack surface.",
      "Ultimately, the connection type is one piece of the puzzle. The bigger factors are how your router is configured, how often you update your software, and how careful you are with what devices you connect.",
      "Wi-Fi brings convenience but also potential exposure to hackers.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6 ways to make your internet safer",
      "Whether you stick with Wi-Fi or switch to Ethernet, there are several practical steps you can take to protect your devices and data. Each step adds an extra layer of security to your network.",
      "IS YOUR HOME WI-FI REALLY SAFE? THINK AGAIN",
      "Choose a long and unique password for your Wi-Fi. Avoid obvious choices like your name, address, or simple sequences. A strong password makes it far harder for attackers to guess or crack your network. A password manager helps you create and store strong, unique passwords for every account, reducing the chances of a hacker gaining access through weak or repeated credentials.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords",
      "Most modern routers support WPA3, which is much more secure than older standards like WPA2. Check your router's settings to enable the latest encryption and ensure your network traffic is harder to intercept.",
      "Router manufacturers regularly release updates that patch security vulnerabilities. Log into your router's admin panel occasionally to check for updates and install them as soon as they are available. This prevents attackers from exploiting known flaws.",
      "10 WAYS TO SECURE YOUR OLDER MAC FROM THREATS AND MALWARE",
      "Regularly check which devices are connected to your network and disconnect anything you no longer use. Each connected device is a potential entry point for attackers, so keeping the list limited reduces your network's exposure.",
      "Even on a secure network, malware can sneak in through downloads, phishing attacks, or compromised websites. A strong antivirus program will detect and block malicious activity, protecting your computer before damage occurs.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Ethernet cables connect to a router as part of a home network setup. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "A virtual private network encrypts your internet traffic, making it unreadable to outsiders. This is especially useful if you ever use Wi-Fi in public or need an extra layer of privacy at home. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.",
      "For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/VPN",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "So, which is safer, Ethernet or Wi-Fi? Ethernet wins in raw security because it eliminates many of the risks that come with wireless connections. But in a well-secured home network, the difference is often smaller than most people think. What matters more is how you manage your devices, passwords, software, and online habits.",

      "Over the past few years, data breaches targeting schools, healthcare providers, and childcare services have been making headlines, exposing sensitive personal information and leaving families vulnerable. Now, a new breach has come to light that targets a nursery chain. Kido, which operates in the U.S., U.K., China and India, has reportedly had sensitive data stolen from thousands of children. Names, photos, addresses, birthdates, parental details and even safeguarding notes and medical records were allegedly accessed by a hacker group called Radiant.",

      "The incident highlights how stolen data threatens not just privacy but also long-term child safety. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about nursery breach",
      "According to reports, the hacker group Radiant claims to have stolen data related to around 8,000 children. To prove possession, they posted samples, including pictures and profiles of ten children, on a darknet website. They then issued a ransom demand, threatening to release more sensitive information unless Kido paid. In addition to targeting the nursery chain directly, Radiant reportedly called some of the children's parents, pressuring them to push Kido into paying the ransom.",
      "FBI WARNS ABOUT NEW EXTORTION SCAM TARGETING SENSITIVE DATA",
      "When questioned about their actions, the group defended their tactics as a form of \"penetration testing\" for which they supposedly deserved compensation. This defense is misleading, as such testing requires explicit permission from the organization being targeted or participation in an official bug bounty program. Without that consent, these actions are illegal and deeply unethical.",
      "Hackers exploited children\u2019s data in the Kido breach, exposing families to serious risks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why is this attack so disturbing?",
      "The Kido breach is alarming for multiple reasons. First, it involves children's data, which is particularly sensitive and legally protected in most countries. Second, the attackers combined traditional data theft with intimidation tactics, reaching out to parents directly. History suggests that once criminals gain access to such information, the attacks can escalate.",
      "Breaches like this highlight how personal and digital security are intertwined. The potential misuse of data extends beyond simple identity theft. It can impact children's safety, family privacy and long-term well-being. With attackers leveraging both the stolen data and psychological pressure on parents, the threat is particularly potent and long-lasting.",

      "7 steps parents can take to protect their child's data",
      "Even though the investigation into the Kido breach is ongoing, parents and schools can take immediate action to protect children's data and reduce the risk of further exploitation. Here's a detailed guide:",
      "Log in to email, school portals and cloud storage accounts linked to your child. Look for unusual activity such as unrecognized logins, changes to passwords or new connected devices. Set up notifications for account activity whenever possible so you are alerted instantly if something suspicious happens.",
      "Adding\u00a02FA creates an extra layer of security. Even if a hacker has a password, they won't be able to access the account without the second verification step. Most email providers, school portals and messaging platforms support this, and it's a simple step that dramatically improves security.",
      "Data broker sites often collect names, addresses and other personal details that hackers can use. Services that remove your child's information from these databases can make it harder for attackers to find and exploit sensitive data.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "A strong antivirus program protects devices from malware, phishing scams, and suspicious scripts. It is particularly important on devices that children use to access school portals or personal accounts. This ensures that if a hacker tries to use malware to get deeper access, it is blocked.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

Still, she worries that turning Google Docs into chat rooms could open the door to bullying or cheating. Parents are also weighing in.

    "story": [
      "OpenAI says it was founded with the goal of benefiting humanity. But several nonprofit organizations that say the artificial intelligence behemoth has strayed from its mission allege that it has recently used intimidation tactics to silence them.",
      "At least seven nonprofits that have been critical of OpenAI have received subpoenas in recent months, which they say are overly broad and appear to be a form of legal intimidation. All of the subpoenas are part of a legal battle between OpenAI and tech titan Elon Musk, with OpenAI suggesting that the subpoenaed nonprofits are somehow connected to Musk.",
      "The organizations that received subpoenas had signed or organized open letters and petitions critical of OpenAI\u2019s ongoing efforts to restructure from a nonprofit to a for-profit public benefit corporation. In one case, a subpoenaed nonprofit had also sponsored a California bill that imposed the first wide-ranging regulations on leading AI companies like OpenAI.",
      "Six of the nonprofits were not involved in the lawsuit between OpenAI and Musk before the tech company brought them into it by issuing the subpoenas, and the remaining nonprofit had filed a supporting brief in the case but says it had not engaged with Musk. Three of the subpoenas, issued to the San Francisco Foundation, Ek\u014d and the Future of Life Institute, have not been previously reported.",
      "The nonprofits say the subpoenas seem designed to extract private information about OpenAI\u2019s critics despite most of the organizations having no relation to Musk or the ongoing lawsuit.",
      "Robert Weissman, co-president of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization that has been critical of OpenAI\u2019s restructuring plans but is uninvolved in the current lawsuit and has not received a subpoena, told NBC News that OpenAI\u2019s intent in issuing the subpoenas is clear. \u201cThis behavior is highly unusual. It\u2019s 100% intended to intimidate,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThis is the kind of tactic you would expect from the most cutthroat for-profit corporation,\u201d Weissman said. \u201cIt\u2019s an attempt to bully nonprofit critics, to chill speech and deter them from speaking out.\u201d",
      "The subpoenas, four of which were reviewed by NBC News, ask for a wide variety of documents and materials, including all information about the organizations\u2019 funders and donations, in addition to all communications regarding Musk, Meta and its founder Mark Zuckerberg. OpenAI had previously expressed suspicions about Meta and Zuckerberg\u2019s involvement in Musk\u2019s $97 billion bid to buy OpenAI in February.",
      "The subpoenas also ask for \u201call documents and communications concerning the governance or organizational structure of OpenAI.\u201d",
      "OpenAI said in September that its conversion to a more traditional for-profit company would \u201cenable us to raise the capital required to accomplish our mission.\u201d The change is seen as a key step before the company could be publicly listed and would allow investors to hold valuable equity in the for-profit instead of just receiving a slice of profits.",
      "Critics of the conversion argue such a change could allow OpenAI, now the world\u2019s highest valued startup, to pursue profit over its charitable mission.",
      "The controversy around the subpoenas exploded online Friday, as employees of several of the nonprofits alleged on social media that the AI titan\u2019s subpoenas are hardball legal tactics that far surpass normal legal action and are often irrelevant to the ongoing Musk lawsuit. The allegations, which included photos of several of the subpoenas, led to several prominent current and former employees of OpenAI publicly criticizing its actions \u2014 highly unusual for the tight-lipped company.",
      "\u201cThis doesn\u2019t seem great,\u201d OpenAI\u2019s Joshua Achiam, the company\u2019s head of mission alignment, said in an X post Friday afternoon. Achiam did not respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment.",
      "Achiam reports to CEO Sam Altman and is tasked with ensuring OpenAI\u2019s pursuit of smarter-than-human AI systems benefit all of humanity.",
      "\u201cWe have a duty to and a mission for all of humanity,\u201d Achiam wrote Friday. \u201cThere are things that can go wrong with power and sometimes people on the inside have to be willing to point it out loudly.\u201d",
      "The subpoenas and tactics at issue in Friday\u2019s statements stem from a protracted and heated legal battle involving Musk.",
      "Musk sued Altman, OpenAI and several co-founders last year accusing them of breaching OpenAI\u2019s contractual duties by embracing a for-profit drive nested within its nonprofit structure, in what Musk alleged has been \u201ca textbook tale of altruism versus greed.\u201d",
      "Altman and OpenAI contend that Musk, who was one of OpenAI\u2019s early boosters and provided around $45 million to the company in its early years, is now jealous of the company\u2019s success and is employing \u201cbad-faith tactics to slow down OpenAI and seize control of the leading AI innovations for his personal benefit.\u201d Musk is also the founder and CEO of OpenAI-rival xAI, which is quickly trying to catch up to other AI companies\u2019 capabilities.",
      "In response to a request for comment, an OpenAI spokesperson referred NBC News to posts on X from OpenAI\u2019s Chief Strategy Officer Jason Kwon.",
      "On Friday, Kwon wrote that after Musk sued OpenAI, several organizations \u201cjoined in and ran campaigns backing his opposition to OpenAI\u2019s restructure. This raised transparency questions about who was funding them and whether there was any coordination.\u201d The various nonprofits that received subpoenas span a range of causes, but have all been critical of OpenAI.",
      "The San Francisco Foundation (SFF), whose mission is to strengthen communities, build civic leadership and foster philanthropy in the San Francisco area, says it has never received any funding from Musk nor has it participated in the lawsuit with Musk. SFF helped lead a petition in January asking California\u2019s attorney general to prevent OpenAI\u2019s attempt to restructure from a nonprofit to a for-profit entity.",
      "Judith Bell, SFF\u2019s chief impact officer, said that SFF has criticized OpenAI because of her organization\u2019s focus on philanthropy. \u201cOpenAI, an organization whose assets have been estimated in the hundreds of billions of dollars, is effectively one of the largest nonprofit entities in history. Its assets were accumulated for the explicit, charitable purpose of benefiting humanity,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cSFF opposes the diversion of these immense charitable assets for private, corporate profit. We believe the law requires that the full value of these public assets must be permanently dedicated to the public good, independent of any for-profit enterprise, regardless of OpenAI\u2019s corporate structure,\u201d she added.",
      "Sean Eskovitz, a litigator and former assistant United States attorney uninvolved in the Musk case and who has not spoken out for either party before, told NBC News that \u201cthe breadth of these subpoenas strike me as quite aggressive and quite broad.\u201d",
      "OpenAI \u201cwill have to demonstrate that the requests are relevant to an issue in the litigation,\u201d he said. \u201cEven then, there would be concerns given the limited or non-involvement of these third parties in the litigation, the nature of the activities that are being inquired about and the public interest in the advocacy and speech issues here.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere would have to be a very close look at the scope of the subpoena in order to ensure that nonparties are not being harassed, that their speech is not being chilled, and that the proponent of the subpoena is not using the subpoena for some ulterior purpose,\u201d Eskovitz said.",
      "Ek\u014d, an international nonprofit organization \u201ccommitted to curbing the growing power of corporations,\u201d had initially shared its concerns about OpenAI\u2019s corporate structure with the company in early April before launching a public campaign critical of the organization.",
      "Emma Ruby-Sachs, Ek\u014d\u2019s executive director, had heard that other advocacy organizations were receiving subpoenas over the past few months. \u201cWe knew this was a tactic that OpenAI was using to try and silence opposition,\u201d she told NBC News.",
      "OpenAI responded to the campaign in an email, noting that it had made attempts to meet with Ek\u014d before the launch of the campaign and raising its suspicions that Musk might have been involved in Ek\u014d\u2019s campaign.",
      "In reply, Ek\u014d\u2019s campaign director dismissed OpenAI\u2019s concerns about its funding: \u201cWe are not in any way supported by or funded by Elon Musk and have a history of campaigning against him and his interests.\u201d",
      "Given their email correspondence and OpenAI\u2019s subsequent silence, Ruby-Sachs was taken aback by OpenAI\u2019s subpoena in early September. \u201cWe had written to them and said we\u2019re over 70% funded by small online donations from individuals, and we\u2019ve run multiple campaigns against Elon Musk in the last year,\u201d she said.",
      "Ruby-Sachs mentioned that Ek\u014d even ran a billboard ad in Times Square earlier this year depicting Musk as a king and advocating for him to be fired during his stint at DOGE earlier this year.",
      "Like the other nonprofits\u2019 subpoenas, Ek\u014d\u2019s was very wide-ranging, asking for, among other details, \u201cthe identity of all Persons or entities that have contributed any funds to You and\u2026the amount and date of any such contributions.\u201d",
      "Such breadth surprised many commentators. Helen Toner, a former member of OpenAI\u2019s board, skeptical of some of the company\u2019s practices, labeled the approach as \u201cdishonesty & intimidation tactics.\u201d",
      "In a post viewed almost 30 million times, Musk reshared Toner\u2019s remark, commenting that \u201cOpenAI was built on a lie.\u201d",
      "Musk subpoenaed Toner\u2019s documents in a similar lawsuit last year.",
      "Given Ek\u014d\u2019s public opposition to Musk, Ruby-Sachs dismissed the idea that Ek\u014d could be funded by Musk to take down OpenAI. \u201cThe logical basis is so ridiculous that we have to assume this is just a tactic to scare us and get us to back off,\u201d she said.",
      "Ruby-Sachs said the organization prides itself on taking marching orders directly from its members, unlike a traditional policy or a lobbying group. Ek\u014d determines its priorities in organization-wide votes in which hundreds of thousands of its members participate.",
      "\u201cThis subpoena shows OpenAI is going after people around the world who are legitimately concerned citizens and trying to shut them up,\u201d Ruby-Sachs said.",
      "\u201cOpenAI is another company, just like every other company, trying to use their money and power to pursue profits, even if it screws over the people of California and potentially all of humanity,\u201d she said.",
      "Ek\u014d\u2019s subpoena has not been widely reported before, nor has a similarly broad subpoena targeting the Future of Life Institute (FLI).",
      "Whereas Ek\u014d says it has no ties to Musk, FLI received at least $10 million in funding from Musk. FLI last received funding from Musk in 2021. The funding focused on AI technical and policy research, including a grant-making program aimed at \u201ckeeping AI robust and beneficial.\u201d",
      "According to an FLI spokesperson, \u201cElon has no input into FLI\u2019s structural activities.\u201d The spokesperson said FLI distributed Musk\u2019s money to leading AI researchers, and a separate tech mogul gave FLI its permanent endowment as is made clear in its online funding reports.",
      "FLI received its subpoena at the beginning of October, while FLI President Max Tegmark received an individual subpoena in late August.",
      "\u201cWe assume the subpoena has to do with us generally calling for more oversight and transparency on the development of advanced AI and AI companies in general, which currently have zero regulation or meaningful oversight,\u201d FLI\u2019s spokesperson said.",
      "In a post on X addressing OpenAI, Tyler Johnston, who received a subpoena as founder of an AI-transparency advocacy group called The Midas Project, wrote: \u201cWe\u2019ve never spoken with or taken funding from Musk and ilk, which we would have been happy to tell you if you asked a single time. In fact we\u2019ve said he runs xAI so horridly it makes OpenAI \u2018saintly in comparison.\u2019\u201d",
      "Johnston\u2019s subpoena was previously reported in the SF Standard.",
      "On Monday, Johnston wrote on X that the subpoena and ensuing news coverage of his involvement in the lawsuit caused insurance brokers to refuse to cover his small watchdog organization. \u201cIf you wanted to constrain an org\u2019s speech, intimidation would be one strategy, but making them uninsurable is another, and maybe that\u2019s what\u2019s happened to us with this subpoena,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Former OpenAI research scientist Steven Adler told NBC News: \u201cI\u2019m surprised that OpenAI\u2019s Board would consider these actions consistent with its nonprofit legal obligations, or that they\u2019d feel personally comfortable with this conduct.\u201d",
      "Legal Advocates for Safe Science and Technology (LASST) also received a subpoena from OpenAI. Tyler Whitmer, president and CEO of LASST and a lawyer himself, was unsettled by the subpoena\u2019s aggressive tactics, especially given his opposition to Musk.",
      "\u201cI think Musk is a malign influence in the world right now,\u201d Whitmer said. \u201cPart of my mission is to hold Musk\u2019s xAI to account in the same way I hold OpenAI to account. It\u2019s just that OpenAI is supposed to be better than this, while I don\u2019t expect the same from Elon,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really clear that the subpoenas aren\u2019t narrowly tailored to the issues of the litigation and are instead trying to leverage the litigation to get information that OpenAI is not otherwise entitled to. And that\u2019s the best faith version of it,\u201d Whitmer said.",
      "Beyond its restructuring efforts, OpenAI also served subpoenas to at least one organization supporting recent efforts to regulate frontier AI companies.",
      "OpenAI\u2019s Head of Global Affairs Chris Lehane was publicly skeptical of California\u2019s SB 53, a newly signed bill mandating transparency into leading AI companies\u2019 risk-mitigation practices, before the bill was signed into law. Lehane is now attempting to shape America\u2019s AI politics to OpenAI\u2019s liking, bringing his dogged approach to Silicon Valley. Lehane recently helped launch a new $100 million Super PAC designed to fight against strict AI legislation.",
      "Encode, a nonprofit whose general counsel, Nathan Calvin, was recently subpoenaed by OpenAI, was a sponsor of the SB 53 legislation and also filed an amicus brief in Musk\u2019s lawsuit against OpenAI.",
      "In Friday\u2019s first volley, Calvin wrote: \u201cWhy did OpenAI subpoena me? Encode has criticized OpenAI\u2019s restructuring and worked on AI regulations, including SB 53.\u201d",
      "\u201cI believe OpenAI used the pretext of their lawsuit against Elon Musk to intimidate their critics and imply that Elon is behind all of them.\u201d",
      "In response, OpenAI\u2019s Kwon wrote: \u201cWhen a third party inserts themselves into active litigation, they are subject to standard legal processes. We issued a subpoena to ensure transparency around their involvement and funding. This is a routine step in litigation, not a separate legal action against Nathan or Encode.\u201d",
      "Ray Seilie, a litigator at Kinsella Holley Iser Kump Steinsapir in Los Angeles, told NBC News that the subpoenas could have been much more demanding if they were really meant as an intimidation tactic.",
      "Regarding Calvin and Encode, Seilie said: \u201cIf OpenAI had wanted to intimidate or harass him, they could have served him with a deposition subpoena, which would have required Calvin to sit down for a full day of questioning under oath by OpenAI\u2019s lawyers in addition to providing documents.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe fact that OpenAI only asked for documents suggests that they were sincerely looking for connections between Musk and Encode, even if they turned out to be wrong about their suspicion.\u201d",
      "Former OpenAI employee, whistleblower and prominent AI policy researcher Daniel Kokotajlo said the pressure for critics to be silent can often be crushing, even in the absence of depositions or subpoenas. \u201cI was super scared last year when I spoke up about OpenAI\u2019s secret nondisparagement clause, even though objectively speaking I was in the right.\u201dThe clause forbade former employees from saying anything negative about the company or face losing their vested equity. OpenAI rescinded the policy shortly after Kokotajlo came forward.",
      "\u201cWhen it\u2019s actually happening to you in real life, the psychological pressure to just stay quiet is pretty darn strong and most people cave to it,\u201d Kokotajlo told NBC News. \u201cThat\u2019s why intimidation tactics work.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said Wednesday that China\u2019s recent restrictions on rare-earth mineral exports are a \u201cglobal supply chain power grab.\u201d",
      "Greer and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent spoke to reporters at the Treasury Department in Washington, where Bessent said Beijing\u2019s actions amounted to a provocation.",
      "The remarks were the latest sign that the U.S.-China trade relationship continues to deteriorate after Beijing\u2019s surprise announcement Thursday of new limits on rare-earth minerals and related technologies.",
      "In response, President Donald Trump threatened to impose 100% tariffs on China, as well as export controls on \u201cany and all critical software.\u201d",
      "The only way China can avoid the new tariffs, Greer told NBC News, is to drop the proposed export controls.",
      "Bessent and Greer were cautiously optimistic that Beijing would back down and return to the negotiating table",
      "\u201cOur expectation is that they won\u2019t implement [the controls] and that we\u2019ll be able to be back to where we were a week ago,\u201d Greer said, \u201cwhere we had the tariff levels we\u2019ve agreed to and we have the flow of rare-earth magnets we agreed to.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, Bessent said, Washington is conferring with its allied trade partners about a unified response to the restrictions. \u201cThis is China vs. the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe and our allies will neither be commanded, nor controlled.\u201d",
      "Rare-earth minerals are critical to manufacturing a wide variety of products, such as batteries, electric vehicles, household goods, TVs and smartphones and solar panels.",
      "After three rounds of what the officials called successful trade talks, China also has yet to officially approve the sale of TikTok U.S. and has not bought any soybeans from American farmers since May.",
      "Nonetheless, Greer and Bessent said the current 90-day pause on tariffs with China \u2014 renewed at least three times so far \u2014 could be re-upped again for a longer interval if China lifts the rare-earths restrictions."

    "summary": "New research found that gene therapy for children with \"bubble boy disease,\" or SCID, was successful in 95% of trial participants.",
    "story": [
      "Two months after she was born, Eliana Nachem got a cough that wouldn\u2019t go away. Three weeks later, she also started having runny stool, prompting a visit to her pediatrician.",
      "Eliana didn\u2019t have allergies or a gastrointestinal condition; instead, tests pointed to a problem with her immune system. At 4 months old, Eliana received her diagnosis: severe combined immunodeficiency, or SCID.",
      "Babies born with the extremely rare disease do not develop the cells required for a functioning immune system. Every germ becomes a potentially fatal threat and to stay healthy, children with the condition must live in a completely sterile environment. Without treatment, kids usually do not live past their second birthday.",
      "\u201cI expected the worst, then I immediately went into research mode,\u201d Eliana\u2019s father, Jeff Nachem, said.",
      "The Nachems also got to work turning their home into a germ-free fortress, rehoming their pets, never opening the windows and opening the doors to outside as sparingly as possible. Eliana was kept inside, and on the rare instance when visitors came by, the family had disposable gowns, gloves and masks for them to wear. (SCID is sometimes referred to as \u201cbubble boy disease.\u201d) Eliana also started on a temporary therapy that replaced a missing enzyme in her body, called adenosine deaminase (ADA).",
      "In the midst of the strict protocol, they learned about a clinical trial in Los Angeles \u2014 2,600 miles from their home in Fredericksburg, Virginia \u2014 that could help their daughter live a normal life.",
      "Scientists have identified about 20 gene variants that cause SCID. Eliana\u2019s form of the disease, ADA-SCID, is diagnosed in fewer than 10 children born in the U.S. each year. (Under 100 babies are diagnosed with any form of SCID in a given year.)",
      "In 2014, when she was just 10 months old, Eliana was one of 62 children enrolled in a clinical trial for a gene therapy for ADA-SCID. In a study published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers followed up on the results of that Phase 2 clinical trial. The update reported that all 62 kids, who received the treatment from 2012 to 2019, are alive today. In 59 of them, including Eliana, the gene therapy completely restored immune function, without requiring any additional treatment \u2014 a success rate of 95%.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the most successful gene therapy trials for an ultra-rare genetic disease that we have,\u201d said Dr. Talal Mousallem, an associate professor of pediatrics at the Duke University School of Medicine. He was not involved with the trial.",
      "Correcting stem cells",
      "The treatment begins with doctors harvesting stem cells from the patient's own bone marrow. These stem cells are purified in a lab, and then modified using an inactivated form of the virus that causes HIV. Instead of carrying the human immunodeficiency virus, this version carries the ADA gene that people with ADA-SCID are missing, reinserting the gene into the stem cell DNA.",
      "Before the customized treatment is reinfused back into the patient, they must undergo chemotherapy to get rid of the body\u2019s existing stem cells and make room for the new ones.  Once back in the body, the cells \u2014 which no longer carry the virus, just the gene it left behind \u2014 get to work building an immune system over the next year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a one-time delivery vehicle that takes the gene into the DNA of the stem cell, so every time it divides to make other cells, those cells carry that ADA gene,\u201d said Dr. Donald Kohn, a pediatric bone marrow transplant physician at UCLA\u2019s Broad Stem Cell Research Center, who led the trial.",
      "A less risky option",
      "Gene therapy clinical trials are underway for four subtypes of SCID, but the standard of care is still a bone marrow transplant, which builds an immune system using stem cells from a donor. The treatment can be risky and side effects further down the line.",
      "It\u2019s ideal for bone marrow transplants to occur between siblings \u2014 who share about half of the same DNA \u2014 but two siblings only have about a 25% chance of being a match. In most cases, the donor is not a sibling, which introduces the risk that the donor\u2019s immune cells will attack the recipient\u2019s body, a phenomenon called graft-versus-host disease.",
      "The risk of graft-versus-host means kids who receive functioning stem cells from another person have to be on immunosuppressant drugs following the transplant, which keep the foreign cells from attacking their immune system.",
      "\u201cWhich slows down the progress, because you are suppressing the immune system while also trying to build an immune system,\u201d Kohn said.",
      "People also have to undergo much higher doses of chemotherapy before receiving a donor bone marrow transplant than they do before undergoing gene therapy.",
      "\u201cThere can be effects [later in life] from being treated with chemotherapy, including growth, endocrine or fertility effects,\u201d said Dr. Whitney Reid, an attending physician in the division of allergy and immunology at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, who was not involved in the trial.",
      "With gene therapy, \u201cyou can give those patients much lower doses of chemotherapy and there is a much lower chance of rejection,\u201d she said.",
      "Having another therapy for ADA-SCID is particularly important, Reid added. Changes in the ADA gene cause toxins to build up in clumps of white blood cells called lymphocytes. This can cause hearing loss and learning difficulties as kids get older.",
      "Unlike other types of SCID, \u201cit doesn\u2019t only affect the immune system,\u201d Reid said.",
      "Mousallem, of Duke University, said he hopes the success of this trial will open the door to gene therapies for other rare diseases that often go untreated, as well as SCID caused by other gene variants.",
      "\u201cThe data is great for ADA-SCID, and it is our hope that one day this becomes the standard of care,\u201d he said.",
      "Eliana turns 12 years old next week and loves going to dance classes.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that she was able to go from living in isolation to being able to go to preschool and go swimming in a public pool and play on a playground and do all the things that every other kid gets to do,\u201d her father said.",
      "Eliana still undergoes testing twice a year to make sure her immune system hasn\u2019t weakened. So far, so good.",
      "\u201cWe think it\u2019s a lifelong therapy,\u201d Kohn said. \u201cSome of these kids are now 15 years old and are living normal lives. We treated them when they were little babies, and now they\u2019re going to prom.\u201d"

      "Kardashian also shared why she split with Ye, between him saying negative things about her mother and sisters and airing out \"personal stuff.\"",
      "\"Just not feeling safe, not even physically, just, like, maybe emotionally or even financially,\" she said, adding, \"We had, like, five Lamborghinis, and I\u2019d come home and they\u2019d all be gone if he was in an episode. And I\u2019d be like, 'Oh, wait, where\u2019s all our cars? My new car.' And it would be like, 'Oh, he gave them away to all of his friends.'\"",
      "\"I didn\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to get when you wake up,\" she continued. \"And that\u2019s, like, a really unsettling feeling. Lack of stability was a big thing.\""

She detailed her journey in her memoir.\u201d",
      "Spears and Federline married in 2004, and finalized their divorce in 2007. According to court records obtained by NBC News, Spears paid between $20,000 and $40,000 per month in child support for their sons, Sean Preston, 20, and Jayden James, 19.",

Something bad is going to happen if things don\u2019t change, and my biggest fear is that our sons will be left holding the pieces.\u201d",

      "Spears wrote in her 2023 memoir, \u201cThe Woman in Me,\u201d that while she was under the conservatorship she felt like she \u201cbecame a robot.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut not just a robot \u2014 a sort of child-robot. I had been so infantilized that I was losing pieces of what made me feel like myself,\u201d Spears wrote. \u201cThe conservatorship stripped me of my womanhood, made me into a child. I became more of an entity than a person onstage. I had always felt music in my bones and my blood; they stole that from me.\u201d",
      "Spears' memoir is being adapted into a biopic by Universal Pictures, with \"Wicked\" director Jon M. Chu and producer Marc Platt attached, according to NBC News. (TODAY and Universal Pictures are owned by the same parent company, NBCUniversal.)",

      "On Oct. 7, Aurora Griffo, who posted food videos under the name \u201cGlamorama\u201d on TikTok, shared a now-deleted review of Arizona bakery JL Patisserie that sparked major backlash and, eventually, an apology.",
      "\u201cI do not mind spending 10 dollars on a pastry if they are really good, but you cannot use fake-ass ingredients,\u201d Griffo said in the controversial review, while holding a pistachio croissant. \u201cThat pistachio color is about as natural as my boobs, ass and waistline.\u201d",
      "She was similarly harsh regarding the shop\u2019s coffee, which she deemed \u201csuper sour and acidic,\u201d and its quiche, which she said had a \u201cpaper-thin\u201d crust and so much egg, she \u201cwould have eaten an omelet\u201d instead.",
      "\u201cFive dollars for a canel\u00e9? I didn\u2019t even pay that in San Tro-f---ing-pez,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat\u2019s the price next to the Phoenix Airport? OK.\u201d",
      "\u201cI absolutely loved the pumpkin pie croissant, but everything was a little on the sweet and rich side, which some people love,\u201d she added. \u201cPersonally, I like my sweets a little less sweet, so I\u2019d rather get treated like s--- and go to Paris again.\u201d",
      "Griffo ended her review with this missive: \u201cWith all of that being said, I think if you stay away from the expensive ingredients, like deez nuts, you can definitely enjoy delicious, rich pastry here.\u201d",
      "The Bakery\u2019s Response Goes Viral",
      "Though the review itself didn\u2019t initially go viral, it caught the attention of the bakery, which is owned by Jenna Leurquin. On Oct. 9, she responded in a now-viral video, disputing most of Griffo\u2019s claims, without naming her directly.",
      "\u201cSo, we recently had an influencer reach out to us and asked to do a collaboration, and we respectfully declined, because it was not in our budget right now,\u201d Leurquin said. \u201cThen, she essentially tried to blackmail us by saying if we offered the food for free, she would then write a good review about us.\u201d",
      "Along with the claim, Leurquin posted a screenshot of a direct message from Griffo in which she said the \u201cmeal will need to be comped including the gratuity\u201d for a collaboration, but that if the bakery accepts, her \u201chonest review\u201d would \u201chighlight/focus on what l enjoyed and be softer/quicker on my words with what I may not like as much.\u201d",
      "Leurquin said she would consider it, but before she\u2019d made up her mind, Griffo came in the next day. The staff recognized her when she came in and were \u201cvery accommodating\u201d and \u201ctotally respected that review,\u201d said Leurquin.",
      "\u201cBut what we don\u2019t like is lying and bullying,\u201d Leurquin said.",
      "For the remainder of the video, she pushes back on the accusation that the bakery\u2019s ingredients are fake: They use PreGel pistachio paste, which is \u201cmade from the finest pistachios,\u201d Panettone flour from Italy, and other imported ingredients. \u201cNot bad for a \u2018close to the airport bakery,\u201d Leurquin said.",
      "Aafter showing some of the bakery\u2019s preparation processes and noting everything is made from scratch, Leurquin ends the video with a message to all influencers.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about me. This specific influencer has gone to many different local restaurants and bullied them,\u201d Leurquin said. \u201cThe problem is if the next generation is influenced by her to believe it\u2019s OK to bully and disrespect the food industry.\u201d",
      "Griffo did not immediately respond to TODAY.com\u2019s request for comment.",
      "Leurquin\u2019s response garnered a staggering 60 million views and nearly 50,000 comments.",
      "\u201cI am loving this new trend of restaurants getting publicity for outing these influencers, blackmailing businesses for a pastry,\u201d commented one TikTok user.",

      "\u201cMy review was not revenge for being turned down for a collaboration I had already planned to visit and review the bakery regardless, paid or not,\u201d Griffo wrote in the text-based TikTok. \u201cBut I understand with how things unfolded, it might have looked like I did it out of spite. That\u2019s not who l am, and that was never my intention.\u201d",
      "Griffo said she gives honest reviews and the folks who have followed her \u201cfor a while\u201d know that, but understands now that \u201chonesty without compassion can come across the wrong way.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo the bakery, I\u2019m sincerely sorry for any harm my words may have caused. I respect the time, effort, and heart that goes into running a small business, and I genuinely wish you nothing but success moving forward,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re all human. Sometimes we mess up publicly and all we can do is take accountability, learn, and grow from it.\u201d"

    "summary": "Who was Adeline Watkins and what happened to her? This is the true story of Ed Gein's girlfriend and how it compares to what's shown in the series.",
    "story": [
      "The newest season of Netflix's \"Monster\" not only depicts killer Ed Gein and his macabre crimes, it also shows him with a female companion whose role in his life has been disputed.",
      "Charlie Hunnam plays the man who became known as The Butcher of Plainfield for the grisly crimes uncovered at his Wisconsin farm in 1957. Gein admitted to killing two local women and robbing graves at a local cemetery to make ghoulish items like bowls, lampshades and upholstered chairs out of human skin and bone.",
      "In \"Monster: The Ed Gein Story,\" actor Suzanna Son plays a woman named Adeline Watkins, who appears to be Gein\u2019s girlfriend and a woman who shares some of his interest in gruesome murders.",
      "Was she a real person? Here's what to know.",
      "Who Was Adeline Watkins?",
      "Following Gein's arrest in 1957, a local woman from Gein's hometown of Plainfield named Adeline Watkins gave an interview with the Minneapolis Tribune, which was reprinted in the Wisconsin State Journal on Nov. 21, 1957, saying Gein once proposed to her.",
      "Watkins, who was 50 years old at the time, described Gein as \"good and kind and sweet\" in the article.",
      "She claimed the two had a 20-year romance and that Gein \"was so nice about doing things I wanted to do that sometimes I felt I was taking advantage of him.\"",
      "\"I loved him and I still do,\" she added.",
      "She was described by the reporter as \"a plain woman with graying bangs and horn-rimmed glasses.\"",
      "Watkins said her last date with Gein was on Feb. 6, 1955, about two years before he was arrested. She claimed that Gein didn't explicitly propose to her that night, but she \"knew what he meant.\"",
      "\"I turned him down, but not because there was anything wrong with him,\" she continued. \"It was something wrong with me. I guess I was afraid I wouldn't be able to live up to what he expected of me.\"",
      "Watkins' mother was also quoted saying Gein was a \"sweet, polite man\" who always had her daughter home by 10 p.m. from a date.",
      "Watkins added that she and Gein often talked about books, including his favorites about lions, tigers, Africa and India. She said they also loved true crime.",
      "\"I guess we discussed every murder we ever heard about,\" she said. \"Eddie told how the murdered did wrong, what mistakes he had made. I thought it was interesting.\"",
      "What Did Ed Gein Say About His Relationship with Adeline Watkins?",
      "Gein never publicly made any mention of Watkins.",
      "In the book \"Unhinged\" by Robert Keller, Gein was described as a \"lonely old bachelor\" whom local farmers' wives took pity on and delivered meals and cookies to him at his farm.",
      "Watkins said in the Minneapolis Tribune that she and Gein went on dates to the movies or a local tavern. She said she had to \"drag\" Gein into a tavern because he did not drink.",
      "However, one of the women Gein admitted to murdering was a tavern owner, Mary Hogan. He frequently visited her establishment and looked at her as a \"mirror image of his sainted mother,\" according to \"Unhinged.\" It's unclear whether Watkins and Gein ever visited Hogan's tavern or if they were ever truly a couple.",
      "Following his arrest, Gein lived in state psychiatric facilities until his death in 1984.",
      "While growing up under their mother's domineering presence, Gein and his brother were warned constantly by their mother about the immorality of women and told to avoid them. Neither of them ever married, and Ed Gein remained obsessed with his mother until her death and beyond.",
      "Adeline Watkins Retracted Her Statements",
      "Watkins' interview with the Minnesota paper was picked up by The Associated Press and made national headlines for her alleged love affair with a ghoulish murderer and grave robber.",
      "She then spoke to the local Stevens Point Journal in Wisconsin for a story that ran on Dec. 3, 1957, and denied some of her previous statements.",
      "Watkins said there was no 20-year romance between the two, only that she had known him for 20 years. She said she had only spent time with him during a seven-month period in 1954 and went to a few shows at a local theater and spent time with him at her home. She said she never visited his home.",
      "She denied that she or her mother had referred to Gein as \"sweet\" in the interview. She also denied saying she had to \"practically drag\" Gein into a local tavern.",
      "Outside of the two newspaper stories, Watkins did not speak publicly about Gein again. She died at 85 in 1992 and was buried in the Plainfield Cemetery in Wisconsin. It's one of the cemeteries where Gein admitted to digging up corpses in the 1940s and '50s.",
      "How is Adeline Watkins Portrayed in 'Monster'?",
      "Son portrays Watkins as Gein's girlfriend in the Netflix series. It also shows her as complicit in his crimes. There is no evidence of that ever happening.",
      "Son's character shows him photos of Holocaust victims and notorious Nazi war criminal Ilse Koch, and then Gein shows her the hair-raising items he made out of human body parts. She is shown a bowl made of a skull, a belt made out of women's nipples and a chair upholstered with human skin, all of which were real items found by authorities at Gein's home in Plainfield, Wisconsin.",
      "He also introduces Son's character to his \"mother,\" which is really a corpse of his late mother sitting in a chair with her back to Watkins like a scene straight out of \"Psycho,\" which was inspired by Gein's crimes. Adeline then promptly leaves.",
      "Gein denied digging up the body of his mother, Augusta Gein, who died of a stroke in 1945.",
      "In a later episode, the two are seen at a graveyard, where Watkins accepts a wedding proposal from Gein. She is then shown wanting to have sex with him, but he stops her because he's been taught by his mother that sex is only for procreation.",
      "The two are then shown moving in together, and Watkins is depicted as having a morbid fascination when she finds the corpse of one of Gein's victims. Yet another disturbing scene shows Watkins photographing corpses mutilated by Gein and encouraging necrophilia.",
      "None of these events appear to have happened, according to police reports, interviews with Gein and the interviews with Watkins.",
      "In perhaps a nod to the Minneapolis Tribune interview by Watkins, Son's character is later shown seeking media attention to grab the spotlight after Gein's crimes have been made public. In the final episode, she meets with Gein in his psychiatric hospital and confesses to disturbing urges.",
      "Neither Gein nor Watkins ever spoke of any meeting between them while Gein was in the hospital."

It does affect me \u2014 I\u2019m just a human being. We\u2019re all human beings. That\u2019s why I thought, \u2018What the hell?\u2019\u201d"

    "story": [
      "\u201cConform\u201d began as an off-handed comment debut author Ariel Sullivan made to her husband during a \u201cdark point\u201d in her life, she tells TODAY.com. Sullivan was struggling with postpartum depression and the isolation of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "While contact tracing with her husband, she had a vision of a surveillance state future: \u201cSooner or later, we\u2019ll all have these chips in our hand, and we\u2019ll just be able to scan and it\u2019ll know if we\u2019re sick or if we have problems. Then they\u2019ll be able to tell us where we can and can\u2019t go based on it,\u201d she remembers imagining.",
      "She also recalls waking up that morning at 2:30 a.m. to feed her son. By then, Sullivan says the idea had \u201cexploded in her subconscious.\u201d",
      "Instead of going back to sleep, she spent all night outlining \u201cConform,\u201d her debut novel and the first book from Jenna Bush Hager\u2019s Thousand Voices imprint, a joint venture with Random House. Jenna said in a previous interview with TODAY.com that the book is \u201cMargaret Atwood meets Sarah J. Maas.\u201d",
      "\u201cConform\u201d is set in a futuristic authoritarian state where people are sharply divided based on genetic anomalies. Emeline is given the chance to ascend to a higher rank when she\u2019s chosen as a mating partner of one of the society\u2019s elites, but finds a romantic connection with a rebel. (On the topic of the love triangle, Sullivan says she\u2019s firmly Team Emeline.)",
      "Within weeks, Sullivan\u2019s first idea turned into the outline of a trilogy, and then three trilogies, all outlining how this society came to be and where it\u2019s going. Sullivan\u2019s next book is the first of the prequel trilogy, and she predicts debates over the order to read the books in.",
      "Sullivan isn\u2019t quite surprised that she had the capacity to write and outline these books. She says she was always a daydreamer and wrote previously, including some Dramione fanfic.",
      "\u201cThe fact that I wasn\u2019t intimidated by it, and was like, \u2018No, I\u2019m going to do it.\u2019 That\u2019s probably what shocked me most,\u201d she says.",
      "She says writing helped her out of the rut she was in when the idea first arrived.",
      "\u201cBy the time I had finished \u2018Conform,\u2019 I was in such a better place emotionally and mentally,\u201d she says, adding she also went to therapy.",
      "Now, she says she\u2019s receiving messages that \u201cConform\u201d has helped readers escape their own lives and sparked joy.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted to do,\u201d she says.",
      "Below, read an excerpt from \u201cConform,\u201d which is on sale Oct. 14.",
      "Read an Excerpt From 'Conform'",
      "\u201cThis way, Ms. Emeline. He is waiting.\u201d",
      "My heart began an erratic dance. Not trusting myself to speak, I nodded. As we approached the curtains, they pulled back automati\u00adcally.",
      "A magnificent secret garden unlike anything I had ever seen sprawled before me, stealing my breath. Flowers of all kinds ex\u00adploded everywhere\u2014large white hydrangeas, amethyst wisteria, honeysuckle, buttercups, and orange lilies\u2014spilling onto the tile, climbing the walls, and hanging from the ceiling. Small glowing orbs swayed from the ceiling among the wisteria, almost like stars. In the very center of the room stood a beautiful willow. A tree in the sky. It was art. Did the Elite see it? They destroyed ancient art, yet created their own. Why?",
      "Hesitantly, I followed the attendant into the hidden paradise. I didn\u2019t know where to look first, every step revealing more beauty. Alone, I might have run my hands along the flowers and stopped to smell each one.",
      "Life below, my life, was primitive and barren in comparison. I had been living a bleak existence, waiting in perpetual solitude. We all just accepted it.",
      "Lo didn\u2019t. I understood her constant nagging and dedication to improving her social standing. But the sweet perfume of the flowers turned sour at the truth that Minors were given the bare minimum while the Elite surrounded themselves with luxuries. Maybe a part of me wanted to be beguiled by the beauty surrounding me. Another part\u2014the part that didn\u2019t fit\u2014couldn\u2019t stand the divide.",
      "Bright colors and sparkling jewels adorned the Elites sitting at every table we passed. The glittering observers whispered behind heavily ringed hands or elaborate embroidered fans. My breath be\u00adcame too quick as more leaned in like a swarm of bees, lined eyes watching my every step.",
      "The rules from the Grooming slithered into my mind.",
      "Rule One: Remember your place. Although you are in the clouds, your MIND has deemed you defective. You are until your last breath a Minor Defect.",
      "I looked straight ahead, unable to meet anyone\u2019s eyes, even with the lens. My golden dress was a stark, unsettling difference in a rain\u00adbow sea of colorful flowers and gowns. I was the antithesis of the delicate blooms. It was as if I were the sun shining brightly, and all the flowers and people revolved around my presence. Never had I felt so seen. I wasn\u2019t entirely sure it was a good thing.",
      "The attendant finally stopped at a small table below the willow, its branches swaying gently. The man blocked the person waiting for me at the table. A chair scraped against the ground, and my stomach twisted viciously, heartbeats turned violent, slamming into my chest like it might bolt, and I fought the urge to follow it all the way back to the surface forever below.",
      "\u201cYour guest, sir.\u201d The man in gray stepped to the side, gesturing to me before disappearing in the throng of flowers and people.",
      "My heart stopped. The buzzing of conversation, the blooms, and even the tree fell away. Silence found me as the most beautiful man I had ever seen waited \u2014 for me.",
      "\u201cHello, Emeline.\u201d",

      "Women of Worth is L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris\u2019 annual signature philanthropic initiative that recognizes and rewards 10 women who are making a difference in their communities through their nonprofit work.",
      "\u201cThe slogan \u2018Because you\u2019re worth it\u2019 has always been more than makeup, lipstick and hair care. It really is about being a mantra for women to understand their value in life, their jobs, their relationships and their families,\u201d Longoria says. \u201cFor the L\u2019Oreal family to extend that to everyday people and to put the spotlight on women doing amazing things in their community, it just felt so on brand, so perfect.\u201d",

      "\u201cThis was sort of my message from a baby bird to a mama bird and also to yourself too because you will always know what\u2019s right,\u201d she added."

    "summary": "Many Israelis whose loved ones were killed or maimed in terror attacks must now watch the perpetrators walk free as part of the ceasefire.",
    "story": [
      "CAESAREA, Israel \u2014 Ten years ago this week, two Palestinian attackers boarded a bus in Jerusalem and shot, beat and stabbed Israeli American educator Richard Lakin to death along with two others before police killed one of the militants and injured and arrested the other.",
      "The surviving assailant, Bilal Abu Ghanem, was freed in February from his three consecutive life sentences for murder as part of the last Israeli ceasefire and hostage release deal with Hamas.",
      "That\u2019s when his son, Micah Avni, had to watch his father\u2019s murderer go free.",
      "\u201cIt feels like I\u2019ve been betrayed by my country,\u201d Avni, 56, said the day before Hamas exchanged 24 Israeli hostages for about 2,000 Palestinian detainees and prisoners, including 250 serving life sentences for serious crimes including terrorism.",
      "Avni\u2019s anguish and anger have now merged with a larger collective, shared by many Israelis whose loved ones were killed or maimed in terror attacks and who must now watch the perpetrators walk free as part of the latest ceasefire negotiated by the Trump administration.",
      "Their torment hasn\u2019t just punctured the euphoria surrounding last week\u2019s agreement \u2014 it very nearly halted the deal and could still frustrate its full implementation.",
      "Two far-right political parties in Israel\u2019s government cited the release of 250 convicts as their reason for voting against President Donald Trump\u2019s ceasefire and hostage release plan.",
      "\u201cAlongside this joy, it is absolutely forbidden to ignore the question of the price: the release of thousands of terrorists,\u201d said Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right minister of national security and leader of the Otzma Yehudit party, in a statement explaining his party\u2019s opposition. \u201cThese are terrorists whose past experience proves that they will return to terrorism and their art of working to murder Jews.\u201d",
      "While Ben-Gvir and others refer to thousands of \u201cterrorists\u201d released, 250 of those released were convicted of serious crimes.",
      "Most of the rest of the more than 1,700 people let go, among them doctors, nurses and journalists, had been held without charge. These detainees were not involved in the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks and were held under a controversial practice called administrative detention, which allows Israel to detain people for an indefinite period of time without ever charging them. More than 20 minors were on the list.",
      "For Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, the releases were cause for celebrations. Prisoners and detainees who returned to Gaza rode on the tops of buses through crowds of well-wishers.",
      "In the West Bank, families waited for the released prisoners outside the Ramallah Cultural Palace in the Palestinians\u2019 provisional capital. Some women and young girls arrived in traditional Palestinian dresses. Many refused to speak to the gathered press: Israel\u2019s military, they said, had called them and warned them not speak to the media.",
      "The prisoners\u2019 families said they had seen others being re-arrested in the past and didn\u2019t want to gamble on the convicts\u2019 hard-won freedom.",
      "\u201cFor Israel, any Palestinian is a terrorist,\u201d said the uncle of one of the released Palestinians, who refused to give his name, \u201ceven if they didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d",
      "In addition, there is the collective pain of nearly 2 million in Gaza who have endured Israel\u2019s two-year war against Hamas. There is little hope among Palestinians that anybody will be held responsible for the tens of thousands of innocent civilians killed by Israeli fire, along with those maimed in attacks.",
      "Israel has accused Hamas of operating in civilian areas, thus necessitating attacks that endanger noncombatants. In November, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif, whom Israel said it had killed, over alleged crimes against humanity and war crimes.",
      "Israel has forcefully rejected the allegations, and Netanyahu\u2019s office branded the decision \u201cantisemitic,\u201d rejecting them as \u201cabsurd and false\u201d and condemning the ICC as a \u201cbiased and discriminatory political body.\u201d",
      "Tinged with sadness",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged many Israelis\u2019 public pain in comments on Sunday night.",
      "\u201cTomorrow, our sons will return to their borders,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a historic event that is tinged with sadness over the release of murderers \u2014 and joy over the return of kidnapped people.\u201d",
      "Under President Donald Trump\u2019s 20-point plan for ending the fighting, Hamas fighters who lay down their weapons would be spared any punishment \u2014 a condition that has also raised grave reservations among many Israelis, including Netanyahu, who had hoped to see Hamas destroyed.",
      "Rachel Goldberg-Polin, an American Israeli whose son, Hersh, was kidnapped on Oct. 7 and then killed by Hamas last year, said she\u2019s rejected the feelings of anger that come with grief.",
      "\u201cNothing can bring Hersh back,\u201d she said in an interview last week. \u201cI tend to look at this in a very zoomed-out way. I don\u2019t have this fiery venomous anger that I think wouldn\u2019t serve me in any purpose.\u201d",
      "Avni, who opposed this week\u2019s deal, said he worries that the released convicts will simply return to the battlefield or engage in terrorism against Israelis.",
      "\u201cObviously, every single Jewish person wants to get the hostages back,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that strategically trading thousands of terrorists for 20 lives makes sense.\u201d",
      "Avni has advocated executing terrorists as a way to remove prisoner exchanges from the negotiating table. Israeli law allows for capital punishment, but only for treason and \u201ccrimes against humanity.\u201d The death sentence has been used only twice in Israeli history.",
      "In the hours after his father\u2019s murder, Avni admits that he considered taking matters into his own hands. Both Lakin and Abu Ghanem were taken to the same ward in the same Jerusalem hospital after the attack.",
      "The two men were treated only yards apart. Lakin died, but his killer survived.",
      "\u201cI think I would have jumped on him and done something but he had police standing there,\u201d Avni said. \u201cI remember thinking to myself, you know, you\u2019ll go to jail for life, and you\u2019ve got responsibilities.\u201d",
      "Recounting the cruel irony of his father\u2019s killing still brings tears to Avni\u2019s eyes. His father had been a peace-loving school principal who advocated for racially integrated education, had marched with Martin Luther King Jr. and participated in the anti-segregation \u201cFreedom Riders\u201d movement during the 1960s.",
      "The family moved to Israel when Avni was 15 years old.",
      "\u201cHe was a big believer in coexistence. I wish everybody could be like that, but they\u2019re not,\u201d Avni said of his father. \u201cIt was an innocent world view.\u201d",
      "Matt Bradley reported from Caesarea and Daniele Hamamdjian  from Ramallah in the occupied West Bank."

      "Soon, young protesters in Madagascar, where the median age is 19, were demanding the resignation of Rajoelina, 51, who came to power in a military-backed coup in 2009.",

    "published": "Fri, 10 Oct 2025 01:19:24 GMT",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump had to maintain the trust of Israel and a series of Arab- and Muslim-majority nations. His ability to walk that tightrope was tested repeatedly.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s personal touch \u2014 both as a heavy hand and a gentle guide \u2014 played a pivotal role at key moments in the development of a Middle East peace deal that promises to bring an end to Israel\u2019s two-year war in Gaza, current and former officials in the United States and other nations told NBC News.",
      "Trump announced on Wednesday that the \u201cfirst phase\u201d of the plan to end the conflict in Gaza had been agreed to, with a pause in fighting and the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Trump called it \u201ca great deal\u201d in a brief interview with NBC News on Thursday morning. \u201cEverybody is happy,\u201d he said.",
      "The deal accelerated over several crucial moments \u2014 Israel\u2019s strike on Qatar, discussions on the sidelines of the recent United Nations General Assembly in New York City and Jared Kushner\u2019s conversations with his father-in-law, these sources said.",
      "Also helpful, though, was an old-fashioned deadline. In recent weeks, Trump told advisers he wanted to announce a deal by Oct. 7, the second anniversary of the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel that precipitated the war, according to two people familiar with his instructions.",
      "The president, one of the people said, was fixated on the date both for its symbolic significance and because he saw it as a way to herald a new step forward in Israel\u2019s relationship with Saudi Arabia when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visits Washington next month.",
      "This account of the Trump administration\u2019s role in the ceasefire deal is based on interviews with a dozen sources in three countries.",
      "As the war in Gaza ground on \u2014 with more than 67,000 dead, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, declarations of famine and images of wounded children across social media \u2014 it threatened Trump\u2019s vision for a more interconnected Middle East that he began to implement in his first term with the Abraham Accords, which established relationships between Israel and several Arab nations.",
      "The war\u2019s intensity also presented an opportunity for Trump to coalesce regional powers around a peace plan to disarm Hamas, preclude Israel from seizing the West Bank and provide for the redevelopment of Gaza.",
      "Israel and Hamas agreed Wednesday to the first phase of that proposal \u2014 a ceasefire and an Israeli military pullback to a \u201cyellow line\u201d within Gaza that leaves more of the strip under the control of Palestinians. That is to be followed by Hamas\u2019 returning as many as 20 Israeli hostages and the remains of as many as 28 hostages and Israel\u2019s releasing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and the remains of 15 dead Gazans.",
      "Trump was able to announce the pact just one day after his target.",
      "To do that, Trump had to maintain the trust of Israel and of a series of Arab- and Muslim-majority nations that could influence Hamas and Palestinian civilians. At the same time, he had to apply pressure. His ability to walk that tightrope was tested repeatedly.",
      "And, at times, the darkest hours yielded the biggest breakthroughs.",
      "Qatar strikes",
      "After months of negotiations with no result, a turning point came in September in the form of a surprise attack.",
      "Israeli forces launched airstrikes on the Qatari capital, Doha, in an attempt to kill the leaders of Hamas. Six people were killed, including a member of Qatar\u2019s internal security force.",
      "Over the course of the war, Israel has struck in Iran, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen, in addition to Gaza.",
      "But this was different. Qatar is a U.S. ally that hosts a strategic air base with 10,000 American troops. Trump and his team had come to view the Persian Gulf nation as a trusted partner in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas. The parents of an Israeli hostage had been in Doha that very morning, meeting Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani.",
      "The bombing blindsided and angered the White House, as well as the Arab world.",
      "Asked about the strikes at the time, Trump told reporters: \u201cI was very unhappy about it. Very unhappy about every aspect.\u201d",
      "But instead of killing the prospect of a deal, the Israeli attack prompted Trump and his team to ratchet up pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to bring the war to an end.",
      "\u201cIt was the moment that Trump said, \u2018Enough,\u2019\u201d said a former Israeli official, adding: \u201cThis deal, almost identical, has been on the table for over a year now. Netanyahu didn\u2019t want to do it, but Trump left him no choice.\u201d",
      "\u201cBoth Netanyahu and Hamas tried to say \u2018yes, but\u2019 to stall, but Trump decided to hear only \u2018yes\u2019 and pushed them into the corner,\u201d the former official said.",
      "Shortly after the strikes, Trump issued a warning to Israel: He would not support the annexation of the West Bank, as some far-right members of Netanyahu\u2019s Cabinet had proposed.",
      "The Americans, the Qataris and other Arab governments saw the surprise strikes as an opportunity to exert leverage, according to an Arab official and former Israeli officials with knowledge of the diplomatic talks.",
      "\u201cIt was a catalyst to bring pressure on the Israeli government, which had been the main obstacle to a deal,\u201d the Arab official said.",
      "U.N. General Assembly sidelines",
      "Weeks after the strikes on Doha, the U.N. General Assembly met along the bank of the East River in New York City.",
      "It was on the sidelines \u2014 where, historically, deals are often solidified with face-to-face interactions and handshakes \u2014 that the discussions \u201creally took a turn,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday during a Cabinet meeting at the White House.",
      "Trump convened a meeting at the General Assembly with Arab- and Muslim-majority nations to sell his 20-point peace plan. Rubio said that is where Trump \u201ccreated this coalition\u201d before he presented the proposal to Netanyahu at the White House at the end of last month.",
      "Crucially, during that visit, Trump persuaded Netanyahu to call Al-Thani, the Qatari prime minister, to apologize for the Israeli strikes in Qatar. That allowed Qatar to remain engaged as a key intermediary in peace talks.",
      "\u201cIt is my understanding that the Qatari government viewed the apology as a way to move forward, and it saw its role, that it had invested in for quite a long time, as still vital to achieving a ceasefire and hopefully peace in the future,\u201d Nawaf Al-Thani, a former Qatari defense attach\u00e9 to the United States, told NBC News.",
      "Trump\u2019s handling of that episode was reminiscent for many observers of the way he reacted to Israel\u2019s and Iran\u2019s striking each other during a ceasefire agreement following American bombing raids on Iranian nuclear facilities in June.",
      "\u201cWe basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don\u2019t know what the f--- they\u2019re doing,\u201d Trump, clearly frustrated, said at the time. His rebuke of Israel, along with Iran, reassured Arab countries with ties to Shia-majority Iran. In that way, a former senior White House official said, Trump\u2019s messages to Israel after its strikes in Iran and in Qatar were similar.",
      "\u201cBoth showed the president\u2019s commitment to Israel, but also his commitment to the Arab countries,\u201d the former official said.",
      "Seeing the United States pushing Israel over the strike in Doha helped persuade Qatar, Turkey and other Arab governments to press Hamas, making it clear that the time for delays and foot-dragging was over, the officials said.",
      "As the negotiations advanced, both the U.S. and Arab negotiators chose to convey a united and optimistic front, placing Netanyahu at risk of potentially insulting Trump if he questioned the 20-point proposal Trump put on the table, the former Israeli official said.",
      "\u201cThe Trump people and Arab world just briefed total confidence and optimism before anything was finalized to make it seem like a done deal, which made saying \u2018no\u2019 a public affront to Trump, and Netanyahu can\u2019t do that,\u201d the former official said. \u201cIt was a show of very effective statecraft and use of leverage.\u201d",
      "Kushner\u2019s role",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, became his chief envoy to the Middle East. There he was delivering a speech at the opening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. There he was building relationships with Arab leaders, focusing on economic relations.",
      "Years later, Kushner became deeply involved in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas. He emerged, former Israeli officials said, because he carries important influence with regional governments and the president.",
      "\u201cKushner was the architect,\u201d a former Israeli official said.",
      "Kushner was able to convey to Trump that the conflict in Gaza threatened the future of his biggest diplomatic success the last time he was in office \u2014 the Abraham Accords.",
      "That deal produced peace agreements between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco. Trump has aimed to extend it to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel.",
      "\u201cThe entire legacy was in jeopardy,\u201d the former Israeli official said.",
      "Kushner and Trump\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, traveled to Egypt on Tuesday to hammer out details of the deal, according to senior U.S. officials.",
      "They went over various aspects of the proposal, including how Israeli military forces would be redeployed and the order of hostage and prisoner releases, the officials said, with one adding that an important feature of their work was the decision to \u201cseparate the peace deal into two clear phases.\u201d That allowed for an agreement on the exchange of people, while the deal\u2019s other points are negotiated in a second phase.",
      "The U.S. negotiators called Trump on Wednesday evening to get his final guidance before he announced that a deal was in place, the officials said. Israel\u2019s government approved the exchange Thursday evening.",
      "\u201cIt came together quick in a good way,\u201d Witkoff told NBC News in a brief telephone interview Thursday morning as he waited to board a flight to Israel.",
      "Kushner and Witkoff had about \u201cfive hours of sleep in the last three days,\u201d senior U.S. officials said.",
      "American negotiators expect the next phase to be \u201calmost a permanent ceasefire until all the other issues we have to deal with are negotiated and considered,\u201d one of the officials said, pointing to outstanding topics as thorny as how Gaza will be governed.",
      "U.S. officials cautioned Thursday that there is still a lot of work to do to ensure the ceasefire holds and the rest of the plans can be finalized and implemented.",
      "\u201cThis is a very delicate time,\u201d one of them said.",
      "Trump said he plans to travel to Egypt to put his signature on the Middle East agreement in the coming days.",
      "And the U.S. military is preparing options to deploy as many as 200 U.S. troops to Israel to support the International Stabilization Force for the long-term internal security solution for Gaza and to support the flow of humanitarian aid and security assistance into Gaza, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the planning.",
      "\u201cThey will not be in Gaza. No U.S. boots on the ground in Gaza,\u201d one of the officials said.",
      "The effort will be called the Civil-Military Coordination Cell, and U.S. troops could begin arriving in Israel immediately, the officials said.",
      "In addition to supporting moving aid and assistance into Gaza, they are expected to support the deconfliction mechanism between the two sides \u2014 basically making sure that both sides are upholding their part of the security agreements.",
      "\u201cI think right now,\u201d a senior U.S. official said, \u201cwe\u2019re just focused on making sure any gaps are patched up in the agreement.\u201d",
      "Trump allies say the agreement between Israel and Hamas, forged under immense pressure on both sides \u2014 including Trump\u2019s broad support for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, the limits he placed on Netanyahu and a threat to let Israel destroy Hamas if it did not agree to the pact \u2014 is a testament to the validity of his peace-through-strength approach to foreign policy.",
      "\u201cHe understands that sometimes you have to use force to set the structure for peace,\u201d former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who is close to Trump, said in an interview last week."

    "story": [
      "The CIA\u2019s operations abroad are usually shrouded in secrecy, but President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he had authorized the spy agency to take unspecified action in Venezuela, an extraordinary and unprecedented acknowledgement from a commander in chief.",
      "\u201cWhy did you authorize the CIA to go into Venezuela?\u201d a reporter asked Trump at the White House.",
      "\u201cI authorized for two reasons, really,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNumber one, they have emptied their prisons into the United States of America.\"",
      "The second reason, the president said, was narcotics trafficking.",
      "\u201cAnd the other thing are drugs. We have a lot of drugs coming in from Venezuela,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The president\u2019s highly unusual remarks about his orders to the CIA came only hours after The New York Times reported that the Trump administration had authorized the CIA to carry out covert, lethal action in Venezuela.",
      "The CIA declined to comment on the report.",
      "Asked if the Central Intelligence Agency had authority to \u201ctake out\u201d the president of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, Trump said: \u201cOh, I don\u2019t want to answer a question like that. That\u2019s a ridiculous question for me to be given. Not really a ridiculous question, but wouldn\u2019t it be a ridiculous question for me to answer?\u201d",
      "\u201cI think Venezuela is feeling heat,\" he added. \"But I think a lot of other countries are feeling heat too.\u201d",
      "In a post on social media on Tuesday, Trump said the U.S. military had carried out a strike on another boat in the Caribbean which he claimed was smuggling narcotics to the United States. It was the fifth such strike since early September.",
      "Trump also was asked if he was considering U.S. military strikes on Venezuelan soil, and said it was an option.",
      "\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to tell you exactly, but we are certainly looking at land now, because we\u2019ve got the sea very well under control,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple of days where there isn\u2019t a boat to be found.\u201d",
      "NBC News has previously reported that U.S. military officials are drawing up options to target drug traffickers inside Venezuela.",
      "Trump said the lethal strikes against alleged drug smuggling boats had saved American lives, by preventing narcotics from reaching the United States. He also said that after the boats are struck by U.S. forces, \u201cyou see that fentanyl all over the ocean,\u201d adding: \u201cIt\u2019s like floating in bags. It\u2019s all over the place.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials so far have not provided detailed information about exactly what narcotics have been in most of the targeted vessels.",
      "The Trump administration has labeled multiple drug cartels from Venezuela and other Latin American countries as foreign terrorist organizations, citing in part the high death toll from fentanyl use in the United States.",
      "Fentanyl is mainly smuggled over land routes in small, easily concealed amounts across the Mexico-U.S. border, not by boat through the Caribbean, experts say.",
      "The administration has offered different explanations as to the goal of the strikes in the Caribbean. Officials have portrayed the operations as a bold move against the threat posed by drug cartels. But officials also have suggested that the strikes \u2014 and a ramped up U.S. military presence in the region \u2014 are meant to pile pressure on the regime in Venezuela."

    "story": [
      "When it comes to the best foods for easing chronic constipation, are kiwis on your grocery list?",
      "New dietary guidelines from the British Dietetic Association, published Monday, say that kiwis \u2014 along with rye bread and certain supplements \u2014 can help improve constipation symptoms.",
      "The guidelines, the authors say, are the first evidence-based recommendations for treating constipation with diet, not medications.",
      "Chronic constipation affects around 16% of adults worldwide, and constipation is the reason for almost 2.5 million doctors visits in the U.S. per year, according to the American College of Gastroenterology.",
      "Eirini Dimidi, a lead author of the guidelines, said the existing guidance for managing chronic constipation is largely focused on pharmaceuticals.",
      "The few dietary recommendations out there \u2014 eat more fiber, drink more water \u2014 are ambiguous and often lack research to back them up.",
      "\u201cI remember looking at the guidelines and realizing that they are just really limited in the number of dietary recommendations they make,\u201d said Dimidi, a registered dietician and associate professor in the department of nutritional sciences at King\u2019s College in London.",
      "To come up with the new guidelines, the authors analyzed clinical trials and evaluated each method\u2019s effectiveness for managing constipation. The recommendations were jointly published in the Journal of Human Nutrition & Dietetics and Neurogastroenterology & Motility.",
      "What is chronic constipation?",
      "Constipation \u2014 defined by fewer than three bowel movements a week \u2014 is considered chronic if it lasts for more than three months.",
      "Symptoms can vary from person to person, but common ones are hard or lumpy stool, stomachache and nausea. More serious symptoms of constipation include blood in stool, fever and vomiting.",
      "Constipation can be caused by diet, lifestyle, certain illnesses and injuries, and some medications. It\u2019s extremely common, affecting people of all ages, gender and race.",
      "\u201cI see chronic constipation across the spectrum,\u201d said Sue-Ellen Anderson-Haynes, a registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. \u201cI see it in toddlers, I see it in school-age children, I see it in adults. So it\u2019s a common thing,\u201d she said.",
      "Chronic constipation can severely impact people\u2019s lives and limit their physical abilities, worsening their quality of life and work productivity.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re chronically constipated, you may not be able to even participate in physical activity, because you feel bloated, you\u2019re in pain, you\u2019re achy, it may affect your mood,\u201d said Anderson-Haynes, who also owns 360 Girls and Women, a nutrition and health practice based in Boston.",
      "How is chronic constipation treated?",
      "Dr. William Chey, professor of gastroenterology at the University of Michigan and incoming president of the American College of Gastroenterology, said most studies on treating chronic constipation have focused on fiber supplements, like psyllium, and medications, like bisacodyl, senna and amitiza.",
      "He added American guidelines \u201cfocus pretty heavily on medical therapies for chronic constipation.\u201d",
      "Traditional constipation treatments include increasing fiber intake through foods like prunes and other fruits and vegetables, drinking more water, and using different kinds of laxatives.",
      "While the new guidelines include certain fiber-rich foods and fiber supplements, there\u2019s no guidance on a \u201chigh-fiber diet\u201d overall.",
      "\u201cWhen we were building these guidelines, and looking at the literature, we were expecting a lot more evidence on a high-fiber diet, and there simply isn\u2019t enough in constipation,\u201d Dimidi said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of evidence that a high-fiber diet is very beneficial for our overall health and also for elements of gut health, such as reducing the risk of colorectal cancer,\u201d she added. \u201cBut when it comes to constipation, specifically, we just don\u2019t have enough evidence to say that it improves constipation.\u201d",
      "What are the new recommendations?",
      "Chey, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new guidelines, said the recommendations \u201cprovide a valuable road map to things that [people] can try as they\u2019re waiting to see their primary care physician.\u201d",
      "He added that people with more severe cases of constipation may need to see a gastroenterologist.",
      "The recommendations include:",
      "Fiber supplements: More than 10 grams of fiber supplements, such as psyllium, per day can improve stool frequency and consistency and aid in reducing straining. Fiber supplements should be slowly introduced and dosage gradually increased.Probiotics: Certain strains of probiotics, including, B. lactis and Bacillus coagulans Unique IS2, may help some people with symptoms. If taking one, patients should take a supplement of their choice and follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for at least four weeks.Magnesium oxide supplements: 0.5-1.5 grams daily can help with stool frequency and consistency, reduce symptoms such as bloating and abdominal pain and improve overall quality of life. Dosage should start at 0.5 grams per day and be gradually increased weekly.Kiwis: Three daily, with or without the skin, can help improve stool frequency but not consistency.Rye bread: Six to eight slices of rye bread per day can also aid stool frequency, but not consistency. The authors noted that this amount may not be realistic for some people.High mineral-content water: In combination with other treatments, 0.5-1.5 liters per day of high mineral-content water may also help. One of the key minerals in high mineral-content water, magnesium, is a known laxative.",

      "Still, overall, he said, \u201cI think these kinds of recommendations are going to be very helpful.\u201d",
      "Dimidi said she hopes the release of the guidelines can \u201cempower\u201d those with chronic constipation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re hoping [the guidance] means that clinicians are very well-informed and can provide personalized advice to their patients that is very effective,\u201d she said. \u201cBut also that people themselves with constipation can access now evidence-based information, feel empowered to take control of the symptoms and improve a condition that has a tremendous impact on quality of life.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A jubilant Donald Trump celebrated a hard-won ceasefire Monday in the conflict between Israel and Hamas militants, while inviting Middle East leaders to create a lasting peace that unlocks the region\u2019s potential for dramatic economic growth.",
      "As all 20 living hostages rejoined their families in Israel, Trump spoke to the nation's parliament in Jerusalem and marked a momentous breakthrough in a war that began just over two years ago.",
      "The U.S. president who wrung a peace deal from bitter combatants told the Knesset that \u201cthe long and painful nightmare is finally over.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is not only the end of a war,\u201d said Trump, who had arrived in Israel in the morning. \u201cThis is the end of an age of terror and death and the beginning of the age of faith and hope and of God.",
      "\"It\u2019s the start of a grand concord and lasting harmony for Israel and all the nations of what will soon be a truly magnificent region.\u201d",
      "Making it so won\u2019t be easy. Old antagonisms could resurface at any point, jeopardizing the truce that Trump and his advisers brokered over the past few months.",
      "An accusation of bad faith came right away. Family members said Monday that Hamas had released the remains of only four of 28 deceased hostages, breaking a commitment. They called for an \u201cimmediate suspension\u201d of the ceasefire agreement until all the bodies are returned.",
      "Dueling statements from Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also suggested they differed over something as fundamental as whether the fighting was truly over.",
      "Netanyahu, speaking on television Sunday, said, \u201cThe campaign is not over\u201d and that \u201csome of our enemies are trying to recover in order to attack us again.\u201d",
      "Asked about that on Air Force One en route to Israel, Trump told reporters: \u201cThe war is over. The war is over. The war is over, OK? You understand that?\u201d Lest there be any doubt, Trump reinforced the point during his remarks to the Knesset while Netanyahu sat and listened.",
      "\u201cNow you can be a little nicer, Bibi, because you\u2019re not at war anymore, Bibi,\u201d he said, using Netanyahu\u2019s nickname.",
      "After finishing his speech, Trump flew to Egypt to take part in a peace conference with the leaders of 20 nations, posing for pictures in front of a sign proclaiming, \u201cPeace in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "Notably missing from the signing ceremony were the two parties who\u2019d been at war: Hamas and Israel. Trump had invited Netanyahu to the ceremony in Sharm el-Sheikh, but the Israeli leader chose not to attend. His office cited the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah as the reason. Without Netanyahu and a representative from Hamas, the day lacked what often turns out to be an iconic picture at such Middle East peace ceremonies: the U.S. president and the combatants linking arms.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary moment and demonstration of will by an American president: a bid to end the Israeli-Hamas war in Gaza,\u201d Aaron David Miller, a former State Department Middle East analyst and negotiator in Republican and Democratic administrations, said in an interview. \u201cBut to do that you need to climb several very high mountains.\u201d",
      "Richard Goldberg, who served on the White House National Security Council in Trump\u2019s first term, wrote on X: \u201cToday is a celebration. Trump and Netanyahu delivered the opportunity for peace through strength.\u201d",
      "\u201cTomorrow is harder,\u201d he added. \u201cWords like demilitarizing, disarming and de-radicalizing are just words without action. Every step will be filled with pitfalls. Every step will be contested by forces that do not support the Trump vision for peace. By Iran. By the Muslim Brotherhood. By the U.N. By others.\u201d",
      "As for the future, the Trump administration appears to have less of a blueprint than an aspiration. Last month, Trump released a 20-point peace plan that starts with ending the war in Gaza and ends with forging a broader peace between Israel and the Palestinians.",
      "The first part is specific; the latter, vague. The 19th point says that certain conditions that include reconstruction of Gaza and political reform must be met and then, once that happens, \u201cthe conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.\u201d The authors set no hard deadlines or timetables for deciding the Palestinians\u2019 fate.",
      "At home, Trump is enmeshed in a government shutdown with no end in sight. But presidents enjoy far more latitude when it comes to foreign policy, and Trump appears to be savoring his achievement overseas.",
      "A senior administration official traveling with Trump on the quick trip to Israel and Egypt said of the president\u2019s mood: \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever seen him so proud.\u201d",
      "Another official, back in Washington, said: \u201cEveryone is taking great pride in it and wants to be part of it. And it\u2019s an acute reminder that we can do the hard things.\u201d",
      "Trump tapped two confidants to negotiate the deal: his son-in-law Jared Kushner and White House envoy Steve Witkoff, a billionaire real estate developer. Both watched in the Knesset as Trump delivered an hour-long speech, relishing the moment and riffing in ways that made members laugh and applaud in surprise.",
      "\u201cTrump! Trump! Trump,\u201d lawmakers chanted. Some wore his signature piece of campaign memorabilia, a red hat with a twist that read: \u201cTrump, the Peace President.\u201d",
      "Seizing on the good will, Trump made a personal plea to help a friend. Netanyahu is facing trial on corruption charges. Trump went off script to beseech Israeli President Isaac Herzog to pardon the prime minister.",
      "\u201cThis man is a good man right here. I have an idea. Mr. President, why don\u2019t you give him a pardon?\u201d Trump said.",
      "Now that the fighting has stopped and the hostages have been returned, Trump's interest could potentially wane. As the leader with the most leverage in the region, Trump needs to stay involved to make progress on his vision of a transformed Middle East, foreign policy analysts said.",
      "For Trump, there is at least one clear incentive to stay engaged.",
      "He lost out on the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize last week, and his supporters are already lobbying for him to get the award next year.",
      "\"You have to wonder whether he stays with this,\" Miller, the former negotiator, said. \"That will depend primarily on whether there's a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow: the elusive Nobel, which he believes he deserves.\""

      "Some of the longest applause for Trump's speech came when he said that virtually the whole region had endorsed a plan for Gaza to be demilitarized and Hamas to disarm \u2014 key elements of his 20-point plan that have yet to actually be agreed upon.",
      "Now that phase one of his plan is being executed, negotiators and neighboring countries will watch whether key points of Trump\u2019s proposal will be accepted by both Israel and Hamas in talks on the next phases.",
      "Last few days",
      "A ceasefire came into effect in Gaza on Friday at noon local time, (5 a.m. ET), after the first phase of Trump's plan was agreed by Israel and Hamas, bringing relative calm to the enclave for the first time in months since the last truce collapsed in March.",
      "Under the first phase of Trump's plan, 20 living hostages were  handed over to Israel on Monday.  The remains of a further 28 hostages held by Hamas were expected to be released within 72 hours, although only four were initially, much to the disappointment of families.",
      "Israel also pledged to release 250 convicted prisoners and 1,700 Palestinians detained since Oct. 7.  Over 150 of the freed prisoners were deported to Egypt.",
      "More aid has begun to flow into the enclave in recent days, although it falls far short of what aid workers say is necessary.",
      "Now what?",
      "Hamas has long asserted that it would not release the last of the hostages until Israeli groups leave Gaza entirely, but having agreed to the first phase of Trump's plan, the militant group is relying on guarantees from Trump that a full withdrawal will eventually happen.",
      "When and if Israel withdraws fully remains unclear.",
      "Meanwhile, it is also unclear whether Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, will agree to a key stipulation of Trump's overall plan, as well as a crucial demand from Israel \u2014 that it disarm.",
      "Hamas has long refused calls to lay down arms, saying it has a right to armed resistance until Israel ends its occupation of Palestinian territories \u2014 and that has been a key sticking point in talks to negotiate an end to Israel's offensive in Gaza.",
      "In an interview with Al Jazeera on Oct. 9, senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan said that no Palestinian would accept surrendering weapons and that the people of Gaza were in greater need than ever of resistance.",
      "The militant group has agreed to step down from leadership over the territory and relinquish governance to a transitional body of Palestinian technocrats, which would be overseen by an international body, dubbed the \"Board of Peace.\" This body is expected to be headed by Trump, with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair also named as a possible member of the oversight body.",
      "Noting the plan aboard the Air Force One on Monday en route to Israel, Trump said he first wanted to find out whether \"Tony would be popular with all.\"",
      "\"I like Tony, I\u2019ve always liked Tony, but I want to find out that he\u2019s an acceptable choice to everybody,\" he added.",
      "The idea of Blair joining the board has already drawn early criticism, with his reputation in the region shadowed by his decision to back the U.S.-led 2003 invasion of Iraq \u2014 and claims by the U.S. and Britain of Iraq having weapons of mass destruction found to be false.",
      "Trump optimistic",
      "Speaking aboard Air Force One on his way to Israel on Monday, Trump said he believed \"everybody is happy\" with his 20-point peace plan.",
      "Noting that much of Gaza now resembles a \"demolition site\" after more than two years of Israel's offensive in the enclave, Trump said cleanup efforts would begin \"pretty much immediately.\"",

      "\u201cNow, it is time to translate these victories against terrorists on the battlefield into the ultimate prize of peace and prosperity for the entire Middle East,\u201d he said.",

      "Snubbed by the Nobel selection committee, Trump should be the clear front-runner for the prize next year, given the breakthrough he reached toward ending the war in Gaza, his supporters said.",
      "Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., said Friday he would introduce a resolution in Congress saying Trump deserves the honor.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019ll be a strong candidate next year, and he should have been a slam dunk this year, but unfortunately, the committee got it wrong,\u201d Carter said in an interview. \u201cBut they made their decision. So, next year they\u2019ll have an opportunity to make up for it.\u201d",
      "Jason Miller, a former senior Trump campaign official, told NBC News: \u201cThe legacy of the Nobel Peace Prize will be irreparably damaged if it isn\u2019t awarded to President Trump in 2026. The voices calling for President Trump to win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2026 are only going to get louder.\u201d",
      "Few voices were louder than Trump\u2019s in making the case that he\u2019d earned the award this year. The president mounted a rare public campaign to win it based on seven peace deals he says he reached in global hotspots.",
      "He is inching closer to an eighth. A whirlwind bout of U.S.-led diplomacy has culminated in a ceasefire in Gaza. Hamas militants may release the remaining hostages early next week. And Trump plans to fly to the region this weekend to sign the accord and deliver a speech to the Israeli parliament.",
      "Trump has long said he didn\u2019t expect the five-member Norwegian selection committee to give him the award. The betting markets saw it the same way. Early this week, Polymarket, a prediction betting site, had put his odds of winning at 2%.",
      "The deadline for nominating people for the Nobel Prize was Jan. 31 \u2014 11 days into Trump\u2019s new term. Still, the committee was free to consider accomplishments that came later in the year as it winnowed down the candidates, said Nina Graeger, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, who handicaps the top candidates for the prize.",
      "\u201cWill you get the Nobel Prize? Absolutely not,\u201d Trump told an audience of generals and admirals last week. \u201cThey\u2019ll give it to some guy that didn\u2019t do a damn thing.\u201d",
      "But he believed it would be advantageous to strike the Middle East peace deal before the committee revealed the winner, a person who has been in meetings with him said. That way, Trump could make the argument that the committee process was \u201crigged\u201d; a president who ended so many conflicts rightly should have gotten the award that celebrates peace, this person said.",
      "Shortly after the winner was announced, Steven Cheung, the White House communications director, posted on social media that \u201cThe Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace.\u201d",
      "Much can happen in a year\u2019s time. If the peace deal in Gaza doesn\u2019t hold \u2014 if the fighting resumes and more Gazans die in the crossfire \u2014 Trump isn\u2019t likely to get credit for raising false hopes that peace was at hand, foreign policy analysts say.",
      "The committee will want to see if the peace deal that Trump describes as an historic triumph is real or ephemeral.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know if the peace plan will be sustainable and lasting,\u201d Graeger said. \u201cHe definitely should get credit for his efforts to end the war and really engaging with this process. But there are a lot of hurdles in the implementation of the plan.\u201d",
      "A second issue is whether the \u201cAmerica First\u201d president chooses to work more collaboratively with other nations over the coming year. In creating the prize, Swedish inventor and entrepreneur Alfred Nobel held that the winner should be someone who has \u201cdone the most or the best work for fraternity between nations,\u201d among other criteria.",
      "It doesn\u2019t help Trump\u2019s chances that he threatened to acquire Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal, analysts said. Nor is the committee likely to reward him for pulling out of such cross-border endeavors as the Paris climate agreement or the World Health Organization, they said.",
      "K\u00e5re Aas, Norway\u2019s former ambassador to the U.S., said that Trump would be a \u201cstrong contender\u201d for the prize if he ends the Russia-Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas wars. Still, the president wouldn\u2019t be a shoo-in, he added.",
      "Trump\u2019s statements about absorbing Greenland and Canada \u201cwould also be considered by the committee,\u201d Aas said. \u201cThe committee doesn\u2019t necessarily give him the Nobel Peace Prize if there\u2019s peace in Gaza and Ukraine next year.\u201d"

      "The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded Friday to Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, who lives in hiding after attempting to run for the presidency last year against President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Machado, 58, was recognized for keeping \"the flame of democracy burning amidst a growing darkness\" and \"ever-expanding authoritarianism in Venezuela.\"",
      "Despite speculation that President Donald Trump might win the prize for his role helping broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, among other things, Machado emerged as a late favorite in online betting platforms hours before the decision came.",
      "Reacting to the award Friday, White House Communications Director Steven Cheung accused the Nobel Committee of placing \"politics over peace.\"",
      "The winner, Machado, is currently in hiding and faces \"serious threats against her life\" having been blocked from running for president and expelled from office, J\u00f8rgen Watne Frydnes, chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, told a news conference in Oslo.",
      "\u201cOh, my God! I have no words,\u201d she kept repeating when given the news over the telephone by Kristian Berg Harpviken, director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute, who could be seen in a video of the call becoming visibly emotional as he spoke.",
      "\"I hope you understand that this is a movement; this is the achievement of a whole society. I'm just one person. I certainly do not deserve this,\" she said, learning of her accolade just minutes before it was made public. \"I'm honored, humbled and very grateful and behalf of the Venezuelan people. We're not there yet. We are working very hard to achieve it and I'm certain we will prevail.\"",
      "With nicknames such as \"the Lady of Steel\" and \"the Iron Lady,\" she has been among the most high profile victims of Maduro's intensifying crackdown against opposition figures, journalists and civil society during his increasingly repressive rule."

      "LONDON \u2014 Prince William has fought back tears during an emotional conversation with a woman who lost her husband to suicide, in a video released by Kensington Palace Friday.",
      "William, 43, was speaking to campaigner Rhian Mannings at her home in south Wales. Mannings lost her one-year-old son, George suddenly in 2012 to an undiagnosed illness. Five days later, her husband Paul died by suicide. Mannings said Paul blamed himself for their son's death.",
      "Mannings has since used her experience to launch a charity aimed at supporting parents who suffer the loss of a child or young adult.",
      "The video was released on World Mental Health Day to highlight suicide prevention efforts. The Prince and Princess of Wales\u2019 Royal Foundation is launching a new National Suicide Prevention Network, aiming to bring charities together to transform suicide prevention in the U.K. Manning\u2019s charity 2Wish will be part of the network. According to statistics cited in the video, someone in the U.K. dies by suicide every 90 minutes.",
      "\u201cI will forever go over those last few days with him wondering what I missed,\" Mannings says about her Paul's suicide. \"We were just so happy and I think this just shows it really can happen to anyone.\u201d",
      "William, the heir to the throne, asked Mannings what she would say to her late husband if she could.",
      "\u201cI would just like to sit him down like this and just say, \u2018Why didn\u2019t you come to me?\u2019 Because he\u2019s missed out on just so much joy, and we would have been OK. And I think that\u2019s what the hardest thing is, we would have been OK,\u201d Mannings tells William, who then becomes visibly emotional.",
      "\"Are you OK?\" Mannings asks the prince, who takes time to gather himself before continuing. \"It's hard to ask these questions,\" William says.",
      "\u201cThe best way to prevent suicide is to talk about it. Talk about it early, talk about it with your loved ones, those you trust, your friends,\u201d William says."
