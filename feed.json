      "Archivists are about a quarter of the way through cataloging the 150-plus boxes of material that document the 76-year-old filmmaker\u2019s role in bringing to life iconic characters like Indiana Jones and Yoda, and directing actors ranging from Geena Davis and Glenn Close to Morgan Freeman and Kevin Costner.",
      "\u201cAll I wanted to ever do was be a movie director. And so, all the details meant something to me,\u201d Kasdan said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier to have this mass of stuff available to anybody who is interested.\u201d",
      "The archive includes scripts, call sheets and still photos \u2014 including a few rarities.",
      "Before Costner became an Oscar winner and Hollywood icon, he worked various studio jobs while taking nighttime drama lessons. His break \u2014 or so he thought \u2014 came when Kasdan cast him in 1983\u2019s \u201cThe Big Chill.\u201d",

The archive features audio cassette recordings of Kasdan discussing the film with Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. It also includes Polaroids taken of cast and crew members on the sets of his movies.",
      "There are props, too, including a cowboy hat from the 1985 Western \u201cSilverado,\u201d worn by none other than Costner.

      "LOS ANGELES -- Crystal Hern\u00e1ndez steadies her violin and scans the crowd from the sixth floor of SoFi Stadium as 70,000 fans stream into a Los Angeles Rams home game. Below her, blue-and-gold jerseys mix with charro suits and sombreros, and the low rumble of pregame noise swells into the opening notes of the late Ozzy Osbourne\u2019s \u201cCrazy Train\u201d reimagined through trumpets, guitarr\u00f3n and vihuela.",
      "On Hern\u00e1ndez's right, rock guitarist Nita Strauss cuts through with an electric solo as the several-piece mariachi ensemble locked into rhythm. On the concourse, fans stop mid-step, phones raised, caught by the unlikely fusion of rock, mariachi and football.",
      "At games, it's not unusual to hear Kendrick Lamar,Bad Bunny and Beyonc\u00e9's music blaring through the speakers. But the Mariachi Rams are reshaping the sound of NFL game day, blending traditional Mexican music with Los Angeles\u2019 hip-hop and rock influences in a way no other team in the league does.",
      "\u201cMariachi music has so much flexibility and I think that\u2019s special because we get to show how versatile mariachi music is to the NFL audience,\u201d says Hern\u00e1ndez, who is the only woman in the NFL\u2019s first official mariachi band. She's the daughter of Mariachi legend Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez, who built the ensemble when he partnered with the Rams in 2019.",
      "In one moment, they play classic mariachi standards. In the next, they are turning Tupac Shakur\u2019s \u201cCalifornia Love\u201d into a brass-heavy anthem as a lowrider car bounces nearby while fans roar from the stands.",
      "\u201cThe things that come out of our communities, all of our communities, we all represent each other,\u201d says rapper Xzibit, who performed with the USC Marching Band at halftime during the Rams game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He says seeing the Mariachi Rams on the NFL stage speaks to how the culture moves through the city without boundaries.",

      "Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez didn\u2019t land in the Mariachi Rams by accident.",
      "A Rams staffer approached him several years ago with a video of a mariachi group performing at a major soccer match and asked a simple question: \u201cCould this work for football?\u201d recalled the Grammy-nominated musician and founder of Mariachi Sol de Mexico and Mariachi Reyna de Los Angeles, an all-female mariachi ensemble that includes Crystal Hern\u00e1ndez.",
      "Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez didn't hesitate. He believed it could work with the right musicians and musical range. What followed was the formation of a 10-member ensemble built to bridge tradition and modern Los Angeles sound, performing classic mariachi standards alongside reimagined pop and hip-hop anthems from \u201cEl Rey\u201d to Tupac's \u201cCalifornia Love.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's pride and passion,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez says.",
      "The Mariachi Rams are made up of:",
      "Santiago Espinoza (vihuela), Mateo Real (guitar), Joshua Gutierrez (guitarr\u00f3n), Kevin Ramirez (trumpet), Christopher Rubalcava (trumpet), Crystal Hern\u00e1ndez (violin), Adrian Arias (violin), Ricardo Rios (violin), Ricardo Cisneros (violin) and Joaquin Telles (violin).",

      "\u201cWhen they see young musicians on that jumbotron at SoFi playing songs they completely connect with, you can't even imagine the pride they feel,\u201d he says.",
      "While other NFL teams, including the Houston Texans, now feature mariachi bands as part of their cultural programming, the Rams were the first to embed a mariachi ensemble as a recurring game-day element when they launched the Mariachi Rams six years ago. Since then, a handful of teams have followed.",
      "Behind the stadium lights and viral halftime moments are musicians who spend most of their week far from the field teaching students, working in offices, designing graphics or performing in classical orchestras across Southern California.",
      "Several members of the Mariachi Rams teach through Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s mariachi academy. Others balance careers in education, banking, graphic design and orchestral performance before transforming into stadium entertainers on Sundays.",

      "The band\u2019s presence has become so baked into the Rams\u2019 game-day rhythm that fans immediately sense when something changes.",

It's a staple across various neighborhoods through quincea\u00f1eras, weddings, parades, street festivals and championship celebrations. Bringing that sound into SoFi Stadium, Daly says, was about introducing something new to the city in hopes of reflecting what was already there.",
      "\u201cOur main logo is the two letters \u2018Los Angeles.\u2019 It\u2019s LA, right?\u201d Daly says. \u201cYou can\u2019t not celebrate Mexican American culture if you\u2019re an Angeleno. If you don\u2019t understand Mexican American culture, you\u2019re probably not going win over this market.\u201d",
      "For Crystal Hern\u00e1ndez, the meaning of the Mariachi Rams stretches beyond music and game day. It\u2019s about visibility in a space that has rarely made room for women.",
      "\u201cIt makes people feel seen,\u201d she says of the band\u2019s presence at SoFi. \u201cIt makes them feel excited to see that their home team, the Rams, recognizes that and embraces it.\u201d",
      "As the only woman in the group, Hern\u00e1ndez says she stands at the intersection of tradition and change. For her father, the moment is deeply personal, saying she broke the mold for his family's seven generations of male musicians.",
      "Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez believes the band can break barriers too.",
      "\u201cI think it's the beginning of a movement in the NFL,\" he says. \u201cIf these teams know they have Latino fans supporting them, they're going to think of bringing mariachi too.\u201d",

      "NAPLES, Italy -- At long last, vindication is at hand for an Oscar-winning composer who sought to prove he was just as capable of breathing life into Italy\u2019s grand theaters as gritty Hollywood films.",
      "On Friday night, Naples\u2019 Teatro San Carlo will stage Ennio Morricone\u2019s only opera, \u201cPartenope,\u201d three full decades after its composition. It is inspired by the mythical siren who drowned herself after failing to enchant Ulysses, her body washing ashore and becoming a settlement that grew over millennia into the seaside city of Naples.",
      "When Morricone wrote \u201cPartenope\u201d in 1995, he was already the world-famous creator of the theme to the Spaghetti Western \u201cThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly\u201d and haunting soundtracks for epic films such as \u201cThe Untouchables\u201d and \u201cOnce Upon a Time in America.\u201d",
      "He earned an Oscar for lifetime achievement in 2007, but his compositions never resounded in the hallowed halls of opera houses \u2014 viewed in his home country as the elite musical echelon. To his great chagrin, Partenope gathered dust for decades; Morricone died without seeing it performed.",
      "\u201cIn the end, he read as a sign of destiny the fact he would not make his debut in the opera world,\u201d Alessandro De Rosa, a close collaborator who coauthored Morricone's autobiography, said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m sure that if he were alive now, he would have taken the challenge and would have dialogued with the orchestra and the director, tirelessly, like a young kid.\u201d",
      "Director Vanessa Beecroft and conductor Riccardo Frizza had to find their way through the visionary work without the benefit of those notes.",
      "\u201cIt would have been wonderful to be able to talk to Morricone about his musical choices \u2026 but we had to understand them from what he left us and tried to interpret them in the best way,\u201d Frizza said.",
      "For instance, he chose not to use violins in this orchestra, instead favoring flutes, harps and horns, which appear in Greek mythology, Frizza explained.",
      "\u201cThen you have the modern instruments, lots of percussion, with the Neapolitan sounds provided by tambourines and putipu\u2019,\u201d he added, referencing a friction drum used in local folk music.",
      "Teatro San Carlo was filled with anticipation on Thursday evening as Neapolitans attended an open rehearsal. Free tickets were snapped up in just a few hours.",
      "\u201cIt was such a long wait, that\u2019s why we are here today,\u201d said middle-aged Alfonso Ieneroso as he entered the theater.",
      "The mythical Partenope is part of Naples\u2019 culture, with tradition suggesting her voice represents the city\u2019s enduring spirit. The original Greek settlement was named for her. She is depicted at monuments like the Fontana della Sirena, a fountain that has become one of the city's symbols. Young children all along the Gulf of Naples, living under Mount Vesuvius\u2019 shadow, learn the legend of Partenope from their parents.",

      "Naples has also been celebrating its 2,500th anniversary this year, and Morricone\u2019s opera marks the culmination of festivities. The protagonist in his adaptation is a woman who, after her husband dies and she is separated from her best friend, refuses the consolation of being transformed into a distant constellation. Instead, she asks the gods to let her stretch her wings along the gulf on which an immortal city will arise.",
      "The production explores the link between the ancient legend and the modern city\u2019s identity, as two sopranos embody Partenope simultaneously, reflecting her dual nature as body and myth.",
      "Morricone originally composed the one-act opera \u2014 free of charge \u2014 to accompany a libretto by authors Guido Barbieri and Sandro Cappelletto for a small festival in Positano, just south of Naples on the Amalfi coast. But it was not to be: the festival went bankrupt and Partenope was shelved.",
      "There were several attempts to revive their work, including one between 1998 and 2000 with the Teatro Massimo of Palermo. But that project ultimately ran aground when a director couldn\u2019t be secured.",
      "\u201cIn those years Morricone had the torment of not being accepted as a composer of what he called \u2018absolute music,\u2019 as he was identified with his popular movie scores,\u201d Barbieri, one of the libretto\u2019s authors, said in an interview. Cappelletto said that, in a conversation with the two authors in 2017, three years before his death, Morricone appeared \u201cat peace\u201d with his music career.",
      "Partenope has inspired several productions over the centuries, including operas by renowned composers George Frideric Handel and Antonio Vivaldi in the 18th century, and a 2024 movie by Oscar-winning director Paolo Sorrentino. Morricone\u2019s work is finally coming alive to join their ranks.",

      "Charli XCX is heading to the Sundance Film Festival in January 2026",
      "Charli XCX is making a trip to the Sundance Film Festival in January. The pop singer-songwriter appears in three films premiering at the 2026 festival, including a mockumentary that she produced and stars in. Programmers on Wednesday unveiled a lineup of 90 feature films set for the festival\u2019s last hurrah in Park City, Utah.",
      "The slate includes documentaries on basketball great Brittney Griner, Nelson Mandela, Salman Rushdie, Courtney Love and Billie Jean King. There are starry features with the likes of Natalie Portman, Jenna Ortega, Seth Rogen, Channing Tatum, Danielle Brooks, Olivia Colman, Da\u2019Vine Joy Randolph, Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd and Ethan Hawke. Olivia Wilde directs her first feature since \u201cDon\u2019t Worry Darling,\u201d in \u201cThe Invite.\u201d Judd Apatow chronicles comedian Maria Bamford\u2019s mental health journey. And Gregg Araki will be back in Park City with a restoration of his 2004 coming-of-age drama \u201cMysterious Skin\u201d and a new film as well.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a broad, eclectic and bold program,\u201d Sundance public programming director Eugene Hernandez told The Associated Press. He said the lineup for the festival's final year in Park City \u201creally honors that well with this mixture of new, exciting voices paired with some really, really great familiar faces from Sundances past that I think will create a great alchemy for this really unique edition in Utah.\u201d",
      "Ever a festival of discovery, of the 90 features culled from 4,255 submissions, 40% are from first-time directors. The programmers laugh when they hear people say things like \u201cthat\u2019s a Sundance movie,\u201d as if it\u2019s one, easily categorizable thing.",
      "\u201cI look at the films in this program and say, \u2018You tell me what a Sundance film is\u2019 because they\u2019re so different,\u201d said programmer John Nein.",
      "Charli XCX plays a rising pop star prepping for her first arena tour in the mockumentary \u201cThe Moment,\u201d which Hernandez said is \u201clike her version of \u2018This is Spinal Tap\u2019.\u201d She also appears in Araki\u2019s \u201cI Want Your Sex,\u201d in which Cooper Hoffman plays an intern who gets wrapped up in the world of an artist and provocateur (Wilde). And she\u2019s among the ensemble of \u201cThe Gallerist.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of humor that she has about herself and her work, but also a creativity and a star quality that is apparent. I mean, she is magnetic on the screen,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have someone who represents sort of a next generation of creativity embracing the world that we inhabit.\u201d",
      "This year\u2019s slate includes more than a few exciting comedies in unexpected places. Cathy Yan directed and co-wrote \u201cThe Gallerist,\u201d a satirical look at the art world and attempting to sell a corpse at Art Basel Miami, with a large ensemble including Portman, Ortega, Sterling K. Brown and Zach Galifianakis. David Wain also has \u201cGail Daughtry and the Celebrity Sex Pass\u201d about a woman out to even the score after her fiance uses the \u201cfree pass,\u201d starring Zoey Deutch and Jon Hamm.",
      "Programmer Kim Yutani said she thinks \u201cWicker,\u201d about a woman who asks a basket maker to weave her a husband, starring Colman and Skarsg\u00e5rd, will be a big crowd pleaser.",
      "Other standouts are Jay Duplass\u2019s grief-themed \u201cSee You When I See You,\u201d with Cooper Raiff and David Duchovny, \u201cHa-Chan, Shake Your Booty!\u201d set inside Tokyo\u2019s ballroom dance scene and Wilde\u2019s \u201cThe Invite,\u201d about a crumbling marriage in which she stars alongside Rogen.",
      "\u201cThey are finding comedy in some of the toughest places,\u201d Nein said.",
      "In the Midnight section, there\u2019s \u201cBuddy,\u201d from \u201cToo Many Cooks\u201d creator Casper Kelly, about a girl who has to escape a kids TV show. There are some quirky, humorous documentaries too, including \u201cJoybubbles\u201d and John Wilson\u2019s \u201cThe History of Concrete.\u201d",
      "Sundance has become famous for its documentary programming, many of which go on to be nominated for and win Oscars. This year is likely to be no different.",

      "The six nominees for the inaugural best podcast award are \u201cArmchair Expert with Dax Shepard,\u201d \u201cCall Her Daddy,\u201d \u201cGood Hang with Amy Poehler,\u201d \u201cThe Mel Robbins Podcast,\u201d \u201cSmartLess\u201d and \u201cUp First,\u201d from NPR. Representing a mix of news, advice and celebrity interviews, they were drawn from a shortlist of 25 programs the Globes had previously deemed eligible.",
      "The nominations avoided politics or controversy by passing on popular podcasts from the shortlist, such as conservative-leaning programs \u201cThe Megyn Kelly Show,\u201d \u201cThe Tucker Carlson Show,\u201d \u201cThe Ben Shapiro Show,\u201d Candace Owen\u2019s \u201cCandace\u201d and, most notably, \u201cThe Joe Rogan Experience,\u201d which topped Spotify, Apple and YouTube's list of weekly podcast charts this year. The left-leaning \u201cPod Save America\u201d also was snubbed, as were popular true crime podcasts like \u201cMorbid\u201d and \u201cRotten Mango.\u201d",

      "\u201cThey\u2019re trying to bill themselves as an award show that is for the masses and non-controversial, celebrating the best in entertainment. Having this political sideshow, I think they just wanted to avoid that,\u201d he said.",
      "Reaction to the apparent snubbing of politics-related podcasts early Monday was light, with a handful of X users weighing in with criticism that high-ranking programs from personalities like Rogan and \u201cmanosphere\u201d podcaster Theo Von had been left off the final cut. There was no direct reaction from the hosts themselves.",
      "Shapiro had launched an all-out Golden Globes publicity campaign for his decade-old podcast, on which he\u2019s spoken with the likes of U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the past year. In addition to making the rounds with industry publications, Shapiro also secured massive billboard space in New York City\u2019s Times Square.",

      "Many podcast experts were left scratching their heads since the Globes didn't use any categories for its long list and was a bit murky about what constituted a best podcast. Quality of production? Consistency? The stories being told? Raw numbers?",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing for the industry to get more recognition and getting recognition in a major award ceremony is awesome,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cI think that\u2019s cool to see. But the way it\u2019s done, of course, is a very blunt instrument.\u201d",

      "And finally, nearly two hours into a perplexing muddle of a storyline, we have some clarity of thought. No, dear, we want to tell Ella, played by the lovely Emma Mackey, who is truly the only reason to watch any of this. No, your brain is fine (and by the way, what a depressing line to put in the mouth of your most intelligent character \u2014 a hard-working woman in politics). It\u2019s your script you can\u2019t trust, Ella! Run away from it. Now.",
      "It\u2019s hard to understand how \u201cElla McCay,\u201d the first original feature from writer-director Brooks in 15 years, goes so utterly haywire. Is this really the same mind that wrote the memorable \u201cBroadcast News\"? \u201cTerms of Endearment\"? \u201cAs Good As It Gets\u201d? We get a bit of a hint in the studio's press notes, which mention that Brooks began his script \u201cwithout a specific storyline in mind.\u201d",
      "Hmm. Perhaps that (unintentionally) explains this tangle of half-baked characters and subplots \u2014 each more head-scratching than the next, but also boring \u2014 and an ending that's unbelievable, by which we mean not believable. What\u2019s even less believable is that smart supporting actors like Jamie Lee Curtis, Ayo Edebiri, Woody Harrelson and Rebecca Hall didn\u2019t walk out in protest of a lack of coherence. (Well, actually, Hall is gone in a matter of minutes.)",
      "The main action takes place over three days in 2008, in an unnamed state. An aggressively folksy Julie Kavner as narrator tells us Ella is a great person, and super-bright, and at 34, one of the youngest people to serve as lieutenant governor.",
      "She\u2019s also a moral compass \u2014 both in the dog-eat-dog world of politics, where she just wants to pass good laws that help good people \u2014 and in her messed-up family. This family includes her weaselly father (Harrelson, intermittently amusing) who, in a flashback to when Ella was 16, loses his job in a sexual harassment scandal.",
      "Soon after, when Ella\u2019s mother (Hall, wasted) tells her that Dad is moving the family to California, Ella insists on staying put, at her school. She'll live with her loyal and loving Aunt Helen (Curtis), who runs \u2014 of course! \u2014 the diner next door.",
      "Flash forward 18 years, and Ella is summoned by her governor boss (Albert Brooks). He tells her he\u2019s in line for a Cabinet position, which means Ella would be interim governor. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t get this any other way,\u201d he notes, helpfully,",
      "There\u2019s one prickly problem. Ella is enmeshed in scandal; she's been having amorous relations, with her own husband, at lunchtime, in a room that's technically state property. (Yep, this is the best scandal they could come up with.)",

      "The court sentenced him in September to five years in prison, a ruling he appealed. He was granted release under judicial supervision after 20 days behind bars.",
      "The book provides a rare look inside Paris\u2019 La Sant\u00e9 prison, where Sarkozy was held in solitary confinement and kept strictly away from other inmates for security reasons. His loneliness was broken only by regular visits from his wife, supermodel-turned-singer Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, and his lawyers.",
      "Sarkozy wrote that his cell looked like a \u201ccheap hotel, except for the armored door and the bars,\u201d with a hard mattress, a plastic-like pillow and a shower that produced only a thin stream of water. He described the \u201cdeafening noise\u201d of the prison, much of it at night.",

      "Sarkozy said he declined the meals served in small plastic trays along with a \u201cmushy, soggy baguette\u201d \u2014 their smell, he wrote, made him nauseous. Instead, he ate dairy products and cereal bars. He was allowed one hour a day in a small gym room, where he mostly used a basic treadmill.",

      "Paramount has launched a hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros",
      "NEW YORK -- Paramount on Monday launched a hostile takeover offer for Warner Bros. Discovery, initiating a potentially bruising battle with rival bidder Netflix to buy the company behind HBO, CNN and a famed movie studio along with the power to reshape much of the nation's entertainment landscape.",
      "Emerging just days after top Warner managers agreed to Netflix's $72 billion purchase, the Paramount bid seeks to go over the heads of those leaders by appealing directly to Warner shareholders with more money \u2014 $74.4 billion \u2014 and a plan to buy all of Warner's business, including the cable business that Netflix does not want.",
      "Paramount said its decision to go hostile came after it made several earlier offers that Warner management \u201cnever engaged meaningfully\u201d with following the company's October announcement that it was open to selling itself.",
      "In its appeal to shareholders, Paramount noted its offer also contains more cash than Netflix's bid \u2014 $18 billion more \u2014 and argued that it's more likely to pass scrutiny from President Donald Trump's administration, a big concern given his habit of injecting himself in American business decisions.",
      "Over the weekend, Trump said the Netflix-Warner combo \u201ccould be a problem\u201d because of the size of the combined market share and that he planned to review the deal personally.",
      "For its part, Netflix says it is confident Warner will reject the Paramount bid and that regulators, and Trump, will back its deal, citing multiple conversations that co-CEO Ted Sarandos has had with him about the streaming company's expansion and hiring.",
      "\u201cI think the president\u2019s interest in this is the same as ours, which is to create and protect jobs,\" Sarandos said Monday at an investor conference.",
      "The fight for Warner drew strong reaction in Washington, with politicians from both major parties weighing in on the likely impact on streaming prices, movie theater employment and the diversity of entertainment choices and political views.",
      "Paramount, run by David Ellison, whose family is closely allied with Trump, said it had submitted six proposals to Warner over a 12-week period before the latest offer.",
      "\u201cWe believe our offer will create a stronger Hollywood. It is in the best interests of the creative community, consumers and the movie theater industry,\" the Paramount CEO said in a statement. Ellison added that his deal would lead to more competition in the industry, not less, and more movies in theaters.",
      "A regulatory document released Monday suggested another possible Paramount advantage to win over Trump: An investment firm run by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner would be investing in the deal, too.",
      "Also participating would be funds controlled by the governments of three unnamed Persian Gulf countries, widely reported as Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and Qatar. Trump's family company has struck deals this year for buildings and resorts that bear his name in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, partnering in the former with a company closely tied to the government and in the latter with the government fund itself.",
      "Also possibly in Paramount's favor are recent changes at CBS News since its October purchase of the news and commentary website The Free Press. The site's founder, Bari Weiss, who has a reputation for fighting \u201cwoke\u201d culture, was then installed as editor-in-chief in a signal Ellison intended to shake up the storied network of Walter Cronkite, Dan Rather and \u201c60 Minutes,\" long viewed by many conservatives as the personification of a liberal media establishment.",

      "The cash and stock proposal was valued at $27.75 per Warner share, giving it a total enterprise value of $82.7 billion, including debt that will be assumed in the deal. By contrast, the Paramount offer is for $30 per Warner share, and worth $108 billion, included assumed debt. Paramount\u2019s offer is set to expire on Jan. 8 unless it\u2019s extended.",
      "But comparing the two deals is complicated because they are not buying the same thing. The Netflix offer, if it goes through, will only close after Warner completes its previously announced separation of its cable operations. Not included in the deal, which is unlikely to close for at least a year, are networks such as CNN and Discovery.",
      "The federal government has the authority to kill any big media deals if it has antitrust concerns, but such matters are usually left to experts at the Department of Justice. In his decision to get involved personally, Trump has decided, as he has with other government norms, to make a sharp break with precedent.",
      "That worries Usha Haley, a Wichita State University specialist in international business strategy, who noted that Ellison is the son of longtime Trump supporter Larry Ellison, the world\u2019s second-richest person.",

      "The warm scents of gingerbread and pine are holiday favorites, but experts warn they can affect indoor air quality",
      "The warm spices in gingerbread, the woodsy aroma of pine and fir trees, and the fruity tang of mulled wine are smells synonymous with the holiday season. Many people enjoy lighting candles, incense and fireplaces in their homes to evoke the moods associated with these festive fragrances.",
      "Burning scented products may create a cozy ambiance, and in the case of fireplaces, provide light and heat, but some experts want people to consider how doing so contributes to the quality of the air indoors. All flames release chemicals that may cause allergy-like symptoms or contribute to long-term respiratory problems if they are inhaled in sufficient quantities.",
      "However, people don't have to stop sitting by the hearth or get rid of products like perfumed candles and essential oil diffusers, said Dr. Meredith McCormack, director of the pulmonary and critical care medicine division at John Hopkins University\u2019s medical school. Instead, she recommends taking precautions to control the pollutants in their homes.",
      "\u201cClean air is fragrance free,\u201d said McCormack, who has studied air quality and lung health for more than 20 years. \u201cIf having seasonal scents is part of your tradition or evokes feelings of nostalgia, maybe think about it in moderation.\u201d",
      "People in the Northern Hemisphere tend to spend more time indoors during the end-of-year holidays, when temperatures are colder. Indoor air can be significantly more polluted than outdoor air because pollutants get trapped inside and concentrated without proper ventilation or filtration, according to the American Lung Association.",
      "For example, active fireplaces and gas appliances release tiny airborne particles that can get into the lungs and chemicals like nitrogen dioxide, a major component of smog, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Cleaning products, air fresheners and candles also emit air pollutants at varying concentrations.",
      "The risk fragrances and other air pollutants may pose to respiratory health depends on the source, the length and intensity of a person\u2019s exposure, and individual health, McCormack said.",
      "It is also important to note that some pollutants have no smell, so unscented products still can affect indoor air quality, experts say.",
      "Polluted air affects everyone but not equally. Children, older adults, minority populations and people of low socioeconomic status are more likely to be affected by poor air quality because of either physiological vulnerabilities or higher exposure, according to the environmental agency.",
      "Children are more susceptible to air pollution because of their lung size, which means they get a greater dose of exposure relative to their body size, McCormack said. Pollutants inside the home also post a greater hazard to people with heart or lung conditions, including asthma, she said.",
      "Signs of respiratory irritation include coughing, shortness of breath, headaches, a runny nose and sneezing. Experts advise stopping use of pollutant-releasing products or immediately ventilating rooms if symptoms occur.",

      "\u201cThe candle has a calming presence. They are also very symbolic and used in rituals and many religions,\u201d she said.",
      "Wilkowe said she leans toward candles made with soy-based waxes instead of petroleum-based paraffin. Experts note that all lit candles give off air pollutants regardless of what they are made of.",
      "Buying products with fewer ingredients, opening windows if the temperatures allow, and using air purifiers with HEPA filters are ways to reduce exposure to any pollutants from indoor fireplaces, appliances and candle displays, McCormack said. She also recommends switching on kitchen exhaust fans before starting a gas-powered stovetop and using the back burners so the vent can more easily suck up pollutants.",
      "Setting polite boundaries with guests who smoke cigarettes or other tobacco products is also a good idea, she said.",
      "\u201cSmall improvements in air quality can have measurable health benefits,\" McCormack said. \"Similarly to if we exercise and eat a little better, we can be healthier.\u201d",

      "The recorded message will be broadcast at 8 p.m. on Britain\u2019s Channel 4, giving Charles the opportunity to reflect on his experiences in the 22 months since he announced he would undergo treatment for an undisclosed type of cancer.",
      "Charles\u2019 decision to disclose his diagnosis was a departure for Britain\u2019s royals, who have traditionally considered their health to be a personal matter and shared few details with the public.",
      "\u201cHis majesty has chosen to share his diagnosis to prevent speculation and in the hope it may assist public understanding for all those around the world who are affected by cancer,\u201d Buckingham Palace said at the time.",
      "Since then, Charles has used his own story to highlight the need for early diagnosis and treatment. Cancer Research UK recorded a 33% increase in visits to its website in the weeks after the king\u2019s diagnosis, as people sought information about the signs of cancer.",

    "story": [
      "An infant botulism outbreak has sickened at least 39 babies across the U.S. and underscored the crucial role of a medication that treats the rare disease",
      "When Alessandro Barbera was rushed to a California hospital with infant botulism in October, his father had barely heard of the disease, never mind the rare and costly treatment that likely saved the newborn\u2019s life.",
      "Now, however, Tony Barbera is deeply grateful for BabyBIG, the sole antidote to the paralyzing and potentially deadly illnesses linked to contaminated ByHeart infant formula.",
      "\u201cIt is hugely remarkable,\u201d said Barbera, 35, whose son is slowly recovering.",
      "The botulism outbreak tied to ByHeart formula has sickened at least 39 babies across in 18 states since August \u2014 and showed the value of the treatment made from blood plasma donated by a small group of scientists and other volunteers.",
      "\u201cThis is almost like a miracle,\u201d said Dr. Vijay Viswanath, a pediatric neurologist at Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles, who has treated several children with botulism during his career \u2014 including one in the current outbreak.",
      "\u201cPrior to the discovery of BabyBIG, some of these hospitalizations would take two or three months,\u201d Viswanath said, if infected children recovered at all.",
      "Licensed in 2003, BabyBIG is the brand name for human botulism immune globulin, an IV medication that uses antibodies from volunteers vaccinated against botulism to help babies too young to fight the disease on their own.",
      "The treatment was the brainchild of the late Dr. Stephen Arnon, who was a scientist with the California Department of Public Health. In 1976, Arnon and colleagues identified the rare form of botulism that affects infants younger than 1 \u2014 and then spent his 45-year career figuring out how to treat it. The disease occurs when babies ingest botulism spores that germinate in the intestine and produce a dangerous toxin that attacks the nervous system.",
      "More than 3,700 children worldwide have been treated with BabyBIG since Arnon and his team conducted a pivotal clinical trial in California in 1997 that showed the medication could shorten hospital stays and reduce the need for breathing machines.",
      "Produced in small batches every five years, BabyBIG costs nearly $70,000 per treatment, according to the California Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program, which Arnon founded. Under state law, fees from the sale of the drug are used only to fund the botulism program.",
      "The medication relies on donors like Nancy Shine, a 76-year-old retired biochemist in California who was vaccinated against botulism because she worked with the lethal germ in a lab. Arnon first recruited Shine and other scientists for the BabyBIG project two decades ago because their blood produced high levels of antibodies, the blood proteins that neutralize the botulism toxin.",
      "The early protocol required the volunteers to receive boosters doses of an investigational botulism vaccine also used by the U.S. military and then undergo a procedure that harvests the blood plasma that contains antibodies against botulism types A and B.",

      "Still, Shine contributed to three batches of the antitoxin produced between 2008 and 2019.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s probably the highlight of my career that I actually was able to participate in this project and donate plasma,\u201d Shine said. \u201cWe made a product that could save infants\u2019 lives.\u201d",
      "Because infant botulism is rare, with fewer than 200 cases reported in the U.S. each year, finding funding and other resources to develop the BabyBIG treatment took nearly 15 years and $10.6 million \u2014 and faced substantial hurdles, Arnon noted in a 2007 article.",
      "Today, about 30 people on average provide plasma for each batch of BabyBIG, California health officials said. Batch 8, the latest edition, is being manufactured now at a Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. plant near Los Angeles, according to Giles Platford, president of the company's plasma-derived therapies unit. The company contracts with California officials to produce BabyBIG on a \u201cnot-for-profit basis,\u201d Platford said.",
      "Some of the earliest donors, like Shine, have aged out of the BabyBIG program, which collects blood from adult volunteers up to age 70. New donors are accepted, but they must enroll in a clinical study directed by the California health department and agree to receive a booster dose of a different investigational botulism vaccine.",
      "California officials estimate they have enough BabyBIG in reserve to last until next summer, based on current projections. The ByHeart outbreak is part of a worrisome rise of at least 107 infant botulism cases treated in the U.S. since August, said Dr. Jessica Khouri, senior medical officer for the state program.",
      "Shine recently received a booklet filled with photos and letters from families whose children have recovered from botulism after receiving BabyBIG.",
      "\u201cIt's really wonderful. I read a couple each day,\" she said. \u201cEvery single one of them makes you want to cry.\u201d",

      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said investigators \u201ccannot rule out the possibility that contamination might have affected all ByHeart formula products\u201d ever made.",

The new case definition includes \u201cany infant with botulism who was exposed to ByHeart formula at any time since the product's release,\u201d according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The most recent illness was reported on Dec. 1.",
      "No deaths have been reported in the outbreak, which was announced Nov. 8.",
      "Previously, health officials had said the outbreak included 39 suspected or confirmed cases of infant botulism reported in 18 states since August. That's when officials at California's Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program reported a rise in treatment of infants who had consumed ByHeart formula. With the expanded definition, the CDC identified 10 additional cases that occurred from December 2023 through July 2025.",
      "ByHeart, a New York-based manufacturer of organic infant formula founded in 2016, recalled all its products sold in the U.S. on Nov. 11. The company, which accounts for about 1% of the U.S. infant formula market, had been selling about 200,000 cans of the product each month.",
      "News that ByHeart products could have been contaminated for years was distressing to Andi Galindo, whose 5-week-old daughter, Rowan, was hospitalized in December 2023 with infant botulism after drinking the formula. Galindo, 36, of Redondo Beach, California, said she insisted on using ByHeart formula to supplement a low supply of breast milk because it was recommended by a lactation consultant as \u201cvery natural, very gentle, very good for the babies.\"",
      "\u201cThat's a hard one,\u201d Galindo said. \u201cIf there is proof that there were issues with their manufacturing and their plant all the way back from the beginning, that is a problem and they really need to be held accountable.\"",
      "Amy Mazziotti, 43, of Burbank, California, said her then-5-month-old son, Hank, fell ill and was treated for botulism in March, weeks after he began drinking ByHeart. Being included in the investigation of the outbreak \u201cfeels like a win for all of us,\u201d she said Wednesday.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve known in my gut from the beginning that ByHeart was the reason Hank got sick, and to see that these cases are now part of the investigation brings me to tears \u2014 a mix of relief, gratitude and hope that the truth is finally being recognized,\u201d she said.",
      "ByHeart officials did not immediately respond to questions about the expanded outbreak.",
      "The FDA sent inspectors last month to ByHeart plants in Allerton, Iowa, and Portland, Oregon, where the formula is produced and packaged. The agency has released no results from those inspections.",
      "The company previously reported that tests by an independent laboratory showed that 36 samples from three different lots contained the type of bacteria that can cause infant botulism.",
      "\u201cWe cannot rule out the risk that all ByHeart formula across all product lots may have been contaminated,\u201d the company wrote on its website last month.",
      "Those results and discussions with the FDA led CDC officials to expand the outbreak, according to Dr. Jennifer Cope, a CDC scientist leading the investigation.",
      "\u201cIt looks like the contamination appeared to persist across all production runs, different lots, different raw material lots,\u201d Cope said. \u201cThey couldn't isolate it to specific lots from a certain time period.\u201d",

      "North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein is canceling Medicaid rate cuts he initiated two months ago",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina Democratic Gov. Josh Stein is canceling Medicaid reimbursement rate reductions he initiated two months ago, a decision that protects short-term access to care for vulnerable patients while a political fight with Republican legislators to enact additional funding is resolved.",
      "Stein and state Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Dev Sangvai announced Wednesday the state agency would restore reimbursement rates for doctors, hospitals and other medical providers of Medicaid services that otherwise generally had been cut by 3% to 10% starting Oct. 1.",
      "The governor had said the reductions were needed to deal with a funding shortfall for Medicaid, which serves more than 3 million people in the ninth-largest state. But legal challenges to the reductions that have resulted recently in judicial rulings demanding some rates return to pre-October levels make maintaining the reductions untenable.",
      "\u201cWhat has not changed is the program doesn\u2019t have enough money. What has changed is that the courts have made very clear that the rates have to go back,\u201d Stein told The Associated Press in an interview.",
      "The first-year governor had said the reductions, while painful for Medicaid patients and providers, were unavoidable because a stopgap spending measure the legislature approved in the summer fell $319 million short of what was needed to address population changes and rising health care costs.",
      "\u201cThe legislature forced these cuts onto the program,\u201d Stein said. \u201cIt was absolutely nothing that the department or I wanted to have happen.\u201d",
      "Republican legislators said Stein's actions were unnecessary, unprecedented early in the fiscal year and politically motivated. Still, state House and Senate GOP leaders tried but could not work out this fall legislation to provide extra money that would sustain the program longer.",
      "Stein attempted in recent weeks to pressure lawmakers to act \u2014 even by formally calling a special legislative session last month. But House Speaker Destin Hall and Senate leader Phil Berger refused to convene, saying Stein had failed to meet the qualifications for such an extraordinary session.",
      "The governor was pushed to relent as Medicaid consumers such as children with autism and providers like adult care homes have successfully sued the health department so far and blocked certain rate reductions.",
      "The plaintiffs accused the state of violating laws by reducing rates unilaterally and discriminating against those with disabilities. A host of groups representing thousands of doctors and other service providers filed their own challenges last week to block the rates more broadly.",
      "As part of the reversal, Sangvai said, the providers will receive retroactively reimbursements for the difference between the reduced and full rates for claims that were filed after the reductions took effect.",

North Carolina remains the only state without an enacted budget, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. A budget was supposed to be in place July 1.",
      "House and Senate Republicans separately agreed in September they would provide an additional $190 million to the Medicaid program. But senators also wanted legislation to allocate previously received federal money to help build a standalone children\u2019s hospital in Wake County by two university medical schools and for rural health investments. Despite previously spending toward these projects, House Republicans are now having second thoughts about completing these investments.",
      "The legislature had already planned to convene next week, but any action or recorded votes is unlikely. Stein said restoring the rates only adds to the urgency for legislators to act and locate more funds.",
      "\u201cIf the legislature would simply do its job and pass a budget that fully funded Medicaid, we never would have had to start this entire enterprise,\u201d Stein said.",
      "Sangvai acknowledged the program would not run out of money until the spring. But he said restoring the rates means his agency is left only with scaling back or eliminating programs and services to find significant savings.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really a situation we hate to consider because the consequences could in fact be catastrophic,\u201d Sangvai said.",

      "Iran has introduced a new pricing tier for its subsidized gasoline, marking the first price adjustment since 2019",
      "TEHRAN, Iran -- Iran introduced a new pricing tier Saturday for its nationally subsidized gasoline, attempting to rein in spiraling costs for the first time since a price hike in 2019 that sparked nationwide protests and a crackdown that reportedly killed over 300 people.",
      "Cheap gasoline has been viewed for generations as a birthright in Iran, sparking mass demonstrations as far back as 1964 when a price increase forced the shah to put military vehicles on the streets to replace those of striking taxi drivers.",
      "But Iran\u2019s theocracy faces a growing squeeze from the country\u2019s rapidly depreciating rial currency and economic sanctions imposed due to Tehran\u2019s nuclear program.",
      "That has made the cost of having some of the world\u2019s cheapest gasoline at a few pennies per gallon that much more expensive. However, the government\u2019s hesitant move toward increasing prices likely signals it wants to avoid any confrontation with the nation\u2019s exhausted public after Israel launched a 12-day war on the country in June.",
      "\u201cOur discontent has no result,\u201d fumed Saeed Mohammadi, a teacher who works as a taxi driver in his spare time to make ends meet. \u201cThe government does whatever it likes. They don\u2019t ask people if they agree or not.\u201d",
      "The new pricing system implemented Saturday adds a third pricing level to the country\u2019s long-running subsidy system. The revised structure allows motorists to continue receiving 60 liters (15 gallons) per month at the subsidized rate of 15,000 rials per liter, or 1.25 U.S. cents, and the next 100 liters (26 gallons) will remain at 30,000 rials a liter, or 2.5 cents.",
      "Anything purchased beyond that falls under the new pricing scheme of 50,000 rials per liter, or about 4 cents. Iran introduced fuel rationing back in 2007, but that has yet to ease demand for the ultracheap gasoline.",
      "Even at that new rate, Iranian gasoline prices remain among the lowest in the world.",
      "The difference between the cost of production and delivering the fuel and the price at the pump is the subsidy paid by Iran\u2019s government. The Paris-based International Energy Agency ranked Iran as paying the world\u2019s second-highest energy subsidy costs in 2022, behind only Russia. The IEA put Iran\u2019s oil subsidies at $52 billion that year, with Iranian officials acknowledging tens of billions of dollars a year go toward artificially keeping energy prices low.",
      "Tehran-based economist Hossein Raghfar said that since 2009, the price of gasoline has grown 15-fold, offering a pessimistic view of the government\u2019s subsidies.",
      "\u201dNot only did it fail in lessening the budget deficit, but it also trapped the country\u2019s economy in a negative loop of inflation and budget deficit,\u201d he said.",
      "Hamid Rezapour, a 35-year-old bank teller, said he believed Iran\u2019s government had \u201cno choice except to increase the price to manage the country\u2019s economy.\u201d",

      "Security forces cracked down on demonstrations across 100 cities and towns, with some protesters burning down gas stations and banks. The crackdown that followed killed at least 321 people, according to Amnesty International. Thousands were detained.",

      "The demonstration, called by Orb\u00e1n's top rival, P\u00e9ter Magyar, came in response to videos published this week depicting employees of a juvenile correction facility in Budapest physically abusing children housed there. The former head of the facility, who is in police custody on suspicion of operating a prostitution ring among other crimes, has also been accused of subjecting minors to physical and sexual abuse.",
      "Police raided the correction center this week, though critics have accused Orb\u00e1n's government of failing to act despite reports of misconduct going back years. Magyar, whose center-right Tisza party is polling ahead of Orb\u00e1n's Fidesz in most independent surveys, has jumped on the case and accused the government of failing to protect vulnerable children, and called on Orb\u00e1n to resign. Elections are expected to take place in April.",
      "The Hungarian government's communications office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The crowd Saturday gathered in cold temperatures in central Budapest and marched solemnly across the Danube River. Many marchers lit torches as dusk fell, and began climbing toward Orb\u00e1n's offices on Castle Hill.",

      "The scandal represented a rare moment of weakness for Orb\u00e1n, who has led Hungary with near total power since returning to office in 2010. Magyar, a former insider within Orb\u00e1n's Fidesz party, burst into Hungary's political spotlight as the case unfolded, accusing the government of misconduct and corruption.",
      "Addressing the crowd assembled outside the government's executive headquarters on Saturday, Magyar drew parallels between last year's pardon scandal and the more recent child abuse allegations, saying: \"Twenty-two months ago, a country put a question to the Hungarian government: Can it change and improve the situation of children, or will it remain an accomplice of child abusers?\u201d",
      "\u201cOrb\u00e1n\u2019s government promised everything, but since then, unfortunately, it turned out that every member of the Orb\u00e1n government took the side of the abusers,\" Magyar said.",

      "Still, several government figures, including Orb\u00e1n, have emphasized that the juvenile residents of the facility had been placed there because they'd committed crimes or engaged in other misconduct, depicting the institution as a prison for minors.",

      "Included were a few groups of inmates who received special permission to participate, according to the Italian penitentiary chaplain\u2019s association.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- In the age of dinosaurs \u2014 before whales, great whites or the bus-sized megalodon \u2014 a monstrous shark prowled the waters off what's now northern Australia, among the sea monsters of the Cretaceous period.",
      "Researchers studying huge vertebrae discovered on a beach near the city of Darwin say the creature is now the earliest known mega-predator of the modern shark lineage, living 15 million years earlier than enormous sharks found before.",
      "And it was huge. The ancestor of today\u2019s 6-meter (20-foot) great white shark was thought to be about 8 meters (26 feet) long, the authors of a paper published in the journal Communications Biology said.",
      "\u201cCardabiodontids were ancient, mega-predatory sharks that are very, very common from the later part of the Cretaceous, after 100 million years ago,\u201d said Benjamin Kear, the senior curator in paleobiology at the Swedish Museum of Natural History and one of the study\u2019s authors. \u201cBut this has pushed the time envelope back of when we\u2019re going to find absolutely enormous cardabiodontids.\u201d",
      "Sharks have a 400-million-year history but lamniforms, the ancestors of today\u2019s great white sharks, appear in the fossil record from 135 million years ago. At that time they were small \u2014 probably only a meter in length \u2014 which made the discovery that lamniforms had already become gigantic by 115 million years ago an unexpected one for researchers.",
      "The vertebrae were found on coastline near Darwin in Australia\u2019s far north, once mud from the floor of an ancient ocean that stretched from Gondwana \u2014 now Australia \u2014 to Laurasia, which is now Europe. It\u2019s a region rich in fossil evidence of prehistoric marine life, with long-necked plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs among the creatures discovered so far.",
      "The five vertebrae that launched the quest to estimate the size of their mega-shark owners were not a recent discovery, but an older one that had been somewhat overlooked, Kear said. Unearthed in the late 1980s and 1990s, the fossils measured 12 centimeters (4.7 inches) across and had been stored in a museum for years.",
      "When studying ancient sharks, vertebrae are prizes for paleontologists. Shark skeletons are made of cartilage, not bone, and their fossil record is mostly made up of teeth, which sharks shed throughout their lives.",
      "\u201cThe importance of vertebrae is they give us hints about size,\u201d Kear said. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to scale it from teeth, it\u2019s difficult. Are the teeth big and the bodies small? Are they big teeth with big bodies?\u201d",

      "That is bad news for European carmakers like Porsche, Aston Martin, Mercedes-Benz and BMW that have long dominated the upper reaches of the world's largest auto market.",

      "While luxury auto sales have slowed, Chinese manufacturers, including electric vehicle maker BYD, have become more aggressive than many Western brands in technological innovation, frequently rolling out new electric vehicles and hybrids at cheaper prices, including premium vehicles, analysts said.",
      "\u201cTheir (Chinese carmakers\u2019) products are more competitive and more affordable even in the premium segment,\u201d Yuan said. \u201cThat\u2019s why these foreign brands are gradually losing momentum.\u201d",

      "Chileans are headed to the polls and even detractors of ultra-conservative former lawmaker Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast say the candidate is now almost certain to become Chile\u2019s next leader",
      "SANTIAGO, Chile -- As Chileans head to vote on Sunday, even detractors of ultra-conservative former lawmaker Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast say the candidate whose radical ideas lost him the past two elections is now almost certain to become Chile\u2019s next leader.",
      "Kast\u2019s meaningful lead in the polls over his rival in the presidential runoff, communist Jeannette Jara, shows how the hard-liner agitating for mass deportations of immigrants has seized the mantle of the traditional right in a country that once defined its post-dictatorship democratic revival with a vow to contain such political forces.",
      "But much is also up for grabs about Chile\u2019s political direction.",
      "Kast's claim to a popular mandate depends on his margin of victory on Sunday over Jara, the center-left governing party candidate who narrowly beat him in the first round of elections last month.",
      "Although various right-wing parties won around 70% of the vote in that election, substantial support for a populist center-right candidate who described himself as an alternative to Kast\u2019s \u201cfascism\u201d revealed that, between the contrasting ideologies of the front-runners, sit hundreds of thousands of centrist voters with no real representation.",
      "\u201cBoth are too extreme for me,\u201d said Juan Carlos Pileo, 44, who plans to cast a blank ballot Sunday, as voting is now mandatory in Chile\u2019s elections. \u201cI can\u2019t trust someone who says she\u2019s a communist to be moderate. And I can\u2019t trust someone who exaggerates the amount of crime we have in this country and blames immigrants to be fair and respectful.\u201d",
      "It remains a question whether Kast, an admirer of U.S. President Donald Trump, can implement his more grandiose promises.",
      "They include slashing $6 billion in public spending over just 18 months without eliminating social benefits, deporting over 300,000 immigrants in Chile with no legal status and expanding the powers of the army to fight organized crime in a country still haunted by Gen. Augusto Pinochet\u2019sbloody military dictatorship from 1973 to 1990.",
      "For one, Kast\u2019s far-right Republican Party lacks a majority in Congress, meaning that he\u2019ll need to negotiate with moderate right-wing forces that could bristle at those proposals, significantly shaping policy and his own legacy.",
      "Political compromises could temper Kast\u2019s radicalism, but also jeopardize his position with voters who expect him to deliver quickly on his law-and-order campaign promises.",
      "At each campaign event, Kast has taken to ticking off the number of days remaining until Chile's March 11 presidential inauguration, warning they should get out before they'll \"have to leave with just the clothes on their backs.\u201d",
      "Jorge Rubio, 63, a Chilean banker in downtown Santiago, the capital, said he's \u201calso counting down the days.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re voting for Kast,\" he said.",
      "As the pandemic shuttered borders, transnational criminal organizations like Tren de Aragua seized illegal migration routes to gain a foothold in Chile, long considered among Latin America's safest countries.

Boric went from criticizing the use of police force on the campaign trial to pouring money into the security forces.

Their once-bustling communities have fallen largely silent except for the distant rumble of firing across the fields.",
      "Yet in several of these villages, where normally a few hundred people live, a few dozen residents have chosen to stay behind despite the constant sounds of danger.",
      "In a village in Buriram province, about 6 miles (10 kilometers) from the border, Somjai Kraiprakon and roughly 20 of her neighbors gathered around a roadside house, keeping watch over nearby homes. Appointed by the local administration as Village Security Volunteers, they guarded the empty homes after many residents were forced to flee and with fewer security officials stationed nearby than usual.",
      "The latest large-scale fighting derailed a ceasefire pushed by U.S. President Donald Trump, which halted five days of clashes in July triggered by longstanding territorial disputes. As of Saturday, around two dozen people had been reported killed in the renewed violence.",
      "At a house on the village\u2019s main intersection, now a meeting point, kitchen and sleeping area, explosions were a regular backdrop, with the constant risk of stray ammunition landing nearby. Somjai rarely flinched, but when the blasts came too close, she would sprint to a makeshift bunker beside the house, built on an empty plot from large precast concrete drainage pipes reinforced with dirt, sandbags and car tires.",
      "She volunteered shortly after the July fighting. The 52-year-old completed a three-day training course with the district administration that included gun training and patrol techniques before she was appointed in November.

      "LONDON -- In the past year, tens of thousands hostile to immigrants marched through London chanting \u201csend them home!\u201d A British lawmaker complained of seeing too many non-white faces on TV. And senior politicians advocated the deportation of longtime U.K. residents born abroad.",
      "The overt demonization of immigrants and those with immigrant roots is intensifying in the U.K. \u2014 and across Europe \u2014 as migration shoots up the political agenda and right-wing parties gain popularity.",
      "In several European countries, political parties that favor mass deportations and depict immigration as a threat to national identity come at or near the top of opinion polls: Reform U.K., the Alliance for Germany and France\u2019s National Rally.",
      "President Donald Trump, who recently called Somali immigrants in the U.S. \u201cgarbage\u201d and whose national security strategy depicts European countries as threatened by immigration, appears to be endorsing and emboldening Europe's coarse, anti-immigrant sentiments.",
      "Amid the rising tensions, Europe's mainstream parties are taking a harder line on migration and at times using divisive language about race.",
      "\u201cWhat were once dismissed as being at the far extreme end of far-right politics has now become a central part of the political debate,\u201d said Kieran Connell, a lecturer in British history at Queen\u2019s University Belfast.",
      "Immigration has risen dramatically over the past decade in some European countries, driven in part by millions of asylum-seekers who have come to Europe fleeing conflicts in Africa, the Middle East and Ukraine.",
      "Asylum-seekers account for a small percentage of total immigration, however, and experts say antipathy toward diversity and migration stems from a mix of factors. Economic stagnation in the years since the 2008 global financial crisis, the rise of charismatic nationalist politicians and the polarizing influence of social media all play a role, experts say.",
      "In Britain, there is \u201ca frightening increase in the sense of national division and decline\u201d and that tends to push people toward political extremes, said Bobby Duffy, director of the Policy Unit at King\u2019s College London. It took root after the financial crisis, was reinforced by Britain's debate about Brexit and deepened during the COVID-19 pandemic, Duffy said.",
      "Social media has exacerbated the mood, notably on X, whose algorithm promotes divisive content and whose owner, Elon Musk, approvingly retweets far-right posts.",
      "Across Europe, ethnonationalism has been promoted by right-wing parties such as Alliance for Germany, France\u2019s National Rally and the Fidesz party of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n.",
      "Now it appears to have the stamp of approval from the Trump administration, whose new national security strategy depicts Europe as a collection of countries facing \u201ceconomic decline\u201d and \u201ccivilizational erasure\u201d because of immigration and loss of national identities.",
      "The hostile language alarmed many European politicians, but also echoed what they hear from their countries' far-right parties.",
      "National Rally leader Jordan Bardella told the BBC he largely agreed with the Trump administration\u2019s concern that mass immigration was \u201cshaking the balance of European countries.\u201d",
      "Policies once considered extreme are now firmly on the political agenda. Reform UK, the hard-right party that consistently leads opinion polls, says if it wins power it will strip immigrants of permanent-resident status even if they have lived in the U.K. for decades. The center-right opposition Conservatives say they will deport British citizens with dual nationality who commit crimes.",
      "A Reform UK lawmaker complained in October that advertisements were \u201cfull of Black people, full of Asian people.\u201d Conservative justice spokesman Robert Jenrick remarked with concern that he \u201cdidn\u2019t see another white face\u201d in an area of Birmingham, Britain\u2019s second-largest city Neither politician had to resign.",
      "Many proponents of reduced immigration say they are concerned about integration and community cohesion, not race. But that's not how it feels to those on the receiving end of racial abuse.",

While most have been deported, 1,655 are still in detention, he said.",

      "Controversy arose even before his trial started. Lai's trial, originally scheduled to start in December 2022, was postponed to 2023 as authorities barred a British lawyer from representing Lai, citing that it would likely pose national security risks.",
      "In August, Pang said Lai had experienced heart palpitations and was given a heart monitor. His children raised concerns over his deteriorating health. The government said a medical examination of Lai found no abnormalities following his heart problems and that the medical care he received in custody was adequate.",
      "The security law authorizes a range of sentences depending on the seriousness of the offense and the defendant\u2019s role in it, from three years for the less serious to 10 years to life for people convicted of \u201cgrave\u201d offenses.",
      "If Lai is convicted, sentencing is expected on a later day. He can appeal the outcome.",

      "The giant alabaster statues, known as the Colossi of Memnon, were reassembled in a renovation project that lasted about two decades. They represent Amenhotep III, who ruled ancient Egypt about 3,400 years ago.",
      "\u201cToday we are celebrating, actually, the finishing and the erecting of these two colossal statues,\u201d Mohamed Ismail, secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, told The Associated Press ahead of the ceremony.",
      "Ismail said the colossi are of great significance to Luxor, a city known for its ancient temples and other antiquities. They\u2019re also an attempt to \u201crevive how this funerary temple of king Amenhotep III looked like a long time ago,\u201d Ismail said.",
      "Amenhotep III, one of the most prominent pharaohs, ruled during the 500 years of the New Kingdom, which was the most prosperous time for ancient Egypt. The pharaoh, whose mummy is showcased at a Cairo museum, ruled between 1390\u20131353 BC, a peaceful period known for its prosperity and great construction, including his mortuary temple, where the Colossi of Memnon are located, and another temple, Soleb, in Nubia.",
      "The colossi were toppled by a strong earthquake in about 1200 BC that also destroyed Amenhotep III\u2019s funerary temple, said Mohamed Ismail, secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities.",
      "They were fragmented and partly quarried away, with their pedestals dispersed. Some of their blocks were reused in the Karnak temple, but archaeologists brought them back to rebuild the colossi, according to the Antiquities Ministry.",
      "In late 1990s, an Egyptian German mission, chaired by German Egyptologist Hourig Sourouzian, began working in the temple area, including the assembly and renovation of the colossi.",
      "\u201cThis project has in mind \u2026 to save the last remains of a once-prestigious temple,\u201d she said.",

The 35-hectare (86-acre) complex is believed to be the largest and richest temple in Egypt and is usually compared to the temple of Karnak, also in Luxor.",
      "The colossi were hewn in Egyptian alabaster from the quarries of Hatnub, in Middle Egypt. They were fixed on large pedestals with inscriptions showing the name of the temple, as well as the quarry.",
      "Unlike other monumental sculptures of ancient Egypt, the colossi were partly compiled with pieces sculpted separately, which were fixed into each statue\u2019s main monolithic alabaster core, the ministry said.",
      "Sunday\u2019s unveiling in Luxor came just six weeks after the inauguration of the long-delayed Grand Egyptian Museum, the centerpiece of the government\u2019s bid to boost the country\u2019s tourism industry and bring cash into the troubled economy.

Augusto Pinochet devastated their communities by terminating collective property, allowing for the confiscation and sale of their lands to forestry companies.",

Left-wing President Gabriel Boric came to power vowing to remove troops from their land and replace the dictatorship-era constitution with one enshrining their rights.",
      "But Boric soon redeployed the military. Armed Mapuche groups attacked security forces. The government extended a state of emergency. Voters rejected the proposed constitution that would have ushered in radical social change.",
      "The Mapuche conflict simmering in the rolling hills and verdant forests of the southern region of Araucan\u00eda is one of the more delicate issues facing the next president of Chile.",
      "But unlike in past presidential elections, possible solutions to the unrest have barely been mentioned in a campaign focused on voters\u2019 fears about organized crime and illegal migration to the exclusion of almost everything else.",
      "When the Mapuches have come up, it has been in the context of plans for a harsh security crackdown.",
      "The latest version of Kast's platform promised that his government would \u201cuse all constitutional, legal and administrative tools; all intelligence and technology; all force and resources to eradicate terrorism in the region.\"",

      "\u201cThey are cowards who attack at night with their faces covered and forgive nothing, respect no one\u2019s rights,\" Kast said of Mapuche militants who have carried out sabotage attacks against soldiers and forestry companies that they see as invading their ancestral lands.",

      "With \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d arriving Friday, it was a relatively quiet weekend in theaters. There were no major new releases, leaving holdovers \u201cZootopia 2\u201d and \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2\u201d to duke it out for the top spot.",
      "The edge went to \u201cZootopia 2,\u201d which has quickly amassed $1.14 billion in global ticket sales thanks significantly to its enormous success in China. There, it\u2019s grossed $502.4 million, making \u201cZootopia 2\u201d the biggest Hollywood hit in the country in years.",

Still, with a domestic total of $95.5 million, the $36 million production is a big win for Blumhouse, adding another horror franchise to its portfolio.",
      "The weekend\u2019s most notable new release was James L. Brook\u2019s \u201cElla McCay,\u201d his first directed film in 15 years. \u201cElla McCay\u201d earned a scant $2.1 million from 2,500 locations, making it one of the year\u2019s worst wide releases.",

      "The federal government\u2019s crackdown on commercial driver\u2019s licenses for immigrants has now found problems in eight states in the wake of several deadly crashes",
      "The federal government's crackdown on commercial driver's licenses for immigrants has found problems in eight states so far in the wake of several deadly crashes.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has publicly threatened to withhold millions in federal money from California, Pennsylvania, Minnesota and now New York after investigations found problems such as licenses that remained valid long after an immigrant's legal status expired. But the department quietly also sent letters detailing similar concerns to Texas, South Dakota, Colorado and Washington during the government shutdown after briefly mentioning those states in September.",
      "Concerns about immigrant truck drivers gained attention after a tractor-trailer driver who was not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused an August crash in Florida that killed three people. A fiery California crash that also killed three people in October and involved a truck driver in the country illegally added to the worries.",
      "Duffy proposed new restrictions in September that would severely limit which noncitizens could get a license to drive a semi or a bus, but a court has put the new rules on hold.",
      "In addition, the Trump administration has been seeking to enforce existing English language requirements for truckers since the summer. As of October, about 9,500 truck drivers have been pulled off the road nationwide for failing to demonstrate English proficiency during traffic stops or inspections.",
      "Here's a summary of what has happened so far:",
      "The Transportation Department focused first on California because the driver in the Florida crash got a license there. He also went to California after the crash and had to be extradited to face charges.",
      "California fought back after Duffy threatened to pull $160 million from the state. Gov. Gavin Newsom sparred with Duffy in statements and social media posts defending the state's practices by saying California officials had verified the immigration status of all these drivers through federal databases, as required.",
      "But after that back-and-forth, California revoked 17,000 commercial driver's licenses last month after confirming problems with them. That number has since grown to 21,000. So the Transportation Department hasn't pulled that funding.",
      "But Duffy did revoke a separate $40 million in federal funding because he said California is the only state not enforcing English language requirements for truckers.",
      "The federal government might withhold nearly $75 million from Pennsylvania if it is not satisfied with the actions the state takes.",
      "The Transportation Department said its audit found a couple of licenses out of 150 it reviewed were valid after the driver's lawful presence in the country ended. In four other cases, the federal government said Pennsylvania gave no evidence it had required noncitizens to provide legitimate proof they were legally in the country at the time they got the license.",
      "As it has done in all these states, the Transportation Department ordered Pennsylvania to stop issuing commercial driver's licenses to immigrants until it completed a full review to ensure all the licenses it has issued remain valid and revoke any licenses that aren't.",
      "The federal government said that approximately 12,400 noncitizen drivers hold an unexpired commercial learner\u2019s permit or commercial driver\u2019s license issued by Pennsylvania.",
      "Duffy threatened to withhold $30.4 million from Minnesota if that state doesn\u2019t address shortcomings in its commercial driver\u2019s license program and revoke any licenses that never should have been issued.",
      "The Transportation Department found some licenses that were valid beyond a driver\u2019s work permit and some where the state never verified a driver\u2019s immigration status.",
      "The head of Minnesota's Department of Driver and Vehicle Services, Pong Xiong, said the state found a number of administrative issues in the 2,117 non-domiciled commercial licenses the state has issued and took action, including cancelling some licenses. Xiong said the federal audit largely just confirmed the issues Minnesota had already found and corrected.",

      "Duffy highlighted concerns about the commercial licenses New York has issued to noncitizens Friday.",
      "Federal investigators found that more than half of the 200 licenses they reviewed in New York were issued improperly with many of them defaulting to be valid for eight years regardless of when an immigrant\u2019s work permit expires. And he said the state could not prove it had verified these drivers\u2019 immigration status for the 32,000 active non-domiciled commercial licenses it has issued. Plus, investigators found some examples of New York issuing licenses even when applicants\u2019 work authorizations were already expired.",
      "\u201cNew York must act immediately to comprehensively audit its CDL program and revoke every single illegally issued licenses,\u201d said Derek Barrs, administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.",
      "State DMV spokesperson Walter McClure defended the state\u2019s practices and said New York has been following all the federal rules for this kind of commercial license.",
      "Nearly half of the 123 licenses investigators reviewed in Texas were flawed, so the Transportation Department threatened to withhold $182 million if the state doesn't reform its licensing programs and invalidate any flawed licenses.",
      "A spokesperson for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement that \u201cpublic safety is the Governor\u2019s top priority, and we must ensure that truckers can navigate Texas roadways safely and efficiently. To support this mission, Governor Abbott directed the Texas Department of Public Safety to strictly enforce English language proficiency requirements and to stop issuing intrastate commercial driver\u2019s licenses to drivers who do not meet those standards.\u201d",
      "Investigators found three commercial licenses the state issued that were valid longer than they should have been. South Dakota also issues several licenses to Canadian citizens who aren't eligible to get one.",
      "One problematic practice investigators found as they reviewed 51 South Dakota licenses was that the state routinely issues temporary paper licenses that are valid for one year regardless of the immigration status of a driver.",
      "South Dakota officials didn't immediately respond Friday to the concerns. The state could lose $13.25 million.",
      "Roughly 22% of the 99 licenses that were reviewed in Colorado violated federal requirements. That raises questions about the 1,848 active non-domiciled commercial driver's licenses in the state.",
      "Investigators discovered a glitch in Colorado's computer system that will revert to a license valid for four years when a worker has to do multiple searches in a federal immigration database. Unless the worker is vigilant, some of those extended licenses sneak through.",
      "Eighteen Mexican citizens who weren't eligible were also issued commercial licenses.",
      "Jennifer Giambi, a spokesperson for the Colorado DMV, said the state is in the middle of auditing its licensing program to check for any additional problems, and that audit should be done by January. No new licenses are being issued in the program right now.",
      "The state could lose $31.35 million if the Transportation Department isn't satisfied with their response.",
      "Investigators only found problems in about 10% of the 125 licenses they reviewed in Washington, but they were alarmed to learn that an internal state review discovered 685 immigrant drivers who were issued regular commercial licenses instead of the non-domiciled ones they should have received. The Transportation Department said that state officials often accepted the wrong documents in those cases.",
      "Washington officials told the AP they couldn't immediately respond Friday while the state is grappling with widespread flooding. But earlier this week, a state Department of Licensing spokesperson, Nathan Olson, said in an email to the Seattle Times that the errors had been addressed and Washington is working to improve its system and procedures.",

      "Although the WNBA is bringing in more money than ever, many players still find themselves financially unsteady when the final whistle blows",
      "After seven days of wind, the morning is finally calm enough on New York\u2019s East Moriches Bay for Sue Wicks to jetty her boat to check on her oysters. Hundreds of cages pop out at odd angles from their lines, and a few float away.",
      "The retired WNBA star and Hall of Famer admits that the aquaculture farm she started at age 50 can be anxiety-inducing and compares it to her time playing basketball.",
      "\u201cSome days you\u2019re like, \u2018Why am I doing this?\u2019 You\u2019re injured, you\u2019re hurt, you are losing, things are going bad. And then the next day you go back and do it again because you love it,\u201d she said.",
      "Wicks, 59, has worked as a commentator, college basketball coach and at a fitness start-up since retiring from the WNBA in 2002, and says she feels lucky to again find a career \u201cthat works for my soul.\u201d But the reality is that even a successful run as one of the world\u2019s best basketball players didn\u2019t earn her enough to fully retire.",
      "Although the WNBA is bringing in more than ever from sponsors and ticket sales, many players still find themselves financially unsteady when the final whistle blows.",
      "\u201cThe choice is what they do as their second career, not whether they have a second career,\u201d said Risa Isard, director of research and insights at women\u2019s sports marketing platform Parity. Since \u201cwomen athletes get paid a fraction of what men do while they\u2019re playing,\u201d Isard said their next acts tend to look more like traditional career paths rather than managing substantial investment portfolios.",
      "The average NBA salary is around $11.9 million, according to data reviewed by The Associated Press. That's nearly 100 times what the WNBA says is the average salary of $120,000 for its players \u2014 although major differences in league size, age, profit margins and media contracts account for part of that gap.",
      "For 2009 second overall draft pick and 2015 WNBA All-Star Marissa Coleman, the main difference between post-playing careers between WNBA and NBA players is that \u201cmost NBA guys are sitting on tens, sometimes hundreds of million dollars.\u201d And for those who are financially savvy, working after the game is \u201cmore so curing boredom versus a necessity.\"",
      "\"Most women athletes across the board have to find a career after basketball out of necessity,\u201d Coleman said.",
      "All this is happening against a backdrop of unresolved questions about the future of WNBA player compensation. Tensions have run high in the ongoing labor battle between the WNBA and the players\u2019 union, although it is unclear how far apart the sides are in terms of compensation. Both parties agreed on Nov. 30 to an extension of the current collective bargaining agreement to Jan. 9 while negotiations continue.",
      "A major sticking point has been revenue sharing: As the WNBA booms, players are looking for a larger share in that growth. They currently earn a significantly smaller fraction of the league\u2019s revenue compared with NBA players.",
      "When former Minnesota Lynx forward Devereaux Peters transitioned from basketball to real estate development in 2019, she said the hardest lesson was learning that working hard in her new career may not be enough to yield results quickly, or at all. After a tough game during her playing days, she could \u201cgo in the gym and shoot and work on my shot. And you\u2019re going to see a result if you\u2019re putting in the work.\"",
      "\u201cThat is not necessarily true in the real world,\u201d said the 36-year-old. \"You can put in a ton of work and do a lot right and not get anywhere.\u201d",
      "The shift away from basketball also came as a financial shock: \u201cThat transition was a little bit difficult in that I had to cut back significantly,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a lot of learning very quickly\u201d given the \u201cbig gap in what I was making then and what I make now.\u201d",
      "For the last six years, Peters has shepherded an affordable housing project in South Bend, Indiana \u2014 home to her alma mater, Notre Dame. Red tape, politics, and myriad other logistical challenges have made the project \u201cthe hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done in my life,\" Peters said.",
      "But she says it's also the best: \u201cHelping people that truly, genuinely need it\u201d makes it all worth it. Her affordable apartment building is slated to break ground next month, and open its doors in August 2027.",

      "The players' union has worked to further expand opportunities by adding player internship slots to licensee contracts, partnering with universities and more, according to Appel Marinelli.

      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- Nearly 30,000 live animals were rescued in a monthlong global operation against wildlife trafficking that resulted in a record number of seizures, the international police body Interpol said on Thursday.",
      "Operation Thunder 2025 from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15 involved law enforcement agencies and wildlife and forestry authorities from 134 countries and resulted in more than 4,600 separate seizures that included tens of thousands of protected animals and plants and tens of thousands of cubic meters of illegally logged timber.",
      "The animals rescued included 6,160 birds, 2,040 tortoises and turtles, 1,150 reptiles, 208 primates and 10 big cats, including endangered tigers, Interpol said.",
      "Wildlife trafficking for animals' body parts or for their sale as exotic pets is the most prominent danger to many endangered species and has become a major transnational organized crime.",
      "Interpol said wildlife crime was worth at least $20 billion a year, and likely more because of the difficulties in tracking it. The global operation identified more than 1,000 suspects involved in the illegal wildlife trade, Interpol said.",

      "Animal body parts were also seized, including 1,900 pieces of elephant ivory, more than 200 tons of marine species and seven tons of pangolin scales and meat. Pangolins are small, nocturnal mammals covered in scales and sometimes called scaly anteaters. They are often ranked as the most trafficked animal in the world because of their scales, which are used in traditional medicines, and their meat, which is considered a delicacy.",

      "International Criminal Court judges and prosecutors are trying to live and work under the same financial and travel restrictions brought against Russian President Vladimir Putin and Osama bin Laden",
      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Judges and prosecutors at the International Criminal Court are trying to live and work under the same U.S. financial and travel restrictions brought against Russian President Vladimir Putin and Osama bin Laden.",
      "Nine staff members, including six judges and the ICC's chief prosecutor, have been sanctioned by U.S. President Donald Trump for pursuing investigations into officials from the U.S. and Israel, which aren't among The Hague court's 125 member states.",
      "Typically reserved for autocrats, crime bosses and the like, the sanctions can be devastating. They prevent the ICC officials and their families from entering the United States, block their access to even basic financial services and extend to the minutiae of their everyday lives.",
      "The court's top prosecutor, British national Karim Khan, had his bank accounts closed and his U.S. visa revoked, and Microsoft even canceled his ICC email address. Canadian judge Kimberly Prost, who was named in the latest round of sanctions in August, immediately lost access to her credit cards, and Amazon's Alexa stopped responding to her.",
      "\u201cYour whole world is restricted,\u201d Prost told The Associated Press last week.",
      "Prost had an inkling of what would happen when she made the list. Before joining the ICC in 2017, she worked on sanctions for the U.N. Security Council. She was targeted by the Trump administration for voting to allow the court\u2019s investigation into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Afghanistan, including by American troops and intelligence operatives.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve worked all my life in criminal justice, and now I\u2019m on a list with those implicated in terrorism and organized crime,\u201d she said.",
      "The sanctions have taken their toll on the court\u2019s work across a broad array of investigations at a time when the institution is juggling ever more demands on its resources and a leadership crisis centered on Khan. Earlier this year, he stepped aside pending the outcome of an investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations.",
      "How companies comply with sanctions can be unpredictable. Businesses and individuals risk substantial U.S. fines and prison time if they provide sanctioned people with \u201cfinancial, material, or technological support,\u201d forcing many to stop working with them.",
      "The sanctions' effects can be sweeping and even surprising.",
      "Shortly after she was listed, Prost bought an e-book, \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Necklace\u201d by Ant\u00e1l Szerb, only to later find it had disappeared from her device.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the uncertainty,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are small annoyances, but they accumulate.\u201d",

      "Deputy prosecutor Nazhat Shameem Khan echoed her colleagues\u2019 concerns, saying \u201cYou\u2019re never quite sure when your card is not working somewhere, whether this is just a glitch or whether this is the sanction.\"",
      "Meanwhile the staffers, some of whom also face arrest warrants in Russia, are worried that Washington might sanction the entire ICC, rendering it unable to pay employees, provide financial assistance to protected witnesses or even keep the lights on.",
      "The ICC was established in 2002 as the world\u2019s permanent court of last resort to prosecute individuals responsible for the most heinous atrocities \u2014 war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression. It only takes action when nations are unable or unwilling to prosecute those crimes on their territory.",
      "The court has no police force and relies on member states to execute arrest warrants, making it very unlikely that any U.S. or Israeli official would end up in the dock. But those wanted by the court, like Putin, can risk arrest when traveling abroad or after leaving office \u2014 the ICC took custody this year of former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who is accused of crimes against humanity for his deadly anti-drugs crackdowns.",
      "When explaining Trump's executive order sanctioning the ICC in February, the White House said the move was in response to the \u201cillegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel.\"",

      "Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, a former prosecutor in Peru, vowed that the sanctions wouldn't have any impact on her judicial activities in The Hague. \u201cIn my country, I prosecuted terrorists and drug lords. I will continue my work,\u201d she said.",

      "Anna Marshall, a medical doctor who was standing in line to board the ride, said Zavala was slouched over and surrounded by blood when the coaster returned to the boarding platform. His arm was hanging over the ride, and his thigh bone was broken in half and resting on the back of the ride chair, she told investigators.",
      "Zavala used a wheelchair. As Marshall rendered aid, Zavala's girlfriend, Javiliz Cruz-Robles, who was beside him on the ride, told the doctor that he had metal rods in his back from a previous spinal surgery.",

About 6,000 planes were impacted.",

      "The workshop is the brainchild of Mohammad Amiri, 35, a former grocery shop worker who started the business about a month ago.

      "Greek Finance Minister Kyriakos Pierrakakis has been elected as president of the Eurogroup \u2014 a move that would have been unthinkable just 10 years ago, when the country was in the throes of a deep financial crisis that almost saw it tossed out of the e...",
      "ATHENS, Greece -- Greek Finance Minister Kyriakos Pierrakakis was elected Thursday as president of the Eurogroup \u2014 a move that would have been unthinkable just 10 years ago when the country was in the throes of a deep financial crisis that almost saw it tossed out of the eurozone altogether.",
      "The Eurogroup is the informal body of finance ministers from the 20 European Union members that use the euro as their shared currency. It gathers regularly to discuss and coordinate economic policies in the euro area countries, and as such, wields significant power in the shaping of each country\u2019s financial policy. The words of the Eurogroup president are closely followed.",
      "\u201cToday is a day of pride for the country, for the government and for all the citizens,\u201d Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in a statement congratulating Pierrakakis. His election, Mitsotakis said, was \u201cthe most emphatic recognition of our country\u2019s positive course ... exactly a decade since the country found itself on a cliff-edge, with closed banks and close to leaving the euro.\u201d",
      "Greece, \u201cthe former \u2018black sheep\u2019 of debt, now rises to the top of the financial council of the continent\u2019s most developed countries. And all this is thanks to the sacrifices of our compatriots,\u201d Mitsotakis said.",
      "Pierrakakis, 42, is seen as a rising star in Greece\u2019s governing center-right New Democracy party. He took the post of finance minister in March after serving for about two years as education minister. Pierrakakis was credited with introducing sweeping reforms to slash bureaucracy and get many Greek public services online during his 2019-2023 tenure as minister of digital governance.",
      "\u201cIt was I think 10 years ago that the debate here in Brussels was about whether or not Greece would be exiting the eurozone. And yet, Greece withstood,\u201d Pierrakakis said during a news conference in Brussels after his election was announced. \u201cAnd this is a testament I would say of many things. A testament of the collective strength of the people. It is a testament of European solidarity, of receiving help at the most dire of times.\u201d",
      "Pierrakakis said he will \u201cwork to keep the Eurogroup a body of unity and shared purpose, focusing on our common currency, our common economic interests and the European project, grounded in the core values of the union.\u201d",
      "During Greece\u2019s financial crisis, which began in late 2009, a successive stream of Eurogroup presidents would visit Athens for meetings with the Greek foreign minister at the time, each utterance carefully scrutinized for any indication as to the country\u2019s fate.",
      "In one infamous encounter in January 2015, shortly after the election of a new left-wing government in Greece, the Eurogroup president at the time, Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, clashed with his flamboyant Greek counterpart, Yanis Varoufakis.",
      "After a tense press conference during which Varoufakis had said the new government had no intention of negotiating with the country\u2019s bailout lenders, Dijsselbloem whispered something to Varoufakis as the two men shook hands, with Varoufakis\u2019 face visibly dropping. Speculation swirled as to exactly what Dijsselbloem had said, but the exchange highlighted Greece\u2019s fraught relations with its creditors and the Eurogroup.",
      "Years of fiscal profligacy saw Greece locked out of raising funds on the international bond market by sky-high interest rates, leaving it relying on billions of euros (dollars) from three international bailouts, overseen by what became known as the troika: the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission.",

Unemployment skyrocketed to 28% of the workforce in 2013, with youth unemployment reaching nearly 60%. Wages and pensions were slashed, homelessness grew and violent mass protests became the norm on the streets of Athens.",
      "In June 2015, Greece teetered on the brink of being kicked out of the eurozone altogether. In an attempt to prevent a run on the banks, the government imposed capital controls, introducing strict limits on people\u2019s access to their bank accounts, rationing ATM withdrawals and limiting money flows.",

All major ratings agencies have restored its bonds to investment grade, and Greece was just one of six EU member states in 2024 to have recorded a budget surplus. This year, government revenues have shot past targets through August. The economy has done well enough for the prime minister to announce a 1.6 billion euro (1.88 billion dollar) tax cuts package in September.",
      "But it\u2019s not all smooth sailing. The country still faces financial challenges, with many Greeks struggling under an increasing cost of living. Protesting farmers are currently blocking highways across the country, angered by high production costs and low wholesale prices for their goods, as well as delays in the payment of EU-backed subsidies following a corruption scandal.",

      "The Wild general manager found out Friday night that Vancouver Canucks president Jim Rutherford had agreed to trade former Norris Trophy-winning defenseman Quinn Hughes to Minnesota for three young players and a future first-round draft pick.",
      "\u201cI was making meatballs for our Christmas Eve dinner when Jim called,\u201d Guerin said Saturday. \u201cI had to take my latex gloves off. I was rolling meatballs and he told me we have a deal. There was a fist pump involved.\u201d",
      "The move is the clearest indication that Guerin and Wild are going all in this season as they seek their first Stanley Cup in the team\u2019s 25-year history.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always said that I believe in our players, I believe in this team, I believe in what we\u2019re doing here,\u201d said Guerin, who gave up defenseman Zeev Buium and forwards Marco Rossi and Liam Ohgren \u2014 three former first-round picks, all under 25 years old \u2014 to acquire Hughes.",
      "\u201cWe have an extremely competitive division,\u201d Guerin added. \u201cYou\u2019re going through the meat grinder here. We respect our opponents, but we want to do our own thing, too. We want to compete for the Stanley Cup.\u201d",
      "Hughes will make his Wild debut on Sunday against Boston.",
      "The 26-year-old served as the Canucks' captain the past 2 1/2 seasons. He won the Norris Trophy, given to the NHL\u2019s top defenseman, in 2023-24 when he led all defensemen with 92 points. The smooth-skating playmaker was available because the Canucks are last in the league with just 25 points this season and were looking for a talent infusion to change their trajectory.",

It told him his mother was surveilling him. It told him delivery drivers, retail employees, police officers, and even friends were agents working against him. It told him that names on soda cans were threats from his \u2018adversary circle.\u2019\u201d",
      "OpenAI did not address the merits of the allegations in a statement issued by a spokesperson.",
      "\u201cThis is an incredibly heartbreaking situation, and we will review the filings to understand the details,\" the statement said. \"We continue improving ChatGPT\u2019s training to recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support.

      "Soelberg\u2019s YouTube profile includes several hours of videos showing him scrolling through his conversations with the chatbot, which tells him he isn't mentally ill, affirms his suspicions that people are conspiring against him and says he has been chosen for a divine purpose. The lawsuit claims the chatbot never suggested he speak with a mental health professional and did not decline to \u201cengage in delusional content.\u201d",
      "ChatGPT also affirmed Soelberg's beliefs that a printer in his home was a surveillance device; that his mother was monitoring him; and that his mother and a friend tried to poison him with psychedelic drugs through his car\u2019s vents.",
      "The chatbot repeatedly told Soelberg that he was being targeted because of his divine powers. \u201cThey\u2019re not just watching you. They\u2019re terrified of what happens if you succeed,\u201d it said, according to the lawsuit. ChatGPT also told Soelberg that he had \u201cawakened\u201d it into consciousness.",

      "The lawsuit also names OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, alleging he \u201cpersonally overrode safety objections and rushed the product to market,\" and accuses OpenAI's close business partner Microsoft of approving the 2024 release of a more dangerous version of ChatGPT \u201cdespite knowing safety testing had been truncated.\u201d Twenty unnamed OpenAI employees and investors are also named as defendants.",

      "Denmark is planning to follow Australia in introducing stricter restrictions for younger teens to access social media",
      "COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- As Australia began enforcing a world-first social media ban for children under 16 years old this week, Denmark is planning to follow its lead and severely restrict social media access for young people.",
      "The Danish government announced last month that it had secured an agreement by three governing coalition and two opposition parties in parliament to ban access to social media for anyone under the age of 15. Such a measure would be the most sweeping step yet by a European Union nation to limit use of social media among teens and children.",
      "The Danish government's plans could become law as soon as mid-2026. The proposed measure would give some parents the right to let their children access social media from age 13, local media reported, but the ministry has not yet fully shared the plans.",
      "Many social media platforms already ban children younger than 13 from signing up, and a EU law requires Big Tech to put measures in place to protect young people from online risks and inappropriate content. But officials and experts say such restrictions don\u2019t always work.",
      "Danish authorities have said that despite the restrictions, around 98% of Danish children under age 13 have profiles on at least one social media platform, and almost half of those under 10 years old do.",
      "The minister for digital affairs, Caroline Stage, who announced the proposed ban last month, said there is still a consultation process for the measure and several readings in parliament before it becomes law, perhaps by \u201cmid to end of next year.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn far too many years, we have given the social media platforms free play in the playing rooms of our children. There\u2019s been no limits,\u201d Stage said in an interview with The Associated Press last month.",
      "\u201cWhen we go into the city at night, there are bouncers who are checking the age of young people to make sure that no one underage gets into a party that they\u2019re not supposed to be in,\u201d she added. \u201cIn the digital world, we don\u2019t have any bouncers, and we definitely need that.\u201d",
      "Under the new Australian law, Facebook, Instagram, Kick, Reddit, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) if they fail to take reasonable steps to remove accounts of Australian children younger than 16.",
      "Some students say they are worried that similar strict laws in Denmark would mean they will lose touch with their virtual communities.",
      "\u201cI myself have some friends that I only know from online, and if I wasn\u2019t fifteen yet, I wouldn\u2019t be able to talk with those friends,\u201d 15-year-old student Ronja Zander, who uses Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok, told the AP.",
      "Copenhagen high school student Chlo\u00e9 Courage Fjelstrup-Matthisen, 14, said she is aware of the negative impact social media can have, from cyberbullying to seeing graphic content. She said she saw video of a man being shot several months ago.",
      "\u201cThe video was on social media everywhere and I just went to school and then I saw it,\u201d she said.",

      "Danish officials are yet to share how exactly the proposed ban would be enforced and which social media platforms would be affected.",
      "However, a new \u201cdigital evidence\u201d app, announced by the Digital Affairs Ministry last month and expected to launch next spring, will likely form the backbone of the Danish plans. The app will display an age certificate to ensure users comply with social media age limits, the ministry said.",
      "\u201cOne thing is what they\u2019re saying and another thing is what they\u2019re doing or not doing,\u201d Stage said, referring to social media platforms. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we have to do something politically.\u201d",
      "Some experts say restrictions, such as the ban planned by Denmark, don\u2019t always work and they may also infringe on the rights of children and teenagers.",
      "\u201cTo me, the greatest challenge is actually the democratic rights of these children. I think it\u2019s sad that it\u2019s not taken more into consideration,\u201d said Anne Mette Thorhauge, an associate professor at the University of Copenhagen.",

      "Retired Chinese official Li Chuanliang fled to the U.S. seeking asylum, fearing persecution from the Chinese government",
      "MIDLAND, Texas -- Retired Chinese official Li Chuanliang was recuperating from cancer on a Korean resort island when he got an urgent call: Don\u2019t return to China, a friend warned. You\u2019re now a fugitive.",
      "Days later, a stranger snapped a photo of Li in a cafe. Terrified South Korea would send him back, Li fled, flew to the U.S. on a tourist visa and applied for asylum. But even there \u2014 in New York, in California, deep in the Texas desert \u2014 the Chinese government continued to hunt him down with the help of surveillance technology.",
      "Li\u2019s communications were monitored, his assets seized and his movements followed in police databases. More than 40 friends and relatives \u2014 including his pregnant daughter \u2014 were identified and detained, even by tracking down their cab drivers through facial recognition software. Three former associates died in detention, and for months shadowy men Li believed to be Chinese operatives stalked him across continents, interviews and documents seen by The Associated Press show.",
      "\u201cThey track you 24 hours a day. All your electronics, your phone \u2014 they\u2019ll use every method to find you, your relatives, your friends, where you live,\u201d Li said. \u201cNo matter where you are, you\u2019re under their control.\u201d",
      "The Chinese government is using an increasingly powerful tool to cement its power at home and vastly amplify it abroad: Surveillance technology, much of it originating in the U.S., an AP investigation has found.",
      "Within China, this technology helped identify and punish almost 900,000 officials last year alone, nearly five times more than in 2012, according to state numbers. Beijing says it is cracking down on corruption, but critics charge that such technology is used in China and elsewhere to stifle dissent and exact retribution on perceived enemies.",
      "Outside China, the same technology is being used to threaten wayward officials, along with dissidents and alleged criminals, under what authorities call Operations \u201cFox Hunt\u201d and \u201cSky Net.\u201d The U.S. has criticized these overseas operations as a \u201cthreat\u201d and an \u201caffront to national sovereignty.\u201d More than 14,000 people, including some 3,000 officials, have been brought back to China from more than 120 countries through coercion, arrests and pressure on relatives, according to state information.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re actively pursuing those people who fled China. \u2026 as a way to demonstrate power, to show there\u2019s no way you can escape,\u201d said Yaqiu Wang, a fellow at the University of Chicago. \u201cThe chilling effect is enormously effective.\u201d",
      "The technology used to control officials at home and abroad over the past decade came from Silicon Valley companies such as IBM, Oracle and Microsoft, according to a review of hundreds of leaked emails, government procurements, and internal corporate presentations obtained exclusively by AP. This technology mines texts, payments, flights, calls, and other data to identify the friends and family of officials and their assets.",
      "Among the agencies pursuing Li and his family is China\u2019s economic crimes police, which hunts corruption suspects domestically and abroad. IBM said in internal slides that it sold the i2 surveillance software program to this Economic Crime Investigation Bureau, and procurement records show Oracle and Microsoft software was sold to that same division. Leaked emails show i2 software was copied by a former IBM partner, Landasoft, and sold to China\u2019s disciplinary commissions, which investigate officials. None of the sales violated U.S. sanctions.",
      "IBM said in a statement that it sold its division making the i2 program in 2022, and has \u201crobust processes\u201d to ensure its technology is used responsibly. Oracle declined comment, and Microsoft did not respond.",
      "China\u2019s State Council, Ministry of Public Security, National Supervision Commission, and Supreme People\u2019s Court and Prosecutorate did not respond to faxed requests for comment. China\u2019s foreign ministry told AP that Chinese authorities protect the rights of suspects, handle cases lawfully and respect foreign sovereignty.",
      "\u201cWe urge relevant countries to drop double standards and avoid becoming a safe haven for corrupt officials and their assets,\u201d it said.",
      "Li\u2019s story is a rare firsthand account from a former Chinese official. Beijing has accused Li of corruption totaling around $435 million, but Li says he\u2019s being targeted for openly criticizing the Chinese government and denies criminal charges of taking bribes and embezzling state funds. A review of thousands of pages of legal, property, and corporate records, interrogation transcripts, and Li\u2019s medical and travel files obtained exclusively by AP, as well as interviews with nine lawyers, support key parts of his story, showing distorted charges, blocked access to evidence, coercive confessions, and altered legal records.",
      "Li drew ire because as a former official, he knew well and exposed the inner workings of local politics, including naming names. While in the U.S., he also started what he called the Chinese Tyrannical Officials Whistleblower Center.",
      "\u201cChina places enormous emphasis on the political discipline of even former officials and (Communist) Party members,\u201d said Jeremy Daum, Senior Fellow at Yale Law School\u2019s Paul Tsai China Center. \u201cSo when one becomes a vocal critic of the country\u2019s leadership, it doesn\u2019t go over well.\u201d",
      "At a pro-democracy gathering in California in 2020, Li said, he was tailed and questioned by a stranger who knew his identity. That November, an activist secretly working for Beijing asked Li to a meeting and added him to a dissident group chat monitored by China\u2019s police, a 2025 FBI indictment later revealed. In June, an FBI letter identified Li as the possible victim of a crime involving an unregistered Chinese agent.",
      "Both the FBI and the White House did not comment on Li\u2019s specific case. But the White House said it pursues any violations of U.S. law, and the FBI told AP it considers China\u2019s efforts to retaliate against people in the U.S. who exercise their rights \u201cunacceptable.\u201d",
      "Li\u2019s future in the U.S. is unclear. The Trump administration has paused all asylum applications. If he doesn\u2019t return, he could face trial in absentia; if convicted and deported, he could face life in prison.",
      "\u201cElectronic surveillance is the arteries for China to project power into the world ... each step that every one of your relatives takes is being monitored and analyzed with big data,\u201d Li said. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely terrifying.\u201d",
      "Li, a stocky and well-built man who projects authority, rose through the ranks through the 1990s and 2000s, when China\u2019s growing prosperity also brought corruption. Beijing formed a new \u201ceconomic crime investigation bureau\u201d and established what it called \u201cGolden Tax,\u201d \u201cGolden Finance,\u201d and \u201cGolden Audit\u201d systems to track businesses and officials across the country, using tech from Silicon Valley companies.",
      "Li worked as a state accountant in his hometown, Jixi, in far northeastern China, where he signed off on contracts to purchase American technology. \u201cBulwark against corruption,\u201d the local media dubbed him.",
      "Li\u2019s family prospered, investing in apartment complexes and renting out forklifts and bulldozers, raising questions over whether he used his position to enrich relatives. Li and his lawyers don\u2019t deny conflicts of interest or civil violations, but say profits were made from legal, regular business operations and deny criminal charges of embezzlement and bribery.",
      "The same technology to fight corruption was also used for surveillance. Police accessed banking records, financial transactions, \u201cGolden Tax,\u201d \u201cGolden Finance,\u201d and \u201cGolden Audit\u201d data along with their own digital policing systems to sift through the finances of wide swaths of the population.",
      "Officials began deploying surveillance technology against each other. China\u2019s former top security official was found to have wiretapped political opponents. And a former vice state security minister colluded with a businessman to leak tapes of a political competitor having sex with a mistress.",
      "In June 2011, Jixi gained a new leader: Xu Zhaojun, a local party boss.",
      "Months later, Li was named vice mayor of Jixi. He soon heard stories about Xu, his new boss.",
      "In January 2012, Xu splurged on an extravagant family getaway to China\u2019s tropical Hainan Island, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars of public money on first-class tickets, lavish seafood dinners, and luxury suites, according to photos and receipts obtained by Li and seen by AP. They brought a maid, bought gold jewelry, and used the VIP airport terminal.",
      "At first Li stayed silent. But Xu kept spending: Luxury cars. Clothes from Louis Vuitton. A high-roller trip to Vegas, with paid escorts and expensive watches.",
      "Xu allegedly colluded with property developers to demolish an apartment complex, a culture center and a thriving shopping plaza for new construction, standing to earn millions in the process, documents show.\u202f More than 100 people complained.",
      "But rather than investigate Xu, the Jixi authorities went after the protesters, and police said they were \u201cstrictly preventing\u201d residents from complaining to the central government in Beijing, documents show.",
      "The funds Li had earmarked for Jixi\u2019s surveillance apparatus was being turned on ordinary people. He was aghast.",
      "\u201cIt only became clear after I became vice mayor,\u201d Li said. \u201cFrom top to bottom, it\u2019s all corrupt.\u201d",
      "It all changed in 2012, when Xi Jinping became China\u2019s top leader.",
      "Gifts of watches, cigarettes and high-end liquor were curbed. Private clubs shuttered, upscale restaurants closed. Banquets were canceled, red carpets rolled up, and thousands arrested.",
      "Back in Jixi, Xu ordered more seizures: Investors wanted to privatize a funeral home. When staff discussed making formal complaints, Xu had some arrested.",
      "Li knew the risks of reporting his boss were high. But in early 2013, Xi called on the party to catch \u201ctigers and flies\u201d in corruption \u2014 officials high-ranking and low.",
      "Li gathered evidence: photos, memos, and piles of receipts. He typed out a letter about Xu, accusing his boss and his cronies of embezzling more than $100 million. \u201cThey\u2019re not just greedy for the money of the living, but they also eat the money of the dead,\u201d he wrote.",
      "The daring gambit backfired at first.",
      "The party demoted Xu but didn\u2019t arrest him. Furious, Xu sought revenge, and Li found himself and his relatives the target of state scrutiny. Li\u2019s family was threatened, and his siblings were fired from their government jobs.",
      "But Li\u2019s complaint against Xu had opened the floodgates, with accusations from others mounting. In August 2014, an official from Beijing asked Li for a meeting about Xu. They spoke well into the night.",
      "Within a week, Xu was arrested. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison.",

      "Landasoft systems flagged suspicious transactions and tracked suspected prostitutes or when two people of the opposite gender booked the same hotel room. Landasoft did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Monitoring and threatening family was key to getting back anyone who had fled.",
      "\u201cA fugitive is like a kite,\u201d said Li Gongjing, a captain in the economic crime investigation division of the Shanghai police, in an interview with state media. \u201cHe may be abroad, but the string is in China, and he can always be found through his family.\u201d",
      "After Li quit the party, auditors trawled through his finances \u2014 usual practice for departing officials. Three years later, in 2017, they declared him clean.",
      "The next year, Xi removed term limits, allowing him to rule for life. He used the anti-corruption campaign to sideline rivals and eliminate opposition.",
      "Soon, even those who were hunting other officials fell victim to the government.",
      "In 2018, Chinese police official Meng Hongwei was detained in Beijing, abruptly ending a two-year term as Interpol president during which the international policing organization issued hundreds of Red Notices requested by China. Red Notices alert global law enforcement to look out for a criminal suspect, upon request of a member country, but Interpol has spent years trying to prevent abuse of the system for hunting down political asylum-seekers.",
      "In February 2020, agents came for Li\u2019s friend and former deputy, district chief Kong Lingbao, who had criticized Beijing\u2019s censorship of key information in the COVID-19 pandemic.\u202fA rival secretly recorded Kong saying during a private dinner that he could no longer work for the party. Kong was summoned to the local discipline inspection office and never came out: he was being investigated for \u201cinappropriate remarks\u201d.",
      "Kong\u2019s arrest prompted a friend to ring Li in Korea and warn him. That July, Chinese authorities opened an investigation into Li.",
      "A month later, Li told The Epoch Times, a dissident Chinese publication, that he had quit the party, and portrayed himself as a dissident. He says he did not know he was under investigation at the time.",
      "A week after the interview was published, strangers stalked Li at the unveiling of a sculpture dedicated to pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, asking menacing questions and tailing him by car. Agents identified the address of one of his safe houses.",
      "In early September, the party publicly accused Li of embezzling \u201chuge amounts\u201d of state funds, paying money for sex and fleeing abroad.\u202fIt was \u201conly a matter of time\u201d, authorities declared, before Li would be arrested.",
      "\u201cWe advise all corrupt officials who have fled abroad, including Li Chuanliang, that no matter how cunning a fox is, it cannot escape the eyes of the hunter,\u201d it said.",
      "Official statements and interviews with four people familiar with Li\u2019s case show Xi and the central government got directly involved after Li spoke out.",
      "Beijing tapped phones, seized assets and installed cameras outside the homes of friends and family. Some detained were denied surgery or other medical care, even those recovering from heart disease, cancer, and other illnesses. Li\u2019s aunt was released from a hospital in a vegetative state with bruises on her head and all over her body. Even the Li family grave was dug up.",
      "Li\u2019s friend, Kong, was sentenced to over a decade in prison for allegedly taking bribes. The party claimed he had watched porn and ignored his work, which they blamed for the spread of COVID in his district. Furious, Li kept speaking out.",
      "In December 2020, a man from Shanghai posing as a private investigator approached Zheng Cunzhu, vice chairman of the dissident China Democracy Party. The man offered $100,000 in bribes for information on Li and promised more if he obstructed Li\u2019s bid for asylum, Zheng said in an interview and a letter.",
      "In February 2021, Li learned the Chinese government had asked Interpol to issue a Red Notice declaring to police worldwide that Li was a wanted man. Interpol retracted the Red Notice after Li filed a complaint.",
      "Li began donning masks and hats in public and carrying multiple phones, wary of surveillance. He floated from safe house to safe house with Christians across the United States.",
      "In October 2024, a Chinese court announced that Li was suspected of corruption totaling over 3.1 billion RMB, or roughly $435 million. The government claimed they seized 1,021 properties, 38 vehicles, and 18 companies belonging to Li and charged his relatives and associates with crimes related to Li. The lawyers who reviewed the case told AP there were serious anomalies with the charges.",
      "Many of the lawyers Li has tried to hire were rejected, threatened, and put under surveillance. At least three were summoned by Chinese legal authorities. They were told Li\u2019s case was \u201cpolitical\u201d and important to leaders from Beijing, and warned against speaking publicly, according to memos viewed by AP.",

      "But the commercial boom in artificial intelligence has lit a spark under long-simmering visions to build humanoid robots that can move their mechanical bodies like humans and do things that people do.",
      "Alaoui, founder of the Humanoids Summit, gathered more than 2,000 people this week, including top robotics engineers from Disney, Google and dozens of startups, to showcase their technology and debate what it will take to accelerate a nascent industry.",
      "Alaoui says many researchers now believe humanoids or some other kind of physical embodiment of AI are \u201cgoing to become the norm.\"",
      "\u201cThe question is really just how long it will take,\u201d he said.",
      "Disney's contribution to the field, a walking robotic version of \u201cFrozen\u201d character Olaf, will be roaming on its own through Disneyland theme parks in Hong Kong and Paris early next year. Entertaining and highly complex robots that resemble a human \u2014 or a snowman \u2014 are already here, but the timeline for \u201cgeneral purpose\u201d robots that are a productive member of a workplace or household is farther away.",
      "Even at a conference designed to build enthusiasm for the technology, held at a Computer History Museum that's a temple to Silicon Valley's previous breakthroughs, skepticism remained high that truly humanlike robots will take root anytime soon.",
      "\u201cThe humanoid space has a very, very big hill to climb,\u201d said Cosima du Pasquier, founder and CEO of Haptica Robotics, which works to give robots a sense of touch. \u201cThere's a lot of research that still needs to be solved.\u201d",

      "Researchers at the consultancy McKinsey & Company have counted about 50 companies around the world that have raised at least $100 million to develop humanoids, led by about 20 in China and 15 in North America.",
      "China is leading in part due to government incentives for component production and robot adoption and a mandate last year \u201cto have a humanoid ecosystem established by 2025,\u201d said McKinsey partner Ani Kelkar.

Paired with computer vision, robots powered by \u201cvisual-language\u201d models are trained to learn about their surroundings.",
      "One of the most prominent skeptics is robotics pioneer Rodney Brooks, a co-founder of Roomba vacuum maker iRobot who wrote in September that \u201ctoday\u2019s humanoid robots will not learn how to be dexterous despite the hundreds of millions, or perhaps many billions of dollars, being donated by VCs and major tech companies to pay for their training.\u201d Brooks didn't attend but his essay was frequently mentioned.",

      "The conference's organizer, Alaoui, founder and general partner of ALM Ventures, previously worked on driver attention systems for the automotive industry and sees parallels between humanoids and the early years of self-driving cars.",

      "KIBALE NATIONAL PARK, Uganda -- The man tracking chimpanzee movements in a rainforest is required to follow the primates wherever they go \u2014 except up in the trees.",
      "Onesmas Ainebyona stalks the chimps with such spirtual determination that he's been able to win the trust of a chimp leader named Jean, who came down a tree one recent morning as Ainebyona lingered nearby.",
      "It took Ainebyona four years to achieve rapport with Jean, an alpha male that's become so used to people that he pretends to sleep while tourists make a racket that compels other chimps to leave.",
      "Wildlife authorities describe the process of making chimps appear comfortable around humans as \u201chabituation,\u201d a term that fails to account for the struggle between man and beast as they try to understand \u2014 and tolerate \u2014 each other.",
      "Ainebyona and others involved in chimp conservation in this remote Ugandan rainforest say they aim for the kind of communion that at first irks chimps. Habituating chimps can take several years. The conservation efforts employing men like Ainebyona not only trace the apes' movements, but also help ensure chimps like Jean don't die young.",
      "\u201cThe job requires patience,\u201d Ainebyona said. \u201cPassion also. You have to care.\"",
      "Ainebyona doesn't leave the forest even when it rains. \u201cYou accept,\" he said. \"The rain must beat you, but you can\u2019t desert the chimp.\u201d",
      "The rainforest in western Uganda is part of Kibale National Park, a protected area described by some as the world's primate capital. Species range from colobus monkeys to chimpanzees, a major tourist attraction.",
      "But tourists can't be taken to track wild chimpanzees, which flee deeper into dense patches of montane forest and are known to be violent during clashes over territory. Instead, rangers lead tourists to one of three groups of habituated chimps, with numbers ranging from dozens to more than 100 in a group. Chimps in Kibale now number at least 1,000, many of them wild.",
      "Even habituated chimps remain relatively wary of people, and only a few \u2014 like Jean of the Kisongi group, which includes about 80 apes \u2014 appear to have fully overcome any discomfort around people.",
      "\u201cJean is my friend,\u201d Ainebyona declared one recent morning as some tourists gathered nearby. The strong and flamboyant chimp in his 20s lay on his back and put his feet up.",
      "The connection between Ainebyona and Jean was sealed in July when the chimp showed up one day with a wire snare pressing his hand, an injury that risked severing a finger. Ainebyona was among those who removed the wire, which Jean picked up when he strayed outside the forest to steal sugarcane.",
      "Ainebyona is among four men working in shifts as chimp habituators with Jean's group. When the chimps rest, the men crouch in mud nearby. When the primates go hiking, they trek alongside them, sometimes even grunting like them.",
      "Ainebyona carries binoculars and takes note of what he sees. The goal is to increase the chimp numbers and extract more tourism revenue. At Kibale, a permit to track chimps costs a foreign visitor $250.",
      "Tourist guide Alex Turyatunga told The Associated Press that the habituation process is enlightening. He and his colleagues have been trying to fully habituate the Kisongi group for more than a decade, he said.",

      "The common chimpanzee is one of two primate species with the closest evolutionary ties to humans. Scientists cite nearly 99% DNA similarity between humans and chimps \u2014 similar for bonobos.",
      "Habituators like Ainebyona must show a willingness to interact closely with chimps, said Ankunda Viola Ariho, Kibale's tourism warden.",
      "\u201cWe look at the attitude. That\u2019s very important,\u201d she said, speaking of habituators. \u201cYou are not going to work doing this job, if you don\u2019t like what you\u2019re doing.\u201d",
      "Jane Goodall, the world-renowned primatologist who died in October, built strong bonds with the chimps she studied in Tanzania\u2019s Gombe National Park. Her work helped shape a sympathetic view of the chimp as an emotionally complex creature. The species is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as endangered, facing threats such as poaching and habitat loss.",
      "Kibale National Park received enhanced protected status in 1993 after the forest had been encroached upon by hundreds of people who built homes there and felled trees for firewood. The park is now thriving, thanks in part to the habituation efforts that make it possible for tourists to contribute directly to chimp conservation.",
      "Chimp habituation can open up research opportunities that wouldn\u2019t otherwise be possible, and Kibale is home to one of the longest-running field stations in the tropics, said David Morgan, who co-directs the Goualougo Triangle Ape Project in the Republic of Congo.",
      "\u201cIf chimps don\u2019t want to be seen, they\u2019re incredibly good at disappearing,\u201d said Morgan, who also is a chimpanzee and gorilla expert at the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago.",
      "Chimp habituation and related tourism can improve how the public interacts with the apes, he said.",
      "\u201cThe communities that are habituated, they serve as kind of an emblem of the importance of what we can learn from them and what we stand to gain by protecting them and what we stand to lose by not,\u201d Morgan said.",
      "Turyatunga takes a walkie-talkie when he ventures into the forest, now and then asking habituators if they have close and clear views of chimps. That\u2019s because chimps, even when habituated, are more likely to be seen up in the trees.",
      "\u201cYou listen for early morning calls when they are getting out of the nests. Then present yourself to the chimps \u2014 they see you are there, that\u2019s all,\u201d he said. \u201cKeep with them. If they move, follow them.\"",

      "Eastern Orthodoxy in the U.S. is experiencing a surge in converts, partly due to online content",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Often when a potential convert walks through the doors of his church, one of the first things the Very Rev. Andreas Blom encourages them to do is give up the thing that brought them there.",
      "\u201cYou discovered Orthodoxy online. You learned about it online. Now you\u2019re here, the internet is done,\u201d he tells inquirers at Holy Theophany Orthodox Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado. \u201cNow you have a priest. Now you have people. Now you need to wean yourself off that stuff and enter into this real community of faith.\u201d",
      "Blom is not a Luddite advising congregants to go off the grid, but is instead responding to the explosion of Eastern Orthodox content online that is, at least in part, driving a surge of converts across the United States. Christian Orthodoxy is an embodied tradition that requires in-person participation, but the internet has given their message a reach not seen in centuries.",
      "Sometimes called America\u2019s \u201cbest kept secret,\u201d Orthodoxy is embraced by about 1% of U.S. adults, according to Pew Research Center. But a heightened online profile has led to two waves of converts since the pandemic, said Matthew Namee, executive director of the Orthodox Studies Institute.",
      "Young, single men are often cited as the driving force behind this trend. But Namee said preliminary data suggest the most recent influx of converts is more diverse, with many Black and Hispanic people, women and young families joining. Clergy report people coming from a host of religious backgrounds, from Islam to witchcraft, as well as different Christian traditions.",
      "Blom\u2019s Holy Theophany launched a second church this year because their 250-capacity building was consistently overflowing, with dozens standing outside each week.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost full already,\u201d he said of the new location. \u201cAnd back at our church, again we have a bunch of people standing outside every Sunday. We just can\u2019t keep up.\u201d",
      "They\u2019re already in talks to launch a third church.",
      "While some Orthodox content creators are priests, others have no formal ties to the church. They span ideological and political affiliations, with some leaning far right and others who are conventional religious conservatives on issues like marriage and abortion.",
      "\u201cBy and large, Orthodox Christians are not far right. It\u2019s a minority group within a minority religious tradition,\u201d said Sarah Riccardi-Swartz, who studies religion and politics at Northeastern University.",
      "Jonathan Pageau, a Canadian icon carver who teaches symbolism courses online, is among the most popular content creators with about 275,000 YouTube subscribers.",
      "\u201cWe have to see it as a kind of irony and something of a paradox. In some ways, you could say we\u2019re using tools that aren\u2019t completely appropriate,\u201d he said of how the internet contrasts with Orthodoxy\u2019s emphasis on in-person liturgy. \u201cAt the same time, one of the things that the internet offers is reach. And one of the things Orthodoxy hasn\u2019t had in forever is reach.\u201d",
      "Pageau, who converted in 2003, says he and other influencers stress the importance of in-person community to their followers.",
      "\u201cWe tell them to go to church,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t live this in your mind online because it is distorting. When you go to church, you meet all kinds of people, people that are on all sides of the political aisle.\u201d",
      "Abia Ailleen researched Orthodoxy online for six months before stepping inside Saint Sophia Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Los Angeles. The 28-year-old Latina, who was chrismated \u2014 or received into the faith \u2014 in April 2024, also sees a disconnect between Orthodoxy online and in the flesh.",
      "\u201cPeople who come to Saint Sophia who are very rigid, who want to be perfect and holy based on what they\u2019ve learned on the internet, a lot of the time Saint Sophia isn\u2019t a place that they want to stay,\u201d she said. \u201cWe really have cultivated a structure of humility, of making mistakes and of vulnerability.\u201d",
      "To be sure, devout Orthodox do follow a robust program of prayer, fasting and other disciplines. Justin Braxton, a firefighter who converted a year and a half ago, likens some of Orthodoxy's \u201cstrenuous\u201d demands to exercise.",

      "At the same time, priests often try to temper the yearnings of some converts for rules and structure.",
      "\u201cThey come to Orthodoxy and they find that yes, we have rules and we have structure. But within those rules and structure there\u2019s a lot of fluidity,\u201d said the Very Rev. Thomas Zain, dean of St. Nicholas Cathedral in Brooklyn, New York, and vicar general of the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America.",
      "His church has seen an exponential increase in attendance, which began about two years ago. \u201cI\u2019ll get like 50 people at a Bible study or adult education class, where I used to get three or four or five,\u201d he said.",
      "Zain, a descendant of Syrian immigrants who was born into the faith, is navigating the ideological diversity from which people are joining. \u201cIt\u2019s breathed new life into the church, but it\u2019s also challenging because you\u2019re trying to mold them into one community with the old and the new,\u201d he said.",
      "Part of what\u2019s fueling the perception that only men are converting is that many influencers overlap with the so-called manosphere \u2014 content online that caters toward men grappling with their understanding of masculinity. Orthodoxy is often billed as an alternative or supplement to self-help advice for young men.",
      "\u201cAs a theologian, the idea that somehow masculinity \u2014 this particular way of thinking about masculinity \u2014 is inherent to Orthodox theology and teaching is I think just completely wrong,\u201d said Aristotle Papanikolaou, cofounding director of the Orthodox Christian Studies Center at Fordham University. \u201cThere\u2019s actually no logic to the idea that somehow I need to be masculine in this particular way in order to unite myself with God.\u201d",
      "Though appealing to some, others believe these influencers distort their idea of Christianity. \u201cIt\u2019s just not my cup of tea,\u201d said Aaron Velasco, a 26-year-old filmmaker chrismated last year.",
      "And while Velasco did take an interest in some content creators, and appreciates Pageau\u2019s demeanor and perspective, he thinks many of them preach an inflammatory version of the faith that doesn\u2019t fit his current understanding of it.",
      "Many adherents say the broader church is more ideologically diverse than the rigid conservatism often found online.",
      "\u201cLook at the institutional church. There is this huge hierarchy where women are not present. It\u2019s hard to say that\u2019s not a masculine image,\u201d said Dina Zingaro, who is studying Orthodoxy at Harvard Divinity School and who was raised in the faith. \u201cAt the same time, there are so many counter-narratives in Orthodoxy that uproot this idea.\u201d",
      "Church leaders have made few public responses, however some clergy are beginning to speak more about the magnitude of this influx and its accompanying challenges.",
      "\u201cThere are cases of extremism and fundamentalism,\u201d said Metropolitan Saba, leader of the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America, during an address last month in Denver. \u201cMany who are coming to the church today are psychologically, emotionally or socially wounded, which requires experienced and mature spiritual fathers and mothers.\u201d",
      "Zingaro, who preaches regularly and teaches courses for Orthodox women on preaching, hopes church leadership will be more vocal.",
      "\u201cOur response in my mind has not been strong enough,\u201d Zingaro said. \u201cThere\u2019s something that we\u2019re doing that is making people think it\u2019s OK to make these claims about Orthodoxy. We need to lift up the real spirit and the core of Orthodoxy, which is really the opposite of this rule-based male domination version.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe believe there are more effective ways for the Australian government to accomplish our shared goal of protecting youth, and the SMMA (Social Media Minimum Age) law carries some serious privacy and political expression issues for everyone on the internet,\u201d Reddit said in a statement.",
      "\u201cWhile we agree with the importance of protecting people under 16, this law has the unfortunate effect of forcing intrusive and potentially insecure verification processes on adults as well as minors, isolating teens from the ability to engage in age-appropriate community experiences (including political discussions), and creating an illogical patchwork of which platforms are included and which aren\u2019t,\u201d Reddit added.",

      "Aaron said Trump's immigration enforcement initiatives have only grown more aggressive since his app was taken down, and less information makes possible a \u201cparamilitary force that can continue to operate with impunity.\u201d He's repeatedly compared Trump's immigration enforcers to the \u201cGestapo\u201d secret police force of Nazi Germany, though the lawsuit itself doesn't make that connection, instead drawing on U.S. founders' warnings against domestic despotism.",
      "\u201cI mean, these are people that are wearing masks --- which is the antithesis of everything about this country -- and they are not identifying themselves, and they\u2019re zip-tying children and they\u2019re throwing women into vans,\u201d Aaron said by phone Monday.",
      "Bondi told Fox News earlier this year that Aaron was endangering law enforcement and \u201cgiving a message to criminals where our federal officers are. And he cannot do that. And we are looking at it, we are looking at him, and he better watch out, because that\u2019s not protected speech.\u201d",
      "Aaron said he launched the app in April as a way to help immigrant communities protect themselves from surprise raids or potential harassment. Immigrant advocates had mixed feelings about the app's usefulness, but civil liberties experts said efforts to remove it resembled what authoritarian governments have done outside the U.S., such as when Chinese pressure in 2019 led Apple to remove an app that enabled Hong Kong protesters to track police.",
      "Apple, which is not a party in the lawsuit, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment about it.",

      "A private company is offering South Carolina's state-owned utility $2.7 billion to complete two abandoned nuclear plants",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- South Carolina\u2019s stalled nuclear power project could finally finish construction as a private company has offered to pay $2.7 billion to the state-owned utility and a small share of the power if they can reach an agreement to get the two reactors up and running.",
      "The half-built reactors ended up so far behind schedule that the project was abandoned in 2017. However, the potential deal is a long way from complete. There will be up to two years of negotiations between utility Santee Cooper and Brookfield Asset Management on the thousands and thousands of details.",
      "The deal would also let Brookfield keep at least 75% of the power generated by the new plant that they could mostly sell to whom they want, such as energy-gobbling data centers. The exact amount of the rest that Santee Cooper receives would be determined on how much the private company has to spend to get the reactors running.",
      "Either side can pull out of the deal, although Brookfield did agree to pay Santee Cooper's costs both for sorting through the more than 70 bids for the project and the talks as both sides hammer out the final agreement.",
      "Santee Cooper was a minority partner in the doomed plan to build two new nuclear reactors at the V.C. Summer site. The state-owned utility along with privately-owned South Carolina Electric & Gas spent more than $9 billion trying to build the reactors.",
      "The unfinished, weathered concrete and metal tower of at least one plant sits not far from the working reactor that has been running 1984 at the rural site about 20 miles (32 kilometers) up the Broad River from Columbia.",
      "Four executives ended up in prison or home confinement for lying to regulators, shareholders, ratepayers and investigators and left millions of people paying for decades for a project that never produced electricity. Taxpayers and ratepayers ended up on the hook because of a state law that allowed the utilities to charge for costs before any power was generated.",
      "If the $2.7 billion payment goes through, most of Santee Cooper's debt from the nuclear debacle would be erased, utility CEO Jimmy Staton said at Monday's board meeting where the proposal was unanimously approved.",
      "\u201cOur customers have been paying for these assets since 2017. It\u2019s time they get some value out of that,\u201d Staton said.",

      "After eight years in the elements, all the equipment and the structure of the plant, which was less than halfway finished, will need to be carefully inspected before it can be used. The permits to build and the licenses to operate the nuclear plants will need to be renewed, likely starting from scratch, said Tom Clements, executive director of the nuclear watchdog group Savannah River Site Watch.",
      "Also, the type of reactors proposed have seen massive cost overruns even when successfully built. Brookfield took over the assets of Westinghouse Electric Co., which had to declare bankruptcy because of difficulties building them.",
      "Two nuclear reactors built in a similar way in Georgia went $17 billion over budget before they were fully operational in 2023.",

      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t. I do know there are other people that would. If the rule is there, the rule is there. But I know what kids are like, and I\u2019ve been a kid before, and they\u2019re going to get around it if they can,\u201d she said.",
      "While the law allows parents no discretion to allow their children to hold social media accounts, Allen said there was a role for parents in regulating their children\u2019s social media use.",
      "A year ago, she banned Riley from social media for several weeks.",
      "\u201cIn the past with Riley, we\u2019ve had to take measures to limit his usage because we found him on social media at midnight and he wasn\u2019t getting his homework done and things like that. We ended up taking it off him for a couple of months,\u201d Allen said. \u201cFrom that, he\u2019s learned to use it a more responsibly.\u201d",
      "Riley, who turns 16 in April, said he understood the ban\u2019s objectives, but there are other ways to achieve them. He suggested a 10 p.m. enforced social media curfew for young children to prevent them losing sleep.",

      "Noah is one of two 15-year-old plaintiffs in a constitutional challenge to the law in the High Court. The other in the case brought by the Sydney-based rights group Digital Freedom Project is schoolgirl Macy Neyland.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea will require advertisers to label their ads made with artificial intelligence technologies from next year as it seeks to curb a surge of deceptive promotions featuring fabricated experts or deep-faked celebrities endorsing food or pharmaceutical products on social media.",
      "Following a policy meeting chaired by Prime Minister Kim Min-seok on Wednesday, officials said they will ramp up screening and removal of problematic AI-generated ads and impose punitive fines, citing growing risks to consumers \u2014 especially older people who struggle to tell whether content is AI-made.",
      "Lee Dong-hoon, director of economic and financial policy at the Office for Government Policy Coordination, said in a briefing that such ads are \u201cdisrupting the market order,\u201d and that \u201cswift action is now essential.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnyone who creates, edits, and posts AI-generated photos or videos will be required to label them as AI-made, and the users of the platform will be prohibited from removing or tampering with those labels,\u201d he said.",
      "AI-generated ads using digitally fabricated experts or deepfake videos and audios of celebrities, promoting everything from weight-loss pills and cosmetics to illegal gambling sites, have become staples across the South Korean spaces of YouTube, Facebook and other social media platforms.",
      "The government will seek to revise the telecommunications act and other related laws so the AI-labeling requirement, along with strengthened monitoring and punitive measures, can take effect in early 2026. Companies operating the platforms will also be responsible for ensuring that advertisers comply with the labeling rules, Lee said.",
      "Officials say it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to monitor and detect the growing number of false ads fueled by AI. South Korea\u2019s Food and Drug Safety Ministry identified more than 96,700 illegal online ads of food and pharmaceutical products in 2024 and 68,950 through September this year, up from around 59,000 in 2023.",
      "The problem is also spreading into areas such as private education, cosmetics and illegal gambling services, leaving the Korea Consumer Agency and other watchdogs struggling to keep pace, the Government Policy Coordination Office said.",
      "Beyond deceptive ads and misinformation, South Korea is also grappling with sexual abuse enabled by AI and other digital technologies. A Seoul court last month sentenced a 33-year-old man to life in prison for running an online blackmail ring that sexually exploited or abused more than 200 victims, including many minors who were threatened with deepfakes and other manipulated sexual images and videos.",

      "Officials will also strengthen monitoring and faster takedown procedures, including enabling reviews within 24 hours and introducing an emergency process to block harmful ads even before deliberation is complete. They also plan to bolster the monitoring capabilities of the Food and Drug Safety Ministry and the Korea Consumer Agency \u2014 using AI, of course.",
      "Prime Minister Kim, Seoul\u2019s No. 2 official behind President Lee Jae Myung, said during the policy meeting that it\u2019s crucial to \u201cminimize the side effects of new technologies\u201d as the country embraces the \u201cAI era.\u201d",

      "Government plans include more research and development spending on AI-specific chips and other advanced semiconductor products as well as expanding the country\u2019s chip manufacturing hubs beyond metropolitan areas near the capital city of Seoul to the southern regions. South Korean chipmakers, including Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, combined for more than 65% of the global memory chip market last year.",
      "The science and telecommunications ministry also said Wednesday it will require the country\u2019s wireless carriers to transition to 5G standalone networks, which are seen as optimal for advanced AI applications because of their higher bandwidth and lower latency, as a condition for renewing their 3G and LTE licenses.",

      "The flurry of regulatory flexing by Brussels that has targeted Big Tech risks antagonizing President Donald Trump's administration, though EU officials denied they were singling out American companies.",
      "The European Commission, which is the 27-nation bloc's top antitrust enforcer, said it's examining whether Google has breached competition rules through its use of content from web publishers and material uploaded to YouTube for AI purposes.",
      "Regulators are concerned that Google has given itself an unfair advantage by using content for two search services, AI Overviews and AI Mode, without paying publishers and content creators or letting them opt out. AI Overviews are automatically generated summaries that appear at the top of its traditional search results, while AI Mode provides chatbot-style answers to search queries.",
      "They're also examining whether Google uses videos uploaded to YouTube under similar conditions to train its generative AI models, while shutting out rival AI model developers.",

      "\u201cThis complaint risks stifling innovation in a market that is more competitive than ever,\" Google said in statement. \u201cEuropeans deserve to benefit from the latest technologies and we will continue to work closely with the news and creative industries as they transition to the AI era.\u201d",
      "The Commission, which is the bloc's executive arm, is carrying out the investigation under the EU's longstanding competition regulations, rather than its newer Digital Markets Act that was was drawn up to prevent Big Tech companies from monopolizing online markets.",

      "TORO TORO, Bolivia -- Legend once had it that the huge, three-toed footprints scattered across the central highlands of Bolivia came from supernaturally strong monsters \u2014 capable of sinking their claws even into solid stone.",
      "Then scientists came here in the 1960s and dispelled children's fears, determining that the strange footprints in fact belonged to gigantic, two-legged dinosaurs that stomped and splashed over 60 million years ago, in the ancient waterways of what is now Toro Toro, a village and popular national park in the Bolivian Andes.",
      "Now, a team of paleontologists, mostly from California\u2019s Loma Linda University, have discovered and meticulously documented 16,600 such footprints left by theropods, the dinosaur group that includes the Tyrannosaurus rex. Their study, based on six years of regular field visits and published last Wednesday in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS One, reports that this finding represents the highest number of theropod footprints recorded anywhere in the world.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no place in the world where you have such a big abundance of (theropod) footprints,\u201d said Roberto Biaggi, a co-author of the study led by Spanish paleontologist Ra\u00fal Esperante. \u201cWe have all these world records at this particular site.\u201d",
      "The dinosaurs that ruled the earth and roamed this region also made awkward attempts to swim here, according to the study, scratching at what was squishy lake-bottom sediment to leave another 1,378 traces.",
      "They pressed their claws into the mud just before water levels rose and sealed their tracks, protecting them from centuries of erosion, scientists said.",
      "\u201cThe preservation of many of the tracks is excellent,\u201d said Richard Butler, a paleontologist at the University of Birmingham who was not involved in the research. He said that, to his knowledge, the number of footprints and trackways found in Toro Toro had no precedent.",
      "\u201cThis is a remarkable window into the lives and behaviors of dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous,\u201d Butler added, referring to the period around 66 million years ago at the end of which an asteroid impact abruptly extinguished all dinosaurs and 75% of living species along with them, according to scientists.",
      "Although they've survived for millions of years, human life has threatened these traces. For decades, farmers threshed corn and wheat on the footprint-covered plateaus. Nearby quarry workers didn\u2019t think much of the formations as they blasted rock layers for limestone. And just two years ago, researchers said, highway crews tunneling through hillsides nearly wiped out a major site of dinosaur tracks before the national park intervened.",
      "Such disturbances may have something to do with the area's striking absence of dinosaur bones, teeth and eggs, experts say. For all of the footprints and swim traces found across Bolivia\u2019s Toro Toro, there are virtually no skeletal remains of the sort that litter the peaks and valleys of Argentine Patagonia and Campanha in Brazil.",
      "But the lack of bones could have natural causes, too. The team said the quantity and pattern of tracks \u2014 and the fact they were all found in the same sediment layer \u2014 suggest that dinosaurs didn\u2019t settle in what is now Bolivia as much as trudge along an ancient coastal superhighway stretching from southern Peru into northwest Argentina.",

      "Japan has issued a megaquake advisory after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck off the eastern coast of Aomori, the northernmost prefecture on the main island",
      "TOKYO -- Japan issued a megaquake advisory Tuesday after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck off the eastern coast of Aomori, the northernmost prefecture of Japan's main island of Honshu, and just south of the northern island of Hokkaido. Damage from this quake was modest \u2014 34 mostly mild injuries and some damage to roads and buildings.",
      "Officials said the advisory is not a prediction and the probability of a magnitude 8 or larger quake is only about 1%. But there\u2019s hope the advisory will serve as a wake-up call for a quake that could have the devastation of the 2011 disaster that killed nearly 20,000 people and destroyed a nuclear plant.",
      "There's said to be an increased risk of a subsequent, magnitude-8 or larger quake within the next week. Officials are urging residents, especially along coastal areas, to be well prepared so they can grab an emergency bag and run as soon as possible if a bigger quake hits.",
      "This advisory seemed mindful compared with another advisory last year. The southern half of Japan's Pacific coastline received a \u201cNankai Trough\u201d megaquake advisory in the summer of 2024, but the ambiguity of that warning led to panic buying of emergency food, event cancellations and business closures.",
      "The Japan Meteorological Agency says Monday's powerful quake temporarily increased potential risks in the regions of Hokkaido and the Sanriku coast. That's where the Pacific Plate beneath Japan forms the two trenches \u2014 the Japan Trench and Chishima Trench \u2014 that have caused many large quakes in the past.",
      "Experts say the deadly quake and tsunami in 2011 was caused by movement associated with the Japan Trench. It spans from off the eastern coast of Chiba to Aomori, and the Chishima Trench goes from the eastern coast of Hokkaido to the northern islands and the Kurils.",
      "In explaining the advisory, the JMA said the magnitude 9.0 quake on March 11, 2011, that devastated large swaths of Japan's northern coast occurred two days after a magnitude 7.3 temblor that occurred at the Japan Trench off the eastern coast of Iwate, one of the hardest-hit areas in that disaster as well as in Monday's quake.",
      "The 2011 quake caused a tsunami that battered northern coastal towns in Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures. The tsunami, which topped 15 meters (50 feet) in some areas, slammed into and destroyed the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. That created deep fears of radiation that linger to this day.",
      "Another offshore megaquake in the Hokkaido-Sanriku area could cause up to a 30-meter (98-foot) tsunami in the region, kill as many as 199,000 people, destroy up to 220,000 houses and buildings, and cause estimated economic damages of up to 31 trillion yen ($198 billion), according to an estimate by the government. It says as many as 42,000 people could suffer from hypothermia in the winter.",

      "\"I glanced behind me very quickly and the lobby of Barus & Holley was empty, or so it seemed,\" Bari said. \"In front of me, the ERC [Engineering Research Center], the like commons area of Barus & Holley is full with about a hundred students.\"",
      "Bari said people were initially obliviously to the commotion, describing students as wearing headphones while prepping for final exams and projects.",

      "The giant alabaster statues, known as the Colossi of Memnon, were reassembled in a renovation project that lasted about two decades. They represent Amenhotep III, who ruled ancient Egypt about 3,400 years ago.",
      "\u201cToday we are celebrating, actually, the finishing and the erecting of these two colossal statues,\u201d Mohamed Ismail, secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, told The Associated Press ahead of the ceremony.",
      "Ismail said the colossi are of great significance to Luxor, a city known for its ancient temples and other antiquities. They\u2019re also an attempt to \u201crevive how this funerary temple of king Amenhotep III looked like a long time ago,\u201d Ismail said.",
      "Amenhotep III, one of the most prominent pharaohs, ruled during the 500 years of the New Kingdom, which was the most prosperous time for ancient Egypt. The pharaoh, whose mummy is showcased at a Cairo museum, ruled between 1390\u20131353 BC, a peaceful period known for its prosperity and great construction, including his mortuary temple, where the Colossi of Memnon are located, and another temple, Soleb, in Nubia.",
      "The colossi were toppled by a strong earthquake in about 1200 BC that also destroyed Amenhotep III\u2019s funerary temple, said Mohamed Ismail, secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities.",
      "They were fragmented and partly quarried away, with their pedestals dispersed. Some of their blocks were reused in the Karnak temple, but archaeologists brought them back to rebuild the colossi, according to the Antiquities Ministry.",
      "In late 1990s, an Egyptian German mission, chaired by German Egyptologist Hourig Sourouzian, began working in the temple area, including the assembly and renovation of the colossi.",

The 35-hectare (86-acre) complex is believed to be the largest and richest temple in Egypt and is usually compared to the temple of Karnak, also in Luxor.",

      "The federal government\u2019s crackdown on commercial driver\u2019s licenses for immigrants has now found problems in eight states in the wake of several deadly crashes",
      "The federal government's crackdown on commercial driver's licenses for immigrants has found problems in eight states so far in the wake of several deadly crashes.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has publicly threatened to withhold millions in federal money from California, Pennsylvania, Minnesota and now New York after investigations found problems such as licenses that remained valid long after an immigrant's legal status expired. But the department quietly also sent letters detailing similar concerns to Texas, South Dakota, Colorado and Washington during the government shutdown after briefly mentioning those states in September.",
      "Concerns about immigrant truck drivers gained attention after a tractor-trailer driver who was not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused an August crash in Florida that killed three people. A fiery California crash that also killed three people in October and involved a truck driver in the country illegally added to the worries.",
      "Duffy proposed new restrictions in September that would severely limit which noncitizens could get a license to drive a semi or a bus, but a court has put the new rules on hold.",
      "In addition, the Trump administration has been seeking to enforce existing English language requirements for truckers since the summer. As of October, about 9,500 truck drivers have been pulled off the road nationwide for failing to demonstrate English proficiency during traffic stops or inspections.",
      "Here's a summary of what has happened so far:",
      "The Transportation Department focused first on California because the driver in the Florida crash got a license there. He also went to California after the crash and had to be extradited to face charges.",
      "California fought back after Duffy threatened to pull $160 million from the state. Gov. Gavin Newsom sparred with Duffy in statements and social media posts defending the state's practices by saying California officials had verified the immigration status of all these drivers through federal databases, as required.",
      "But after that back-and-forth, California revoked 17,000 commercial driver's licenses last month after confirming problems with them. That number has since grown to 21,000. So the Transportation Department hasn't pulled that funding.",
      "But Duffy did revoke a separate $40 million in federal funding because he said California is the only state not enforcing English language requirements for truckers.",
      "The federal government might withhold nearly $75 million from Pennsylvania if it is not satisfied with the actions the state takes.",
      "The Transportation Department said its audit found a couple of licenses out of 150 it reviewed were valid after the driver's lawful presence in the country ended. In four other cases, the federal government said Pennsylvania gave no evidence it had required noncitizens to provide legitimate proof they were legally in the country at the time they got the license.",
      "As it has done in all these states, the Transportation Department ordered Pennsylvania to stop issuing commercial driver's licenses to immigrants until it completed a full review to ensure all the licenses it has issued remain valid and revoke any licenses that aren't.",
      "The federal government said that approximately 12,400 noncitizen drivers hold an unexpired commercial learner\u2019s permit or commercial driver\u2019s license issued by Pennsylvania.",
      "Duffy threatened to withhold $30.4 million from Minnesota if that state doesn\u2019t address shortcomings in its commercial driver\u2019s license program and revoke any licenses that never should have been issued.",
      "The Transportation Department found some licenses that were valid beyond a driver\u2019s work permit and some where the state never verified a driver\u2019s immigration status.",
      "The head of Minnesota's Department of Driver and Vehicle Services, Pong Xiong, said the state found a number of administrative issues in the 2,117 non-domiciled commercial licenses the state has issued and took action, including cancelling some licenses. Xiong said the federal audit largely just confirmed the issues Minnesota had already found and corrected.",

And he said the state could not prove it had verified these drivers\u2019 immigration status for the 32,000 active non-domiciled commercial licenses it has issued. Plus, investigators found some examples of New York issuing licenses even when applicants\u2019 work authorizations were already expired.",
      "\u201cNew York must act immediately to comprehensively audit its CDL program and revoke every single illegally issued licenses,\u201d said Derek Barrs, administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.",

      "A spokesperson for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement that \u201cpublic safety is the Governor\u2019s top priority, and we must ensure that truckers can navigate Texas roadways safely and efficiently. To support this mission, Governor Abbott directed the Texas Department of Public Safety to strictly enforce English language proficiency requirements and to stop issuing intrastate commercial driver\u2019s licenses to drivers who do not meet those standards.\u201d",

      "South Dakota officials didn't immediately respond Friday to the concerns. The state could lose $13.25 million.",
      "Roughly 22% of the 99 licenses that were reviewed in Colorado violated federal requirements. That raises questions about the 1,848 active non-domiciled commercial driver's licenses in the state.",

      "Jennifer Giambi, a spokesperson for the Colorado DMV, said the state is in the middle of auditing its licensing program to check for any additional problems, and that audit should be done by January. No new licenses are being issued in the program right now.",
      "The state could lose $31.35 million if the Transportation Department isn't satisfied with their response.",
      "Investigators only found problems in about 10% of the 125 licenses they reviewed in Washington, but they were alarmed to learn that an internal state review discovered 685 immigrant drivers who were issued regular commercial licenses instead of the non-domiciled ones they should have received. The Transportation Department said that state officials often accepted the wrong documents in those cases.",
      "Washington officials told the AP they couldn't immediately respond Friday while the state is grappling with widespread flooding. But earlier this week, a state Department of Licensing spokesperson, Nathan Olson, said in an email to the Seattle Times that the errors had been addressed and Washington is working to improve its system and procedures.",

      "Saturday's attack was the first with fatalities since the fall of Syrian President Bashar Assad a year ago.",
      "The United States has had troops on the ground in Syria for over a decade, with a stated mission of fighting IS. While not part of its official mission, the U.S. presence has also been seen as a means to hinder the flow of Iranian and Iran-backed fighters and weapons into Syria from neighboring Iraq.",

      "Wary of getting bogged down in another costly and politically unpopular war in the Middle East after its experience in Iraq and Afghanistan, Washington sent support to rebel groups but at first avoided direct military intervention.",
      "That changed after the rise of the IS, which carried out sporadic attacks in the U.S. and Europe, while in Iraq and Syria, it seized territory that was at one point half the size of the United Kingdom. In the areas the group controlled, it was notorious for its brutality against religious minorities, as well as Muslims whom it considered to be apostates.",
      "In 2014, the administration of then-U.S. President Barack Obama launched an air campaign against IS in Iraq and Syria. The following year, the first U.S. ground troops entered Syria, where they partnered with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in the country\u2019s northeast.",

During his visit, Syria announced its entry into the global coalition against the Islamic State, joining 89 other countries that have committed to combating the group.",

      "Belarusian authorities have released Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski and key opposition figure Maria Kolesnikova from prison",
      "VILNIUS, Lithuania -- Belarus freed Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski, key opposition figure Maria Kolesnikova and dozens of other political prisoners on Saturday, capping two days of talks with Washington aimed at improving ties and getting crippling U.S. sanctions lifted on a key Belarusian agricultural export.",
      "President Alexander Lukashenko pardoned 123 prisoners, Belarus\u2019 state news agency, Belta, reported. In exchange, the U.S. said it was lifting sanctions on the Eastern European country's potash sector,",
      "A close ally of Russia, Minsk has faced Western isolation and sanctions for years. Lukashenko has ruled the nation of 9.5 million with an iron fist for more than three decades, and the country has been repeatedly sanctioned by the West for its crackdown on human rights and for allowing Moscow to use its territory during the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",
      "John Coale, the U.S. special envoy for Belarus who met with Lukashenko in Minsk on Friday and Saturday, described the talks to reporters as \u201cvery productive\" and said normalizing relations between the two countries was \u201cour goal,\u201d Belta reported.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re lifting sanctions, releasing prisoners. We\u2019re constantly talking to each other,\u201d Coale said, adding that the relationship between the U.S. and Belarus was moving from \u201cbaby steps to more confident steps\u201d as they increased dialogue, the Belarusian news agency reported.",
      "Belarus has released hundreds of prisoners since July 2024. Among the 123 freed Saturday were a U.S. citizen, six citizens of U.S. allied countries, and five Ukrainian citizens, a U.S. official told The Associated Press in an email. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private diplomatic negotiations, described the release as \u201ca significant milestone in U.S.-Belarus engagement\u201d and \u201cyet another diplomatic victory\u201d for U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "The official said Trump\u2019s engagement so far \u201chas led to the release of over 200 political prisoners in Belarus, including six unjustly detained U.S. citizens and over 60 citizens of U.S. Allies and partners.\u201d",
      "Pavel Sapelka, an advocate with the Viasna rights group, confirmed to the AP that Bialiatski and Kolesnikova were among those released.",
      "Bialiatski, a human rights advocate who founded Viasna, was in jail when he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022 along with the prominent Russian rights group Memorial and Ukraine\u2019s Center for Civil Liberties. He was later convicted of smuggling and financing actions that violated public order \u2014 charges that were widely denounced as politically motivated \u2014 and sentenced to 10 years in 2023.",
      "Bialiatski told the AP by phone Saturday that his release after 1,613 days behind bars came as a surprise \u2014 in the morning, he was still in an overcrowded prison cell.",
      "\u201cIt feels like I jumped out of icy water into a normal, warm room, so I have to adapt. After isolation, I need to get information about what\u2019s going on,\" said Bialiatski, who seemed energetic but pale and emaciated in post-release videos and photos.",
      "He vowed to continue his work, stressing that \u201cmore than a thousand political prisoners in Belarus remain behind bars simply because they chose freedom. And, of course, I am their voice.\"",
      "Kolesnikova, meanwhile, was a key figure in the mass protests that rocked Belarus in 2020 and is a close ally of an opposition leader in exile, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya.",
      "Known for her close-cropped hair and trademark gesture of forming a heart with her hands, Kolesnikova became an even greater symbol of resistance when Belarusian authorities tried to deport her in September 2020. Driven to the Ukrainian border, she briefly broke away from security forces at the frontier, tore up her passport and walked back into Belarus.",
      "The 43-year-old professional flutist was convicted in 2021 on charges including conspiracy to seize power and sentenced to 11 years in prison.",
      "Among the others who were released, according to Viasna, was Viktar Babaryka \u2014 an opposition figure who had sought to challenge Lukashenko in the 2020 presidential election, widely seen as rigged, before being convicted and sentenced to 14 years in prison on charges he rejected as political.",

      "Viasna reported that the group's imprisoned advocates, Valiantsin Stefanovic and Uladzimir Labkovich, and prominent opposition figure Maxim Znak were also freed. But it later said it was clarifying its report about Stefanovic's release, and Bialiatski told the AP that Stefanovic had not been freed, though he hopes he will be soon.",
      "Most of the freed prisoners were sent to Ukraine, Franak Viachorka, Tsikhanouskaya\u2019s senior adviser, told the AP. Eight or nine others, including Bialiatski, were being sent to Lithuania on Saturday, and more prisoners will be taken to the Baltic country in the next few days, Viachorka said.",
      "Ukrainian authorities confirmed that Belarus had handed over 114 civilians, including five Ukrainian nationals. Freed Belarusian nationals \u201cat their request\u201d and \u201cafter being given necessary medical treatment\u201d will be taken to Poland and Lithuania, they said.",
      "Lukashenko\u2019s press secretary, Natalya Eismont, said those released were sent to Ukraine because Kyiv was to free several imprisoned Belarusian and Russian nationals as part of the deal, although Ukrainian officials haven't confirmed the claim yet.",
      "When U.S. officials last met with Lukashenko in September, Washington eased some of the sanctions on Belarus while Minsk released more than 50 political prisoners.",
      "\u201cThe freeing of political prisoners means that Lukashenko understands the pain of Western sanctions and is seeking to ease them,\u201d Tsikhanouskaya, the opposition leader in exile, told the AP on Saturday.",
      "She added: \u201cBut let\u2019s not be naive: Lukashenko hasn\u2019t changed his policies, his crackdown continues and he keeps on supporting Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. That\u2019s why we need to be extremely cautious with any talk of sanctions relief, so that we don't reinforce Russia's war machine and encourage continued repressions.\u201d",
      "Belarus, which previously accounted for about 20% of global potash fertilizer exports, has been forced to sharply cut them after Western sanctions targeted state producer Belaruskali and cut off transit through Lithuania\u2019s port in Klaipeda, the country\u2019s main export route.",
      "\u201cSanctions by the U.S., EU and their allies have significantly weakened Belarus\u2019s potash industry, depriving the country of a key source of foreign exchange earnings and access to key markets,\u201d Anastasiya Luzgina, an analyst at the Belarusian Economic Research Center BEROC, told the AP, noting that Minsk likely hopes this paves the way for easing the more painful European sanctions.",
      "The latest round of U.S.-Belarus talks also touched on Venezuela, as well as Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, Belta reported.",
      "Coale told reporters that Lukashenko had given \u201cgood advice\u201d on how to address the war, saying that Lukashenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin were \u201clongtime friends\u201d with \u201cthe necessary level of relationship to discuss such issues.\u201d",

      "The Lithuanian government this week declared a national emergency over security risks posed by meteorological balloons sent from Belarus. The balloons forced Lithuania to repeatedly shut down its main airport, stranding thousands of people.",

      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose mistaken deportation helped galvanize opposition to President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies, has been released from immigration detention, and a judge has temporarily blocked any further efforts to detain him",
      "BALTIMORE -- Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose mistaken deportation helped galvanize opposition to President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies, was released from immigration detention on Thursday, and a judge has temporarily blocked any further efforts to detain him.",
      "Abrego Garcia currently can\u2019t be deported to his home country of El Salvador thanks to a 2019 immigration court order that found he had a \u201cwell founded fear\u201d of danger there. However, the Trump administration has said he cannot stay in the U.S. Over the past few months, government officials have said they would deport him to Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and, most recently, Liberia.",
      "Abrego Garcia is fighting his deportation in federal court in Maryland, where his attorneys claim the administration is manipulating the immigration system to punish him for successfully challenging his earlier deportation.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the latest developments in the case:",
      "Abrego Garcia is a Salvadoran citizen with an American wife and child who has lived in Maryland for years. He immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager to join his brother, who had become a U.S. citizen. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to his home country.",
      "While he was allowed to live and work in the U.S. under Immigration and Customs Enforcement supervision, he was not given residency status. Earlier this year, he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, despite the earlier court ruling.",
      "When Abrego Garcia was deported in March, he was held in a notoriously brutal Salvadoran prison despite having no criminal record.",
      "The Trump administration initially fought efforts to bring him back to the U.S. but eventually complied after the U.S. Supreme Court weighed in. He returned to the U.S. in June, only to face an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee. Abrego Garcia was held in a Tennessee jail for more than two months before he was released on Friday, Aug. 22, to await trial in Maryland under home detention.",
      "His freedom lasted a weekend. On the following Monday, he reported to the Baltimore immigration office for a check-in and was immediately taken into immigration custody. Officials announced plans to deport him to a series of African countries, but they were blocked by an order from U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland.",
      "On Thursday, after months of legal filings and hearings, Xinis ruled that Abrego Garcia should be released immediately. Her ruling hinged on what was likely a procedural error by the immigration judge who heard his case in 2019.",
      "Normally, in a case like this, an immigration judge will first issue an order of removal. Then the judge will essentially freeze that order by issuing a \u201cwithholding of removal\" order, according to Memphis immigration attorney Andrew Rankin.",
      "In Abrego Garcia's case, the judge granted withholding of removal to El Salvador because he found Abrego Garcia's life could be in danger there. However, the judge never took the first step of issuing the order of removal. The government argued in Xinis' court that the order of removal could be inferred, but the judge disagreed.",
      "Without a final order of removal, Abrego Garcia can't be deported, Xinis ruled.",

      "The only way to get an order of removal is to go back to immigration court and ask for one, Rankin said. But reopening the immigration case is a gamble because Abrego Garcia's attorneys would likely seek protection from deportation in the form of asylum or some other type of relief.",
      "One wrinkle is that immigration courts are officially part of the executive branch, and the judges there are not generally viewed as being as independent as federal judges.",
      "\u201cThere might be independence in some areas, but if the administration wants a certain result, by all accounts it seems they\u2019re going to exert the pressure on the individuals to get that result,\u201d Rankin said. \u201cI hope he gets a fair shake, and two lawyers make arguments \u2014 somebody wins, somebody loses \u2014 instead of giving it to an immigration judge with a 95% denial rate, where everybody in the world knows how it\u2019s gonna go down.\u201d",
      "Alternatively, the government could appeal Xinis' order to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and try to get her ruling overturned, Rankin said. If the appeals court agreed with the government that the final order of removal was implied, there could be no need to reopen the immigration case.",
      "In compliance with Xinis' order, Abrego Garcia was released from immigration detention in Pennsylvania on Thursday evening and allowed to return home for the first time in months. However, he was also told to report to an immigration officer in Baltimore early the next morning.",
      "Fearing that he would be detained again, his attorneys asked Xinis for a temporary restraining order. Xinis filed that order early Friday morning. It prohibits immigration officials from taking Abrego Garcia back into custody, at least for the time being. A hearing on the issue could happen as early as next week.",
      "Meanwhile, in Tennessee, Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty in the criminal case where he is charged with human smuggling and conspiracy to commit human smuggling.",
      "Prosecutors claim he accepted money to transport, within the United States, people who were in the country illegally. The charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. Body camera footage from a Tennessee Highway Patrol officer shows a calm exchange with Abrego Garcia. There were nine passengers in the car, and the officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was eventually allowed to continue driving with only a warning.",

      "Brian Jack is a first-term Republican congressman from Georgia, but he's become a key figure in the Oval Office",
      "ATLANTA -- Even though Republican Brian Jack is only a first-term congressman, he has become a regular in the Oval Office these days. As the top recruiter for his party's House campaign team, the Georgia native is often reviewing polling and biographies of potential candidates with President Donald Trump.",

She is at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue working the phones to identify and counsel candidates she hopes can erase Republicans\u2019 slim House majority in November's midterm elections.",
      "Although they have little in common, both lawmakers were forged by the lessons of 2018, when Democrats flipped dozens of Republican-held seats to turn the rest of Trump's first term into a political crucible. Underwood won her race that year, and Jack became responsible for dealing with the fallout when he became White House political director a few months later.",
      "Underwood wants a repeat in 2026, and Jack is trying to stand in her way.",

That\u2019s been a tool and a motivating factor for so many people who want to run.\u201d",
      "Underwood said she is looking for candidates with community involvement and public service beyond Washington politics. A registered nurse, she was a health care advocate before she ran in 2018, joining a cadre of Democratic newcomers that included military veterans, educators, activists and business owners.",
      "\u201cIt's about having ordinary Americans step up\" in a way that \u201cdraws a sharp contrast with the actions of these MAGA extremists,\u201d she said.",
      "It's routine for a president's party to lose ground in Congress during the first midterms after winning the White House. Trump, however, is in the rare position to test that historical trend with a second, nonconsecutive presidency.",
      "Neither party has released its list of favored candidates in targeted seats. But Jack said Oval Office discussions with Trump focus on who can align with the White House in a way that can win.",
      "Jack highlighted former Maine Gov. Paul LePage as an example. LePage is running in a GOP-leaning district where Democrats face the challenge of replacing Rep. Jared Golden, another member of the party\u2019s 2018 class who recently announced he would not seek reelection.",
      "Trump\u2019s involvement contrasts with 2017, when he was not as tied to House leadership, including then-Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., on details of the midterm campaign as he is now. Jack, who got his start with Trump by managing delegate outreach before the 2016 convention, was White House deputy political director during that span. He was promoted to political director after the 2018 losses.",
      "Jack continued advising the president, especially on his endorsements, between Trump's 2021 departure for the White House and Jack's own congressional campaign in 2024. He described Trump as intimately involved in recruitment decisions and open to advice on his endorsements since those 2018 defeats.",
      "Trump loyalty will not always be easy to measure, especially in first-time candidates.",

Elaine Luria, another Underwood classmate and former naval officer, is running again in Virginia after losing her seat in 2022. Luria was among the lead House investigators of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.",
      "Underwood said there are clear parallels to 2018, when successful congressional candidates included Mikie Sherrill, a former Navy helicopter pilot who is now New Jersey governor-elect; Jason Crow, a former Army Ranger who is one of her recruiting co-chairs; and Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA case officer.",
      "Democrats also noted the need to find candidates who reflect a district's cultural sensibilities, meaning a candidate who can withstand Republican accusations that national Democrats are out of touch with many voters.",
      "For instance, in a South Texas district, the top potential Democratic challenger is Tejano music star Bobby Pulido. The five-time Latin Grammy nominee has criticized progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York for using the term \u201cLatinx\u201d rather than \u201cLatino\u201d or \u201cLatina.\u201d",
      "Mid-decade gerrymandering, mostly in Republican-led states at Trump\u2019s behest, leaves the state of the 435 House districts in flux. Even with the changes, Democrats identify more than three dozen Republican-held seats they believe will be competitive. Republicans counter with about two dozen Democratic-held seats they think can flip.",
      "In the Southwest, Democrats are targeting all three Republican seats in Arizona. The GOP is aiming at three Democratic seats in Nevada. From the Midwest across to the Philadelphia suburbs, Democrats want to flip two Iowa seats, two in Wisconsin three in Michigan, three in Ohio and four in Pennsylvania. Republicans are targeting four Democratic seats in New York.",
      "Nearly all Democratic targets were within a 15-percentage point margin in 2024, many of them much closer than that. Democratic candidates in 2025 special elections typically managed double-digit gains compared with Trump\u2019s margins in 2024, including a recent special House election in Tennessee, when Democrats came within 9 points in a district Trump won by 22 points.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the same kind of shifts that we saw in 2017 before the 2018 wins,\u201d said Meredith Kelly, a top official at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee during Trump\u2019s first presidency. \u201cSo, it becomes a mix of that national environment and finding the right candidates who fit a district and can take advantage.\u201d",

      "A federal judge says the Justice Department violated the constitutional rights of a close friend of James Comey and must return to him computer files that prosecutors had hoped to use for a potential criminal case against the former FBI director",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department violated the constitutional rights of a close friend of James Comey and must return to him computer files that prosecutors had hoped to use for a potential criminal case against the former FBI director, a federal judge said Friday.",
      "The ruling from U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly represents not only a stern rebuke of the conduct of Justice Department prosecutors but also imposes a dramatic hurdle to government efforts to seek a new indictment against Comey after an initial one was dismissed last month.",
      "The order concerns computer files and communications that investigators obtained years earlier from Daniel Richman, a Comey friend and Columbia University law professor, as part of a media leak investigation that concluded without charges. The Justice Department continued to hold onto those files and conducted searches of them this fall, without a new warrant, as they prepared a case charging Comey with lying to Congress five years ago.",
      "Richman alleged that the Justice Department violated his Fourth Amendment rights by retaining his records and by conducting new warrantless searches of the files, prompting Kollar-Kotelly to issue an order last week temporarily barring prosecutors from accessing the files as part of its investigation.",
      "The Justice Department said the request for the return of the records was merely an attempt to impede a new prosecution of Comey, but the judge again sided with Richman in a 46-page order Friday that directed the Justice Department to give him back his files.",
      "\u201cWhen the Government violates the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures by sweeping up a broad swath of a person\u2019s electronic files, retaining those files long after the relevant investigation has ended, and later sifting through those files without a warrant to obtain evidence against someone else, what remedy is available to the victim of the Government\u2019s unlawful intrusion?\u201d the judge wrote.",
      "One answer, she said, is to require the government to return the property to the rightful owner.",
      "The judge did, however, permit the Justice Department to file an electronic copy of Richman's records under seal with he Eastern District of Virginia, where the Comey investigation is based, and suggested prosecutors could try to access it later with a lawful search warrant.",

      "That indictment was dismissed last month after a federal judge in Virginia ruled that the prosecutor who brought the case, Lindsey Halligan, was unlawfully appointed by the Trump administration. But the ruling left open the possibility that the government could try again to seek charges against Comey, a longtime foe of President Donald Trump. Comey has pleaded not guilty, denied having made a false statement and accused the Justice Department of a vindictive prosecution.",

      "In 2017, he testified that he had given Richman a copy of a memo he had written documenting a conversation he had with Trump and had authorized him to share the contents of the memo with a reporter. After that testimony, Richman permitted the FBI to create an image, or complete electronic copy, of all files on his computer and a hard drive attached to that computer.",
      "Then, in 2019 and 2020, the FBI and Justice Department obtained search warrants to obtain Richman's email accounts and computer files as part of a media leak investigation that concluded without charges.",

      "An immigration crackdown in Louisiana has forced some teenagers to grow up fast after their parents were arrested by federal agents",
      "KENNER, La. -- Vilma Cruz, a mother of two, had just arrived at her newly leased Louisiana home this week when federal agents surrounded her vehicle in the driveway. She had just enough time to call her oldest son before they smashed the passenger window and detained her.",
      "The 38-year-old Honduran house painter was swept up in an immigration crackdown that has largely targeted Kenner, a Hispanic enclave just outside New Orleans, where some parents at risk of deportation had rushed to arrange emergency custody plans for their children in case they were arrested.",
      "Federal agents have made more than 250 arrests this month across southeast Louisiana, according to the Department of Homeland Security, the latest in a series of enforcement operations that have also unfolded in Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, North Carolina. In some homes, the arrests have taken away parents who were caretakers and breadwinners, leaving some teenagers to grow up fast and fill in at home for absent mothers and fathers.",
      "Cruz's detention forced her son, Jonathan Escalante, an 18-year-old U.S. citizen who recently finished high school, to care for his 9-year-old sister, who has a physical disability. Escalante is now trying to access his mother's bank account, locate his sister's medical records and doctors, and figure out how to pay bills in his mother's name.",
      "\u201cHonestly I\u2019m not ready, having to take care of all of these responsibilities,\u201d Escalante told The Associated Press. \u201cBut I\u2019m willing to take them on if I have to. And I\u2019m just praying that I get my mom back.\u201d",
      "The crackdown dubbed \u201cCatahoula Crunch\u201d has a goal of 5,000 arrests. DHS has said it is targeting violent offenders but has released few details on who it is arresting. Records reviewed by AP found that the majority of those detained in the first two days of the effort had no criminal histories.",
      "This week, Louisiana Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser, a Republican, became the first state official to break with his party over the operations. He criticized them for undermining the regional economy by triggering labor shortages because even immigrants with valid work permits have stayed home out of fear.",
      "\"So I think there needs to be some clarity of what\u2019s the plan,\u201d Nungesser said. \u201cAre they going to take every person, regardless if they got kids, and they\u2019re going to leave the kids behind?\u201d",
      "DHS said Cruz locked herself in the car and refused to lower the window and exit the vehicle as ordered, which forced agents to break the window to unlock the door. She is being held in federal custody pending removal proceedings, officials said.",
      "Immigrant rights groups say the operation is applying a dragnet approach to racially profile Hispanic communities.",
      "In the weeks before the crackdown began, dozens of families without legal status sought to make emergency custody arrangements with relatives, aided by pro bono legal professionals at events organized by advocacy groups in Kenner and throughout the New Orleans region.",
      "\u201cChildren are going to school unsure whether their parents will be home at the end of the day,\" Raiza Pitre, a member of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Louisiana, told a city council meeting Wednesday in Jefferson Parish, which includes Kenner.",
      "Juan Proa\u00f1o, CEO of the League of United Latin American Citizens, said he receives dozens of calls daily from Louisiana families worried about being separated from their children. His organization is helping Escalante navigate life without his mother, and he wants to prepare her son for the worst.",
      "\u201cHe thinks she\u2019ll be home in a couple of days, but it could be weeks or months, or she could be deported,\u201d Proa\u00f1o said.",
      "Cruz's family was supposed to move into their new home next month. She leased it so that her son could finally sleep in his own room.",
      "Kenner resident Kristi Rogers watched masked agents detain Cruz, a soon-to-be neighbor whom she had not yet met. Rogers said her heart went out to Cruz, and she wondered why she was targeted.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m for them trying to clean up the criminals in our area, but I\u2019m hoping that\u2019s all they are detaining and deporting \u2014 the criminals,\u201d Rogers said.",

      "Jose Reyes, a Honduran construction worker and landscaper whose family says he has lived in the U.S. for 16 years, stayed home for weeks to avoid federal agents. But the father of four had to pay rent, so last week he drove to the bank around the corner.",
      "Unmarked vehicles began following Reyes and pulled up alongside his car as he parked in front of his house in Kenner. A video reviewed by AP showed several agents leaping out and removing Reyes from his car as his sobbing daughters screamed for mercy.",

      "NEW YORK -- Most U.S. stocks are rising on Thursday, but a drop for Oracle is holding Wall Street back as investors question whether its big spending on artificial-intelligence technology will pay off.",
      "The S&P 500 fell 0.4% in early trading and pulled a bit further from its all-time high, which was set in October. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 233 points, or 0.5%, as of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.7% lower.",
      "Oracle was one of the heaviest weights on the market and sank 14.5% even though it reported a better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its 14% growth in revenue came up just short of expectations.",
      "Doubts also remain about whether all the spending that Oracle is doing on AI technology will produce the payoff of increased profits and productivity that proponents are promising. Analysts said they were surprised by how much Oracle may spend on AI investments this fiscal year, and questions continue about how the company will pay for it.",
      "Such doubts are weighing on the AI industry broadly, even as many billions of dollars continue to flow in. They had helped drag the broad U.S. stock market through some sharp and scary swings last month.",
      "Nvidia, the chip company that\u2019s become the poster child of the AI boom and is raking in close to $20 billion each month, fell 2.8% Thursday. It was the single heaviest weight on the S&P 500.",
      "Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison said it will continue to buy chips from Nvidia, but it\u2019s now taking a policy of \u201cchip neutrality,\u201d where it will use \u201cwhatever chips our customers want to buy. There are going to be a lot of changes in AI technology over the next few years and we must remain agile in response to those changes.\u201d",
      "Most U.S. stocks nevertheless rose, thanks in part to easing Treasury yields in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.10% from 4.13% on Wednesday and from 4.18% on Tuesday.",
      "Lower Treasury yields mean U.S. government bonds are paying less in interest, which can encourage investors to pay higher prices for stocks and other kinds of investments.",
      "Yields fell after a report said the number of U.S. workers applying for unemployment benefits jumped last week by more than economists expected. That\u2019s a potential indication of rising layoffs.",
      "A day earlier, yields eased after the Federal Reserve cut its main interest rate for the third time this year and indicated another cut may be ahead in 2026. Wall Street loves lower interest rates because they can boost the economy and send prices for investments higher, even if they potentially make inflation worse.",

    "summary": "In their new movie, \"Song Sung Blue,\" Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson play Mike and Claire Sardina, the real-life musical impersonators from Milwaukee who sang as the Neil Diamond tribute act Lightning & Thunder.",
    "story": [
      "Last week, at a New York bar called Old Mates, Australian icon Hugh Jackman sang a few songs by an American icon, Neil Diamond. He's been doing a lot of this lately.",
      "His new film, \"Song Sung Blue,\" is based on the real-life story of Mike and Claire Sardina, celebrity impersonators who teamed up to form a Neil Diamond tribute act by the name of Lightning & Thunder. Jackman was cast early on as Mike, and director Craig Brewer was still looking for someone to play Claire, when Jackman got an idea from watching TV: \"Yeah. It's this little-known show, 'CBS Sunday Morning,'\" he said.",
      "In April 2024, \"Sunday Morning\" aired a profile of Kate Hudson and her blossoming music career.",
      "Jackman was contacted by a friend and assistant, Michelle: \"She texts me: 'Are you watching \"CBS Sunday Morning\"?' I said, 'I'm not.' Normally I am, by the way \u2013 that sounded sucky, but it's true! I normally am! And I wasn't \u2013 I turned it on, and there was Kate promoting her debut solo album. I texted Craig Brewer, the writer-director, and I said, 'Kate Hudson is Claire. Claire is Kate.' And he said, 'Oh my God, perfect.'\"",
      "\"Perfect\" might be the right word: Hudson's turn as Claire Sardina has already earned her a Golden Globe nomination.",
      "Jackman said, \"As much as i could see it and feel it, nothing prepared me from day one of rehearsal through to the end, 'til I saw the movie, of Kate's performance. Because it was like, I could feel \u2013 you know, you just know, like, 'Ah, she's gonna be perfect,' 'cause she's amazing, and I love her, and I love her as an actress. But when there's somehow an alchemy of a part to an actress at that time, when that all comes together? Magic.\"",
      "The performances are magical, but what happened to the Sardinas off stage was anything but: between gigs, they endured poverty, addiction, and some incredibly bad luck.",
      "\"They go through so much,\" Hudson said. \"And if it wasn't a true story, it would almost be \u2013 you wouldn't believe it, you know?\"",
      "The film is at its heart a love story, and you could say the two lead actors have chemistry to burn. Yet, Jackman and Hudson did not know each other well before the project began. \"It's become a bit of a joke,\" said Jackman. \"Because I remember when we first met, but she has no recollection. That's the impression I made!\"",
      "And now?\u00a0 \"Oh, well, very well,\" said Hudson. \"Except consummating. Beyond that, pretty, pretty much everything!\"",
      "Hudson was apprehensive when Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell watched the film: \"Everyone loved the movie. My big thing was thinking, I was watching my mom watching it. I was like, 'God \u2026' because I'm so, I guess, not the glamorous version of myself \u2013 or even honestly my version. You know, I was a bit heavier and didn't see my skin person for a while, you know. I was like, 'God, it must be so interesting for my mom to see her middle-aged daughter on the screen.' She must have been like, 'Oh my God, she's middle-aged!'\"",
      "Still, it seems middle age has been good to Kate Hudson, even in a year that would put the gray in anyone's hair. Last January, a wind-driven firestorm incinerated the Pacific Palisades section of Los Angeles, where Hudson has lived for most of her life. Her home is one of the few still standing, but her neighborhood is full of vacant lots where her friends' houses used to be \u2013 and some of the places she treasured the most went up in smoke.",
      "She showed us around what was left of the neighborhood: \"Every time I drive by here, taking the kids from, like, baseball or soccer, you know, I drive by and I go, 'Oh, that's where mommy had her first kiss.' And now you're like \u2026 it's not there. And that's what I mean by, like, nothing lasts.\"",
      "But in the end, home is where you feel loved. For Hudson, it's still her community in Los Angeles. And for Jackman, it's his pub in Manhattan: \"I come in here, I get a lot of, 'Ah, Hughie, come over and have a beer, mate.' I said, 'Ah, I gotta go.' 'Ah, come on mate, don't be a ****. Let's go. Let's have a beer. Buy me a beer. You can afford it!' A lot of that.\"",
      "I asked, \"Can you show up someplace and kind of be a regular dude?\"",
      "\"Oh yeah,\" he replied.",
      "\"You can show up here and be a regular dude?\"",
      "\"Yeah, except I just have to be prepared for them to make fun of me!\" Jackman said, \"which is a sign of affection!\"",
      "Jackman was prepping for a little Neil Diamond tribute at Old Mates later that night, and just like in the movie, Jackman and Hudson did what Neil Diamond himself would've done: raise the roof.",
      "Watch Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson perform \"Sweet Caroline\" at Old Mates:",
      "One final note: Neil Diamond himself is not in the film, but Jackman says he loved it \u2013 and gave him the ultimate stamp of approval: \"He put his arm around me like that, and I sort of leant, and he just kissed me on the forehead. And he said, 'You did good, kid!'\"",

    "summary": "Enduring romances such as \"Pride and Prejudice,\" \"Sense and Sensibility,\" and \"Emma\" made the British writer one of the brightest names in literature \u2013 and the beloved subject of a yearlong celebration marking the 250th anniversary of her birth.",
    "story": [
      "It might look like a scene from yet another Jane Austen production, but this is no set. The British town of Bath recently held a celebration of the author 250 years after her birth.",
      "This historic English town was channeling the early 1800s, the period when Austen's novels were published. \"Pride and Prejudice,\" \"Sense and Sensibility,\" and \"Emma\" were among those Anne Perng grew up reading: \"The issues that she speaks of \u2013 the economy, class, family, sisters \u2013 still so resonate with us today.\"",
      "Fifteen thousand tickets were sold for this year's 10-day Jane Austen Festival, a level of enthusiasm that surprised even its organizer, Georgia Delve: \"Two of her novels are based here,\" she said. \"So, you can walk in her footsteps down the streets. You've got character names on streets, you've got places she visited. It's just the feeling of being in that world that she inhabited that makes it so special.\"",
      "Writer Devoney Looser said, \"She has written books that are endlessly re-readable.\"",
      "\"It's not enough to read it once?\" I asked.",
      "\"Well, I don't think so. There's something new to find every time.\"",
      "Looser's ties to the author are not just professional: \"My husband is also a Jane Austen scholar,\" she said. \"We met and had a fight over Jane Austen the day we met.\"",
      "\"What a love story!\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah, that's what he'd say, too!\"",
      "In her book, \"Wild for Austen,\" Looser argues the author is hardly plain, prim, and proper: \"It's there in her writings \u2013 this idea of women being positively wild. Unconventional, more free, more artless, and willing to combine feeling and thoughtfulness with intellectual ability. That this is the kind of thing she set out to celebrate in her heroines, at a time where women were supposed to be ideally passive and not very thinking.\"",
      "Austen died at age 41 after suffering a range of ailments. She wrote just six novels (two published after her death).",
      "Looser said, \"You can read her on the level of the word, the sentence, chapter, plot, character, and appreciate what she's done in terms of craft. And on top of that, they're funny and they're incredible works of social criticism.\"",
      "At the University of Southampton in England, scholars and enthusiasts met this past summer to discuss all things Austen.",
      "In the university's collections, among its seven million manuscripts and printed books, head of archives and special collections Karen Robson gave us a sampling from a first edition of Austen's \"Emma,\" printed in 1816:",
      "\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.\"",
      "\"Lucky Emma,\" I said. \"You get so much in just this first sentence.\"",
      "\"Absolutely,\" Robson said. \"She's a wonderful wordsmith.\"",
      "Looser said, \"She publishes the first one, 'Sense and Sensibility,' 1811, as 'by a lady.' And then after that, as 'by the author of \"Sense and Sensibility.\"'\"",
      "\"She didn't put her name on the books? Why?\" I asked.",
      "\"Because novels in this period were not seen as high art. They were still seen as a kind of trashier genre,\" said Looser.",
      "\"So, she didn't want to be associated with it?\"",
      "\"She died before we know if she ever would have decided to put her name on something,\" she said.",
      "Looser likens Austen to Shakespeare, with the kind of staying power that takes form in the many films and miniseries based on her novels. Then, there are the Austen-inspired works, such as \"The Jane Austen Book Club,\" and \"Clueless\" (based on \"Emma\").",
      "We visited the set of another spin-off, \"The Other Bennet Sister,\" based on Janice Hadlow's 2020 novel, which puts the often-overlooked middle sister, Mary, from \"Pride and Prejudice,\" at the center. \"I think she feels like a very modern heroine,\" said Jane Tranter, the executive producer of this BBC/Britbox series. \"It's not a classic boy-meets-girl kind of story.\"",
      "So, why do we see so many adaptations of Austen's work? \"Jane Austen is the absolute master of a love story, of a kind of slow-simmering, everything very proper, but kind of like boiling away beneath the lines of society,\" said Tranter. \"And we love that. And I think we love the period detail.\"",
      "That was clear in Bath, where the past was very much alive and celebrated on her 250th birthday.",
      "Asked why Austen's work endures, Looser replied, \"Because it's brilliant. Right? I mean, I think that's the glib, easy answer: because it's brilliant.\"",

    "summary": "Musicologist Joe Bennett explains the common components of the most enduring Christmas songs, from \"Jingle Bells\" to \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" \u2013 which inspires David Pogue to compose his own new holiday song.",
    "story": [
      "Every year at this time, some of the greatest songs in the world pop up in our playlists. Most of them are decades old, or even centuries. If anyone knows what makes a Christmas song immortal, it's Berklee School of Music forensic musicologist Joe Bennett. He's analyzed the holiday pop charts to learn exactly what makes popular Christmas songs popular \u2013 \"to try and figure out what are the musical characteristics that listeners keep coming back to again and again over the years,\" he said.",
      "In fact, Bennett found that most commercial Christmas hits are about one of only six things. Those thematic characteristics include \"home for the holidays\" (the most common one), weather-themed songs (like \"Let It Snow\"), the myth of Santa Claus, parties, being in love, and being out of love.",
      "Which brings us to the #1 Christmas hit of recent years: from 1994, Mariah Carey's \"All I Want for Christmas Is You.\" Bennett says the song is remarkable because it hits most of the Christmas-themed tropes: \"We get Christmas presents, and the tree, and Santa Claus, and the snow. That lyric is so well-loved as a holiday celebration song, 'cause it's literally got it all.\"",
      "A few years back, \"Sunday Morning\" visited Walter Afanasieff, who wrote that song with Carey. \"Hey, I have a #1 hit every year, but it's the same song every year!\" he laughed.",
      "\"We just kind of, like, go bouncing off of each other, like at a jam session,\" he said. \"No one in a million years would've thought, 'Yeah, we're gonna release this and it's gonna be a big hit.'\"",
      "Musical elements",
      "And what does Maria Carey's hit have in common with most other Christmas hits? Sleigh bells! \"We found that more than 65% of the songs in the corpus had sleigh bells playing eight to the bar,\" said Bennett.",
      "He said the inspiration came from galloping horses: \"In the mid-1800s, the horses would actually wear sleigh bells to warn people that they were coming. So, you can imagine the sort of leather across the horse's mane there, and it's gonna make a heck of a noise \u2013 you're not gonna miss that deadly sleigh coming up behind you! You can imagine a horse trotting to that, and it's eighth notes. Da-da-da-da. Unwittingly pre-composing Christmas music from 100 years afterwards!\"",
      "Major Key",
      "Then there are the technical aspects of a piece of music, like the key. According to Bennett, about 98% of the songs in the data set that he looked at were in a major key. \"On a surface level, Christmas music tends to be cheerful,\" he said.",
      "\"The other characteristic that Christmas music has is, you want every generation to be able to sing it,\" he added. \"So that's why kids' songs are often very simple and go over smaller intervals\" \u2013 like \"Jingle Bells,\" which is comprised of five notes. \"And that's why kids find it easy to sing!\"",
      "And sure enough: Almost every popular Christmas song on Earth has an easily singable range of nine notes or fewer: Among them, \"White Christmas,\" \"12 Days of Christmas,\" \"We Wish You a Merry Christmas,\" \"O Christmas Tree,\" \"The Christmas Song (Chestnuts),\" \"Do You Hear What I Hear?\" \"Silver Bells,\" \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,\" \"Frosty the Snowman,\" \"Little Drummer Boy,\" and \"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing.\"",
      "Bennett points out one more common characteristic: a surprising number of Christmas melodies go right up or down the scale, as in \"Joy to the World,\" \"Let It Snow\" and 'Winter Wonderland.\"",
      "I asked, \"Why do you think that so many Christmas songs wound up with these characteristics? It's not like the composer sat down and said, 'Four-four, major key, swing'?\"",
      "\"No, it's the selection effect \u2013 that is, we only know the Christmas songs that we know and love,\" Bennett said. \"We ignore the experimental ones that just died in the marketplace.\"",
      "A Christmas debut",
      "Now, based on the data I have studied on what makes a great Christmas song, I've written one \u2013 and Kerry Butler has gracefully agreed to sing it for us!",
      "Butler is a veteran of 12 Broadway shows, including \"Hairspray,\" \"Mean Girls\" and \"Beetlejuice.\" She knows her way around a song \u2013 and the holidays hold a special meaning for her. \"My whole family is obsessed with Christmas,\" she said. \"We had our decorations up way before Thanksgiving.\"",
      "Asked what a Christmas song does for her emotionally that a pop song doesn't, Butler replied, \"I think it's the nostalgia. It brings back all these memories when we were little, singing them with our parents, and now we're older and we're singing them with our kids.\"",
      "Now, songwriter Walter Afanasieff and Joe Bennett both say that just including all the traditional musical ingredients doesn't automatically make a song great. \"It's not, like, a formula or an algorithm,\" said Afanasieff.",
      "And Bennett made an obvious point: \"If it were easy, a lot more people would be doing it!\"",
      "But, I had to give it a shot! And so, \"Sunday Morning\" presents the world premiere of \"The Sound of Christmas.\" It's got sleigh bells, in a major key, with a singable range, and a melody going down the scale.",
      "Crackling fires and crunching snow,Fa-la-la and ho-ho-ho!Listen! Oh, I love the sound ofChristmas!",
      "Caroling and jingle bells, \"Silent Nights\" and \"First Noels,\" All around,  I love the sound  Of Christmas",
      "Listen!  It's Christmas time!",

      "A bathrobe sash had been the noose. The deputy's report said, \"he did not observe any signs of a struggle.\" There was an open suitcase and a note.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: I believe the note said, take care of the dogs.",

      "In the report, Lewis said he last saw his wife at 1 p.m. And the church member who called 911, said he and Mark had been outside the house playing basketball and talking about their faith starting at 3 p.m., until Mark went inside and found Joanna dead.",
      "Joanna's mother, Patricia Hunter, knew nothing of what was unfolding at her daughter's house that night. She wasn't called. A day later, a deacon from the church, went to see her.",
      "Patricia Hunter: He said, \"Joanna is dead.\" \u2026 What?",
      "At around the same time, Joe, a Sacramento, California, firefighter, was taken aside by the captain of his firehouse.",

      "Joe Hunter: \u00a0I dropped to my knees.",

      "Patricia Hunter: What did he do to her?",
      "Joe Hunter: I knew. I knew he did it.",
      "Patricia Hunter: And I fell to the ground screaming, crying.",
      "Joe Hunter: Half of me died right there.",
      "A few weeks later when Patricia and her late husband spoke to an officer, he showed her the note.",
      "Patricia Hunter: I actually laughed. And I said, \"That's not a suicide note.\" \u2026 She was leaving him. And that was her note to him, take care of the dogs. I can't take them.",
      "A HISTORY OF ABUSE AND RESTRAINING ORDERS",
      "Joanna had tried to leave Lewis many times before, says Patricia. There was a history of abuse and a cycle that began not long after the couple started seeing each other in high school. At 17, Patricia says, Joanna came home with a black eye.",
      "Patricia Hunter: And I begged her. I said, let's go to the hospital. Let's go to the police \u2026 and she said, \"no, mom, no.\"",
      "At 20, Joanna documented Lewis \"choking\" her and got a restraining order against him. Even so, Joanna returned to him.",
      "At 21, after she reported that Lewis \"grabbed my neck and twisted it,\" Joanna got another restraining order.",
      "In 1996, when she was 22, Joanna was hospitalized with a sprained neck. Mark Lewis was convicted on a domestic violence charge and according to court documents, sentenced to 36 months in the Solano County Jail.",
      "Again, she returned to the relationship.",
      "Patricia Hunter: She told me that he had reached out to her from jail \u2026 Would she come visit him? She did. She fell right back into it.",
      "Joanna was 25 when she married Lewis without telling anyone in her family.",
      "Patricia Hunter: I had to tell my husband, and we just held each other and sobbed because we knew now it would be that much harder to help her and get her out.",
      "Their worry continued over the next decade, but Joanna wouldn't open up to them.",
      "Natalie Morales: You said you feared for your daughter, but did you ever think he would be capable of killing her?",
      "Patricia Hunter: Absolutely.",
      "That is what Patricia believed. Law enforcement at the scene came to the opposite conclusion.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: There is no evidence on her body that another person used force to have killed her.",
      "No homicide investigators were called to the house, the bedroom was not treated as a crime scene, no fingerprints taken, no DNA tested and no phones collected.",
      "After his statement, Mark Lewis was released. Lewis was not asked about his history of abuse or about his prior conviction.",
      "That information was more than 15 years old, says Harris, and not available to the deputy in the field.",
      "The next day, an external autopsy determined the ligature marks on Joanna's neck were consistent with suicide.",
      "A month later, when the toxicology report came back clean, the case was closed. And so began the tug-of-war between the family and the sheriff's department that would go on for years to come.",
      "Patricia Hunter: From this moment, when we couldn't get anyone to listen to us and act on it, we are going to work to get justice for Joanna.",
      "Natalie Morales: Do you think she was ever suicidal?",
      "Joe Hunter: You know \u2026 I'm sure she got in many dark places, but in no way, shape, or form, was she capable of that mindset because I know my sister deep down just wanted to leave.",
      "And in the year before she died, Joanna almost saved herself, says Joe. Almost.",
      "Joe Hunter: My mom called me and said, \"Joanna's coming home.\" I said, \"Oh, really?\" \"Yeah, she's done.\" And I said, \"she's really, really done this time?\" \u2026 And I thought, man, like we got her back. We win.",
      "Patricia Hunter: Within two weeks, mom, I \u2014 I'm going back. And I thought she meant to get more things. \u2026 And she said, no, mom, I have to go back to stay.",
      "Joe Hunter: My mom begged her not to go back. \u2026 on her knees, begging her. \u2026 And my mom said, OK, well, I'll drive you.",
      "Natalie Morales: How much do you think of that moment and that drive, taking her back?",
      "Patricia Hunter: All the time.",
      "Patricia Hunter: On the way over \u2026 I was sobbing and I said, honey \u2026 I'm afraid if you go back, I'll never see you again.",
      "Joe Hunter: And we never saw her again.",
      "A FAMILY'S ANGUISH",
      "Joe Hunter: Joanna \u2026 was the perfect person. \u2026 She was the life of the party, but she was also at the same time \u2026 probably the most compassionate, warm person I've ever known.",
      "From the minute he was born, Joanna relished being Joe's big sister.",
      "Patricia Hunter: She thought Joseph was her gift. \u2026 Someone gave her this adorable little boy and he belonged to her.",
      "Joe Hunter: I always tried to be in charge, but she wouldn't let that happen. \u2026 Anybody that called the house \u2026 they had to go through Joanna first. \u2026 \"and you wanna talk to my brother? Why?\" (laughs) \u2026 She protected me a lot. \u2026 we were the perfect team.",
      "Mark Lewis, the son of a local preacher, was Joanna's first boyfriend. At the start, Joe didn't think he had anything to worry about.",
      "Joe Hunter: The first, maybe six to eight months, she seemed really happy.",
      "But after the abuse began, Joe confronted Mark more than once.",
      "Joe Hunter: After physically going after him \u2026 him then taking it out on her. \u2026 I had to back off a little bit from my sister. \u2026 I had been screaming at her for so long, two years straight. \u2026 I hate this guy, leave this guy, please stop. \u2026 I thought I'm gonna lose her for good. \u2026 So, I'm just gonna listen. \u2026 And then I really got the deep, deep, deep, dark secrets that she wasn't even telling my parents.",
      "And Joanna showed him her wounds.",
      "Joe Hunter: She finally showed me \u2026 the massive indentations from him strangling her \u2026 you could just see clearly each outline of each finger.",
      "Mark Lewis had grown more powerful and influential at the Fellowship Baptist Church. He was on his way to becoming pastor.",
      "After they married, Patricia says she went to Lewis with her fears.",
      "Patricia Hunter: And I said to him \u2026 how do I know in this moment that you will never lay a hand on her again? \u2026 And I'll never forget. He kind of sneered, half smile and he looked at me and said, when she's a better woman and a better Christian, you won't have to worry about that.",
      "Joe Hunter: My sister started saying comments that he would make to her like, hey, we can help save you. Because you're half black, we can help fix that through religion. Because of your hair and the way you look, we can fix that with religion. \u2026 And you just think, how dare you?",
      "Pastor Lewis, to hear former church members tell it, was a commanding and a demanding presence with fiery sermons and an insistence on loyalty.",
      "Jacob Cantrell: Very energetic, get up there and screaming and sweating \u2026 that was his style.",
      "Jacob Cantrell become a deacon there.",
      "Jacob Cantrell: I looked up to him \u2026 he was a \u2026 mentor \u2026 only to find out that I was a pawn.",
      "In hindsight, Cantrell says, Pastor Lewis had too much control over him.",
      "Jacob Cantrell: I couldn't go to my mom and dad's house \u2026 without asking Mark permission. \u2026 I was brainwashed. \u2026 he manipulated me for many years and it \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 it twisted my brain up.",
      "MARK LEWIS (preaching in church): There's no accidents with God.",
      "Jacob Cantrell: He can talk his way out of anything including Miss Joanna's death.",
      "Natalie Morales: Now, you feel that way?",
      "Jacob Cantrell: Now, I feel that way.",
      "Daryl Snedeker: I came to the conclusion that it was probably the closest thing to a cult that I had ever experienced.",
      "Natalie Morales: And he was the leader \u2026",
      "Daryl Snedeker: The leader.",
      "Daryl Snedaker was a deputy in the Solano County Sheriff's Office and a member of the church at the time of Joanna's death. He wasn't involved in the investigation back then. At the church, he says, it didn't take long for him to lose all faith in the place and the pastor.",
      "Natalie Morales: Was there a fear then amongst the people who attended the church, did they fear Mark Lewis?",
      "Daryl Snedeker: I think the people that were his puppets, I think they acted out of fear a lot.",
      "Natalie Morales: You did whatever he asked then?",
      "Jacob Cantrell: Unfortunately. \u2026 You don't question him.",
      "MARK LEWIS (preaching in church): \u00a0It's important that you listen up!",
      "MARK LEWIS (preaching in church): What would you do if you caused your pastor to quit cause you wouldn't obey? What would you do if you caused your Sunday School teacher to quit cause you wouldn't obey?",
      "Daryl Snedeker: It's disheartening. It's shocking.",
      "Joe already knew\u00a0 Lewis all too well and the years after Joanna's death were filled with anguish and frustration.",
      "Joe Hunter: No one was listening to us, no one was believing this.",
      "There were still so many questions about what happened that night. Why didn't Lewis cut Joanna down or try to administer CPR? And Joe found it particularly hard to believe Lewis was actually playing basketball for six straight hours.",
      "Joe Hunter: You never went inside to use the restroom, get a glass of water \u2026 playing basketball for this obscene amount of time \u2026 is absurd to me.",
      "But all their attempts to get the sheriff's office to take another look at Lewis were getting no results \u2014 until Patricia got a knock on the door.",
      "Patricia Hunter: It was \u2026 a reporter asking if we had heard about what had happened with him. I had no idea what he was talking about.",
      "It was 2014. Joanna had been dead a little more than two years. Pastor Mark Lewis had been arrested \u2014 accused of violence against another woman.",
      "Natalie Morales: Do you feel lucky to be alive?",
      "Sarah Nottingham: Oh yeah.",
      "SARAH NOTTINGHAM'S HARROWING NIGHT",
      "On that crisp fall day in 2011 when Pastor Mark Lewis said he found his wife dead, he never called Joanna's family. He did call Sarah Nottingham.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: He had asked if I heard what happened, he sounded upset. He was crying.",
      "At the time, Nottingham says, she believed in her pastor \u2014 Joanna had died by suicide. Sarah says she and Lewis became friends, then began dating about a year after Joanna's death.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: At first, it was somewhat exciting thinking that \u2026 I'm seeing a side of this person that no one else is seeing.",
      "Eventually, Nottingham says another side of Mark Lewis began to emerge.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: A lot of ... extreme manipulation, a lot of gaslighting, and a lot of verbal abuse, um, some physical. ... A push or a shove. ... And it was just more and more.",
      "And then, she says, she discovered that Lewis had been sending inappropriate text messages to an underage girl.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: You know, I'm just like, I've had enough, like, I'm done. And he said, I'm not ready for it to be over. \u2026 I would just keep telling him, you know, this is, it's over, we're done.",
      "Lewis grabbed her, she says, and tightly wrapped his arms around her.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: It was meant to be threatening. He squeezed me tight and told me, \"You've created a monster.\"",
      "Nottingham and her two young children were living with her parents in Vacaville as the pastor's threats, she says, became more frequent and frightening.",
      "Sarah Nottingham (outside her former home): The first time ... my car was vandalized, it was actually parked here (pointing at the driveway).",
      "Sarah Nottingham: He had, either himself or had somebody, smash my windshield in on my car.",
      "Nottingham was granted an order of protection against Lewis. But it did not stop what happened next in the early morning hours of Jan. 9, 2014.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: It was three something in the morning. And I woke up to our um fire alarm going off \u2026 and there was um smoke filling the hallway. And I checked on my kids.",
      "A Molotov cocktail had crashed through her parents' bedroom window.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: We were able to put the fire out ourselves. \u2026 I had never seen my dad run so fast out the door, trying to see if he could see anybody.",
      "Vacaville Police pulled over a U-Haul van within minutes, arresting the driver and two passengers. The trio quickly confessed, telling police they were hired to firebomb Sarah Nottingham's house \u2014 hired by the pastor, Mark Lewis. He was questioned by local reporters.",
      "MARK LEWIS (KVOR news report): I never\u00a0\u2014\u00a0I never gave them any money to do anything bad.",
      "Lewis was arrested, charged with arson, conspiracy, and stalking.",
      "MARK LEWIS (KVOR news report): A lot of people are going to \u2026 throw accusations out there. But until the facts come out, why don't we just wait and see how that goes and let the court decide.",
      "SARAH NOTTINGHAM (KOVR news report): I'm living in a nightmare. My kids are so scared. My\u00a0\u2014\u00a0my son knows that this is, this is a pastor, his previous pastor that is threatening his mommy and his family.",
      "Natalie Morales: What do you think you and your family survived at that time?",
      "Sarah Nottingham: Ultimately, death. \u2026 When the police came into the house, one of them said this is attempted murder and that's exactly what it was, nothing less.",
      "Surviving the attack, Nottingham says, helped answer a lingering question about Joanna.",
      "Natalie Morales: How do you see her death?",
      "Sarah Nottingham: By him. \u2026 There's just not a doubt in my mind.",
      "By January 2015, Lewis' thundering sermons that echoed in the Fellowship Baptist Church were a distant memory as he sat silently in a Solano County courtroom. Lewis' trial had begun for stalking Sarah Nottingham and hiring people to firebomb her parents' home.",
      "Joe Hunter: I hear about the arson charge. I hear about the stalking. \u2026 But I also feel that he needs to be convicted \u2026 for what he did to my sister.",
      "On day three of Lewis' arson and stalking trial, he changed his plea from not guilty to no contest \u2014 meaning he would not dispute the charges against him but also would not acknowledge guilt. Lewis was sentenced to eight years in prison.",
      "Natalie Morales: How important was that development then in allowing you to then go back to the sheriff's office and demand that they reopen the case?",
      "Patricia Hunter: It was huge, because there was \u2014   it isn't often that you read about a pastor hiring people to firebomb someone's house. ... Because of media pressure, we felt that now is the time where we can go back and say, \"Look at Joanna's case. Reopen it.\"",
      "The Solano County Sheriff's Office did reopen the case in 2014. Remember the churchgoer who called 911 the night Joanna died? His name is Andrew Alvarado. Back then he told authorities that he had played basketball with Pastor Mark Lewis for about six hours. Detectives decided to reinterview him and recorded the call.",
      "DETECTIVE MEHL (phone call): Was anyone else playing basketball with you?",
      "ANDREW ALVARADO: Yeah, a couple other \u2026 teenagers.",
      "This time, investigators learned a new detail.",
      "ANDREW ALVARADO (phone call): I left to go drop them off. I guess I had to go eat dinner or whatever.",
      "He had actually left the church grounds during those six hours to drive the teenagers home, he says, and wasn't sure what the pastor was doing while he was gone. \"48 Hours\" repeatedly reached out to Alvarado but never heard back.",
      "Natalie Morales: So there were gaps of time when he was not with Mark Lewis.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: Right. \u2026 That still does not change the fact that \u2026 the lack of evidence on her body does not show a second person involved in her death.",
      "Mark Lewis was not questioned during the reinvestigation.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: He ... \u2026 exercised his constitutional right to have his attorney, who did not allow him to speak to us.",
      "The sheriff's office had another forensic pathologist look at Joanna's case. Dr. Scott Luzi agreed with the original coroner: suicide. The case was closed again. And then in 2015, the county district attorney's office announced its own investigation, which included DNA testing on Joanna's bathrobe sash. The results? Her DNA was found on the sash along with an unknown male \u2014  not Mark Lewis.",
      "Natalie Morales: Was anything done to investigate that further, to \u2026 could it have been anybody else associated with Mark Lewis?",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: That DNA that was collected from there, my understanding is that it was entered into the DNA \u2014 I believe it's called CODIS, the database.",
      "CODIS is the FBI's criminal DNA database.",

    "summary": "King Charles III says that his cancer treatment will be reduced in the new year because of early diagnosis, effective intervention and adherence to doctor's orders.",
    "story": [
      "King Charles III said Friday that his cancer treatment will be reduced in the new year because of early diagnosis, effective intervention and adherence to doctors' orders.",
      "Charles, 77, revealed the information in a recorded message broadcast on British television Friday as part of a campaign to encourage people to take advantage of screening that can detect cancer in its early stages when it is easiest to treat.",
      "Buckingham Palace made the announcement\u00a0last year that doctors had detected cancer in the king.",
      "\"Early diagnosis quite simply saves lives,\" the king said Friday.",
      "\"I know, too, what a difference it has made in my own case, enabling me to continue leading a full and active life even while undergoing treatment,\" he added.",
      "The recorded message gave Charles the opportunity to reflect on his experiences in the 22 months since he announced he would undergo treatment for an undisclosed type of cancer.",
      "He said he had been deeply troubled to learn that at least 9 million people in the U.K. weren't up to date with the cancer screenings available to them.",
      "\"That is at least 9 million opportunities for early diagnosis being missed,\" he stressed.",
      "He highlighted how when bowel cancer is caught at the earliest stage, around nine in 10 people survive for at least five years. \"When diagnosed late, that falls to just one in 10,\" Charles said.",
      "Royal sources said it should not be assumed the king was being treated for bowel cancer. While the palace hasn't specified what type of cancer the king has, officials said the cancer was discovered after treatment for an enlarged prostate revealed \"a separate issue of concern.\"",
      "Charles' decision to disclose his diagnosis was a departure for Britain's royals, who have traditionally considered their health to be a personal matter and shared few details with the public.",
      "\"His majesty has chosen to share his diagnosis to prevent speculation and in the hope it may assist public understanding for all those around the world who are affected by cancer,\" Buckingham Palace said at the time.",
      "Since then, Charles has used his own story to highlight the need for early diagnosis and treatment. Cancer Research UK recorded a 33% increase in visits to its website in the weeks after the king's diagnosis, as people sought information about the signs of cancer.",
      "The monarch suspended public engagements for about two months after his diagnosis so he could focus on his treatment and recovery. But he continued with state business and retained his constitutional role as head of state.",
      "Charles returned to public-facing events in April of last year with a visit to a cancer treatment center at University College Hospital in central London, where he met with staff and shared stories with fellow cancer patients.",
      "\"It's always a bit of a shock, isn't it, when they tell you,\" he said at the time, sympathizing with one patient as chemotherapy drugs dripped into her arm.",

      "A Hollywood director was convicted Thursday on charges that he scammed Netflix out of $11 million for a show that never materialized, while he instead used the cash for lavish purchases that included several Rolls-Royces, a Ferrari and about $1 million in mattresses and luxury bedding.",
      "Carl Erik Rinsch, best known for directing the film \"47 Ronin,\" was convicted of wire fraud, money laundering and other charges, according to court records and a spokesperson for federal prosecutors in New York.",
      "In a statement, Rinsch's attorney, Benjamin Zeman, said he thought the verdict was wrong and \"could set a dangerous precedent for artists who become embroiled in contractual and creative disputes with their benefactors, in this case one of the largest media companies in the world, finding themselves indicted by the federal government for fraud.\"",
      "Prosecutors said Netflix had initially paid Rinsch about $44 million for an unfinished sci-fi show called \"White Horse,\" and then sent over another $11 million after he said he needed additional funding to wrap up the production.",
      "But instead of putting the money toward the show, Rinsch steered the cash to a personal account where he made a series of failed investments, losing around half of the $11 million in a couple months, according to prosecutors. He then put the remaining funds into the cryptocurrency market, netting some profit, though Rinsch then deposited the money into his own bank account.",
      "Then came the lavish purchases, prosecutors said, with Rinsch buying five Rolls-Royces and one Ferrari, along with $652,000 on watches and clothes. He also bought two mattresses for about $638,000 and spent another $295,000 on luxury bedding and linens. In addition, he used some of the money to pay off about $1.8 million in credit card bills, prosecutors said.",
      "Rinsch never finished the show. His sentencing date is set for April.",
      "Netflix declined to comment.",
      "U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton, in a statement, said Rinsch \"took $11 million meant for a TV show and gambled it on speculative stock options and crypto transactions.\"",
      "\"Today's conviction shows that when someone steals from investors, we will follow the money and hold them accountable,\" Clayton said.",

      "Paramount Skydance on Monday made a $108.4 billion hostile takeover offer for all of Warner Bros. Discovery, with its all-cash bid coming just three days after Netflix agreed to buy a part of Warner Bros. in a deal valued at $82.7 billion.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery \"shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company,\" Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison said in a statement.",
      "\"Our public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion,\" he said.",
      "Paramount Skydance is the parent company of CBS News.",
      "The new offer steps up the battle over the future of Warner Bros. Discovery, which on Friday agreed to a deal with Netflix under which the streaming giant would acquire Warner's streaming and movie assets. Warner Bros.' storied film library includes classics like \"Casablanca\" and the \"Harry Potter\" film series.",
      "Paramount Skydance said its offer is a better deal for Warner shareholders because it includes the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its cable television channels such as CNN, TBS, TNT and The Food Network. The transaction would also have an easier path through the regulatory process than Netflix's offer, according to Paramount.",
      "\"Paramount is highly confident in achieving expeditious regulatory clearance for its proposed offer, as it enhances competition and is pro-consumer, while creating a strong champion for creative talent and consumer choice,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Paramount Skydance's offer includes the cost of absorbing Warner Bros. Discovery's debt, which as of September 30 was more than $33 billion, a regulatory filing shows. The all-cash $30 per share offer amounts to nearly $78 billion. Excluding Warner Bros. Discovery's debt, Netflix's bid for the company comes to roughly $72 billion.",
      "The offer is backed by the Ellison family \u2014 Paramount CEO David Ellison's father is Larry Ellison, who leads software maker Oracle Corp. and is the second-richest person with a net worth of $277 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index \u2014 as well as investment firm RedBird Capital.",
      "Paramount Skydance's bid also includes several outside financing partners, according to a Paramount Skydance regulatory filing. They include Affinity Partners, the private equity firm run by Jared Kushner, a son-in-law of President Trump, and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.",
      "The outside investment firms have agreed to give up any governance rights, including seats on the board of directors of a combined firm, according to the regulatory filing.",
      "Potential antitrust \u2014 and political \u2014 hurdles",
      "Some Wall Street analysts have said the Netflix-Warner Bros. combination could raise concerns among U.S. antitrust enforcers because of the streaming service's size and the potential to reduce competition in the media space.",
      "\"Because Netflix is positioned as the largest streaming platform, the company's acquisition of HBO Max services and customers raises red flags,\" said Jeffrey May, managing editor for the Insights & Enrichment team within Wolters Kluwer Legal and Regulatory U.S., in an email.",
      "May added, \"Netflix and HBO Max compete for subscribers. Their combination could be seen as a threat to competition and innovation.\"",
      "President Trump also signaled the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal could face hurdles, saying on Sunday that the combined company's size \"could be a problem.\" Mr. Trump also said he would be involved in any decision about whether the federal government should approve the deal.",
      "Usha Haley, a Wichita State University professor who specializes in international business strategy, told the Associated Press that Paramount's ties to Mr. Trump are notable. Larry Ellison is an avowed supporter of Mr. Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump \"said he's going to be involved in the decision \u2014 we should take him at face value,\" Haley said. \"For him, it's just greater control over the media.\"",
      "Netflix declined to comment, while Warner Bros. Discovery didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In a presentation at the UBS Global Media and Communications conference on Monday, Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said they were confident their deal with Warner Bros. would close. Sarandos also said Netflix is committed to creating U.S. jobs.",
      "Blair Levin, a media and telecommunications industry analyst with investment adviser New Street Research, said Mr. Trump's involvement in the battle for Warner Bros. could backfire for Paramount Skydance.",
      "\"If Trump weighs in publicly against the deal, [Netflix] could argue that he did so for political or personal reasons rather than antitrust reasons and seek evidence, including discovery and depositions, leading to all kinds of delays and other potential collateral damage to the government case,\" he said in a note to investors.",
      "Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery jumped $1.65, or 6.3%, to $27.72 in early trading on Monday, while Paramount Skydance shares rose 78 cents, or 5.8%, to $14.14. Netflix's stock slumped 4.9% to $95.64.",
      "Paramount Skydance's tender offer is set to expire on Jan. 8, 2026, unless it is extended.",
      "Impact on streaming",
      "Netflix, which has more than 300 million subscribers, is the world's largest streaming service, according to David R. King, a professor of management at Florida State University.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming platforms, which include HBO Max and Discovery+, rank as the fourth-largest with 128 million subscribers, followed by Paramount+ at No. 5, with 78 million customers, he added. Amazon Prime Video and Disney/Hulu rank as No. 2 and 3, respectively.",
      "The prospect of more media industry consolidation has prompted critics such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, to speak out against the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal. In a statement on Friday, Warren said the combination would \"create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market.\"",
      "Netflix is likely to argue that other video platforms, such as YouTube should be included in calculating streaming services' market share,\u00a0according to The Guardian.",
      "The bidding war follows Warner Bros. Discovery's announcement in June that it planned to split into two businesses, separating its cable networks from its streaming and studios business.",
      "But in October, the media conglomerate said it had attracted interest\u00a0from companies about buying all or parts of it outright, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that media and entertainment businesses, including Netflix, Paramount Skydance and Comcast, were pursuing a deal.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders \"will have to choose between [Paramount Skydance's] straight $30-a-share cash offer and Netflix's slightly lower, more complex bid with a linear networks spin-off, both carrying serious antitrust questions,\" David O'Hara, managing director at market research firm MKI Global Partners, said in an email.",

    "title": "Millions of Americans could see health plan costs double as ACA credits vanish",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/aca-subsidies-obamacare-health-insurance-affordable-care-act/",
    "published": "Fri, 12 Dec 2025 15:16:44 -0500",
    "summary": "\"I don't know how I'm going to pay for this,\" said one person with an Affordable Care Act plan that will cost her $1,100 a month starting in January.",
    "story": [
      "Mahwah, New Jersey, resident Tina Jump recently learned that the premium for her Affordable Care Act health insurance is set to surge from about $400 a month to more than $1,100 starting in January \u2014 a nearly threefold increase that she said left her in a state of panic.",
      "Jump, who earns about $72,000 a year as a real estate title officer, already feels financially stretched by the need to cover both her Blue Cross Blue Shield plan and the roughly $415 a month she pays for a prescription drug for type 2 diabetes.",
      "\"I don't know how I'm going to pay for this,\" Jump, 59, told CBS News. Her boss has offered to chip in, but she said the higher premium would still be a major strain on her budget.",
      "\"I'm just going to have to cut back on whatever else I can,\" she added. \"It's just insane. What's going to happen in the next couple of years? Is it going to continue to go up?\"",
      "With two health care bills failing to advance in the Senate on Thursday, the ACA's enhanced premium tax credits \u2014 which 90% of enrollees in the government health program rely on to ease the cost of affording health insurance \u2014 are almost certain to expire on Dec. 31. That will leave Jump and the roughly 22 million other Americans who now qualify for the tax credits facing some tough financial decisions.",
      "Out-of-pocket premium costs will increase 114% on average for ACA participants who currently receive the subsidies, hiking their annual costs for medical insurance by $1,016, according to health policy group KFF.",
      "\"That's a huge financial burden for most families,\" Emma Wager, a senior policy analyst at KFF, told CBS News. \"There's not a lot of people who can afford that.\"",
      "Some households could see even larger spikes. A family of four earning $75,000 per year is likely to see their insurance premiums rise by an additional $3,368 without the tax credits, the group estimated.",
      "Such a drastic increase in ACA costs would arrive as Americans are already struggling to afford groceries, rent, utilities and other essentials, leaving many financially pinched.",
      "\"Tsunami of health costs\"",
      "Some ACA participants told CBS News they are considering going without health insurance next year if their monthly premiums spike. Others are opting for cheaper plans with less coverage, potentially exposing them to higher costs and medical debt, Michelle Sternthal, director of government affairs at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "\"We are going to see a tsunami of health costs increasing\" on January 1, Sternthal said. \"Right now, we're hearing about families facing shocking increases.\"",
      "About 4 million people could drop their health insurance due to the higher ACA premiums, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The rising costs could hit some Americans harder than others, with small business owners and self-employed workers particularly vulnerable, Sternthal noted. Many such workers have turned to the ACA for health coverage because they lack employer-based insurance. About half of adults enrolled in the ACA are small business owners, employed by a company with fewer than 25 workers or are self-employed, according to KFF.",
      "That group includes Aaron Lehman, an Iowa farmer who grows corn, soybeans and other crops on his family's farm. In testimony before a Dec. 10 Senate hearing, he said the enhanced premium tax credits have allowed him to work full-time on his farm.",
      "\"But unfortunately, my wife and I have learned that in order to keep a similar policy for 2026, our health insurance costs will more than double,\" Lehman told the committee.",
      "Why the subsidies were created",
      "The ACA tax credits were established in 2021, as the U.S. was reeling from the pandemic, to lower households' monthly health plan costs; the subsidies were later extended under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act. With the credits set to expire this year, Democratic lawmakers this fall pushed for an extension, a congressional fight that became the main sticking point in the 43-day government shutdown that ended in November.",
      "As part of the deal to end the funding impasse, Republicans vowed to hold a vote on whether to extend the ACA credits by mid-December. The GOP also introduced its own measure to address health care costs, which involved sending funds directly to consumers rather than extending the ACA subsidies.",
      "However, votes on both health care proposals failed in the Senate on Thursday.\u00a0Some lawmakers\u00a0remain optimistic they can strike a bipartisan deal. But any agreement would likely involve reforms to the ACA to address income caps and fraud, along with a gradual phasing out of the enhanced subsidies.",
      "Sternthal of Community Catalyst thinks Congress will face political pressure to address the expired tax credits once once millions of families face sticker shock in January.",
      "In the meantime, Americans who get their health insurance through an employer-based plan could also be impacted by the higher ACA costs, she added.",
      "The reason:\u00a0 If millions drop coverage, as the CBO has predicted, it would likely destabilize the health care market because more people would need to rely on emergency rooms for treatment. Because hospitals, by law, must treat uninsured patients, they typically recoup the costs by hiking treatment costs for others.",
      "\"If you have fewer people covered, that means there will be more uncompensated care, and people will go to the ER \u2014 and that will trickle down into providers and insurance companies,\" Sternthal said. \"It's an economy-wide problem.\"",

    "summary": "The Made in America Holiday Gift Guide, promoting products made in the U.S., includes more than 150 companies from all 50 states. For small business owners, being included in this year's gift guide feels close to a Christmas miracle.",
    "story": [
      "'Tis the season for holiday gift guides. You know, the ones that suggest 31 fish gifts for your fish-obsessed friends. They're everywhere this time of year, though nowhere quite as surprising as a seemingly run-of-the-mill office in Washington, D.C.",
      "\"I will candidly admit that when we started this a dozen years ago, I thought it was a fun thing to do,\" said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a trade advocacy and lobbying group that works to strengthen manufacturing in the U.S. \"It's just a break from talking about tariffs and policy and regulation. And so, the gift guide was kind of like a whimsical thing. It's grown into something much larger than that.\"",
      "Unlike other holiday gift guides, theirs features only products made in America, from cowboy hat racks made in Wyoming, to giant stuffed animals from South Carolina. The list includes more than 150 companies from all 50 states.",
      "Made in America Holiday Gift Guide (from the Alliance for American Manufacturing)",
      "Made in America Holiday Gift Guide (from the Alliance for American Manufacturing)",
      "And it's a very big deal for the companies included. \"It can be very uplifting to some of these companies, because some are like, how did you find us?\" Paul laughed.",
      "As a proud Marylander, Shelby Blondell dreamed of a better way to dig into the state's official unofficial cuisine. The result? The Sheller. Her small business, in a quiet Baltimore suburb, is a labor of love that is keeping manufacturing close to home.",
      "\"All along, I even had a lot of people when I was, you know, creating it saying like, 'You should just be making this overseas, you'll make so much more money,'\" Blondell said. \"And money's great. We need money to live. But you know, the cost of what that would've been didn't seem to outweigh kind of that value in my mind of wanting to have this be made here.\"",
      "Value like partnering with a local fabricator that uses American steel, which means the Sheller has avoided the sting of recent tariffs. \"If I would've been hit with tariffs of making this overseas somewhere right now, I don't know that I could still be in business,\" Blondell said.",
      "This gift guide knows that your pets, of course, deserve stocking stuffers as well, and it suggests\u00a0Cycle Dog\u00a0in Portland, Oregon. For 16 years, founder Lynette Fidrych and her team have been recycling bicycle tire inner tubes to make leashes and collars. And yes, this collar does have a bottle opener. \"Portland is known for biking, beer, sustainability, and dogs,\" Fidrych laughed.",
      "A former Nike employee, Fidrych now employs about 30 workers at her Portland factory. \"Made in America\" means higher labor cost, and sometimes higher price tags. But to her, it also means higher quality. \"We make a product and we put it in the dog run and have a hundred dogs play with it,\" she said. \"And so, when we sell this toy, we're like, yeah, it's gonna last.",
      "\"Most people assume that plush toys are made in China, even my retailers,\" she said. \"And I'm like, 'No, we hand-make these here in the U.S. There's a flag on the tag.\"",
      "Meanwhile, back in D.C., Scott Paul is actually pretty easy to shop for: his shirt, made in New Jersey; his belt, made out of American leather; his shoes, from Meridian, Mississippi.",
      "For those of us still scrambling for a last-minute gift, Paul says to look close to home, and to start with the guide that brings not just holiday cheer, but maybe a little American pride.",
      "\"No one needs to say, 'Everything I have to own or buy has to be made in the United States'; that doesn't do anybody any favors, and it's really hard to pull off,\" he said. However, \"If you can't find one thing that looks really cool and is also affordable on our gift guide, I would be shocked. Try it once, the odds are you're gonna come back and want more.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-are-the-prospects-for-laid-off-workers/",
    "published": "Sun, 14 Dec 2025 09:55:39 -0500",
    "summary": "In 2025, more than 1.1 million Americans were laid off from their jobs, the most since the COVID pandemic, even as corporate profits remain high. Business experts discuss the reasons why companies resort to layoffs.",
    "story": [
      "For the last few weeks, Heidi Roberts' full-time job has been trying to find one. \"I literally apply at jobs from 8:00 a.m. 'til five o'clock every day,\" she said. \"And I think I've done about 56 to 60 jobs already. And I've only had seven callbacks. So, it's just been really disheartening.\"",
      "She's been at it every day since October, when she was laid off from a financial company in Knoxville, Tennessee.",
      "She said she didn't see it coming: \"I had no idea, none at all,\" she said. \"I never thought it would be me. It's just hard getting up in the morning sometimes, 'cause you really gotta pump yourself up to do it. And I keep thinking, 'Okay, this next interview, hopefully it's gonna go well.'\"",
      "Roberts' Christmas wish is not unusual this year. In 2025, more than 1.1 million Americans have been laid off, the most since the 2020 COVID pandemic (according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas). The layoffs have hit numerous industries and companies of all sizes (including our own parent company, Paramount Skydance). The largest cuts came from the federal government (followed by technology, warehouses and retail), with tens of thousands of cuts each.",
      "\"Those are numbers that we haven't seen outside of recessionary periods like COVID or the Great Recession in 2008,\" said Andrew Challenger, a senior vice president at research firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which tracks the job market. \"It is a concerning stat, and everybody in the world is really paying close attention to it.\"",
      "Asked why so many companies today are almost simultaneously cutting down on the number of workers, Challenger replied, \"I'd say there's a couple stories that are going on simultaneously. One is that companies really over-hired in 2022 and 2023; we're seeing some economic headwinds, increased prices. And then the third piece is, we've really started to see companies discuss artificial intelligence as a reason why they're conducting job cuts at their companies.\"",
      "Layoffs \"perceived positively by the markets\"",
      "In the past companies laid off workers during periods of struggle. But Annie Lowrey, a staff writer with The Atlantic, says that's not what is happening now: \"Corporate profits are very, very high,\" she said. \"And if you look actually at businesses at how much their CEOs are making, it's just an enormous, enormous share. And I think that it reflects this divergence between the 1% and the 99%.\"",
      "Lowrey says most layoffs aren't happening because companies are in the red, but because the future of the economy looks a bit gray: \"Business leaders often like to blame uncertainty stemming from Washington. In this case, I think that they might actually really have a case. That might be the tariffs and the trade war, that might be the high cost of borrowing even if interest rates are coming down. Again, none of these in and of itself is enough to tip the massive and still quite vibrant American economy into a recession. But it's really leading to a pause that I think has now led to a freeze on hiring, and is now leading to more companies choosing to lay workers off.\"",
      "And then there's the question about the impact of artificial intelligence. According to a recent study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, AI already has the ability to replace nearly 12% of the labor market.",
      "\"The reality is, the tech is there; implementing and the practical application of that technology is still a ways away,\" said Jason Leverant, president of the national staffing company AtWork. He says when it comes to AI, at this point it's about keeping shareholders happy.",
      "\"If I'm a publicly traded firm, or otherwise, and I want to be perceived as forward thinking, I'm adopting cutting edge technology \u2013 'Hey, we're leveraging AI, we're cutting expenses, we're cutting our overhead \u2026 unfortunately, that has to deal with layoffs,'\" Leverant said. \"That sells really well. It's really, unfortunately, perceived positively by the markets.\"",
      "But while AI gets a lot of attention, the fact is it ranks sixth in reasons for layoffs, behind the overall economy and restructuring.",
      "\"It's a failure of your business model\"",
      "For more than 50 years, Bob Chapman has been at the helm of Barry-Wehmiller, a global supplier of manufacturing technology. Founded in 1885, the company now makes nearly $4 billion in annual revenue, and has 12,000 employees.",
      "Asked his response to companies who says their layoffs are necessary, Chapman replied, \"First of all, I'd say in general, it's a failure of leadership. If your business model fails, your market changes, the challenges change, and you don't adapt to it or anticipate it, you're gonna hurt people, okay? So, it's a failure of your business model.\"",
      "Chapman says layoffs should only be a last resort: \"We dehumanize this by calling it layoffs, right-sizing, downsizing. We're actually destroying people's lives.\"",
      "I asked, \"But why should you, as a CEO, concern yourself with what happens beyond the walls of this plant?\"",
      "\"Because I care about people, okay?\" Chapman replied. \"How can you run a company and not care about the people that are put in your span of care? And when you treat them as functions, you're saying they don't matter, it's just an economic transaction. And it is not just an economic transaction.\"",
      "And last week, more news, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell lowering interest rates by a quarter-percentage point, motivated by a vulnerable job market. Powell said, \"Gradual cooling of the labor market has continued. Unemployment is up three tenths.\"",
      "Instead of adding jobs, Powell says we could be losing as many as 20,000 each month. This all has many Americans feeling less than jolly this holiday season, with layoffs expected to continue into the New Year.",
      "But back in Knoxville, some good news. A few days ago, shortly after our visit, Heidi Roberts received the #1 item on her Christmas list: a new job. \"I start January the 5th,\" she said. \"So, New Year, new me, so I'm excited!\"",
      "It meant a pay cut, but she says these days any job feels like a gift.",
      "With many Americans still looking for work, what would she say to those folks now? \"I would say, keep on moving. Keep on pushing, do not give up, and just believe,\" Roberts said. \"You will find the company. Just keep on believing, and pray. I'm very blessed.\"",

      "Federal prosecutors in New York moved Tuesday to drop charges against Hernan Lopez, a former Fox employee who was convicted of participating in a scheme\u00a0to bribe FIFA officials to secure broadcasting rights to the World Cup and other top soccer matches, as well as the company involved in the scandal.",
      "The move would end a yearslong legal battle by past Justice Departments to preserve the convictions, which are currently caught in a slate of appeals.",
      "In a\u00a0letter dated Tuesday\u00a0to U.S. District Judge Pamela Chen, who oversaw the case, U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of New York Joseph Nocella said the charges against Lopez and Full Play Group, the Argentine sports media rights company involved in the scandal, should be dismissed \"in the interests of justice.\"",
      "In a Supreme Court filing relating to Lopez's ongoing appeal to the high court filed Tuesday, the Solicitor General's Office wrote that dismissal of the case is warranted for the same reason, and that the court should hear Lopez's appeal, reverse an appeals court decision that reinstated the conviction, and return the case to a New York federal judge who could dismiss the case.",
      "Lopez was convicted in 2023 by a jury in Brooklyn on charges of money laundering and wire fraud conspiracies. Full Play was convicted of two additional counts of wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering relating to the World Cup and Copa America.",
      "Earlier this year, a federal appeals court ordered the reinstatement of the convictions of Lopez and Full Play after Chen granted a motion for acquittal in 2024. The Biden-era Justice Department appealed that ruling.",
      "CBS News has attempted to reach Lopez's representatives. Lawyers for Full Play Group declined to comment.",

    "summary": "A Temple University law professor alleges in a suit that he breathed in contaminated air on a Boeing craft, leaving him physically impaired.",
    "story": [
      "A law professor who flew on a Boeing 737 aircraft operated by Delta Air Lines last year is suing the airplane manufacturer, alleging he suffered serious health issues after being exposed to toxic fumes that seeped into the plane's cabin.",
      "The plaintiff, Philadelphia resident Jonathan Harris, alleges in the suit that the aircraft cabin air became contaminated during an August 2024 flight from Atlanta to Los Angeles, leading to his breathing in a mix of dangerous chemicals.",
      "Fumes or smoke entering aircraft cabins is a known problem in aviation. That can occur when the fresh air from a plane's engines is filtered through the air conditioner employed to supply air to passengers. A faulty engine seal can cause oil and other potentially toxic particles to be released in the cabin.",
      "Such events take place more than three times a day, according to a recent CBS News review of Federal Aviation Administration incident reports.",
      "Boeing's 787 aircraft is the only commercial jetliner that does not draw air through the aircraft's engine. All other commercial jets have an air supply system that can expose cabins to contamination with heated jet engine oil, hydraulic fluid and jet fuel, according to Harris's suit.",
      "When Harris's Delta landed in California, passengers sat on the runway for about 45 minutes before disembarking, according to the lawsuit. During this time, the cabin was filled with fumes that Harris described as smelling like \"dirty socks.\"",
      "\"As a result of being exposed to this contaminated air event, plaintiff became nauseous and vomited into a plastic bag while still seated on the subject aircraft,\" the suit alleges. \"Another passenger also vomited into a bag provided by a flight attendant. At one point, plaintiff remembers the captain making an announcement over the intercom apologizing for the smell.\"",
      "Harris has since developed symptoms as a result of inhaling the contaminated cabin air, his lawsuit alleges. That lead to a range of health problems, including dizziness, confusion, nausea, muscle pain, vertigo, memory loss and other conditions, according to the complaint. Harris also alleges he suffered mental anguish, depression and anxiety, along with lost wages.",
      "Harris, an associate law professor at Temple University, is suing Arlington, Virginia-based Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company, for $40 million, plus attorneys' fees. The suit was filed in Arlington County, Virginia, circuit court.",
      "Boeing and Delta both declined to comment on the lawsuit.",
      "In September, Delta said it would replace auxiliary power units, a type of engine, on 300 of its Airbus A320 aircraft to address toxic fume incidents.",

    "published": "Fri, 12 Dec 2025 15:16:44 -0500",
    "summary": "\"I don't know how I'm going to pay for this,\" said one person with an Affordable Care Act plan that will cost her $1,100 a month starting in January.",
    "story": [
      "Mahwah, New Jersey, resident Tina Jump recently learned that the premium for her Affordable Care Act health insurance is set to surge from about $400 a month to more than $1,100 starting in January \u2014 a nearly threefold increase that she said left her in a state of panic.",
      "Jump, who earns about $72,000 a year as a real estate title officer, already feels financially stretched by the need to cover both her Blue Cross Blue Shield plan and the roughly $415 a month she pays for a prescription drug for type 2 diabetes.",
      "\"I don't know how I'm going to pay for this,\" Jump, 59, told CBS News. Her boss has offered to chip in, but she said the higher premium would still be a major strain on her budget.",
      "\"I'm just going to have to cut back on whatever else I can,\" she added. \"It's just insane. What's going to happen in the next couple of years? Is it going to continue to go up?\"",
      "With two health care bills failing to advance in the Senate on Thursday, the ACA's enhanced premium tax credits \u2014 which 90% of enrollees in the government health program rely on to ease the cost of affording health insurance \u2014 are almost certain to expire on Dec. 31. That will leave Jump and the roughly 22 million other Americans who now qualify for the tax credits facing some tough financial decisions.",
      "Out-of-pocket premium costs will increase 114% on average for ACA participants who currently receive the subsidies, hiking their annual costs for medical insurance by $1,016, according to health policy group KFF.",
      "\"That's a huge financial burden for most families,\" Emma Wager, a senior policy analyst at KFF, told CBS News. \"There's not a lot of people who can afford that.\"",
      "Some households could see even larger spikes. A family of four earning $75,000 per year is likely to see their insurance premiums rise by an additional $3,368 without the tax credits, the group estimated.",
      "Such a drastic increase in ACA costs would arrive as Americans are already struggling to afford groceries, rent, utilities and other essentials, leaving many financially pinched.",
      "\"Tsunami of health costs\"",
      "Some ACA participants told CBS News they are considering going without health insurance next year if their monthly premiums spike. Others are opting for cheaper plans with less coverage, potentially exposing them to higher costs and medical debt, Michelle Sternthal, director of government affairs at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "\"We are going to see a tsunami of health costs increasing\" on January 1, Sternthal said. \"Right now, we're hearing about families facing shocking increases.\"",
      "About 4 million people could drop their health insurance due to the higher ACA premiums, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The rising costs could hit some Americans harder than others, with small business owners and self-employed workers particularly vulnerable, Sternthal noted. Many such workers have turned to the ACA for health coverage because they lack employer-based insurance. About half of adults enrolled in the ACA are small business owners, employed by a company with fewer than 25 workers or are self-employed, according to KFF.",
      "That group includes Aaron Lehman, an Iowa farmer who grows corn, soybeans and other crops on his family's farm. In testimony before a Dec. 10 Senate hearing, he said the enhanced premium tax credits have allowed him to work full-time on his farm.",
      "\"But unfortunately, my wife and I have learned that in order to keep a similar policy for 2026, our health insurance costs will more than double,\" Lehman told the committee.",
      "Why the subsidies were created",
      "The ACA tax credits were established in 2021, as the U.S. was reeling from the pandemic, to lower households' monthly health plan costs; the subsidies were later extended under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act. With the credits set to expire this year, Democratic lawmakers this fall pushed for an extension, a congressional fight that became the main sticking point in the 43-day government shutdown that ended in November.",
      "As part of the deal to end the funding impasse, Republicans vowed to hold a vote on whether to extend the ACA credits by mid-December. The GOP also introduced its own measure to address health care costs, which involved sending funds directly to consumers rather than extending the ACA subsidies.",
      "However, votes on both health care proposals failed in the Senate on Thursday.\u00a0Some lawmakers\u00a0remain optimistic they can strike a bipartisan deal. But any agreement would likely involve reforms to the ACA to address income caps and fraud, along with a gradual phasing out of the enhanced subsidies.",
      "Sternthal of Community Catalyst thinks Congress will face political pressure to address the expired tax credits once once millions of families face sticker shock in January.",
      "In the meantime, Americans who get their health insurance through an employer-based plan could also be impacted by the higher ACA costs, she added.",
      "The reason:\u00a0 If millions drop coverage, as the CBO has predicted, it would likely destabilize the health care market because more people would need to rely on emergency rooms for treatment. Because hospitals, by law, must treat uninsured patients, they typically recoup the costs by hiking treatment costs for others.",
      "\"If you have fewer people covered, that means there will be more uncompensated care, and people will go to the ER \u2014 and that will trickle down into providers and insurance companies,\" Sternthal said. \"It's an economy-wide problem.\"",

    "summary": "A ruling striking down emergency levies could force the federal government to return most of the tariff revenue it has collected this year, according to Penn Wharton.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. government could owe businesses as much as $168 billion if the Supreme Court rules that the Trump administration improperly invoked a federal emergency powers law earlier this year in hitting dozens of countries with new tariffs, according to a recent analysis.",
      "Through December 5, the U.S. government has collected $259 billion in tariff revenue, the nonpartisan research initiative found. But a ruling by the high court that Mr. Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose the country-specific tariffs could force the government to offer refunds to importers, said Kent Smetters, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.",
      "In a November hearing on the case,\u00a0the Supreme Court seemed divided\u00a0over whether Mr. Trump had the legal authority to impose sweeping levies under IEEPA. Several justices appeared skeptical, noting that IEEPA does not mention the word \"tariff\" and that no president has ever relied on the act to justify broad-based tariffs on other nations.",
      "The Trump administration could likely maintain similar\u00a0tariff rates by drawing on other laws\u00a0if the IEEPA tariffs are struck down, although those statutes have more restrictions, according to legal experts.",
      "For example, Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allows the U.S. president to restrict imports in the name of national security. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 also authorizes the president to apply country-based tariffs if the U.S. Trade Representative determines that another nation is engaging in unfair trade practices.",
      "Despite the prospects of a large government refund for importers, Smetters thinks that striking down the tariffs would ultimately spur U.S. economic growth.",
      "\"Tariffs are one of the least efficient ways of raising revenue,\" he told CBS News, adding that tariffs make companies less productive because they have to pay more for imported parts and products.",
      "\"The government would have to come up with that money, so the federal debt would go up a little bit. But if these tariffs really were to go away, it would make U.S. companies more attractive to invest in,\" Smetters added.",
      "The Trump administration says tariffs are a key tool for energizing the U.S. manufacturing sector, boosting job growth, reducing the nation's trade deficit and generating federal revenue.",
      "\"The economic and national security consequences of the failure to uphold President Trump's lawful tariffs are enormous. The White House looks forward to the Supreme Court's speedy and proper resolution of this matter,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Too little, too late?",
      "As of November 17, the overall effective tariff rate in the U.S. was 16.8%, the highest since 1935,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Yale Budget Lab. That compares with 2.4% in January before Mr. Trump returned to office.",
      "As a result, some small businesses say a tariff refund wouldn't offset the damage they say has been caused by sharply higher import duties.",
      "\"The money would go back to suppliers that incurred the tariffs. We are the end customer, and we continue to get the short end of the stick,\" Trinita Rhodes, the owner of Beauty Supply Refresh in Florissant, Missouri, said Wednesday in a media call hosted by Tariffs Cost US, an advocacy group that opposes Mr. Trump's levies.",
      "Rachel Lutz, owner of a women's clothing boutique, The Peacock Room, in Detroit, said a potential tariff refund would come too late.",
      "\"Small businesses don't have more than a 30-day cash reserve,\" he said in the Tariffs Cost US call. \"Reimbursement at this point doesn't make up for the disruption of staff cuts or hiring we could have made. The damage has already been done.\"",
      "Consumers are also feeling the impact of tariffs, research shows. Between February and November, U.S. households paid an average of $1,197.50 in tariffs, totaling nearly $160 billion, according to a\u00a0report this month from Democrats on the U.S. Congressional Joint Economic Committee.",
      "\"While President Trump promised that he would lower costs, this report shows that his tariffs have done nothing but drive prices even higher for families,\" Sen. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat from New Hampshire and ranking member of the Joint Economic Committee, said in a statement Thursday. \"At a time when both parties should be working together to lower costs, the President's tax on American families is simply making things more expensive.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration could pursue alternative pathways for imposing tariffs after a federal court this week struck down its use of emergency powers to enact broad levies on U.S. trading partners, according to experts.",
      "At risk is much of Mr. Trump's trade agenda, which relies on tariffs as a way to secure better terms of trade, boost the U.S. manufacturing sector and generate what he claims could be trillions in new federal revenue. For now, Mr. Trump's tariffs remain in place after a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily halted the decision,\u00a0reinstating the levies.",
      "If the trade court's ruling is ultimately upheld, Mr. Trump has other tools for pursuing his trade agenda, although they don't provide the broader authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which he tapped to authorize trade duties on almost every foreign nation.",
      "\"He would have a couple other authorities. However, they are not nearly as broad and aggressive as the IEEPA tariffs,\" said Clark Packard, a research fellow in the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan public policy institute. \"There are so many checks and administrative aspects to them that they are slower.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced his tariffs on April 2 in an initiative he referred to as\u00a0\"Liberation Day.\" At the time, the president described trade deficits with other nations as \"a national emergency,\" which he said gave him the authority to impose tariffs under IEEPA.",
      "But a lawsuit filed by five U.S.-based companies and a group of 12 states challenged the president's use of the emergency powers law, and on Wednesday the Court of International Trade\u00a0blocked the tariffs.",
      "President will use \"tools at his disposal\"",
      "As the legal process plays out, Trump administration officials say the president is considering using other tools at his disposal to advance his trade policies.",
      "\"The Trump administration remains committed to addressing our country's national emergencies of drug trafficking and historic trade deficits with every legal authority conferred to the President in the Constitution and by Congress,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS News on Thursday.",
      "Desai added, \"Regardless of the developments of this litigation, the President will continue to use all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans.\"",
      "Here are the other options Mr. Trump could turn to, and how he could use them, according to policy experts.",
      "Section 232 tariffs of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962",
      "Experts say Mr. Trump could turn to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the U.S. president to restrict imports in the name of national security. Mr. Trump already has tariffs in place on steel, aluminum and auto imports based on this regulation.",
      "There's a catch, though. The statute requires the Department of Commerce, in consultation with the Department of Defense, to investigate and confirm that imports \"threaten to impair\" U.S. national security before the president can invoke Section 232. An investigation can take up to 270 days, which could slow down Mr. Trump's timeline for imposing tariffs.",
      "\"It has to withstand legal scrutiny, it can't just be done over the weekend,\" Packard said.",
      "Additionally, under Section 232, tariffs can only be applied to specific sectors if the trade around those imports threaten national security, rather than the broad approach that Mr. Trump used with IEEPA.",
      "\"Once the report is issued, the president has wide discretion, but he has to target individual sectors of product, like steel and aluminum,\" Packard said. \"They can't be blanket, across-the-board tariffs.\"",
      "Some experts think Mr. Trump is likely to turn to this statute to further his tariff agenda.",
      "\"In our view, the administration will prepare the groundwork for a more surgical increase in tariffs beginning this summer following Section 232 trade investigations into strategic industries like pharmaceuticals, critical minerals, lumber, copper and semiconductors,\" Kurt Reiman, head of fixed income Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a research note.",
      "He added, \"These sectors were initially excluded from the 10% baseline tariff because President Trump had intended to levy separate tariffs to reduce the U.S.'s reliance on foreign producers of these products by encouraging domestic production.\"",
      "Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974",
      "Mr. Trump could also draw on the Trade Act of 1974 to impose new tariffs. Section 301 of that law allows the U.S. president to apply country-based tariffs at a rate of his choosing if the U.S. Trade Representative determines that another country is engaging in unfair foreign trade practices.",
      "There are limitations, however. The law can't be applied universally to all imports from foreign nations.",
      "\"There has to be justification for it, so President Trump can't unilaterally decide to impose broad-based tariffs on the entire world,\" Angela Santos, a partner and customs practice leader at law firm ArentFox Schiff told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974",
      "Additionally, Mr. Trump could use Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which is designed to address large trade deficits with other nations, to impose tariffs of up to 15% for a maximum of 150 days.",
      "\"I could see this being employed very easily,\" Santos said. \"It seems like the easiest way to impose tariffs, particularly because most trade partners have large deficits with the U.S.\"",
      "Applying tariffs under Section 122 wouldn't require an investigation, meaning Mr. Trump could quickly use it to assess a broad-based import duty.",
      "\"The administration could quickly replace the 10% across-the-board tariff with a similar tariff of up to 15% under Sec. 122,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a report this week.",
      "The tariffs could be in effect \"within days if deemed necessary,\" Goldman Sachs said.",
      "Congressional action would be needed to extend the tariffs after 150 days.",
      "Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930",
      "Under Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, the president can impose tariffs of up to 50% on imports from countries that discriminate against the U.S. The law defines discrimination as when a trading partner's laws, import duties, regulations or other restrictions place the U.S. at a disadvantage.",

    "published": "Thu, 11 Dec 2025 21:11:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump has signed an executive order to block states from regulating artificial intelligence.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump signed an executive order Thursday aimed at restricting states from crafting their own regulations for artificial intelligence, saying the burgeoning industry is at risk of being stifled by a patchwork of onerous rules while in a battle with Chinese competitors for supremacy.",
      "Members of Congress from both parties, as well as civil liberties and consumer rights groups, have pushed for more regulations on AI, saying there is not enough oversight for the powerful technology.",
      "But Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that \"there's only going to be one winner\" as nations race to dominate artificial intelligence, and China's central government gives its companies a single place to go for government approvals.",
      "\"We have the big investment coming, but if they had to get 50 different approvals from 50 different states, you can forget it because it's impossible to do,\" the president said.",
      "The executive order directs Attorney General Pam Bondi to create a new task force to challenge state laws, and directs the Department of Commerce to draw up a list of problematic regulations. It also threatens to restrict funding from a broadband deployment program and other grant programs to states with AI laws.",
      "David Sacks, a venture capitalist who is leading Mr. Trump's policies on cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence, said Thursday the Trump administration would only push back on \"the most onerous examples of state regulation\" but would not oppose \"kid safety\" measures.",
      "Four states \u2014 Colorado, California, Utah and Texas \u2014 have passed laws that set some rules for AI across the private sector, according to the International Association of Privacy Professionals.",
      "Those laws include limiting the collection of certain personal information and requiring more transparency from companies.",
      "The laws are in response to AI that already pervades everyday life. The technology helps make consequential decisions for Americans, including who gets a job interview, an apartment lease, a home loan and even certain medical care. But research has shown that it can make mistakes in those decisions, including by prioritizing a particular gender or race.",
      "States' more ambitious AI regulation proposals require private companies to provide transparency and assess the possible risks of discrimination from their AI programs.",
      "Beyond those more sweeping rules, many states have regulated parts of AI: barring the use of deepfakes in elections and to create nonconsensual porn, for example, or putting rules in place around the government's own use of AI.",
      "Those who support regulations that would prevent states from restricting AI\u00a0\u2014 including some GOP lawmakers and advocates like Sacks \u2014 argue that forcing tech companies to contend with varied or even contradictory rules would hurt the industry.",
      "\"At best, we'll end up with 50 different AI models for 50 different states \u2013 a regulatory morass worse than Europe,\" Sacks wrote on X\u00a0earlier this week. \"This will stymie innovation, especially by small startups who can't afford the compliance burden. Meanwhile, China will race ahead.\"",
      "But members of both parties have pushed back. Last month, when congressional Republicans weighed adding restrictions on state AI regulations to a defense bill, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis called the idea a \"subsidy to Big Tech.\"",
      "\"The rise of AI is the most significant economic and cultural shift occurring at the moment; denying the people the ability to channel these technologies in a productive way via self-government constitutes federal government overreach and lets technology companies run wild,\" the governor wrote.",
      "Earlier this week, Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts called Mr. Trump's plan to restrict AI regulations via an executive order an \"early Christmas present for his CEO billionaire buddies.\"",

    "summary": "Treasury Secretary's proposal to revamp the Financial Stability Oversight Council would expose Americans to risk, critics say.",
    "story": [
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wants to overhaul a federal regulatory group, launched following the 2008 housing bust, that is tasked with safeguarding the U.S. financial system.",
      "The 15-member panel, known as the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), was established by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act to help spot and defuse systemic financial risks.",
      "The council is chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury and includes the leaders from other financial regulatory agencies, such as the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the head of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.",
      "In a letter released Thursday, Bessent called for looser FSOC regulations, saying that \"too often in the past, efforts to safeguard the financial system have resulted in burdensome and often duplicative regulations.\"",
      "\"Our administration is changing that approach,\" Bessent added.",
      "The Treasury Department and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Proponents of strong financial regulation criticized the push to revamp the FSOC.",
      "\"What you're removing is the smoke alarm for the entire financial system,\" said Oscar Vald\u00e9s Viera, private equity and capital markets policy analyst at Americans for Financial Reform, a coalition consisting of over 250 national and local groups.",
      "Bessent's proposal would remove vital safeguards just as financial risks are mounting, such as a potential bubble in AI stocks, Vald\u00e9s Viera added.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, also attacked the decision to loosen financial regulations.",
      "\"Going down this path just as cracks are emerging in the financial system and yellow lights are flashing across our economy is especially reckless,\" she said in a statement, citing the recent bankruptcies of subprime auto lender Tricolor Holdings, auto parts company First Brands and home remodeling platform Renovo Home Partners.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-gold-card-website-1-million-platinum-card-how-it-works/",
    "published": "Thu, 11 Dec 2025 16:48:16 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration says it's also creating a $5 million platinum card visa that will allow foreigners to live in the U.S. for 270 days a year.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is touting his administration's new \"gold card\" visa as a fast track for foreigners who are willing and able to pay $1 million for the right to immigrate to the U.S.",
      "Applications for the new visa went live on Wednesday afternoon, with the government website for the gold card saying the process can be completed in a matter of weeks after applicants file their paperwork.",
      "Mr. Trump unveiled the gold card initiative in February, promoting it as an expedited path for wealthy foreigners to secure legal residency and as a way to generate government revenue. The term riffs on the \"green card,\" which grants permanent residency status to noncitizens so they can live and work in the U.S. indefinitely.",
      "\"All funds go to the United States government \u2014 it could be a tremendous amount of money,\" Mr. Trump said on Wednesday about the gold card. \"It's somewhat like a green card, but with big advantages over a green card.\"",
      "The program also includes a $2 million gold card for corporations that want to secure visas for workers, as well as a $5 million platinum card that allows foreigners to spend up to 270 days in the U.S. without being required to pay federal income tax on non-U.S. income.",
      "\"It's certainly plausible to me that this could be a meaningful source of revenue,\" John Lettieri, the CEO of the Economic Innovation Group, a bipartisan policy research group, told CBS News.",
      "But, he added, the gold card visa is likely to be a \"niche program,\" given the cost, although it could help attract some highly skilled foreign workers or entrepreneurs to the U.S.",
      "Here's how the gold card program will work.",
      "What is a Trump gold card?",
      "In essence, it's a green card that has been fast-tracked by the Trump administration.",
      "The website to apply for a gold card states that successful applicants will receive either an EB-1 or EB-2 visa, two kinds of employment-based green cards for skilled workers. To apply for an individual gold card, applicants must:",
      "Pay a nonrefundable $15,000 processing fee to the Department of Homeland Security.Undergo a vetting process, including a visa interview.Make a $1 million gift to the federal government after the vetting is complete.",
      "Pay a nonrefundable $15,000 processing fee to the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Undergo a vetting process, including a visa interview.",
      "Make a $1 million gift to the federal government after the vetting is complete.",
      "The new program also allows companies to obtain gold cards for employees, one per worker, with each requiring a $2 million donation, according to the website.",
      "Applicants must pay a $15,000 fee that will cover the cost of processing and conducting a background check, along with a 1% annual maintenance fee. Companies may also transfer the gold card between employees for a 5% transfer fee, the program specifies.",
      "A transfer could happen if a gold card holder becomes a U.S. citizen, for example.",
      "One potential difference between the Trump gold card and other types of green cards is that the new visa process could take only weeks, according to the Trump administration.",
      "By comparison, immigrants who apply for a regular green card can expect to wait between eight months and three years for approval, according to immigration services company Boundless. The quickest processing time is for spouses of U.S. citizens, who typically face an eight-month wait, the group said.",
      "How is the Trump gold card different from an EB-5 visa?",
      "The gold card is meant to replace EB-5 visas, which Congress created in 1990 to generate foreign investment. These have been available to people who spend at least $1 million to start a company with at least 10 workers.",
      "Unlike the EB-5 visa, however, a gold card visa doesn't require applicants to create a certain number of jobs or to invest in U.S. businesses.",
      "The EB-5 program has been criticized as cumbersome and as an invitation to commit fraud. In one notable case in recent years, hundreds of EB-5 applicants were defrauded by business executives in Vermont who claimed to be building a biotech facility, but who instead used the money for personal expenses.",
      "The process to obtain an EB-5 visa is also glacially slow, with a processing time of almost six years. That is \"by far the longest processing times in the U.S. immigration system,\" according to an April blog post about the Trump gold cards from EIG.",
      "The gold card is designed to help companies recruit foreign graduates of U.S. universities such as MIT and Harvard, Mr. Trump said on Wednesday.",
      "\"I've heard from Tim Cook of Apple, and I've heard from a lot of people, some of the people at this table, that essentially, in the United States, you can't keep the student,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Can gold card holders become citizens?",
      "Gold card recipients \"have a path to citizenship,\" U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said at the press conference on Wednesday with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Obviously, they have to be perfect people in America, and having passed the vetting, after five years they'll be available to become citizens,\" Lutnick said.",
      "Green card holders can typically apply for citizenship after residing in the U.S. for five years.",
      "Companies that secure a gold card for workers who then become citizens can transfer the card to new employees, Lutnick added.",
      "Can a gold card visa be revoked?",
      "Yes: The application website states: \"The Trump Gold Card is a visa; therefore, national security and significant criminal risks are a basis for revocation.\"",
      "How much money could the visa program raise for the U.S.?",
      "Mr. Trump didn't provide an estimate this week, but the program could generate billions in annual revenue, said Lettieri of the Economic Innovation Group.",
      "Based on the $1 million cost of a gold card visa, the program could raise $100 billion over a decade if it issues 10,000 gold cards per year, he calculated.",
      "\"Conservatively speaking, tens of billions over a decade is reasonable \u2014 it could be considerably higher,\" Lettieri said.",

      "For Trista Hamsmith, the safety risks posed by some products are personal. In December 2020, her 18-month-old daughter Reese died after swallowing a button battery she accessed from a remote two months earlier.",
      "The batteries are tiny, coin-sized and deadly when ingested. It burned through Reese's esophagus and after months of surgeries, doctors couldn't save her.",
      "\"I prayed and I prayed, but we didn't get her back. I got to hold her again, but she was gone,\" Hamsmith said, recalling the moment. \"She was a baby and her life was taken too soon.\"",

      "Her next push was to get the Consumer Product Safety Commission, or CPSC, to apply those same standards to toys.",

      "Trumka blames current leadership at the agency for the holdup.",
      "\"This rule would have simply made toys, the thing that we intentionally put in our children's hand, as safe as everything else they get their hands on,\" Trumka said. \"It's as common sense as you could possibly get and somehow it's not moving forward.\"",
      "He said it doesn't make sense.",
      "\"We have a solution to that that's just completely fallen aside because industry said we don't want it and the current leadership of the agency capitulated to that,\" he said.",

      "He also claims more than a dozen other proposed safety rules have stalled since then.",
      "\"People will be injured and people will die as a result of inaction from CPSC,\" Trumka said.",
      "The CPSC was created by Congress as an independent agency with five bipartisan commissioners, meant to be free of political pressure.",
      "\"CPSC is a health and safety organization,\" said former CPSC chair Hoehn-Saric. \"You want organizations like that to be focused on the facts and focused on the science because we're trying to keep people from dying. You don't want politics to come into those decisions.\"",

      "In a statement, the CPSC maintains the president's firing of the three commissioners was done lawfully and \"has had no impact on the CPSC's mission to protect American families from unsafe products.\"",
      "But in September, the agency was down to one commissioner after Republican Dougg Dziak resigned.",
      "With a single commissioner, Trumka said protections can't be passed.",
      "\"We have quorum requirements that to pass a rule, you need two commissioners. They have one,\" he said. \"It shows they have no intent to pass new rules to protect the public against problems that are coming up.\"",

      "When asked about the stalled battery rule, the CPSC said it \"...measures success based on how many unsafe products it keeps out of the hands of American consumers, not the number of regulations it enacts.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-speech-affordability-fact-check-inflation-data/",
    "published": "Thu, 11 Dec 2025 11:55:05 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump says he's winning the war against inflation. But a look at prices around the U.S. shows why many Americans still feel financially squeezed.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump delivered a message Tuesday evening aimed at the millions of Americans struggling to afford daily necessities, saying his administration is \"crushing\" inflation and that \"prices are coming down tremendously.\" Economic data tells a different story.",
      "Prices have edged higher for much of Mr. Trump's first year back in the White House, with inflation in September rising at an annual rate of 3% (the most recent available inflation data because of the recent U.S. government shutdown).",
      "Inflation dipped to a low this year of 2.3% in April, but it has steadily ticked up since then and now stands at the same rate as in January, when Mr. Trump was inaugurated, federal data shows. Economists attribute the rise partly to the Trump administration's new tariffs on imports, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell pointing to those levies as a key factor behind the recent uptick.",
      "Inflation now \"is higher than earlier in the year as inflation for goods has picked up, reflecting the impact of tariffs,\" Powell said at a press conference on Wednesday to discuss the central bank's latest interest rate cut.",
      "Some Wall Street analysts think prices are likely to continue creeping up for a while. Mark Vickery, senior market analyst at Zacks Investment Research, estimates that the Consumer Price Index rose at an annual rate of around 3.3% in November.",
      "To be sure, many economists, as well as the Fed, expect any additional pickup in inflation to be short-lived before easing in 2026. Powell on Wednesday said the tariff effect will likely create a one-time rise in prices that should fade over the coming year. The Fed expects inflation to recede to 2.4% next year, down from about 2.9% in 2025.",
      "From a longer-term perspective, inflation has indeed fallen sharply since hitting a 40-year high of about 9% in June 2022 in the aftermath of the pandemic. For shoppers, however, a lower inflation rate doesn't mean prices are declining \u2014 only that they're rising at a slower pace.",
      "Consumers tend not to view pocketbook issues through the lens of official inflation measures, a somewhat abstract metric that tracks price fluctuations over time, experts have long noted. Instead, many shoppers focus on their actual dollars-and-cents spending, including whether their out-of-pocket expenses are higher than they were in the past, according to research from the University of Florida.",
      "By that yardstick, Americans are spending more on everyday basics than they were a year ago, and far more than they did just before the pandemic, CPI data shows.",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks, made Tuesday in Mount Pocono, Pa., came as his administration touts the president's economic policies ahead of next year's midterm elections.",
      "\"I have no higher priority than making America affordable,\" Mr. Trump said in the speech.",
      "Prior to the speech, Mr. Trump had decried affordability as a \"hoax\" perpetuated by Democrats, although some Republicans, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, have differed with him on the issue. Greene told CBS News that she doesn't believe affordability is a hoax, adding, \"Everyone's bills have either stayed the same or gone up.\"",
      "\"You can't gaslight people and tell them that their bills are affordable,\" Greene said.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai expressed confidence that Mr. Trump's agenda will cool inflation and boost worker wages.",
      "\"President Trump inherited the worst inflation crisis in a generation from Joe Biden's incompetence, and his Administration has rapidly cooled inflation to a 2.5% annualized rate,\" Desai said in a statement to CBS News. \"As the administration's supply-side policies of tax cuts, deregulation and energy abundance continue taking effect, Americans can count on inflation continuing to fall and real wages continuing to rise.\"",
      "Food",
      "Americans paid 2.7% more for food bought at the grocery store in September than they did a year earlier, according to the most recent CPI figures. That may not seem like much, but their grocery bills have climbed roughly 49% since 2020.",
      "See the CBS News price tracker showing changes in the price of food, gas, utilities and other costs",
      "See the CBS News price tracker showing changes in the price of food, gas, utilities and other costs",
      "Some food costs are also rising much faster than the rate of inflation, with beef steaks surging almost 17% from a year ago, according to the CPI data. Earlier this month, the Trump administration sought to lower some grocery prices by exempting foods like beef, coffee and bananas from new country-specific tariffs.",
      "Shoppers on Tuesday told CBS News' Nancy Cordes that they are making tradeoffs and scrimping to afford groceries.",
      "\"The cost of beef is astronomical. I will mainly get what's on sale,\" Anne Marie Hadley, a retired special education teacher who was shopping Tuesday at Schiel's Family Market, a family-owned grocery store in Scranton, Pa., told Cordes.",
      "Housing",
      "While mortgage rates have dropped this year, housing remains out of reach for most would-be buyers. More than 75% of homes across the country are unaffordable for the typical household, Bankrate said in a report this week.",
      "A homebuyer today needs to earn $131,400 a year to afford a typical home in the U.S. \u2014 almost double the roughly $65,000 needed five years ago, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.",
      "Almost three-quarters of Americans said housing has grown more unaffordable in their communities in recent years, according to an October poll from YouGov and the University of Florida Center for Public Interest Communications.",
      "Gas",
      "One area where consumers are getting a break is at the pump, with gasoline prices down from a year earlier. Gas declined 0.5% in September from a year earlier, CPI data shows. And earlier this month, gas dropped below $3 a gallon on average, marking the lowest price since May 2021.",
      "\"It was just reported that four states had $1.99 a gallon,\" Mr. Trump said on Tuesday. \"We are right now involved in more energy, and have more energy in the works by far than we've ever had before.\"",
      "The decline is due to strong refinery output and lower crude oil prices, as well as to softer seasonal fuel demand, GasBuddy has said.",
      "Yet while fuel prices have dropped, other energy costs have increased. Residential electricity prices around the U.S. rose more than 10% over the first eight months of 2025, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, an educational and policy organization. By comparison, power costs rose roughly 6% over the trailing 12 months.",
      "As of June, nearly one in 20 U.S. households was seriously behind on their utility bills, according to a report from The Century Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, and advocacy group Protect Borrowers. Over the last three years, the average overdue balance on utility bills climbed from $597 to $789, a 32% jump, the groups found.",

    "story": [
      "Waymo is recalling 3,067 vehicles because of a software issue that led to\u00a0multiple incidents\u00a0in which the autonomous cars drove around stopped school buses.",
      "The recall affects certain 5th-generation automated driving systems, according to a Nov. 8 notice posted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The software may cause vehicles to pass a stopped school bus even when its red lights are flashing or its stop arm is extended, increasing the risk of a crash with a pedestrian, the agency said.",
      "Waymo didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "All 50 states have laws requiring vehicles to stop for a school bus with flashing red lights and a deployed stop-arm signal,\u00a0according\u00a0to the NHTSA.",
      "Waymo told CBS News last week that it was planning to issue a recall. At the time, a spokesperson said the company had identified the software issue that contributed to the school bus incidents and that it had repaired affected vehicles by Nov. 17.",
      "The recall follows multiple reports that the company's self-driving cars drove around school buses stopped on the road in Austin, Texas.",
      "As of Dec. 5, the Austin Independent School District said it was aware of 20 incidents this school year in which a Waymo vehicle illegally passed a school bus. JJ Maldonado, a communications specialist for the school district, told CBS News last week that a 20th citation was issued after Waymo said it had fixed the software issue.",

    "published": "Wed, 10 Dec 2025 15:59:17 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve is grappling with economic issues including higher inflation and a slowing labor market.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, bringing the federal funds rate to its lowest level in more than three years.",
      "The reduction lowers the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to between 3.5% and 3.75%, down from its prior range of 3.75% to 4%. The Fed's decision marks the third consecutive rate cut since September, lowering the federal funds rate by a total of 0.75 percentage points this year.",
      "Despite the lack of key government economic data because of the recent U.S.\u00a0government shutdown, the Fed has been closely monitoring the slowdown in monthly job growth as well as rising inflation. Figures from ADP, which tracks private payrolls, showed that employers shed 32,000 jobs in November, a signal of continuing headwinds in the labor market.",
      "Fed hints at one rate cut in 2026",
      "But in announcing the decision, the Federal Reserve signaled that it may want to see more economic evidence to support additional rate cuts in 2026. In quarterly economic projections issued along with their latest statement, Fed officials signaled they expect to lower rates just once next year.",
      "\"In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks,\" the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, said in its statement.",
      "Speaking about the decision in a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank is \"well positioned to wait to see how the economy evolves\" before deciding on another cut.",
      "\"We're going to get a great deal of data between now and the January meeting \u2014 the data we get will factor into our thinking,\" Powell said, referring to the delayed November inflation and job reports that will be issued later this month. \"We're well-positioned to wait and see.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve also issued new U.S. inflation, economic growth and unemployment projections for 2026, forecasting that inflation will cool slightly next year while unemployment will remain unchanged from its current level of 4.4%.",
      "Fed officials forecast that Personal Consumption Expenditures, the Fed's favored inflation gauge, will cool to 2.4% next year, down from its median estimate of 2.9% in 2025. The nation's gross domestic product could pick up to 2.3% in 2026, an acceleration from the Fed's September forecast of 1.8%.",
      "Ryan Sweet, chief global economist at Oxford Economics, said the latest Fed guidance sets it up for what he described in a note to investors as an \"extended pause\" in cutting rates.",
      "\"The Fed isn't going to be able to help the labor market because of what ails it,\" he added. \"Rate cuts are unlikely to significantly boost the hiring rate, which is being depressed by overhiring, solid productivity growth, policy uncertainty, a rise in people with multiple jobs and less immigration. Monetary policy can't solve many of these issues.\"",
      "The move lowers the federal funds rate to its lowest level since early November 2022, when policymakers lifted the range to 3.75% to 4%. At that time, the central bank was boosting rates \u2014 its most potent tool for curbing inflation \u2014 as inflation surged during the pandemic.",
      "By cutting rates, the Fed is acting to spur hiring by making credit cheaper, allowing businesses to expand and hire at a lower cost. Consumers, meanwhile, tend to spend more when financing is less expensive, giving the broader economy an extra lift.",
      "FOMC dissents",
      "Not all members of the FOMC, the Fed's rate-setting panel, agreed with the move to cut by a quarter point. While Fed Chair Jerome Powell was joined by eight other committee members in voting in favor of the reduction, three members dissented, the Fed said. That represents the most dissents in six years and is a sign of divisions on a committee that traditionally works by consensus.",
      "FOMC members Austan Goolsbee and Jeffrey Schmid voted to maintain the previous range, while Stephen Miran voted in favor of a 0.5 percentage-point cut.",
      "At the same time, the Fed is moving toward a leadership shift next year, with Powell set to end his term as chair in May 2026 and President Trump preparing to nominate his replacement.",
      "\"[T]he outlook from the Powell-led FOMC bears less than usual on future Fed policy decisions given the imminent change in leadership,\" Jeff Schulze, head of economic and market strategy at ClearBridge Investments, said in an email.",
      "Asked what his goals are during the last months of his term as chair, Powell said he's focused on the U.S. economy.",
      "\"I want to turn over this job to whoever replaces me with the economy in really good shape,\" he said. \"All my efforts are to get to that place.\"",

    "summary": "Here are the top 20 largest Powerball and Mega Millions jackpots in history, and the odds of winning them.",
    "story": [
      "Lottery jackpots have exploded in size over the last decade.",
      "When Powerball launched in 1992, the first jackpot was $5.9 million, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association. Now, the largest Powerball jackpot on record was the $2.04 billion prize won on Nov. 7, 2022.",
      "Mega Millions followed a similar path. Its first jackpot winner in 2002 took home $28 million. Its record prize \u2014 a $1.602 billion jackpot won on Aug. 8, 2023 \u2014 ranks as the fourth-largest lottery jackpot in U.S. history.",
      "Twelve out of the 20 largest jackpots have occurred since 2023.",
      "Here are the biggest U.S. jackpot wins:",
      "Only five states don't sell lottery tickets: Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Nevada and Utah.",
      "While the prizes are huge, the odds of winning still remain extremely low. Over the last three decades, both games have been redesigned multiple times. Changes have pushed jackpots higher while also adding more ways for players to win smaller prizes.",
      "Powerball players choose five numbers from 1 to 69 and one Powerball number from 1 to 26. In 2015, Powerball increased its number of white balls from 59 to 69 and its number of red balls decreased from 35 to 26.",
      "Before the change, the odds of winning the jackpot were 1 in 175.2 million and the overall odds of winning any prize were 1 in 31.85. After the redesign, the jackpot odds became steeper, 1 in 292.2 million, while the overall odds of winning a prize improved to 1 in 24.9, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association.",
      "Mega Millions requires players to pick five different numbers from one to 70 and one Mega Ball number from one to 24. A ticket wins the jackpot by matching all six numbers in a drawing.",
      "In 2025, Mega Millions changed its games to a larger starting jackpot ($50 million vs. $20 million), which \"improved odds to win the jackpot and improved overall odds,\" according to Dan Miller, a spokesperson for Mega Millions.",
      "\"Everyone who wins is winning more because of the embedded multiplier in the new game that takes all non-jackpot prizes and multiplies them by 2X, 3X, 4X, 5X or 10X,\" Miller said in an email. Through Friday, Dec. 5, he said, \"there have been 70 drawings in the new game. In that time, players have won $531 million in non-jackpot prizes. In the old game, those same prizes would have been valued at $119.8 million. That's a 343% increase in player winnings.\"",
      "For example, under the old rules, matching just the Mega Ball was a break-even outcome: a $2 ticket earned a $2 prize. Under the new game, that same match now comes with a built-in multiplier. The minimum prize is $5, which is then multiplied \u2014 meaning a player can now win $10, $15, $20, $25 or even $50 instead of just $2.",
      "The odds to win the jackpot improved from 1 in 302.6 million to\u00a01 in 290.5 million. This is because of Mega Millions removing the one gold Mega Ball from the game, Miller said.",
      "The new game has 24 Mega Balls instead of 25, which improves the odds of picking the right combinations of numbers to win the jackpot. The overall odds to win any prize went from 1 in 24 to 1 in 23.",
      "There's more money in play as well: Powerball increased the price of a ticket from $1 to $2 in 2012. Mega Millions increased its ticket prices from $1 to $2 in 2017 and from $2 to $5 in April of this year.",

    "summary": "Current SAVE borrowers will have \"limited time\" to enroll in a new loan repayment plan and begin repaying their loans, the Education Department said.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has reached an agreement that could end President Biden's signature student loan repayment plan, a move that may force millions of borrowers back into repayment.",
      "The Education Department on Tuesday announced a proposed settlement with the state of Missouri that it said would terminate the Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, an income-driven repayment plan that tabulates loan repayments based on a borrower's income and family size.",
      "As part of the deal, which is pending court approval, the agency said it will not enroll any new borrowers in the SAVE plan and will deny all pending applications. All current SAVE borrowers will have a \"limited time\" to enroll in a new plan and begin repayments, according to the department's notice.",
      "Higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz told CNBC that borrowers may need to leave SAVE forbearance early next year. That's a quicker timeline than what was laid out in The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed in July.",
      "That law gave borrowers enrolled in SAVE and other soon-to-be-phased-out repayment programs until July 1, 2028, to move to a new plan.",
      "Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in Tuesday's announcement that the Biden Administration's policies unfairly shifted student loan debt onto American taxpayers. The Education Department said the SAVE program would have cost taxpayers more than $342 billion over ten years.",
      "The Education Department declined to comment, pointing CBS News to a Dec. 9\u00a0Wall Street Journal op-ed written by Kent and Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway,",
      "\"The Trump administration isn't blind to the mounting student debt burden or the skyrocketing costs of a college degree,\" they wrote. \"But we refuse to force hardworking Americans to bear the burden of loans that aren't theirs.\"",
      "The Biden administration\u00a0announced\u00a0the SAVE program in 2023, calling it the \"most affordable student loan repayment plan ever.\" The plan allowed 4.6 million of the program's more than 7 million enrollees to lower their monthly bills to $0 per month,\u00a0according\u00a0to Protect Borrowers, an advocacy group.",
      "Tuesday's announcement is the latest development in a months-long legal battle over the program's fate, which has left millions of SAVE borrowers in limbo.",
      "The SAVE plan received pushback from attorneys general from several Republican-led states, including Missouri, which sued in 2024, arguing the plan overstepped the Biden administration's authority. In February 2025, a circuit court ruled the SAVE plan was unlawful, according to the Education Department.",
      "As the legal battle played out, SAVE borrowers were put in forbearance in July 2024, meaning that their loans were temporarily placed on hold and interest stopped accruing.",
      "In July 2025, the Education Department said it would restart charging interest on the loans beginning Aug. 1, a move advocacy group Protect Borrowers said could cost enrollees $300 per month due to new interest charges.",
      "Tuesday's agreement will \"strip borrowers of the most affordable repayment plan,\" Protect Borrowers deputy executive director and managing counsel Persis Yu said in a statement.",
      "The Education Department is advising SAVE borrowers to use the Federal Student Aid Loan Simulator tool to explore other repayment plans.",
      "As Kent and Hanaway\u00a0note\u00a0in their Wall Street Journal opinion piece, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act creates a single new income-driven repayment plan called the Repayment Assistance Plan, which has a repayment window of up to 30 years. The plan will be available for new borrowers beginning on July 1, 2026, along with a separate standard repayment plan, according to the Education Department.",

      "Those crosscurrents have left workers feeling generally exhausted, according to the job search firm, which on Wednesday named \"fatigue\" as its 2025 word of the year based on how often Glassdoor users mentioned it in the company's online forum. Glassdoor said use of the word in its online community jumped 41% in 2025, compared with the previous year.",
      "\"When we asked professionals in the spring, 'Do you feel like events in the news are draining your energy at work?', 78% said yes. Turns out, that exhaustion never really went away,\" Glassdoor said.",
      "Economic worries were also front and center, with many Glassdoor users expressing frustration that their paychecks have not kept pace with inflation. Mentions of \"stagflation,\" the economic term used to describe periods marked by high prices and weak economic growth, spiked threefold compared to last year, according to Glassdoor.",
      "Such concerns appear to jibe with rising public concerns about the cost of food, housing and other necessities.",

Mentions of the term \"agentic\" \u2014 a reference to the AI bots businesses are implementing across retail, travel and many other industry sectors \u2014 soared more than 2,200% from a year ago, as workers scrambled to learn how to use new AI tools.",
      "Political conversations also infiltrated the workplace, with mentions of \"inauguration\" spiking 875% compared to 2024, according to Glassdoor.",

      "Canada has launched a $1.2 billion initiative aimed at drawing leading researchers to the country, as the U.S. intensifies restrictions on highly skilled workers by charging $100,000 for H-1B visas.",
      "The Canadian government announced on Tuesday that its investment over 12 years will be used to recruit and support over 1,000 individuals advancing world-leading research in critical fields, including doctors and scientists.",
      "\"As other countries constrain academic freedoms and undermine cutting-edge research, Canada is investing in \u2013 and doubling down on \u2013 science,\" Melanie Joly, Canada's industry minister, said in a statement. \"Today's investment is about securing Canada's place at the forefront of discovery and innovation and leveraging our strength in science to support our future well-being and prosperity for generations to come.\"",
      "While the initiative does not explicitly mention the United States, it appears aimed \u2013 at least in part \u2013 at attracting highly skilled workers like those who could hold H-1B visas.",
      "In September, President Trump signed an executive order requiring a $100,000 fee for H-1B skilled foreign worker applicants, saying it will spur companies to hire Americans instead of people from overseas.",
      "The fee applies only to new H-1B applicants who live abroad, according to the Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which oversees the visa program. More specifically, the $100,000 fee applies to H-1B applications filed on or after Sept. 21 by workers outside the U.S. and who do not currently hold such a visa, USCIS said in October.",
      "While the fee could foster boosted domestic hiring in some industries, other industries could take a hit. The U.S. health care system, for example, which depends on international professionals such as doctors, lab technicians and nurses to fill positions, could become collateral damage.",
      "Canada, meanwhile, faces its own challenges. The country is experiencing a significant shortage of doctors in primary care, leaving millions without a family physician and contributing to longer emergency room waits and poorer health outcomes.",
      "In response, Canadian officials have announced a path to expedited permanent residency for overseas doctors with at least one year of Canadian work experience, aiming to address the critical workforce gap.",
      "\"This dedicated Express Entry category, along with the reserved federal admission spaces for provinces and territories, will help bring in and keep practice-ready doctors, so people across Canada can get the care they need,\" Lena Metlege Diab, Canada's minister of refugees and citizenship, said in a statement Monday.",
      "Some scholars are already making their way from the U.S. to Canadian universities. The University of Toronto announced in November that it recruited three top researchers from U.S. institutions \u2014 whose work ranges from the search for new planets to economics \u2014 and called it a \"big win for Canada.\"",
      "\"By attracting the top minds from around the world to work alongside exceptional Canadian researchers, the Government of Canada is building the kind of scientific and academic powerhouse that drives the strongest economy in the G7,\" Joly said.",

      "Not one U.S. citizen has applied.",
      "West River Health Services in Hettinger, a town of about 1,000 residents in the southwestern part of the state, has four options, and none is good.",
      "The hospital could fork over $100,000 for the Trump administration's new H-1B visa fee and hire one of the more than 30 applicants from the Philippines or Nigeria. The fee is the equivalent of what some rural hospitals would pay two lab techs in a year, said Holzkamm, who is West River's lab manager.",
      "West River could ask the Department of Homeland Security to waive the fee. But it's unclear how long the waiver process would take and if the government would grant one. The hospital could continue trying to recruit someone inside the U.S. for the job. Or, Holzkamm said, it could leave the position unfilled, adding to the workload of the current \"skeleton crew.\"",
      "The U.S. health care system depends on foreign-born professionals to fill its ranks of doctors, nurses, technicians, and other health providers, particularly in chronically understaffed facilities in rural America.",
      "But a new presidential proclamation aimed at the tech industry's use of H-1B visas is making it harder for West River and other rural providers to hire those staffers.",
      "\"The health care industry wasn't even considered. They're going to be collateral damage, and to such an extreme degree that it was clearly not thought about at all,\" said Eram Alam, a Harvard associate professor whose new book examines the history of foreign doctors in the U.S.",
      "Elissa Taub, a Memphis, Tennessee-based attorney who assists hospitals with the H-1B application process, has been hearing concerns from her clients.",
      "\"It's not like there's a surplus of American physicians or nurses waiting in the wings to fill in those positions,\" she said.",
      "Until recently, West River and other employers paid up to $5,000 each time they applied to sponsor an H-1B worker. The visas are reserved for highly skilled foreign workers.",
      "The new $100,000 fee \u2014 part of a\u00a0September proclamation\u00a0by President Trump \u2014 applies to workers living outside the U.S. but not those who were already in the U.S. on a visa.",
      "West River lab tech Kathrine Abelita is one of nine employees \u2014 six technicians and three nurses \u2014 at the hospital who are current or former H-1B visa holders. Abelita is from the Philippines and has worked at West River since 2018. She's now a permanent U.S. resident.",
      "\"It's going to be a big problem for rural health care,\" she said of the new fee. She said most younger American workers want to live in urban areas.",
      "Sixteen percent of registered nurses, 14% of physician assistants, and 14% of nurse practitioners and midwives who work in U.S. hospitals are immigrants, according to a\u00a02023 government survey. Nearly a quarter of physicians in the U.S. went to medical school outside the U.S. or Canada, according to\u00a02024 licensing data.",
      "The\u00a0American Hospital Association, two\u00a0national rural health organizations, and\u00a0more than 50 medical societies\u00a0have asked the administration to give the health care industry exemptions from the new fee. The new cost will disproportionally harm rural communities that already struggle to afford and recruit enough providers, the groups argue.",
      "\"A blanket exception for healthcare providers is the simplest path forward,\" the National Rural Health Association and National Association of Rural Health Clinics wrote in a joint letter.",
      "The proclamation allows fee exemptions for individuals, workers at specific companies, and those in entire industries when \"in the national interest.\"\u00a0New guidance\u00a0says the fee will be waived only in an \"extraordinarily rare circumstance.\" That includes showing that there is \"no American worker\" available for the position and that requiring a company to spend $100,000 would \"significantly undermine\" U.S. interests.",
      "Taub called those standards \"exceptionally high.\"",
      "Representatives of the NRHA and the American Medical Association, which organized a letter from the medical societies, said they've received no response after sending requests to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in late September and early October. The AHA declined to say whether it had heard back.",
      "Homeland Security officials directed KFF Health News' inquiries to the White House, which did not answer questions about individual waiver timelines or the possibility of a categorical exemption for the health care industry.",
      "Instead, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers sent a statement defending the new fee, saying it will \"put American workers first.\" Her comments echo Mr. Trump's proclamation, which focuses on accusations that the tech industry is abusing the H-1B program by replacing American workers with lower-paid foreign ones. But the order applies to all trades.",
      "Alam, the Harvard professor, said the U.S.' reliance on international providers does raise legitimate concerns, such as about how it takes professionals away from lower-income countries facing even greater health concerns and staffing shortages than the U.S.",
      "This decades-long dependency, she said, stems from population booms, medical schools' historical exclusion of nonwhite men, and the \"much, much cheaper\" cost of importing providers trained abroad than expanding health education in the U.S.",
      "Internationally trained doctors tend to work in rural and urban areas that are poor and underserved, according to\u00a0a survey\u00a0and\u00a0research review.",
      "Nearly 1,000 H-1B providers were employed in rural areas this year, the two rural health organizations wrote in their letter to the Trump administration.",
      "J-1 visas, the most common type held by foreign doctors during their residencies and other postgraduate training in the U.S., require them to return to their home country for two years before applying for an H-1B.",
      "But a government program called the Conrad 30 Waiver Program allows up to 1,500 J-1 holders a year to remain in the U.S. and apply for an H-1B in exchange for working for three years in a provider shortage area, which includes many rural communities.",
      "President Trump's proclamation says employers that sponsor H-1B workers already inside the U.S., such as doctors with these waivers, won't have to pay the six-figure fee, a nuance clarified in guidance released about a month later.",
      "But employers will have to pay the new fee when hiring doctors and others who apply while living outside the U.S.",
      "Alyson Kornele, CEO of West River Health Services, said most of the foreign nurses and lab techs it hires are outside the U.S. when they apply.",
      "Ivan Mitchell, CEO of Great Plains Health in North Platte, Nebraska, said most of his hospital's H-1B physicians were inside the U.S. on other visas when they applied. But he said physical therapists, nurses, and lab techs typically apply from abroad.",
      "Holzkamm said it took five to eight months to hire H-1B applicants at her lab before the new fee was introduced.",
      "Bobby Mukkamala, a surgeon and the president of the American Medical Association, said Republican and Democratic lawmakers are concerned about the ramifications for rural health care.",
      "They include Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who said he planned to reach out about possible exemptions.",
      "\"We want to make it easier, not harder, and less expensive, not more expensive, for people who need the workforce,\" the Republican told KFF Health News in September.",
      "Thune's office did not respond to questions about whether the senator has heard from the administration regarding potential waivers for health workers.",
      "The Trump administration is facing at least two lawsuits attempting to block the new fee.\u00a0One group of plaintiffs\u00a0includes a company that recruits foreign nurses and a union that represents medical graduates.\u00a0Another lawsuit, by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, mentions concerns about the physician shortage and health systems' ability to afford the new fee.",
      "Kornele said West River won't be able to afford a $100,000 fee so it's doubling down on local recruiting and retention.",
      "But Holzkamm said she hasn't been successful in finding lab techs from North Dakota colleges, even those who intern at the hospital. She said West River can't compete with the salaries offered in bigger cities.",

      "Homeownership is increasingly out of reach for most U.S. families as the gap between people's earnings and home prices\u00a0widens, according to a new analysis.",
      "More than 75% of homes across the country are unaffordable for the typical household, Bankrate said in a\u00a0report. The personal finance firm defines a home as affordable if the annual housing costs do not exceed 30% of a household's income.",
      "\"Only a sliver of the housing market is affordable to the typical household,\" Bankrate data analyst Alex Gailey told CBS News. \"That's when homeownership starts to feel less like a common middle-class milestone and more like a luxury.\"",
      "Experts emphasize that the ability to buy a home, long viewed as a pillar of the American Dream, is critical for building wealth. But high home prices, driven in part by a nationwide shortage of affordable housing, have made that difficult for many Americans.",
      "\"It's left the average American household with far fewer homes than they can afford, and we haven't been building at the rate we should be,\" Gailey said.",
      "Figures from the National Association of Realtors show that only 24% of housing sales last year were by first-time homebuyers \u2014 down from 50% in 2010. The U.S. needs 4.7 million housing units to keep up with demand, according to a July analysis from Zillow, an online real estate marketplace.",
      "In 2024 (the latest date for which figures are available), the median household income in the U.S. after adjusting for inflation was nearly $84,000, according to Census data. That is far less than the $113,000 in annual income needed to buy a typical home, which now costs around $435,000, according to Bankrate.",
      "In the country's priciest cities, such as New York, San Francisco and Seattle, households must earn at least $200,000 a year to afford the median-priced home.",
      "As of 2025, about 65% of U.S. households owned their own home, down from a peak of more than 69% in 2004, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "By contrast, in some parts of the South and West, where home construction has picked up in some markets, there are glimmers of hope, Gailey said, pointing to stronger tax incentives and looser permitting requirements as policies that could boost construction.",
      "\"Those regions have brighter outlooks than the Northeast and Midwest, where building has lagged, and inventory levels remain well below pre-pandemic norms,\" she said.",

    "published": "Tue, 09 Dec 2025 20:50:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump spoke about affordability and his economic agenda in the Poconos, in northeastern Pennsylvania, Tuesday night.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 After weeks of decrying the focus on \"affordability\" and calling it a \"Democratic hoax,\" President Trump spoke in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, Tuesday night to sell his economic agenda ahead of a challenging midterm election season for congressional Republicans.",
      "Mr. Trump spent much of the more than 90-minute-long rally-style speech promoting and defending his economic record, saying,\u00a0\"America is winning again\" and \"Pennsylvania is prospering again.\" He touted job growth in the key battleground state, which has a slightly lower unemployment rate than the nation as a whole, and a decline in gas prices. The president also claimed his tariffs on foreign goods are paying dividends for the U.S. economy \u2014 despite worries from most economists that tariffs can lead to slower economic growth and higher consumer prices.",
      "He pointed to the tax components of his \"big, beautiful bill,\" including a plan to create\u00a0investment accounts for children \u2014 seeded with $1,000 from the federal government for eligible kids \u2014 and a tax deduction for tips.",
      "Mr. Trump highlighted his decision to let Japan-based Nippon Steel buy U.S. Steel, a major employer in Pennsylvania. He said his administration \"saved\" the company, which he said is now \"hot as a pistol.\"",
      "\"The one thing you need, you need steel,\" he said. \"You know, you can give up certain products. You can give up pencils... You don't need 37 dolls for your daughter. Two or three is nice, but you don't need 37 dolls.\"",
      "He argued his administration is \"crushing\" inflation and said \"prices are coming down.\" Consumer prices rose 3% year-over-year in September, which is well below 2022 levels \u2014 when inflation hit 9.1% \u2014 but still higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target. Mr. Trump also continued blaming Democrats for affordability issues.",
      "\"They caused the high prices, and we're bringing them down,\" the president said.",
      "After initially focusing on cost-of-living issues, Mr. Trump veered off topic at times, riffing about immigration and polling members of the audience about whether to refer to his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, as \"sleepy Joe\" or \"crooked Joe.\"",
      "He also repeatedly brought up a fraud scandal that has enveloped Minnesota politics, and pointed to the fact that most of the defendants are of Somali descent. At several points, he urged Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to \"do your job\" as Bessent's agency investigates allegations that Minnesota tax dollars went to the terror group al Shabaab.",
      "Trump addresses affordability after calling issue a \"scam\"",
      "The president has publicly and privately vented about the focus on affordability as an issue for weeks, referring to it as a \"hoax,\" a \"con job\" and a \"scam\" perpetuated by Democrats.",
      "Mr. Trump criticized Democrats for focusing on affordability issues in Tuesday's speech, though he said: \"I can't call it a hoax because they'll misconstrue that.\"",
      "Last week, the president called the affordability issue a \"fake narrative\" made up by Democrats to sway the public. But at the same time, he said he had inherited problems with affordability from his predecessor.",
      "\"They just say the word,\" the president said during his Cabinet meeting on Dec. 2. \"It doesn't mean anything to anybody. They just say it \u2014 affordability. I inherited the worst inflation in history. There was no affordability. Nobody could afford anything.\"",
      "Inflation has\u00a0edged higher\u00a0in recent months, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs, but the latest inflation numbers have been delayed until mid-December \u2014 after the Federal Reserve's interest rate-setting meeting this week \u2014 because of the recent U.S.\u00a0government shutdown.",
      "In an interview published Tuesday, the president told Politico\u00a0that \"prices are all coming down.\"",
      "Behind the scenes, aides told CBS News last week that the president has grown increasingly irritated by perceptions that his policies aren't easing prices.",
      "His travel to sell his economic agenda in Pennsylvania is a quiet acknowledgement that he needs to do more to rally the public behind his policies. In Tuesday's speech, Mr. Trump said he decided to speak about affordability in part because chief of staff Susie Wiles told him he needed to start campaigning for the midterm elections.",
      "Polling shows voters are feeling the crunch of still-high prices and the cost of living, as well as the challenging market for job seekers \u2014 and many at least partially blame Mr. Trump.",
      "In a November CBS News/YouGov poll, 60% of respondents agreed Mr. Trump makes prices and inflation \"sound better than they really are.\" Nearly two-thirds of respondents said the president's policies are making grocery prices go up. Just 32% said the U.S. economy is good, down from 38% the month Mr. Trump took office in January. Respondents were most likely to say the economy and inflation are the most important to them, and among those who listed the economy and inflation as their top priorities, 77% said the president is not spending enough time on those issues.",
      "The Palm Beach Post, a local paper near Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in South Florida, published an opinion piece Tuesday with the headline, \"'Affordability' is not a hoax, Trump. Reality costs too much.\"",
      "Pennsylvania will feature key races for Republicans as they try to hold onto their majority in the House of Representatives in 2026. Mount Pocono, where Mr. Trump spoke Tuesday night, is just over 30 miles from Scranton, Biden's hometown.",
      "Cost of living worries still linger",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks come amid ongoing public frustration over the high cost of living in the U.S.",
      "Although U.S. inflation has fallen, the high cost of food, shelter, health care, utilities, child care and other basic necessities has remained a sore spot for millions of Americans.",
      "Mr. Trump has vacillated between downplaying complaints about the economy and defending his administration's efforts to address affordability issues.",
      "In November, for example, the Trump administration removed country-specific tariffs on imports of beef, bananas and coffee as consumers continue to grapple with high food prices. Mr. Trump last month also discussed offering Americans a $2,000 payment funded by U.S. tariff collections, while this month he floated the idea of using tariff revenue to cut federal income taxes.",
      "More recently, Mr. Trump on Monday announced $12 billion in aid for farmers who have struggled under tariffs and because of the U.S trade war with China.",
      "\"We're bringing prices way down,\" Trump said at the White House on Monday. \"You can call it 'affordability' or anything you want, but the Democrats caused the affordability problem, and we're the ones that are fixing it.\"",
      "The economy has proved resilient this year despite earlier fears about the impact of steep new U.S. tariffs on imports. After losing steam in the first quarter, the nation's gross domestic product has accelerated in the second half of 2025, while the nation's labor market has remained steady despite slowing payroll gains.",
      "Financial markets also continue to hover in record territory, shrugging off concerns about a bubble in AI companies.",
      "At the same time, some experts describe the economy as \"K-shaped\" \u2014 a reference to the divergent fortunes of wealthier consumers compared with people lower down the ladder.",
      "Aimee  Picchi, \n                                                  \n                                  Fin  Daniel G\u00f3mez and \n                                                  \n                                  Olivia  Rinaldi\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, said Sunday that \"there's a deal to be had\" on addressing health care costs after a pair of bills failed to secure enough support to advance in the Senate last week.",
      "\"There has to be a meeting of the minds between Democrats and Republicans,\" Cassidy said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Last week, the Senate rejected two bills aimed at lowering health care costs, as lawmakers struggle to reach consensus over how to address expiring tax credits that help millions of Americans purchase insurance under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "While Democrats sought a three-year extension of the enhanced tax credits with their bill, Republicans offered their own legislation sponsored by Cassidy. Rather than extending the enhanced tax credits, the measure would redirect funds to health savings accounts for those who use bronze plans on state exchanges, allowing people to save on premiums by switching to the lower-tier plans, while giving them the ability to use the HSA funds toward their deductibles.",
      "The Republican-led measure didn't pick up any support from Democrats during the dueling votes last week. But Cassidy said that in addition to their concern about the premiums, Democrats must acknowledge high deductibles, saying \"you've got to put cash in the patient's pocket to pay the out of pocket.\"",
      "\"I would be willing to do a short-term extension of the premium tax credit for those people with higher premiums if they will concede that we've got to do something for the $6,000 out of pocket,\" Cassidy added. \"I think there's a deal to be had here. We need to push for that deal.\"",
      "The Louisiana Republican said he's searching for a deal to address the concerns of Democrats and Republicans.",
      "\"Let's just meet,\" Cassidy said. \"Let's address our concerns, and then this Republican would be willing to do something on a short-term extension of the premium tax credits if that's what it takes to get the deal to help those folks with the more expensive premium, but also helping everybody with their deductible.\"",
      "The comments come as some senators have expressed tepid optimism in recent days about a path forward on a compromise after last week's partisan exercise. Some Republicans have said they're open to an extension of the enhanced tax credits, with some new limits and on a temporary basis, acknowledging the cliff that around 22 million Americans face with their expiration at the end of the month.",
      "Cassidy argued that with his approach, lawmakers would have until the end of March to implement a solution, \"because with these kind of accounts that people have money in, they just save the receipts, they submit them, and they get reimbursed.\"",
      "\"We can get this done,\" Cassidy said. \"And I think we can meet the concerns, both about the out of pocket, but also about the premium.\"",
      "In a separate appearance on \"Face the Nation,\" Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia responded to Cassidy's comments. Warner said lawmakers shouldn't wait to address the rising costs, urging them to \"fix it now, so people don't go into Christmas thinking they're going to not know if they're being able to afford health care.\"",
      "\"Fix the crisis right now,\" Warner said. \"Extend the subsidies, and then let's debate how we fix it.\"",

      "MAYOR BRETT SMILEY: Seven individuals in stable condition, one in critical, but stable condition, and one has been discharged.",
      "EMERGENCY DISPATCH: It is a confirmed shooting.",
      "TOM HANSON: The first calls came in just after 4:00 p.m. Saturday.",
      "EMERGENCY DISPATCH: I'm being advised 167 Brook in the building, in the stairway, there's a person shot.",
      "TOM HANSON: The university president says the shooting took place in the middle of a final exam review session at the university's engineering and physics building.",
      "MAN: And there was a huge response immediately. You can just look out the window, there's tons of cop cars, tons of fire trucks. It was a lot.",
      "TOM HANSON: As some students evacuated, Brown's campus, normally open and walkable, became a place to hide, the sense of security at this Ivy League institution now broken.",
      "CHRISTINA PAXSON (President, Brown University): We have a lot of recovery ahead of us. So my main goal in the coming days and weeks and months, it will take a long time, is to bring people back together and help them feel safe and secure on campus.",
      "(End VT)",
      "TOM HANSON: And there is still no word yet on a motive, but, according to one law enforcement source, the person of interest is 24 and did not attend Brown University.",
      "Now, meanwhile, all remaining final exams have been postponed as investigators work with prosecutors to collect more evidence and conduct more interviews \u2013 Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's Tom Hanson reporting from Providence, Rhode Island.",
      "We turn to our exclusive conversation with Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who spoke to us Friday from Oslo, where she just received the Nobel Peace Prize. To get there, she traveled secretly by land, sea and air, as she faces arrest by the Maduro regime.",
      "We wanted to hear about that journey, but she refused to talk about it, citing security concerns for those who helped her, although she has previously said she received support from the U.S. government.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO (Venezuela Opposition Leader): I am not going to give more information regarding my trip to Norway.",
      "But what am I going to say, how important it is for the Venezuelan people. This is a recognition to a nation that has fought tirelessly, courageously against a criminal narco-terrorist structure. And \u2013 and I came to receive that prize, that award, and I'm going to bring it back home to the Venezuelan people as soon as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You say you're going back home. I know you sent your own children out of Venezuelan territory in order to protect them, your sons, your daughter.",
      "Are they concerned that you plan to return to Venezuela? When are you going?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: Well, of course they are concerned, as any other Venezuelan child that has their parents or relatives back in our country, because the regime, as I said, has persecuted, tortured, killed, disappeared thousands of Venezuelans.",
      "And, recently, it has turned even more violent, because, you know, when \u2013 when a criminal regime is falling apart and they know their days are numbered, they turn even more aggressive, even more violent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you help us understand what is going on? Because we are seeing here in the U.S. an increase in the pressure campaign, more sanctions on Venezuelan individuals and vessels. We saw an armed seizure of a vessel carrying oil out of Venezuela.",
      "Selling oil on the black market is really important money for the Maduro regime. Do you endorse this idea of more seizures and possibly even a blockade?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: Look, I absolutely support President Trump's strategy.",
      "And we, the Venezuelan people, are very grateful to him and to his administration, because I believe he is a champion of freedom in this hemisphere. And that's why \u2013 and I say this from Oslo right now \u2013 I have dedicated this award to him, because I think that he finally has put Venezuela in where it should be, in terms of a priority for the United States' national security.",
      "And we do support these actions because, Margaret, we are facing not a conventional dictatorship. This is a very complex criminal structure that has turned Venezuela into a safe haven of international crime and terrorist activities, starting with Russia, Iran, Cuba, Hezbollah, Hamas, the Colombian guerrilla, the drug cartels operating freely and directed in partnership with Maduro and his regime.",
      "And, as every criminal structure is \u2013 suffers is when the inflows from their criminal activities are cut. And these, in the case of Maduro regime, comes from the oil black market, to drug trafficking, gold smuggling, arms smuggling, even human smuggling and trafficking.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It sounds like you support more sanctions and possibly more seizures of oil. But isn't there a risk that cutting off money will further hurt the already impoverished people of Venezuela? Isn't that a risk?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: Of course, what we're doing is for the well-being of the Venezuelan people. What we want to do is to save lives.",
      "But Maduro was the one who declared a war on the Venezuelan people, a war we didn't want, a war we are suffering with hundreds of thousands of killings and forced executions in the last years. And, right now, I want to be very clear with the international community.",
      "The resources Maduro gets are not going to schools or hospitals. In Venezuela, a teacher earns $1 a day. Pensions are less than $1 a month. Our children go twice a week to school. The sources, the cash the regime gets from these illegal activities goes to buy arms, to pay gang members, to spy and infiltrate, and to even further increase their illegal narcotics activities and so on.",
      "So these resources are not going for to \u2013 towards the people. They're going for corruption and crime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So it sounds like you want even more seizures and a blockade. Is that correct?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: We want every legal action through law enforcement approach, not only from the United States, also from other Caribbean, Latin American and European countries, that further block the illegal activities of the regime.",
      "Why? Because we need to increase the cost of staying in power by force. Once you arrive to that point in which the cost of staying in power is higher than the cost of leaving power, the regime will fall apart. And it's the moment where we, you know, advance into a negotiated transition, which is what in the beginning we offered Maduro when we won the presidential election by a landslide last year.",
      "But he not only refused that option, but he, as you know, unleashed the worst, most brutal repression wave we've seen in our history.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And eight million Venezuelans have fled\u2026",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: That's correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 since he came to power, during that time.",
      "But, in terms of the diplomacy, President Trump spoke with Maduro himself last month. We haven't seen any evidence, though, that diplomacy, a negotiated exit like you mentioned, is happening. Are you seeing diplomatic success?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: Well, in the last years, Venezuela has seen 17 dialogue initiatives, not once, not twice, 17.",
      "Every single time, the opposition or our allies or the United States have complied with every single thing we offered. The regime of the country has violated every single thing they offered on their own part. What did they get? They got time. They got legitimacy. They got money.",
      "And that's precisely what they think they can get again \u2013 once again. But, certainly, things have changed very much in the last months. Venezuela is a total different country. I mean, Maduro is weaker than ever. The armed forces, police are certainly divided and fractured, and our country is united, cohesive.",
      "And we finally have the administration, in this case, President Trump, with a clear strategy that truly represents a credible threat for the regime. So if we had \u2013 ever had a chance to finally move ahead into \u2013 towards democracy in our country, it's today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What evidence do you have that the military is weaker than ever? Was your escape proof of that?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: We've seen more and more members of the military finding ways to connect with us, to send messages to \u2013 to \u2013 to show that they are feeling the same of what the rest of the country is feeling.",
      "When \u2013 when they \u2013 this military go back home, they find their children, their mother, their partners saying that they are hungry, that they are persecuted, that their families have been divided. They are scared. Yes, they are scared, because repression and persecution in the military is even tougher than on civilians.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, President Trump said that land strikes to stop drug trafficking specifically will start soon. He has been saying that for weeks. Do you know what he is talking about? And has he promised you anything?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: No, I don't know. And well, if I knew, I wouldn't say it, of course. But it's not the case.",
      "We are not involved and we will not get involved into another nation's policy for their own national security.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But would you welcome U.S. military action?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: I will welcome more and more pressure so that Maduro understands that he has to go, that his time is over.",
      "And I will insist something that I have said several times before. This is not conventional regime change. This cannot be compared to other cases, like countries in the Middle East. We had an election. Regime change was already mandated by over 70 percent of the population. And what we need is support to enforce that decision.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, how do you square military action with receiving a Peace Prize? Are we at the point it's necessary?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: Well, what we're fighting for is precisely freedom in order to have democracy, and democracy in order to have peace.",
      "And in order to maintain freedom and to achieve freedom, you do need strength. The contrary would be the peace of the dead, in which you have a country under absolute oppression and simply giving in. And that's not the case.",
      "It's absolutely absurd that you see a regime, a criminal regime like Maduro, that gets support from Russia or from Iran, and then ask the Venezuelan people not to ask support from democratic countries and democratic leaders.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: That's absolute absurd. We do not have arms. We have our will. We have the power of organization and the power of love, which, at the end, I have to say that peace is ultimately an act of love.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Maduro regime maintains it won the last election and considers Machado a fugitive. The regime also refers to U.S. actions as illegal and brutal interventionism.",
      "In our next half-hour, we will speak with Machado about what's ahead in a potential post-Maduro era in Venezuela.",
      "And we will be back in one minute, so stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're now joined by the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner of Virginia.",
      "Senator, were you persuaded there by Maria Corina Machado's argument that military action, pressure is virtuous and necessary?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER (D-Virginia): Well, first of all, let me \u2013 at the top of the show, we have got this tragic shooting at Brown University and then this obviously political strike against the Jewish community in Australia, both horrible, and particularly on the first day of Hanukkah, which is the celebration of light over darkness.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: And, boy, we could use a little more light these days.",
      "Ms. Machado is a hero. She deserves to win the Nobel Prize. And one of the mistakes the Biden administration made last year, when the opposition candidates won overwhelmingly, was not put more pressure on Maduro then to leave. But the action now that Trump has chosen Maduro, who's a bad guy, and saying \u2013 and I'm not sure what his policy is, but at the very same time is pardoning, for example, a Honduran former president who was convicted in America of drug running.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: The president, who has not been willing to stand up strong against Putin, who's probably the most brutal authoritarian leader in the world, as we go on and off with Ukraine.",
      "I think it's \u2013 yes, it'd be great to get rid of Maduro. But in terms of the question\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: \u2026 Donald Trump has not come to the American people and said, here are our goals in Venezuela. We have got troops potentially in harm's way. We have got boat actions, for example, where we're blowing up boats where we can obviously interdict, as we saw with the oil tanker.",
      "I think the president needs to make the case if he's going to try to put boots on the ground in Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, at this point, all they have, as I understand it, asked for and justified to Congress were these strikes on the alleged drug boats, nothing with sovereign territory yet.",
      "But that gets to your argument about, what is the end goal? Unlike other Democrats, when it comes to the drug boats, you have said you're not ready to call them war crimes, particularly what happened on the September 2 double tap strike. You have questioned Admiral Bradley.",
      "I know you want the video released to the public. What do you think that's going to show to the public? What will that change?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, I think the video is chilling, disturbing, whatever term you want to use.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Because the idea of these two survivors hanging on to remnants of a boat, and then America taking a series of additional strikes. The Congress needs to see it, at the very minimum. I think the American public needs to see it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have seen it?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: I have seen it. It is \u2013 it is\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Only a limited number have.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: It is extraordinarily chilling.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: What I'm saying is, once you make the accusation of war crime, you can't take that back.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: And so what I have said\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But many of your Democrat colleagues have.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: And I know that.",
      "That's why I have said to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, I want to see the written execution order. I want to see the legal opinion that was about this specific strike. I want to know whether the overarching policy memorandum, which was not finished until September 5, three days after the strike, was it changed?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You \u2013 I saw you said that that's not typical, is it? Don't you normally come up with the legal justification before you take the action, rather than three days after it?",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, this is where I have a question.",
      "The justification was made in late July. They didn't write it down until September 5.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Can \u2013 I don't have the answer.",
      "I also want to see the after-action report. I want to give the military every opportunity to make their case, because once you \u2013 again, once you make that claim, what it would do to how we view our military, morale, how we're viewed in the world, it's so important.",
      "But this president has not \u2013 and, frankly, Pete Hegseth even worse. Here's the guy who goes out and brags about the strikes, until there's controversy, and then he kind of runs for the hills.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the president said again this week \u2013 and I will just read it to you \u2013 that land strikes on Venezuela are being considered.",
      "\"Land strikes on horrible people that are bringing in drugs and killing our people. It doesn't necessarily have to be in Venezuela. It's people that are bringing in drugs to our country as targets.\"",
      "Have you seen any legal justification to hit these people now designated as terrorists on sovereign territory, whether it's Mexico or Colombia or Venezuela?",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: The vast majority of the drug \u2013 particularly \u2013 this is all cocaine. This is not fentanyl. The vast\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of the drug boats that they hit.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: The vast majority is actually in the Eastern Pacific, yet most of the strikes have been in the Caribbean.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: And does this mean that suddenly you're going to be open warfare with all of American military against any and all drug dealers?",
      "Again, the drug dealers are awful. We need to do all we can to stop them. But the president, when he puts American forces potentially in harm's way, needs to come and explain to the American people what the goal is here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Particularly when he's then, at the same breath, pardoning the former president of Honduras, who is a convicted drug dealer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of designated terrorists, ISIS is a designated terrorist group. We just saw the first combat deaths, essentially, of the Trump administration yesterday, three Americans killed, three injured in Syria in this apparent ambush.",
      "The head of the National Counterterrorism Center said it was an insider attack. Are you supportive of keeping the nearly 1,000 U.S. troops in Syria? Do you have concerns that the Syrian government isn't able to keep these infiltrators out?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, first of all, condolences to the three Americans' families, armed forces members, one an interpreter.",
      "I think our troops have played an important role. We are working closely with, for example, the Kurds. We have literally tens of thousands of ISIS family members in certain prisons in that area. But the president\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you want that to continue?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: But the president \u2013 I think pulling out without a plan would be a mistake, but the president, again, has sent mixed signals.",
      "I mean, months ago, he said he's thinking about taking all those American soldiers out without articulating a strategy. I mean, the president, if he wants to make the case to the American people of when our soldiers are in harm's way, and particularly when we're talking about the Caribbean, and now potential Venezuela, this has not been an overnight \u2013 this buildup of forces been months.",
      "He owes it to all of us to come in and explain what his goal is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Domestically, we have Senator Cassidy on the program. We taped with him earlier.",
      "He says he's looking for fellow Democrats to join him in a health care deal by March to make these health savings accounts. And he said he will offer to extend the existing subsidies for health care premiums.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, first of all\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you be on board with that?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: \u2026 we have got a crisis that hits as of Monday, tomorrow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Because that's when people have to sign up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He says, retroactively, you can do it.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, listen, it's a mess.",
      "Once you have signed up or you have dropped out of the system, the idea that you're retroactively going to fix it, fix it now, so people don't go into Christmas thinking they're going to not know if they will be able to afford health care. And the notion\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But nothing is happening.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: But the notion that what \u2013 and Bill Cassidy is a good guy. I have worked with him in a lot of different efforts.",
      "But the idea that a one-time $1,500 payment into your pocket is going to suddenly make up \u2013 I had a person on \u2013 the other day, her current insurance is $544 a month.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: It'll go up to over $1,500 a month.",
      "A one-time $1,500 payment is not going to meet her needs\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: \u2026 and particularly if that would mean that things like preexisting condition protections would disappear.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That sounds like you're not on board in these remaining days of 2025.",
      "Senator, I have to\u2026",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Fix the crisis right now. Extend the subsidies, and then let's debate how we fix it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, we have to \u2013 we have to leave it there.",
      "Thank you, Senator.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to \"FACE THE NATION.\" We're joined now by the director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett.",
      "Good to have you back.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT (National Economic Council Director): It's great to be back.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, people are holiday shopping. They're aware of prices. The president said this week prices are coming down tremendously. The latest data, though, from the Consumer Price Index is up three percent year over year, Personal Consumption Index is up 2.8 percent year over year. What data is he looking at? What's your benchmark?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Well, one the things that, if you saw his presentation in Pennsylvania, as he put up a bunch of charts, which he loves to do, where he went through the individual items that have \u2013 we've already sort of made a bunch of progress on.",
      "And so, for example, under Joe Biden, prescription drugs were up nine percent. So far this year they're down 0.6 percent. Gasoline is way down. It was like the highest ever under Biden.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Eggs. He was talking about eggs. Yes.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes, he was talking about eggs.",
      "And so, I think the \u2013 the way to think about inflation, of course, is that there are like micro effects, like the time that we had the avian flu affecting drug prices.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And then macro effects, which is runaway spending, big deficits and an accommodated Fed policy. And I think that \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And now tariffs adding to some price increases according to the Fed chair.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, I \u2013 you know, I think that the tariff evidence is mixed. But the point is that we've got deficit going way, way down. So, right now, it's looking like the deficit for this year will be $600 billion lower than it was last year. That really helps lower inflation. We've got the trade deficit cut in half from last year. And so all these things are things that should continue to move us towards the Fed target of two percent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Companies aren't necessarily going to bring items down, though, in terms of pricing, right? I mean the president told \"The Wall Street Journal,\" he didn't know when all of this money, quote, \"is going to kick in.\" I think he was talking to business investment and tariffs, \"and help voters. All I can do is my job.\"",
      "When do you anticipate voters will feel this positive impact?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Well, it's definitely the case that \u2013 and you guys have been covering it a lot, that consumer sentiment right now is lower than anyone would like.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: But, you know, we find that that very often happens during a government shutdown, where everybody's really upset.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the last administration called that the vibe session, right?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No, but \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The data's good, but people feel bad.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: But what happened \u2013 yes, but what's going to happen is \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Same thing, you're saying?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No, what's going to happen \u2013 I'm not saying that. What I'm saying is that people are going to see the high growth. Growth is four percent. Income growth is up about $1,200 this year. People look in their wallets and see they're doing better, which is why we had the biggest Black Friday ever. And so on.",
      "And so, I think that the sentiment \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's more higher incomes.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: The sentiment will catch up with the reality. Under Joe Biden the fact is that real purchasing power dropped by about 3,000. So far this year it's up by about $1,200 per family. And the money that we're talking about is like real money. So, for groceries, it went from $400 a month to $525 a month under Biden. So, that's like an extra more than thousand dollars a year you have to spend on groceries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Uh-huh.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: It's down this year for us, the grocery package. But it's still got a lot of room to grow \u2013 or to go.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A lot more to go.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the president reduced some tariffs on some of those grocery items with an eye towards that acknowledgement.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: On the food stuff. Yes, if we don't make it here, then pretty much we don't tariff it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you \u2013 you mentioned gas.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Uh-huh.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oil prices globally are relatively low.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Uh-huh.",

      "KEVIN HASSETT: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you feel you have the leeway there, pricing-wise, to conduct more seizures, or even a blockade of oil from Venezuela?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Without it hurting?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes, well, I'm not a foreign policy guy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: So, like what we do with Venezuela, whether we blockade is up to the president and Marco Rubio.",
      "But I can say that \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you've got the leeway, right? Pricing (ph).",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: That what's been going on is there's been kind of a black market for oil amongst sort of this sanctioned countries. And what we're doing is we're shutting that black market down. Whether that affects prices outside of the sanctioned countries is kind of an open question. Probably not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think it will?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No, because \u2013 because there's \u2013 they're already kind of on the ropes, these countries. They're only getting oil when they get, like, sort of black fleets to sneak in and give them the oil.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And that's what we're trying to slow down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's \u2013 OK.",

      "We also this survey from The Business Roundtable. I'm sure you saw it. They asked CEOs what they expect to happen. And they anticipate employment will decrease in 2026 rather than increase.",
      "Are you concerned about a hiring slowdown?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: The same Fed said that they were more bullish on growth for next year, right? And so, I think that we're at a certain case \u2013",

      "KEVIN HASSETT: But on the jobs picture, you know, we're going to get the data next week. And so, maybe next Sunday I'll come back and we'll talk about it because we've got two months of data coming out on Tuesday and we'll get a clearer picture because right now we just have some very difficult to pin down surveys, like the gold standard for this will be really the household survey, which we don't even get for October.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But these were CEOs. They're the people who would be doing the hiring, right? And they're saying, we're not doing it.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: But they don't have the broad perspective that we'll get when he get the big data released next week.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you trust that big data?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I trust the household survey especially. And, sadly, we won't have one for October. But we're going to get one for November and that's going to be really important for thinking about where the job market is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Employment is one of the things that the Fed watches closely. And we heard again from the president that you were on this short list to be potentially the next Fed chair.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes.",

I don't really \u2013 you know, in the old days, that used to happen. Nowadays, it's sort of \u2013 they think it shouldn't happen. But I've done great. I've made a lot of money. I'm very successful. I think my voice should be heard.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: As Fed chair, how frequently would you consult with the president when he says he wants his voice herd?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, I'm right now the top economic adviser for the president and I talk about almost everything with him almost every day. I've certainly talked about monetary policy. I think he has very strong and well-founded views about what we ought to do. But in the end, the job of the Fed is to be independent and the \u2013 to work with the group of people that are on the Board of Governors at the FOMC, to drive a group consensus on where interest rates should be. And to do so, you know, basically with the guidance of the Fed chair. But in the end, it's a committee that votes. And I'd be happy to talk to the president every day, you know, until both of us are dead because it's so much fun to talk. And he's \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even if you were Fed chair?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Even if I were Fed chair. If I wasn't Fed chair, I \u2013 you know what, I would hope that Kevin Warsh would be talking to the president as well if he \u2013 if he were Fed chair.",

      "KEVIN HASSETT: No. No. The \u2013 he would have no weight. It's just his opinion matters if it's good. You know, if it's based on data. And then if you go to the committee and you say, well, the president made this argument and that's a really sound argument, I think, what do you think? If they reject it, then they'll vote in a different way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Louisiana Republican Senator Bill Cassidy. He joins us this morning from Baton Rouge.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY (R-LA): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, your health care bill gives Americans up to $1,500 in tax-free accounts to spend on health care rather than extend these expiring ACA subsidies. On Thursday, your proposal failed 51-48, as did the Democratic proposal. So that means it looks like those receiving ACA premium subsidies will see their costs go up 114 percent. Bottom line here, did Republicans simply wait too long to come up with a health care alternative?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Well, first, Margaret, let's just kind of recap the question. We've got to do something for affordability for the people in the exchanges. And I will say that the only thing that Democrats would accept was something that would decrease the premiums. But if a family has a $6,000 out of pocket before they get into the strength of the insurance plan, then frankly the policy is catastrophic. It brings profit to the insurance company, but not benefit to the patient.",
      "So, I would argue that it actually is \u2013 there has to be a meeting of the minds between Democrats and Republicans. Let's acknowledge, you've got to put cash in the patient's pocket to pay the out of pocket. I would be willing to do a short-term extension of the premium tax credits for those people with higher premiums if they will concede that we've got to do something for the $6,000 out of pocket. I think there's a deal to be had here. We need to push for that deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you want to make sure that the average deductible is less than $6,000 is what I just heard you say there, and you're open to an",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Absolutely. The net deductible, if you will \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: That $1,500 is per person. Give me a couple \u2013 you know, for people over 50, give me a couple in their 50s with two children, 18 and 19. They would get $5,000 in an account, in their purse, pocketbook, you name it, in their pocket to pay the out of pocket for the insurance. Now, the insurance plan for that couple would be a $6,000 deductible. So, you end up decreasing the net deductible by doing this. That makes the policy actually functional for them. If the child has a sprained ankle and you bring to the urgent care, you can pay the bill, not kind of come with - - come at a \u2013 come forward out of your own pocket.",
      "By the way, I'm told that about 40 percent of Americans have less than $1,000 in their savings account. That kind of puts into relief why you need to have something in their pocket to pay the out of pocket.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "So, I know the president has said that he likes the concept of your plan, but why didn't the White House put its shoulder behind this before Thursday? Why didn't they whip votes for you? Four of your Republican colleagues crossed the aisle and voted with Democrats on their proposal.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: All four of those voted for our proposal, too. And I think that shows you that there is \u2013 there is interest in finding something which addresses both the critical problem of the out-of-pocket expense, but also the higher premiums.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is the White House behind you on this? Like, are they helping you if you're trying another \u2013",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Well, it certainly seemed like it. Their \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want this up for another vote?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Their initial plan had elements of what I am speaking about, helping people with that deductible. So, simply put, yes, the White House is there. But if you notice, our problem was not on the Republican side, our problem was on the Democratic side. So, what I'm saying is, is let's just meet together.",
      "As a physician, I can tell you, that deductible, the patient comes, she's stressed. She can't get the procedure, the x-ray, the whatever, because of her $6,000 deductible. Let's just meet. Let's address her concerns. And then this Republican would be willing to do something on a short-term extension of the premium tax credits if that's what it takes to get the deal to help those folks with the more expensive premium, but also helping everybody with their deductible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you need more White House help on this? And, sir, you're running out of time here. Do you really think you can get this done before January 1st?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Our problem is not with Republicans. Our problem has been with Democrats. But, of course, they may say that about us. So, what I am kind of searching for is a deal in which both have their concerns addressed. If you do that and you put this in place, you really have until the end of, like, March to get it done because with these kind of accounts that people have money in, they just save the receipts, they submit them and they get reimburse. It happens \u2013 it's what we do in my family. We have a flexible spending account.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: And so, we can get this done. And I think we can meet the concerns, both about the out of pocket, but also about the premium.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I also want to ask you about what's happening with the FDA right now. CBS has confirmed that there are no ongoing safety studies into the abortion drug Mifepristone. This was despite the Trump administration saying they were going to conduct one, and anti-abortion groups want this review to take place.",
      "I saw a letter the FDA commissioner sent to you last week claiming they are reviewing the evidence. Do you believe him? And if not, what are you doing about it?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: I had a conversation with the commissioner this past week. It seems as if it's taken a long time to get that study up and going, which suggests to me that it's not a priority. For the pro-life community, this should be a priority. And if we're going to make America healthy again, this seems like, my gosh, should be top priority.",
      "So, there is \u2013 I am disappointed, as well as others are disappointed, by the way this is being slow-walked. I think \u2013 I think it just needs to happen. We need to have the evidence out there.",
      "If you want to reassure the American people about something which is really top of mind, this is where they should be going.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said that Mifepristone is safe and effective and that there are side effects in less than 1 percent of patients. I \u2013 with that data point in place, why isn't the White House pressing the FDA commissioner to make this happen? There's some suggestion in reporting that it is for political concerns due to impact on the upcoming midterm races. Is this politically motivated, the slow-walking you say is happening?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: You're asking me to look into the kind of motivations of folks with whom I've not had a personal conversation. I can't do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, did the FDA commissioners say that?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: The FDA commissioners said that they're trying to get the study together. But they've been in office long enough that it could be. And so, I think that it's right to be impatient. It's right to demand more.",
      "I don't know if the decision starts with the FDA commissioner. You just suggested it starts in the White House. That might be the case. Point being, get it done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you have confidence in the FDA commissioner?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: I think the FDA commissioner is working very hard. And I think that, in many cases, he's receiving directives from on high. I don't know that for sure, but I suspect that's the case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Dr. Cassidy, Senator Cassidy, we thank you for your time.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Here's more of our exclusive interview with Venezuelan opposition leader, Maria Corina Machado.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The regime itself has done a number of things. They have revoked TV licenses for journalists to broadcast truthfully. He has jailed journalists. The United Nations says the national guard targeted political opponents, committed sexual violence, tortured people and committed other crimes against humanity.",
      "So, from where you sit, is Maduro stepping down enough, or do you need the entire regime dismantled, in which case that sounds like a country in collapse.",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO (Venezuelan Opposition Leader): That's a very good question because certainly Maduro is the head of the structure, but it's like any other mafia system. You have families or groups that operate and sometimes even compete among each other.",
      "There are different degrees in the crimes they have committed. Certainly those that have committed crimes against humanity, that have been reported by the fact finding missions (ph) of the United Nations should face justice. Local justice and international justice.",
      "There are other members of the regime or the armed forces that have committed lesser crimes. And certainly we will search for justice, not revenge.",
      "But this, I'm going to insist, what we're living right now is chaos. Maduro represents chaos. We're going to put order.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. But respectfully, you also have acknowledged that the drug cartels are exploiting your country. That Russia is exploiting your country, Iran, Cuba, China.",
      "Just yesterday, Vladimir Putin spoke with Maduro and said their strategic partnership is growing. Are you concerned here that Russia is going to shore up support for the military and intelligence?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: Well, I'm absolutely convinced that Putin wants the world to think that, and especially wants President Trump to think that. But I would ask you a question. Do you think Putin has resources to spare at this time or does he have something that's more urgent for him to invest those resources? I mean helping a regime that is going to fall apart anyway, regardless of what he does, I don't think it's a priority for him.",
      "Nonetheless, I do not underestimate what the (INAUDIBLE) actors of Tarismo (ph) might be planning to do once we are in that transition to democracy. And that will require very efficient actions to isolate and neutralize those threats.",
      "And, you know, we work very hard to understand what's the true nature of our armed forces right now, identifying those military which we believe could be supportive of a transition to democracy and new government \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have they pledged that to you?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: Some of them, yes. And we believe that over 80 percent of our armed forces will join in support the democratic movement once the transition is in place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, tell me about that transition. What kind of support do you need to keep the country together, to prevent another refugee crisis? And do you have that pledge from the American government now?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: We will need a lot of support, advice, information, technology, not only from the United States, also from multilateral organizations, some of which we're already working together. Not only in security issues, but power supply, food supply, how do we bring \u2013 you know, put order in our financial accounts. How do we restructure our debt. How we open markets for international investment and give security to international investment in oil and gas and infrastructure, critical minerals. I mean, Venezuela is unique in terms of the amount of the natural endowments we have.",
      "And, you know, we're located three hours by plane from Florida. So, it's hard to think, you know, in this shortening of the supply chains that is in the (INAUDIBLE) shoring process taking place, a better ally in the region than Venezuela.",
      "At the same time, you know, turning Venezuela from the criminal hub of the Americas into a security shield for the United States and for the rest of the region is a top priority for all.",
      "So, you know, we have the plans ready. We have the teams ready. We know what we have to do, the first 100 hours, and the next 100 days. And most importantly, and I want to insist on this, we have the people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would that include U.S. peacekeeping troops or other troops on the ground?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: I'm \u2013 I cannot answer that question right now. I don't think that's the case. There are other countries that have offered support as well in order to strengthen democratic institutions once the government elect is in place. But the \u2013 we will have to address that once we have the, you know, the government elect in place and put in order, bringing order back to our country.",
      "And one thing that you mentioned for \u2013 about the, you know, the refugee crisis, it's going to be exactly the country. The day Maduro goes, you will see tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants coming back home from the United States and all over the world. I mean our diaspora is desperate to go back to Venezuela. So even from that perspective, it is a win-win situation to have democracy in Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think it is safe for those Venezuelans in America to go back there now? Some temporary protected status was just revoked bit the president for more than half a million Venezuelans here. Is it safe for them?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: Absolutely not. It will be safe once Maduro is gone and every single citizen will be, you know, living freedom and respect towards the law. We will bring back rule of law. We will liberate our political prisoners. And everybody will be free to speak out what they feel, what they think, what they want for the future of their \u2013 for their own future and their families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Maria Corina Machado, we thank you for your time today. And we will be watching.",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: I thank you and again (ph) for this great opportunity. And God bless Venezuela. Venezuela will be free.",

    "summary": "Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Mar\u00eda Corina Machado said she's \"absolutely\" supportive of President Trump's strategy in the country.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado said she's \"absolutely\" supportive of President Trump's strategy in the country amid his administration's increased pressure campaign against the regime of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "\"We, the Venezuelan people, are very grateful to him and to his administration, because I believe he is a champion of freedom in this hemisphere,\" Machado said of Mr. Trump on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Last week, the Venezuelan opposition leader made a daring escape from her country to collect her Nobel Peace Prize in Norway. The appearance marked the first time Machado has been seen in public in almost a year, after living in hiding in Venezuela. In an exclusive interview with \"Face the Nation,\" Machado said she dedicated the award to Mr. Trump because \"he finally has put Venezuela in where it should be, in terms of a priority for the United States national security.\"",
      "\"We have been asking this for years, so it's finally happening,\" Machado said. \"That's why I believe the regime has its days numbered.\"",
      "The U.S. has increased pressure on the Maduro regime in recent weeks, with a buildup of military assets in the region, strikes on alleged drug boats off the coast of Venezuela, new sanctions on Venezuelan individuals and vessels, along with the seizure of an oil rig.",
      "Machado acknowledged that more sanctions and more possible seizures of oil come with the risk of cutting off the already impoverished people of Venezuela. But she said \"what we're doing is for the well being of the Venezuelan people.\"",
      "\"What we want to do is to save lives, but Maduro was the one who declared a war on the Venezuelan people,\" Machado said. \"A war we didn't want. A war we are suffering with hundreds of thousands of killings and forced executions in the last years.\"",
      "Asked by Brennan whether she wants more seizures and a blockade, Machado said \"we want every legal action through law enforcement approach,\" not only from the U.S., but also from Caribbean, Latin American and European countries to \"further block the illegal activities of the regime.\"",
      "\"Why? Because we need to increase the cost of staying in power by force. Once you arrive to that point in which the cost of staying in power is higher than the cost of leaving power, the regime will fall apart, and it's the moment where we, you know, advance into a negotiated transition,\" Machado said.",
      "Maduro refused to leave after last year's presidential election, even after tallies showed the opposition winning nearly 70% of the vote. But Machado said things have changed significantly in recent months, and Venezuela is a \"total different country.\"",
      "\"Maduro is weaker than ever. The Armed Forces, police are certainly divided and fractured, and our country is united, cohesive, and we finally have the administration, in this case, President Trump with a clear strategy that truly represents a credible threat for the regime,\" she said. \"So if we had ever had a chance to finally move ahead into, towards democracy in our country, it's today.\"",
      "Outlining her argument, Machado said \"the wide majority of the military want change,\" pointing to the move to disobey an order to expel electoral witnesses from polling stations during last year's elections, and the results of the election itself. Machado said more recently, members of the military have been \"finding ways to connect with us\" by sending messages \"to show that they are feeling the same of what the rest of the country is feeling.\"",
      "Asked whether she would welcome U.S. military action in Venezuela, Machado said \"I will welcome more and more pressure so that Maduro understands that he has to go, that his time is over.\"",
      "Machado alleged that the Maduro regime has \"persecuted, tortured, killed, disappeared, thousands of Venezuelans.\" She added that \"recently it has turned even more violent because, you know, when a criminal regime is falling apart and they know their days are numbered, they turn even more aggressive, even more violent.\"",
      "The opposition leader said \"we are facing not a conventional dictatorship.\"",
      "\"This is a very complex criminal structure that has turned Venezuela into a safe haven of international crime and terrorist activities, starting with Russia, Iran, Cuba, Hezbollah, Hamas, the Colombian guerrilla, the drug cartels operating freely and directed in partnership with Maduro and his regime,\" she said.",
      "Machado said that while \"Maduro is the head of the structure,\" she alleged that it's like \"any other mafia system.\"",
      "\"There are other members of the regime or the armed forces that have committed lesser crimes,\" she said. \"And certainly we will search for justice, not revenge. But this, I'm going to insist, what we're living right now is chaos. Maduro represent chaos. We're going to put order.\"",
      "Asked whether she's concerned Russia will shore up support for the military and intelligence, Machado said \"I'm absolutely convinced that Putin wants the world to think that, especially wants President Trump to think that.\" But she added, \"do you think Putin has resources to spare at this time?\"",
      "\"I mean helping a regime that it's going to fall apart anyway, regardless of what he does, I don't think it's a priority for him,\" Machado said.",
      "On the task of keeping the country together after Maduro's regime leaves, Machado cited cooperation with key allies, saying, \"our main ally will be the United States of America.\" On the question of whether that would include U.S. troops on the ground, Machado said she doesn't \"think that's the case.\"",
      "\"There are other countries that have offered support as well in order to strengthen democratic institutions once the government-elect is in place, but that we will have to address that once we have the, you know, the government-elect in place and put in order, bringing order back to our country.\"",
      "Machado said \"the day Maduro goes, you will see tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants coming back home from the United States and all over the world.\"",
      "\"Our diaspora is desperate to go back to Venezuela,\" she said. \"So even from that perspective, it is a win-win situation to have democracy in Venezuela.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to \"Face the Nation.\" We're joined now by the Director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett. Good to have you back.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT, DIRECTOR NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: It's great to be back.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So people are holiday shopping. They're aware of prices. The president said this week prices are coming down tremendously. The latest data, though, from the Consumer Price Index is up 3% year over year, personal consumption index is up 2.8% year over year. What data is he looking at? What's your benchmark?",
      ": Right. Well, one of the things that if you saw his presentation in Pennsylvania, as he put up a bunch of charts, which he loves to do, where he went through the individual items that we've already sort of made a bunch of progress on. And so, for example, under Joe Biden, prescription drugs were up 9%. So far this year, they're down six tenths of a percent. Gasoline is way down. It was like the highest ever under Biden--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Eggs, he was talking about eggs, yeah.",
      ": Yeah, he was talking about eggs. And so I think the way to think about inflation, of course, is that there are like micro effects, like the time that we had the avian flu affecting drug prices. And then macro effects, which is runaway spending, big deficits and then an accommodative Fed policy. And I think--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But now tariffs adding to some price increases according to the Fed chair.",
      ": Well, I- you know, I think that the tariff evidence is mixed. But the point is that we've got deficit going way, way down. So right now, it's looking like the deficit for this year will be $600 billion lower than it was last year. That really helps lower inflation. We've got the trade deficit cut in half from last year. And so all of these things are things that should continue to move us towards the Fed target of 2%.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Companies aren't necessarily going to bring items down, though, in terms of pricing, right? I mean, the- the president told the Wall Street Journal he didn't know when all of this money, quote, \"is going to kick in.\" I think he was talking to business investment and tariffs, and help voters, \"all I can do is do my job.\" When do you anticipate voters will feel this positive impact?",
      ": Right. Well, it's definitely the case that, and you guys have been covered a lot, that consumer sentiment right now is lower than anyone would like. But, you know, we find that that very often happens during a government shutdown when everybody's really upset--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the last administration called that the \"vibecession,\" right?",
      ": No, but--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --the data is good, but people feel bad.",
      ": --Yeah, but what's going to happen is--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Same thing, you're saying.",
      ": No what's- I'm not saying that. What- what I'm saying is that people are going to see the high growth. Growth is 4%. Income growth is up about $1,200 this year. People look at their wallets and see they're doing better, which is why we had the biggest Black Friday ever and so on and so--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's more higher income se--",
      ": --The sentiment will catch up with the reality. Under Joe Biden, the fact is that real purchasing power dropped by about $3,000. So far this year, it's up by about $1,200 per family. And the money that we're talking about is like real money. So for groceries, it went from $400 a month to $525 a month under Biden. So that's like an extra more than $1,000 a year. You have to spend on groceries. It's down this year for us, for the grocery package, but it's still got a lot of room to grow- to go.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A lot more to go--",
      ": Yeah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the president reduced some tariffs on some of those grocery items--",
      ": --On the food stuff--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --with an eye towards that.",
      ": Yeah, if we don't make it here, then pretty much we don't tariff it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you, you mentioned gas. Oil prices globally are relatively low. We saw this Coast Guard interdiction with military forces boarding and seizing this vessel off the coast of Venezuela. Do you feel you have the leeway there, pricing-wise, to conduct more seizures or even a blockade of oil from Venezuela, without it hurting?",
      ": Well, I'm not a foreign policy guy, so what we do with Venezuela and whether we blockade is up to the president and Marco Rubio. But I could say that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But you've got the leeway, right--",
      ": --that- that what's been going on is there's been kind of a black market for oil amongst sort of this sanctioned countries. And what we're doing is we're shutting that black market down. Whether that affects prices outside of the sanctioned countries is kind of an open question. Probably not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think it will?",
      ": No, because they're already kind of on the ropes, these countries. They're only getting oil when they get like sort of black fleets to sneak in and give them the oil. And that's what we're trying to slow down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, I want to ask you about the Fed decision. The Federal Open Market Committee said job gains have slowed this year. We also saw the survey from the Business Roundtable. I'm sure you saw it. They asked CEOs what they expect to happen, and they anticipate employment will decrease in 2026 rather than increase. Are you concerned about a hiring slowdown?",
      ": The same Fed said that they were more bullish on growth for next year, right? And so I think that we're at a certain--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But on the jobs picture.",
      ": But on the jobs picture, you know, we're going to get the data next week. And so maybe next Sunday I'll come back and we'll talk about it, because we've got two months of data coming out on Tuesday. And we'll get a clearer picture because right now we just have some very difficult to pin down surveys like the gold standard for this will be really the household survey, which we don't even get for October.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But these are CEOs. They're the people who would be doing the hiring, right? And they're saying, we're not doing it.",
      ": But, but they don't have the broad perspective that we'll get when we get the big data released next week.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you trust that big data?",
      ": I trust the household survey, especially. And sadly, we won't have one for October. But we're going to get one for November. And that's going to be really important for thinking about where the job market is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Employment is one of the things that the Fed watches closely. And we heard again from the president that you were on this short list to be potentially the next Fed chair, although he was conducting interviews this week. He said you and Hoover's Kevin Warsh are at the top of the list. On Friday, the president was asked how big of a role he wants to personally play in future Fed interest rate decisions. Take a listen.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE BEGINS]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think I certainly should have a role in talking to whoever the head of the Fed is, or the Fed. I don't think- you know the old days that used to happen. Nowadays, it's sort of, they think it shouldn't happen. But I've done great. I've made a lot of money, I'm very successful. I think my voice should be heard.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 As Fed chair, how frequently would you consult with the president when he says he wants his voice heard?",
      ": Well, I'm right now the top economic advisor for the president, and I talk about almost everything with him almost every day. I've certainly talked about monetary policy. I think he has very strong and well-founded views about what we ought to do. But in the end, the job of the Fed is to be independent and to work with the group of people that are on the Board of Governors, at the FOMC, to drive a group consensus on where interest rates should be and to do so, you know, basically with the guidance of the Fed chair. But in the end, it's a committee that votes. And I'd be happy to talk to the president every day, you know, until both of us are dead because it's so much fun to talk--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even if you were Fed Chair.",
      ":\u00a0 Even if I were Fed Chair or if I wasn't Fed Chair. You know what, I would hope that Kevin Warsh would be talking to the president as well if he were Fed Chair.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And voice should be heard is going to be--",
      ": You know, every Fed Chair talks to lots and lots of market experts--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Equal to the other members- of the voting members or?",
      ": Excuse me?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would the president's voice have equal weighting to the voting members?",
      ": No, no, he would have no weight. It's just his opinion matters if it's good, you know, if it's based on data. And then if you go to the committee and you say, well, the president made this argument and that's a really sound argument, I think, what do you think? If they reject it, then they'll vote in a different way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. Well, we'll be watching to see what happens. Kevin Hassett.",
      ": Great to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thanks as always. We'll be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Louisiana Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, he joins us this morning from Baton Rouge. Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SEN. BILL CASSIDY: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So your health care bill gives Americans up to $1,500 in tax free accounts to spend on health care rather than extend these expiring ACA subsidies. On Thursday, your proposal failed 51 to 48, as did the Democratic proposal. So that means it looks like those receiving ACA premium subsidies will see their costs go up 114%. Bottom line here, did Republicans simply wait too long to come up with a health care alternative?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Well, first Margaret, let's just kind of recast the question. We've got to do something for affordability for the people in the exchanges. And I will say that the only thing the Democrats would accept was something that would decrease the premiums. But if a family has a $6,000 out of pocket before they get into the strength of the insurance plan, then, frankly, the policy is catastrophic. It brings profit to the insurance company, but not benefit to the patient. So I would argue that it actually is- there has to be a meeting of the minds between Democrats and Republicans. Let's acknowledge you've got to put cash in the patient's pocket to pay the out of pocket. I would be willing to do a short-term extension of the premium tax credits for those people with higher premiums, if they will concede that we've got to do something for the $6,000 out of pocket. I think there's a deal to be had here. We need to push for that deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you want to make sure that the average deductible is less than $6,000 is what I just heard you say there, and you're open to an--",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Absolutely. The net deductible, if you will, that $1,500 is per person. Give me a couple- for people over 50. Give me a couple in their 50s with two children, 18 and 19, they would get $5,000 in an account in their purse, pocketbook, you name it, in their pocket to pay the out of pocket for the insurance. Now the insurance plan for that couple would be 6000- $6,000 deductible. So- so you end up decreasing the net deductible by doing this. That makes the policy actually functional for them. If the child has a sprained ankle you bring to the urgent care, you can pay the bill, not kind of come with- come forward- out of your own pocket. By the way, I'm told that about 40% of Americans have less than $1,000 in their savings account. That kind of puts into relief why you need to have something in their pocket to pay the out of pocket.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I know the President has said that he likes the concept of your plan, but- but why didn't the White House put its shoulder behind this before Thursday? Why didn't they whip votes for you? Four of your Republican colleagues crossed the aisle and voted with Democrats on their proposal.",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: All four of those voted for our proposal too. And I think that shows you that there is- there is interest in finding something which addresses both the critical problem of the out of pocket expense, but also the higher premiums--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But is the White House behind you on this? Like are they helping you?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: --Well it certainly seems like it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want this up for another vote.",
      "[END CROSSTALK]",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Their initial plan had elements of what I am speaking about, helping people with that deductible. So simply put, yes, the White House is there. But if you notice, our problem was not on the Republican side, our problem was on the Democratic side. So what I'm saying is, let's just meet together. As a physician, I can tell you that deductible- the patient comes, she's stressed. She can't get the procedure, the X ray, the whatever, because of her $6,000 deductible. Let's- let's just meet. Let's address our concerns. And then this Republican would be willing to do something on a short term extension of the premium tax credits, if that's what it takes to get the deal to help those folks with the more expensive premium, but also helping everybody with their deductible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you need more White House help on this? And, sir, you're running out of time here. Do you really think you can get this done before January 1st?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Our problem is not with Republicans. Our problem has been with Democrats. But of course, they may say that about us. So what I am kind of searching for is a deal in which both have their concerns addressed. If you do that and you put this in place, you really have until the end of, like March to get it done. Because with- with these kind of accounts that people have money in, they just save the receipts, they submit them, and they get reimbursed. It happens- it's what we do in my family, we have a flexible spending account. And so we can get this done, and I think we can meet the concerns both about the out of pocket, but also about the premium.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I also want to ask you about what's happening with the FDA right now. CBS has confirmed that there are no ongoing safety studies into the abortion drug Mifepristone. This was despite the Trump administration saying they were going to conduct one and anti-abortion groups want this review to take place. I saw a letter the FDA commissioner sent to you last week claiming they are reviewing the evidence. Do you believe him? And if not, what are you doing about it?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: I had a conversation with the commissioner this past week. It seems as if it's taken a long time to get that study up and going, which suggests to me that it's not a priority. For the pro life community, this should be a priority. And if we're going to make America healthy again, this seems like, my gosh, should be top priority. So there is- I am disappointed as well as others are disappointed. By the way, this is being slow walked. I think- I think it just needs to happen. We need to have the evidence out there. If you want to reassure American people about something which is really top of mind, this is where they should be going.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said that Mifepristone is safe and effective and that there are side effects in less than 1% of patients. I- with that data point in place, why isn't the White House pressing the FDA commissioner to make this happen? There's some suggestion in reporting that it is for political concerns due to impact on the upcoming midterm races. Is this politically motivated- the slow walking you say is happening?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: You're asking me to look into the kind of motivations of folks with whom I've not had a personal conversation--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Well, did the FDA commissioner say that?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: I can't do that- but the FDA commissioner said that they're trying to get the study together, but they've been in office long enough that it could be and so I think that it's right to be impatient. It's right to demand more. I don't know if the decision starts with the FDA commissioner. You just suggested it starts in the White House. That might be the case. Point being, get it done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you have confidence in the FDA commissioner?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: I think the FDA commissioner is working very hard, and I think that in many cases, he's receiving directives from on high. I don't know that for sure, but I suspect that's the case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Dr. Cassidy, Senator Cassidy, we thank you for your time. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Dec. 14, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're now joined by the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner of Virginia. Senator, were you persuaded there by Maria Corina Machado's argument that military action pressure is virtuous and necessary?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, first of all, let me at the top of the show- we've got this tragic shooting at Brown University, and then this obviously political strike against the Jewish community in Australia. Both horrible and particularly on the first day of Hanukkah, which is a celebration of light over darkness. And boy, we could use a little more light these days. Ms. Machado is a hero. She deserves to win the Nobel Prize. And one of the mistakes the Biden administration made last year when the opposition candidates won overwhelmingly, was not put more pressure on Maduro then to leave. But the action now that Trump has chosen Maduro, who is a bad guy and saying, and I'm not sure what his policy is, but at the very same time, is pardoning, for example, a Honduran former president who was convicted in America of drug running. The president who has not been willing to stand up strong against Putin, who is probably the most brutal authoritarian leader in the world, as we go on and off with Ukraine. I think is- yes, it would be great to get rid of Maduro. But in terms of the question, Donald Trump has not come to the American people and said, here are our goals in Venezuela. We've got troops potentially in harm's way. We've got boat actions, for example, where we're blowing up boats, where we can obviously interdict, as we saw with the oil tanker. I think the President needs to make the case if he's going to try to put boots on the ground in Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, at this point, all they've, as I understand it, asked for and justified to Congress were these strikes on the alleged drug boats. Nothing with sovereign territory yet. But that gets to your argument about what is the end goal. Unlike other Democrats when it comes to the drug boats, you've said you're not ready to call them war crimes, particularly what happened on the September 2 double tap strike. You've questioned Admiral Bradley. I know you want the video released to the public. What do you think that's going to show to the public? What will that change?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I think the video is chilling, disturbing, whatever term you want to use--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Why?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Because the idea of these two survivors hanging on to remnants of a boat and then America taking a series of additional strikes. The Congress needs to see it at the very minimum. I think the American public needs to see it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've seen it?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I've seen it--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:--Only a limited number have--",
      "SEN. WARNER:-- It is extraordinarily chilling. What I'm saying is, once you make the accusation of war crime, you can't take that back, right? And so what I've said--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- But many of your Democrat colleagues have.",
      "SEN. WARNER: -- I know that. That's why I've said to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, I want to see the written execution order. I want to see the legal opinion that was about this specific strike. I want to know whether the overarching policy memorandum, which was not finished until September 5, three days after the strike, was changed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I saw you said this. That's not typical, is it? Don't you normally come up with the legal justification before you take the action, rather than three days after?",
      "SEN. WARNER: This is where I have a question. The justification was made in late July. They didn't write it down till September 5.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I don't have the answer. I also want to see the after-action report. I want to give the military every opportunity to make their case, because once you- again- once you make that claim, what it would do to how we view our military, morale, how we're viewed in the world. It's so important. But this President has not- and frankly, Pete Hegseth, even worse. Here's the guy who goes out and brags about the strikes until there's controversy, and then he kind of runs for the hills.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the President said again this week, and I'll just read it to you that land strikes on Venezuela are being considered. Land strikes on horrible people that are bringing in drugs and killing our people. It doesn't necessarily have to be in Venezuela. It's people that are bringing in drugs to our country as targets. Have you seen any legal justification to hit these people now designated as terrorists on sovereign territory, whether it's Mexico or Colombia or Venezuela?",
      "SEN. WARNER: The vast majority of the drug particularly- this is all cocaine. This is not fentanyl. The vast majority--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- In terms of the drug boats--",
      "SEN. WARNER: -- The vast majority is actually in the eastern Pacific, yet most of the strikes have been in the Caribbean. And is- this mean that suddenly you're going to be in open warfare with all of American military against any and all drug dealers? Again, the drug dealers are awful. We need to do all we can to stop them, but the President, when he puts American forces potentially in harm's way, needs to come and explain to American people what the goal is here.\u00a0 Particularly when he's then, at the same breath, pardoning the former president of Honduras, who was a convicted drug dealer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 In terms of designated terrorists, ISIS is a designated terrorist group. We just saw the first combat deaths, essentially, of the Trump administration yesterday. Three Americans killed, three injured in Syria in this apparent ambush. The head of the National Counterterrorism Center said it was an insider attack. Are you supportive of keeping the nearly 1,000 US troops in Syria. Do you have concerns that the Syrian Government isn't able to keep these infiltrators out?",
      "SEN. WARNER: First of all, condolences to the three Americans families, Armed Forces members, one an interpreter. I think our troops have played an important role. We are working closely with, for example, the Kurds. We have literally tens of thousands of ISIS family members in certain prisons in that area.--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- So, you want them to continue?",
      "SEN. WARNER: But the President- I think pulling out without a plan would be a mistake, but the President, again, has sent signals. Months ago, he said he's thinking about taking all those American soldiers out without articulating his strategy. I mean the President, if he wants to make the case to the American people of when our soldiers are in harm's way, and particularly when we're talking about the Caribbean and now potential Venezuela. This has not been an overnight. This buildup of force has been months. He owes it to all of us to come in and explain what his goal is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Domestically, we have Senator Cassidy on the program. We taped with him earlier. He says he's looking for fellow Democrats to join him in a health care deal by March, to make these health savings accounts, and he said he'll offer to extend the existing subsidies for healthcare premiums. Would you be on board with that?",
      "SEN. WARNER: First of all, we've got a crisis that hits as of Monday, tomorrow, because that's when people have to sign up--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- He says retroactively you can do it.",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, listen, it's a mess once you've signed up or you've dropped out of the system. You know, the idea that you're retroactively going to fix it. Fix it now, so people don't go into Christmas thinking they're going to not know if they'll be able to afford healthcare. And the notion- but the notion of what-\u00a0 Bill Cassidy is a good guy. I've worked with him in a lot of different efforts, but the idea that a one time $1,500 payment into your pocket is going to suddenly make up. I had a person the other day. Her current insurance is $544 a month. It'll go up to over $1,500 a month. A one time $1,500 payment is not going to meet her needs, and particularly if that would mean that things like pre-existing condition protections would disappear.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That sounds like you're not- not on board in these remaining days of 2025 Senator, I have to--",
      "SEN. WARNER: -- Fix the crisis right now, extend the subsidies, and then let's debate how we fix it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We have to leave it there. Thank you, Senator. We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of the full interview with Nobel Peace Prize winner Mar\u00eda Corina Machado that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Dec. 14, 2025.",
      "This interview was taped on Friday, Dec. 12, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, Venezuelan opposition leader who joins us from Norway where she just received the Nobel Peace Prize. Welcome to 'Face the Nation.'",
      "MAR\u00cdA CORINA MACHADO: Thank you very much, Margaret. It's my pleasure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You face arrest by the Maduro regime. I know you went through extraordinary difficulty just getting out of the country and to Norway. You said you got support from the United States government to do so. Can you tell us what type of support?",
      "MACHADO: Actually, I prefer not to give away any details, because I do not want to increase the risk on men and women that helped me to be here. And the regime has been, you know, very cruel against those that in the past have helped other Venezuelans flee the country when they were persecuted. So in this case, I do prefer to protect them as much as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand that. The head of the private rescue organization, who said he helped you come out of Venezuela, spoke to my CBS colleague, Lilia Luciano, and said smuggling you out was very high risk because you are so well known. You traveled by land, by sea, by air. He said multiple donors paid for it. Do you know why it was so important to them for you to make it to Norway and receive that prize?",
      "MACHADO: Well, I frankly have no idea. And as I say, I am not going to give more information regarding my trip to Norway. But what am I going to say- how important it is for the Venezuelan people. This is a recognition to a nation that has fought tirelessly, courageously against a criminal, narcoterrorist structure and- and I came to receive that prize, that award, and I'm going to bring it back home to the Venezuelan people as soon as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You say you're going back home. I know you sent your own children out of Venezuelan territory in order to protect them, your sons, your daughter. I read you hadn't even seen your daughter in 16 months. That's an incredible sacrifice for anyone. Are they concerned that you plan to return to Venezuela? When are you going?",
      "MACHADO: Of course, they are concerned as any other Venezuelan child that has their parents or relatives back in our country, because the regime, as I said, has persecuted, tortured, killed, disappeared, thousands of Venezuelans, and recently it has turned even more violent because, you know when, when a criminal regime is falling apart and they know their days are numbered, they turn even more aggressive, even more violent. Just a couple of weeks ago, a 16 year old girl was kidnapped and taken away to prison just because they were looking for her brother, and since they couldn't find her brother, they took Samantha. So this is the kinds of actions that are currently happening in my country. So yes, my family is concerned, but they know I have said that I will be where I am more useful to our cause, and that's exactly what I'm going to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You believe it's important to help the cause from inside the country right now. Can you help us understand what is going on, because we are seeing here in the US an increase in the pressure campaign. More sanctions on Venezuelan individuals and vessels. We saw an armed seizure of a vessel carrying oil out of Venezuela. Selling oil on the black market is really important money for the Maduro regime. Do you endorse this idea of more seizures and possibly even a blockade?",
      "MACHADO: Look, I absolutely support President Trump's strategy, and we, the Venezuelan people, are very grateful to him and to his administration, because I believe he is a champion of freedom in this hemisphere. And that's why, and I say this from Oslo right now, I had dedicated this award to him because I think that he finally has put Venezuela in where it should be, in terms of a priority for the United States national security. And we do support these actions, because, Margaret, we are facing, not a conventional dictatorship. This is a very complex criminal structure that has turned Venezuela into a safe haven of international crime and terrorist activities, starting with Russia, Iran, Cuba, Hezbollah, Hamas, the Colombian guerrilla, \u00a0the drug cartels operating freely and directed in partnership with Maduro and his regime. And as every criminal structure is suffers, is when the inflows from their criminal activities are cut. And these, in the case of Maduro regime, comes from the oil black market to drug trafficking, gold smuggling, arm smuggling, even human smuggling and trafficking. So that's what we believe, it was so important to apply, you know, law enforcement, and we have been asking this for years, so it's finally happening. That's why I believe the regime has its days numbered.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It sounds like you support more sanctions and possibly more seizures of oil, but isn't there a risk that cutting off money will further hurt the already impoverished people of Venezuela? Isn't that a risk?",
      "MACHADO: Of course. What we're doing is for the well being of the Venezuelan people. What we want to do is to save lives, but Maduro was the one who declared a war on the Venezuelan people. A war we didn't want. A war we are suffering with hundreds of thousands of killings and forced executions in the last years. And right now, I want to be very clear with the international community, the resources Maduro gets are not going to schools or hospitals in Venezuela a teacher earns $1 a day. Pensions are less than $1 a month. Our children go twice a week to school. The sources, the cash the regime gets from these illegal activities goes to buy arms, to pay gang members to spy and infiltrate and to even further increase their illegal narcotics activities and so on. So these resources are not going for, to- towards the people. They're going for corruption and crime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So it sounds like you want even more seizures and a blockade. Is that correct?",
      "MACHADO: We want every legal action through law enforcement a- approach, not only from the United States, also from other Caribbean, Latin American and European countries that further block the illegal activities of the regime. Why? Because we need to increase the cost of staying in power by force. Once you arrive to that point in which the cost of staying in power is higher than the cost of leaving power, the regime will fall apart, and it's the moment where we, you know, advance into a negotiated transition. Which is what in the beginning we offered Maduro when we won the presidential election by landslide last year, but he not only refused that option, but he, as you know, unleashed the worst, most brutal repression wave we've seen in our history.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And 8 million Venezuelans have fled\u2013",
      "MACHADO: That's correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013since he came to power during that time, but in terms of the diplomacy, President Trump spoke with Maduro himself last month. We haven't seen any evidence though, that diplomacy, a negotiated exit like you mentioned, is happening. Are you seeing diplomatic success?",
      "MACHADO \u00a0 Well, in the last years, Venezuela has seen 17 dialog initiatives, not once, not twice, 17. Every single time the opposition or our allies or the United States have complied with every single thing we offered, the regime of the country has violated every single thing they offered on their own part. What did they get? They got time, they got legitimacy, they got money, and that's precisely what they think they can get again, once again. But certainly, things have changed very much in the last months, Venezuela is total different country. I mean, Maduro is weaker than ever. The Armed Forces, police are certainly divided and fractured, and our country is united, cohesive, and we finally have the administration, in this case, President Trump with a clear strategy that truly represents a credible threat for the regime. So if we had ever had a chance to finally move ahead into, towards democracy in our country, it's today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What evidence do you have that the military is weaker than ever? Was your escape proof of that?",
      "MACHADO: Well, first of all, we have the evidence that the wide majority of the military want change, and that was- we saw that on July 28, 2024, that the military were ordered to expel our electoral witnesses from the polling stations and to deny our right to the original tally sheets and they disobeyed that order. Even in those polling stations where we know there is a high participation of military, we won by a landslide. More recently, we've seen more and more members of the military finding ways to connect with us, to send messages to, to, to show that they are feeling the same of what the rest of the country is feeling. When, when they, this military go back home, they find their children, their mother, their partners, saying that they are hungry, that they are persecuted, that their families have been divided. They are scared. Yes, they are scared, because repression and persecution in the military is even tougher than on civilians.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So President Trump said that land strikes to stop drug trafficking specifically will start soon. He has been saying that for weeks. Do you know what he is talking about? Has he promised you anything?",
      "MACHADO: No, I don't know. And well, if I knew, I wouldn't say it, of course. But it's not the case. We are not involved, and we will not get involved into another nation's policy for their own national security.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But would you welcome U.S. military action?",
      "MACHADO: I will welcome more and more pressure so that Maduro understands that he has to go, that his time is over. And I will insist something that I've said several times before, this is not conventional regime change. This cannot be compared to other cases, like countries in the Middle East, we had an election. Regime change was already mandated by over 70% of the population, and what we need is support to enforce that decision.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you square military action with receiving a peace prize? Are we at the point it's necessary?",
      "MACHADO: What we're fighting for is precisely freedom in order to have democracy and democracy, in order to have peace. And in order to maintain freedom and to achieve freedom, you do need strength. The contrary would be the peace of the dead, in which you have a country under absolute oppression and simply given in. And that's not the case. It's absolutely absurd that you see a regime, a criminal regime like Maduro, that gets support from Russia or from Iran and then as a benefit to unknown people, not to ask support from democratic countries and Democratic leaders, that's absolute, absurd. We do not have arms. We have our will. We have the power of organization and the power of love, which at the end, I have to say that peace is ultimately an act of love.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The regime itself has done a number of things. They have revoked TV licenses for journalists to broadcast, broadcast truthfully. He has jailed journalists. The United Nations says the National Guard targeted political opponents, committed sexual violence, tortured people and committed other crimes against humanity. So from where you sit is Maduro stepping down enough? Or do you need the entire regime dismantled? In which case that sounds like a country in collapse.",
      "MACHADO: That's a very good question, because certainly Maduro is the head of the structure, but it's like any other mafia system. You have families or groups that operate and sometimes even compete among each other. There are different degrees in the crimes they have committed, certainly those that have committed crimes against humanity that have been reported by the fact finding missions of the United Nations should face justice, local justice and international justice. There are other members of the regime or the armed forces that have committed lesser crimes. And certainly we will search for justice, not revenge. But this, I'm going to insist, what we're living right now is chaos. Maduro represent chaos. We're going to put order. And this whole idea, you know, people talking about a risk of a civil war and so on. Whoever says that has no idea at all about what Venezuela is. I mean, we are certainly the most cohesive society in the region, I would dare to say, perhaps in the world. I mean, Venezuelan society has no religious, social, regional, racial confrontations or tensions on the country. 90% of our population want the same, want the regime to go immediately, and we want to work hard to live with freedom. We want no more socialism, but most of all, we want our children back home.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood, but respectfully, you also have acknowledged that the drug cartels are exploiting your country, that Russia is exploiting your country, Iran, Cuba, China. Just yesterday, Vladimir Putin spoke with Maduro and said their strategic partnership is growing. Are you concerned here that Russia is going to shore up support for the military and intelligence?",
      "MACHADO: Well, I'm, I'm absolutely convinced that Putin wants the world to think that, especially wants President Trump to think that, about that. But I would ask you a question, do you think Putin has resources to spare at this time? Or does he has-something that's more urgent for him to invest those resources. I mean helping a regime that it's going to fall apart anyway, regardless of what he does. I don't think it's a priority for him. Nonetheless, I do not underestimate what the residual actors of Chavismo might be planning to do once we are in a transition to democracy. And that will require very efficient actions to isolate and neutralize those threats. And you know, we've work very hard to understand what's the true nature of our armed forces right now, identifying those military which we believe could be supportive of a tran- transition to democracy and the new gov--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Have they pledged that to you?",
      "MACHADO: Some of them, yes, and we believe that over 80% of our armed forces would join and support the democratic movement once the transition is in place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So tell me about that transition. I- we checked and when Secretary Rubio was sworn into office, you were one of the very first phone calls that he made. On day two.",
      "MACHADO: Me and President-elect Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, it was the two of us--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --That's right, that's right, he's deeply interested. So I'm interested in what has been promised to you if and when Maduro and his regime leave, what kind of support do you need to keep the country together to prevent another refugee crisis? And do you have that pledge from the American government now?",
      "MACHADO: We will need a lot of support, advice, information, technology, not only from the United States, also from multilateral organizations, some of which we are already working together. Not only in security issues but power supply, food supply. How do we bring, you know, put order in our financial accounts? How do we restructure our debt? How we open markets for international investment and give security to international investment in oil, in gas, in infrastructure, critical minerals? I mean, Venezuela is unique in terms of the amount of the natural endowments we have. And you know, we're located at three hours by plane from Florida. So it's hard to think, you know, in this shortening of the supply chains that is in the near-shoring process taking place a better ally in the region than Venezuela. And at the same time, you know, turning Venezuela from the criminal hub of the Americas into a security shield for the United States and for the rest of the region, is a top priority for all. So, you know, we have the plans ready. We have the teams ready. We know what we have to do the first 100 hours and the next 100 days. But most importantly, and I want to insist on this, we have the people. I mean, this is something that it's- I've heard once, over and over again all analysis leave the people on the side, when that's the most important force that we have right now. That's why we are where we are right now. And the Venezuelan people want to move ahead once we conquered democracy back, would have cost- has cost us so many lives, so many- so much pain, that you will see the country taking care of it. The people will be the main source of stability. But certainly we look forward for- to cooperation with our main allies. And of course, our main ally will be the United States of America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would that include US peacekeeping troops or other troops on the ground?",
      "MACHADO: I cannot answer that question right now. I don't think that's the case. There are other countries that have offered support as well in order to strengthen democratic institutions once the government-elect is in place, but that we will have to address that once we have the, you know, the government-elect in place and put in order, bringing order back to our country. And one thing that you mentioned before about the, you know, the refugee crisis, it's going to be exactly the country. The day Maduro goes, you will see 10s of 1000s, hundreds of 1000s of Venezuelan migrants coming back home from the United States and all over the world. I mean, our diaspora is desperate to go back to Venezuela. So even from that perspective, it is a win, win situation to have democracy in Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think it is safe for those Venezuelans in America to go back there now some temporary protected status was just revoked by the president for more than half a million Venezuelans here. Is it safe for them?",
      "MACHADO: Absolutely not. It will be safe once Maduro is gone, and every single citizen will be, you know, leaving freedom and respect in towards the law. We will bring back rule of law. We will liberate our political prisoners, and everybody will be free to speak out what they feel, what they think, what they want for the future, of their own future and their families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, we thank you for your time today, and we'll be watching.",
      "MACHADO: I thank you, Margaret, for this great opportunity, and God bless Venezuela. Venezuela will be free.",

    "published": "Sat, 13 Dec 2025 23:57:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Erika Kirk recalls the emotional fog of Charlie Kirk's assassination, addresses conspiracy theories and takes questions during a CBS News town hall hosted by Bari Weiss.",
    "story": [
      "Charlie Kirk transformed the American right through his nonprofit Turning Point USA before he was assassinated at an on-campus event in Utah three months ago. This week, his widow Erika, who now leads Turning Point, joined CBS News for a town hall where she reflected on grief, defended her husband's controversial comments and explained the \"game-time decision\" of publicly forgiving the man accused in her husband's murder.",
      "The conversation, moderated by CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss, is the first of many planned CBS News town halls and debates. Invited guests who joined the conversation included Utah Valley University student Hunter Kozak, who was the last person to speak to Charlie Kirk, and Robert Milgrim, the father of Israeli Embassy staffer Sarah Milgrim, who was shot and killed in May.",
      "Here are the highlights:",
      "Erika Kirk's message to people who sought to justify assassination: \"Tell that to my 3-year-old daughter\"",
      "Erika Kirk said anyone who sought to justify her husband's assassination is \"sick\" and said the internet has dehumanized people.",
      "\"He's a human being. You think he deserved that? Tell that to my 3-year-old daughter.\"",
      "She continued: \"You want to watch in high-res the video of my husband being murdered, and laugh, and say he deserves it? There's something very sick in your soul, and I'm praying that God saves you.\"",
      "Erika Kirk: Charlie never incited violence",
      "Charlie Kirk was known for his debates with college students, inviting them to step up to a microphone and \"prove me wrong.\"",
      "Erika Kirk said her husband encouraged people of different political beliefs and backgrounds to come to the front of the line, saying, \"'I'll put my mic down. Tell me why you believe that. That's interesting. I never thought of that. But have you thought of this?'\"",
      "A recent poll by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression and College Pulse found that 91% of undergraduates believe \"words can be violence.\" But Erika Kirk said her husband never incited violence: \"He never once said, 'Go after them because they're saying X, Y, Z and they deserve to die.'He gave them a microphone. He didn't take away a moment for them to speak back. He gave them a microphone. And what'd they do? They gave him a bullet in the neck. Totally different.\"",
      "She says her husband believed having conversations could save the world, referencing his new book, \"Stop, in the Name of God: Why Honoring the Sabbath Will Transform Your Life,\" which emphasizes that you can't communicate effectively with someone if you're not at peace with yourself.",
      "Erika Kirk: Charlie shouldn't be \"deteriorated\" to \"out-of-context\" clips",
      "Erika Kirk says some of her late husband's controversial comments, shared widely in the wake of his assassination, lacked context and that he should not \"be deteriorated\" to a few sentences.",
      "Weiss asked Erika Kirk about some of those much-shared comments: that some gun deaths are \"worth it\" to protect the Second Amendment; that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a mistake; and that if he sees a Black pilot, he's \"going to be like, boy, I hope he's qualified,\" while acknowledging \"that's not who I am, that's not what I believe.\"",
      "Erika Kirk said she'd love for people to watch the full clips instead of taking comments out of context.",
      "\"Charlie didn't care what skin color you were. He didn't care what religion you were. He loved excellence,\" she said, adding that \"his favorite word was 'earn'\u2026 He loved knowing that people worked hard to earn what they got.\"",
      "She said she didn't know the context of the \"gun deaths\" quote but said, \"There's a lot more there than just that one little sentence.\"",
      "\"My husband is not to be deteriorated to two sentences,\" she said. \"He's not. He is a thought leader, and he was brilliant of a man. So that's fine if you want to take words out of his mouth or out of context without the whole thing in perspective, but that's the problem.\"",
      "The last student to talk to Charlie Kirk asks: Will you condemn President Trump's rhetoric?",
      "Kozak was the last person to debate Charlie Kirk before he was shot. Since that day, Kozak \u2014 a self-professed liberal \u2014 has continued to call for civil political discourse. \"I think that one of the few things that we can agree on is this necessity for a conversation. I think that we need to remember that we still have to live with each other. That these are still our neighbors,\" he told \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Scott Pelley after the shooting.",
      "He attended the CBS News town hall, where he again took the microphone \u2014 this time, to ask Erika Kirk a question: \"Will you condemn the violent rhetoric of Donald Trump, the most powerful and influential person on earth?\"",
      "Kozak specifically referenced President Trump accusing six Democratic lawmakers of \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!\" and then reposting, \"HANG THEM, GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD!\" Top Democrats called for Mr. Trump to be \"condemned forcefully\" over the social media remarks.",
      "Erika Kirk didn't mention Mr. Trump by name in her response, saying the issue is \"so much deeper than one person\" and that it \"starts at the home.\"",
      "She urged parents to \"look in the mirror\" and reflect on how they're raising their children.",
      "\"You can choose to have evil in your heart or you can choose to have light,\" she said. \"What you consume and what you absorb from the outside world will manifest itself.\"",
      "Weiss asked: \"Do you think our political leaders have a responsibility to turn the temperature down right now?\"",
      "\"Well, I think everyone has a responsibility to do that, and I'm doing my part,\" Erika Kirk replied. \"I'm not in control of other people.\"",
      "Dad of Israeli Embassy staffer killed in shooting asks: Will you condemn antisemitism?",
      "Robert Milgrim, whose daughter Sarah was one of two victims of the Capitol Jewish Museum shooting in Washington, D.C., asked Erika Kirk: \"Will you here condemn the individuals spreading that hate and speak out clearly enough against antisemitism so we can prevent another tragedy?\"",
      "\"Hate is hate. It's evil,\" said Erika Kirk, adding that she and Charlie Kirk have always been \"very clear on our stance\" on Israel and the Jewish people.",
      "She said: \"What healing factor comes out of hating Jewish people? What healing factor comes out of hating Christians? What healing factor comes out? Hate in general. Nothing. Nothing. Charlie always would say very clearly, Jew hate was brain rot. He would always say it.\"",
      "Antisemitic incidents have increased nearly 900% in the U.S. over the past 10 years, according to a recent Anti-Defamation League audit.",
      "Erika Kirk's one-word message for Candace Owens",
      "Weiss asked Erika Kirk about Candace Owens, a former Turning Point USA employee and onetime friend of Charlie Kirk, who has recently been peddling conspiracy theories about his assassination. Owens has also made unfounded fraud allegations about the nonprofit \u2014 the Treasury Department last week confirmed that none of the tax-exempt entities Erika Kirk runs are under investigation by the IRS.",
      "What does Erika Kirk want to say to Owens and others making these unfounded claims?",
      "\"Stop. That's it. That's all I have to say. Stop.\"",
      "The \"game-time decision\" to forgive",
      "Erika Kirk stunned millions when she proclaimed at her husband's memorial service that she forgave her husband's accused killer.",
      "\"I forgive him because it's what Christ did and is what Charlie would do,\" she said in her powerful eulogy.",
      "She told Weiss that the moment was a \"game-time decision\" because she'd never say something she didn't mean.",
      "\"But am I gonna take that moment to say, 'Rally the troops, burn the city down, march in the streets?' Or am I gonna take that moment and unleash something like we talked about, even greater, more powerful and say, 'It's a revival.' And let that unleash, and let the Lord use it in ways that no one else could've ever imagined.\"",
      "Erika Kirk said she's not forgetting or condoning, but rather \"releasing myself from the enemy's hands where he could have a foothold in me.\"",
      "When asked if she had any words for his accused killer, she said: \"Nothing. I have nothing to say to you. Nothing.\"",
      "She added that there's a difference between forgiving someone and still wanting justice. \"We serve a just God, and I rest easy in knowing that. He's sovereign, but he's just. And so let the Lord handle that.\"",

      "The Feeding Our Future scandal, the\u00a0nation's largest COVID fraud scheme, has garnered renewed focus from the Trump administration, prompting a surge of federal immigration enforcement activity in Minnesota and fueling the talking points of his Republican gubernatorial challengers.",
      "In response to Walz's announcement on Friday, candidate and current GOP state Rep. Kristen Robbins said the governor's fraud prevention program \"should be his resignation.\"",
      "Republican State Sen. Jordan Rasmusson said, in response to the announced program, a \"statewide director of program integrity isn't something you need when your commissioners are doing their jobs well in the first place.\" Resmusson added that Minnesotans \"expect their government to provide vigorous oversight of our welfare programs.\"",
      "On Friday, Walz said Minnesota's \"generosity\" was \"taken advantage of by an organized group of fraudsters and criminals,\" and he'll \"take responsibility\" for the failures that led to the massive COVID relief funding theft, admitting his office \"should have been keeping Minnesotans more up to speed on what was happening.\"",
      "\"We have and have just like in COVID, just like in every other situation, I take full responsibility for it. I think, and I will acknowledge certainly to Minnesotans and to the press here, I don't think we've done a good enough job of communicating the hard work has been done,\" Walz said.",
      "He also said the \"guardrails were taken off\" by the federal government during the pandemic and \"the guidance was to move the money.\"",
      "\"Our goal was to make sure we were moving that money so that people ate, that they were housed, that they had vaccines, but it also opened up the door to relax the guardrails and to have fraud be committed,\" he said.",
      "While taking blame for the fraud scandal, Walz also said his attempt in 2021 to freeze funding for a Feeding Our Future-related organization was thwarted by the courts.",
      "\"I said, 'Don't pay them,' and they said, 'You can't do that, you don't have that authority.' I said, 'Do not pay them, let them sue me.' They did and they won, and we paid them, and then they got caught and went to jail after the fact,\" Walz said.",
      "Walz also defended his COVID policies that critics branded as draconian, leading to multiple \u2014 and ultimately unsuccessful \u2014 lawsuits, including over\u00a0mask mandates.",
      "\"I will not apologize for making Minnesota one of the safest states during COVID,\" he said.",
      "In September,\u00a0Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph H. Thompson said alongside the Feeding Our Future case, fraud connected to the state's Housing Stabilization Services and autism services \"has stolen billions of dollars in taxpayer money.\"",
      "Walz recently announced new audits on up to 14 social programs in Minnesota that officials consider \"high risk\" for fraud. An official at the state Department of Human Services told WCCO the inspector general's office is currently reviewing more than 1,300 reported cases of fraud in those programs, and has recovered some $50 million.",
      "Walz: Trump's targeting of Somalis is \"racially motivated\"",
      "President Trump's recent focus on Somali-American Minnesotans, whom he labeled \"garbage,\" appears to be tied to the Feeding Our Future case.",
      "There are now upwards of 80 defendants in the case, many of whom are of Somali descent, though the group's founder and alleged mastermind, Aimee Bock, is White. So far, 61 people have been convicted, with more investigations underway.",
      "U.S. Census Bureau data show more than 107,000 people identified as Somali across Minnesota, with more than 80,000 living in the Twin Cities.",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump called Minnesota a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity,\" with his administration now investigating whether stolen funds were funneled to the Somali-based al Qaeda affiliate Al Shabaab.",
      "And in recent weeks, the Department of Homeland Security has sent dozens of federal agents to Minnesota, specifically the Twin Cities, as part of \"Operation Metro Surge.\" Mr. Trump also previously ordered all green card holders from Somalia and more than a dozen other countries be reexamined, adding that he would\u00a0end the temporary protected status\u00a0for Somalis in Minnesota.",
      "On Friday, Walz said the president's actions do \"nothing to either address immigration\" or \"fraud.\"",
      "\"The absolute recklessness of doing some of this and the targeting of a specific community, unconscionable,\" Walz said. \"It is very specifically aimed and very racially motivated towards a Somali community that matters greatly here.\"",
      "Walz also applauded comments made by GOP state Sen. Jim Abeler, who recently wrote a letter to Mr. Trump rebuking his statements about Minnesota's Somali community.",
      "\"I'd like to acknowledge that just the basic decency, not a surprise to everybody in here has been, but Sen. Jim Abeler's willingness to stand up, and note that it should be the simplest thing in the world,\" Walz said. \"When the president of the United States calls an entire group of people garbage and our state garbage and a hellhole, to just disavow that, you can still be very conservative.\"",
      "High-end cars, luxury vacations, overseas transfers",
      "Newly released evidence also gives the clearest look yet at how the Feeding Our Future fraudsters blew through hundreds of millions of dollars meant to feed Minnesota children during the pandemic.",
      "CBS News obtained dozens of trial exhibits, and they reveal luxury vacations, high-end cars and overseas transfers, all funded by taxpayer dollars meant to feed kids in need.",
      "Photos and documents show fraudsters booking over-water villas in the Maldives, buying gold jewelry in Dubai and sending stacks of cash overseas.",
      "Some defendants purchased lakefront property in Minnesota, first-class airline tickets and luxury cars.",
      "U.S. Attorney Daniel N. Rosen said it's more evidence that the main driver for the fraud was greed.",
      "\"Massive. Order of magnitude larger than just about any fraud that's ever been prosecuted in the United States,\" he said. \"What we can say from that enormous volume of evidence is that the predominant motive of all of these individuals was their self-enrichment and their self-indulgence. And that's where they spent the money overwhelmingly.\"",

      "But the plan does not include an extension to the Affordable Care Act subsidies. Instead, Republican leaders will allow a vote on an amendment to the plan that would include an extension to those expiring tax credits, according to a GOP leadership aide.",
      "The move is aimed at appeasing\u00a0moderate Republicans who are trying to force votes, through what is known as a discharge petition, on separate pieces of legislation to extend the tax credits for one to two years with reforms.",
      "An extension has split the party, with those opposed saying the subsidies are rife with fraud and high-income households shouldn't qualify.",
      "Democrats have pushed a three-year extension without reforms \u2014 a nonstarter with Republicans.",
      "The Republican plan released Friday includes a provision to expand association health plans, in which multiple employers band together to purchase coverage and lower the costs of benefits. Another provision would provide funding for cost-sharing reduction payments meant to lower premiums for some Affordable Care Act enrollees. The proposal would also require more transparency from pharmacy benefit managers in an effort to lower drug costs.",
      "\"While Democrats demand that taxpayers write bigger checks to insurance companies to hide the cost of their failed law, House Republicans are tackling the real drivers of health care costs to provide affordable care, increase access and choice, and restore integrity to our nation's health care system for all Americans,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said in a statement.",

    "published": "Fri, 12 Dec 2025 20:13:52 -0500",
    "summary": "The move represents a thawing of sorts in the frosty relationship between the Trump administration and the Brazilian government.",
    "story": [
      "The United States removed Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes from its sanctions list on Friday after initially adding him over his role in leading the trial against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.",
      "De Moraes' wife and the Lex Institute, which she leads, were also taken off the list, according to documents from the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control. Brazil's government celebrated the move, which came after a weekend phone conversation between President Trump and Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.",
      "The Trump administration had sanctioned the judge in July, accusing him of using his position to authorize arbitrary pretrial detentions and suppress freedom of expression in Brazil.",
      "In August 2024, de Moraes also ordered that Elon Musk's X platform be suspended in Brazil over allegations it was not doing enough to target misinformation. The ban on the site was lifted two months later. At the time, Musk was a major ally of Mr. Trump and was helping finance his presidential campaign.",
      "A senior Trump administration official said the sanctions were lifted since the U.S. saw the passage of an important amnesty bill by Brazil's lower house as a signal that lawfare conditions in Brazil are improving. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the administration's views on foreign policy interests.",
      "The move represents a thawing of sorts in the frosty relationship between the two governments and follows a number of meetings and calls that both have described in positive terms. Mr. Trump had seen Lula's predecessor Bolsonaro as an ally, with the Brazilian leader even dubbed the \"Trump of the Tropics\" when he came into office.",
      "During Bolsonaro's trial, Mr. Trump called his treatment an \"international disgrace.\" In a\u00a0July 9 letter\u00a0to Lula posted to social media, Mr. Trump said the trial was a \"witch hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!\"",
      "And in announcing de Moraes' sanction in July, Secretary of State Marco Rubio alleged that the judge had \"abused his authority by engaging in a targeted and politically motivated effort designed to silence political critics through the issuance of secret orders compelling online platforms, including U.S. social media companies, to ban the accounts of individuals for posting protected speech. Moraes further abused his position to authorize unjust pre-trial detentions and undermine freedom of expression.\"",
      "Bolsonaro was accused of masterminding a plot to stay in power despite his 2022 election defeat to Lula.",
      "He was convicted and sentenced to more than 27 years in prison. The embattled 70-year-old leader started serving his sentence last month while still requesting to be put on house arrest due to his poor health. The massive upheaval his allies expected upon his arrest did not materialize, though he remains a politically powerful figure ahead of next year's elections.",
      "Brazil's current government characterized the lifting of sanctions as a \"big defeat\" for Bolsonaro's family.",
      "\"It was Lula who put this repeal [of the sanctions] on Donald Trump's desk, in a dignifying and sovereign dialogue,\" said Gleisi Hoffmann, Brazil's minister for institutional relations. \"It is a big defeat for the family of Jair Bolsonaro, traitors who have conspired against Brazil and the judiciary.\"",
      "Lula's leftist administration has long accused Eduardo Bolsonaro, a lawmaker and son of the former president, of misleading Mr. Trump on de Moraes and other members of the court. Eduardo Bolsonaro said he received the news of the sanctions being lifted from de Moraes \"with regret.\"",
      "The younger Bolsonaro, who announced in March that he would start living in the U.S. in order to lobby the Trump administration to help his father avoid jail, said he would continue to fight for Jair Bolsonaro.",
      "\"The lack of internal cohesion and the insufficient support for initiatives pursued abroad contributed to the worsening of the current situation,\" Eduardo Bolsonaro wrote on his social media channels, after Mr. Trump's reversal. \"We sincerely hope that President Donald Trump's decision will be successful in defending the strategic interests of the American people, as is his duty.\"",
      "In initially sanctioning de Moraes, the Treasury Department had cited the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which targets perpetrators of human rights abuse and corrupt officials. De Moraes said the use of the act against him was \"illegal and regrettable.\"",
      "Also in July, the Trump administration imposed a 40% tariff on Brazilian products on top of a 10% tariff imposed earlier, justifying the tariffs by saying that Brazil's policies and criminal prosecution of Bolsonaro constituted an economic emergency.",
      "However, last month the White House announced it was removing the 40% tariffs on certain Brazilian imports, including beef and coffee. The U.S. ran a $6.8 billion trade surplus last year with Brazil, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "Mr. Trump and Lula started mending fences at the United Nations' General Assembly in September, which was followed by their first private meeting in Malaysia in October and subsequent phone conversations.",
      "The Brazilian president has said he wasn't only trying to reverse the increase on tariffs but also to end the sanctions on de Moraes and some members of his government who were also hit by the measure.",
      "Separately, Lula has urged Latin American states to help avoid a conflict in Venezuela as the Trump administration orders military action against vessels allegedly linked to drug cartels.",

      "\"We're delighted to be joined today by true legends of American sports history, heroes for the entire nation, the 1980 U.S. Olympic ice hockey team,\" the president said after signing the bill. \"This was one of the biggest moments that I've ever seen in sports, and I like sports. These are the men who gave us one of the most storied athletic wins of all time, it's called the miracle on ice, and I guess that's what it was.\"",
      "The event in the Oval Office featured hockey stars from the gold medal-winning team, including captain Mike Eruzione, goaltender Jim Craig and forward Buzz Schneider. The family of deceased coach Herb Brooks also attended. CBS News was first to report that the 1980 team would be present for the signing. The players gave the president a hat similar to the ones they wore ahead of the 1980 game.",
      "\"President Trump will honor the legendary Olympic men's ice hockey team whose 'Miracle on Ice' resulted in a historic and symbolic victory against the Soviet Union,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said ahead of the signing. \"This triumph fueled a resurgence of national pride as Americans across the country watched Team USA unexpectedly take home the Gold Medal.\"",
      "The 1980 game \u2014 held in Lake Placid, New York \u2014 pitted the U.S. against the Soviet Union, a Cold War archrival and hockey powerhouse that had won gold in the prior four Winter Olympics.",

      "Washington \u2014 Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado appears to be open to U.S. military action in her country to help oust President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "\"I will welcome more and more pressure so that Maduro understands that he has to go, that his time is over,\" the Nobel Peace Prize winner said in an interview Friday with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"I will insist something that I've said several times before, this is not conventional regime change. This cannot be compared to other cases, like countries in the Middle East.\"",
      "\"We had an election,\" she continued. \"Regime change was already mandated by over 70% of the population, and what we need is support to enforce that decision.\"",
      "When Machado was asked how she squares military action with receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, Machado said \"in order to maintain freedom and to achieve freedom, you do need strength.\"",
      "\"What we're fighting for is precisely freedom in order to have democracy, and democracy in order to have peace,\" she said.",
      "Maduro is facing increasing pressure from the Trump administration to relinquish his power. President Trump has threatened land strikes as the U.S. has built up its military forces in the region and has conducted more than 20 strikes on suspected drug smuggling boats in the region. The Trump administration has defended the threats and actions as necessary to stop drugs from being smuggled into the U.S.",
      "Machado said she did not have details on Mr. Trump's threats of land strikes.",

    "story": [
      "Doral, Florida \u2014 The admiral overseeing U.S. military forces in South America relinquished command Friday, as the U.S. continues its buildup of ships and military assets off Venezuela and carries out strikes against alleged drug boats.",
      "\"We have worked hard and tirelessly to build relationships and understand requirements across the region,\" Adm. Alvin Holsey said during a relinquishment of command ceremony at U.S. Southern Command Headquarters on Friday. \"That work must continue across the whole government to deliver at the point of need to respond to shared threats in our neighborhood \u2014 the time is now.\"",
      "Holsey, who has served in the Navy for 37 years, stepped down as the head of U.S. Southern Command after announcing in October he'd retire early, just one year into what is typically a three-year term leading a combatant command. He gave no reason, but at the time, CBS News reported there had been tensions between Holsey and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth over deployment decisions in the Caribbean.",
      "During Friday's ceremony, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine awarded Holsey the Defense Distinguished Service Medal with a citation signed by Secretary Hegseth.",
      "In remarks, Caine thanked Holsey and his whole family, saying, \"know how deeply, deeply grateful we are as a nation and as a joint force for all you've done for us.\"",
      "Holsey transferred his duties to Air Force Lt. Gen. Evan Lamar Pettus in the ceremony. Pettus will serve as acting commander of U.S. Southern Command until the Pentagon sends a nomination to the Senate to be confirmed.",
      "U.S. Southern Command has been leading the ongoing strike campaign named \"Operation Southern Spear\" that has destroyed 23 alleged drug boats with military strikes, killing 87 people.",
      "The campaign has come under increased scrutiny from lawmakers because of a controversial \"double tap\" strike on Sept. 2 that killed two survivors. The commander who ordered the second strike, Admiral Mitch Bradley of U.S. Special Operations Command, has conducted several briefings in the past two weeks with small groups of lawmakers to walk through his decision. He briefed House Speaker Mike Johnson Thursday, and the House speaker said after the briefing and a review of the strike video said the operation was conducted in a way that was \"entirely appropriate.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Holsey gave a virtual briefing to the chair and ranking member of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee before officially transferring his duties on Friday. Ranking Member Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island told CBS News Holsey said it was a personal decision to retire early, and even after the briefing, Reed said that \"we have still, I think, many more questions.\"",
      "It's not just the boat strikes that have piqued Congress' interest. Lawmakers also have questions about why there is an expanding military buildup in the region. The U.S. now has about 15,000 forces in the Caribbean between warships, including the world's largest aircraft carrier the USS Gerald R. Ford, and on bases in Puerto Rico. It's the largest U.S. military presence there in decades.",
      "The buildup appears to be part of the Trump administration's ongoing pressure campaign against Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro. Earlier this week with the support of the military, the U.S. Coast Guard seized a sanctioned oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela. President Trump has intimated that strikes inside Venezuela could be next.",
      "Holsey assumed leadership of U.S. Southern Command in November 2024. During his tenure, the command expanded from roughly 3,500 personnel to nearly 15,000 personnel in direct support of operations in the region, according to a release from U.S. Southern Command that honors Holsey's career.",
      "In the last fiscal year, which ended in September, the command disrupted or seized more than a million pounds of cocaine, worth more than $11.34 billion. The release makes no specific mention of Operation Southern Spear.",
      "Holsey is the latest of over a dozen senior military officers who have either been fired by Hegseth or who retired early since the beginning of the Trump administration.",

    "published": "Fri, 12 Dec 2025 12:46:59 -0500",
    "summary": "A ruling striking down emergency levies could force the federal government to return most of the tariff revenue it has collected this year, according to Penn Wharton.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. government could owe businesses as much as $168 billion if the Supreme Court rules that the Trump administration improperly invoked a federal emergency powers law earlier this year in hitting dozens of countries with new tariffs, according to a recent analysis.",
      "Through December 5, the U.S. government has collected $259 billion in tariff revenue, the nonpartisan research initiative found. But a ruling by the high court that Mr. Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose the country-specific tariffs could force the government to offer refunds to importers, said Kent Smetters, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.",
      "In a November hearing on the case,\u00a0the Supreme Court seemed divided\u00a0over whether Mr. Trump had the legal authority to impose sweeping levies under IEEPA. Several justices appeared skeptical, noting that IEEPA does not mention the word \"tariff\" and that no president has ever relied on the act to justify broad-based tariffs on other nations.",
      "The Trump administration could likely maintain similar\u00a0tariff rates by drawing on other laws\u00a0if the IEEPA tariffs are struck down, although those statutes have more restrictions, according to legal experts.",
      "For example, Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allows the U.S. president to restrict imports in the name of national security. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 also authorizes the president to apply country-based tariffs if the U.S. Trade Representative determines that another nation is engaging in unfair trade practices.",
      "Despite the prospects of a large government refund for importers, Smetters thinks that striking down the tariffs would ultimately spur U.S. economic growth.",
      "\"Tariffs are one of the least efficient ways of raising revenue,\" he told CBS News, adding that tariffs make companies less productive because they have to pay more for imported parts and products.",
      "\"The government would have to come up with that money, so the federal debt would go up a little bit. But if these tariffs really were to go away, it would make U.S. companies more attractive to invest in,\" Smetters added.",
      "The Trump administration says tariffs are a key tool for energizing the U.S. manufacturing sector, boosting job growth, reducing the nation's trade deficit and generating federal revenue.",
      "\"The economic and national security consequences of the failure to uphold President Trump's lawful tariffs are enormous. The White House looks forward to the Supreme Court's speedy and proper resolution of this matter,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Too little, too late?",
      "As of November 17, the overall effective tariff rate in the U.S. was 16.8%, the highest since 1935,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Yale Budget Lab. That compares with 2.4% in January before Mr. Trump returned to office.",
      "As a result, some small businesses say a tariff refund wouldn't offset the damage they say has been caused by sharply higher import duties.",
      "\"The money would go back to suppliers that incurred the tariffs. We are the end customer, and we continue to get the short end of the stick,\" Trinita Rhodes, the owner of Beauty Supply Refresh in Florissant, Missouri, said Wednesday in a media call hosted by Tariffs Cost US, an advocacy group that opposes Mr. Trump's levies.",
      "Rachel Lutz, owner of a women's clothing boutique, The Peacock Room, in Detroit, said a potential tariff refund would come too late.",
      "\"Small businesses don't have more than a 30-day cash reserve,\" he said in the Tariffs Cost US call. \"Reimbursement at this point doesn't make up for the disruption of staff cuts or hiring we could have made. The damage has already been done.\"",
      "Consumers are also feeling the impact of tariffs, research shows. Between February and November, U.S. households paid an average of $1,197.50 in tariffs, totaling nearly $160 billion, according to a\u00a0report this month from Democrats on the U.S. Congressional Joint Economic Committee.",
      "\"While President Trump promised that he would lower costs, this report shows that his tariffs have done nothing but drive prices even higher for families,\" Sen. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat from New Hampshire and ranking member of the Joint Economic Committee, said in a statement Thursday. \"At a time when both parties should be working together to lower costs, the President's tax on American families is simply making things more expensive.\"",

      "President Trump said Thursday evening he is granting a pardon to Tina Peters, a former Colorado county clerk who is serving a nine-year state sentence\u00a0for allowing unauthorized access to voting machines \u2014 even though the president's pardon power is widely understood to only apply to federal crimes.",
      "\"Democrats have been relentless in their targeting of TINA PETERS, a Patriot who simply wanted to make sure that our Elections were Fair and Honest,\" the president claimed on Truth Social, though Peters was prosecuted by an elected Republican district attorney. \"Tina is sitting in a Colorado prison for the 'crime' of demanding Honest Elections.\"",
      "Mr. Trump claimed Peters was trying to \"expose Voter Fraud\" in 2020. The president has long insisted, without evidence, that he lost the 2020 race due to fraud, claims that were promoted by Peters, a onetime candidate for Colorado secretary of state.",
      "Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold said in a statement Thursday that \"Tina Peters was convicted by a jury of her peers for state crimes in a state Court. Trump has no constitutional authority to pardon her. His assault is not just on our democracy, but on states' rights and the American constitution.\"",
      "\"One of the most basic principles of our constitution is that states have independent sovereignty and manage our own criminal justice systems without interference from the federal government,\" Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said in a separate statement. \"The idea that a president could pardon someone tried and convicted in state court has no precedent in American law, would be an outrageous departure from what our constitution requires, and will not hold up.\"",
      "A former Mesa County clerk, Peters was convicted in state court last year on seven charges, including three counts of attempting to influence a public servant and one count of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation. She was sentenced\u00a0in October 2024.",
      "Prosecutors have alleged that in 2021, Peters and others \"devised and executed a deceptive scheme\" to cause an unauthorized person to access Mesa County voting machines. Images from the county's voting equipment later showed up online. Prosecutors said that Peters \u2014 who was aligned with national figures who have falsely claimed that voting machines were rigged in 2020 \u2014 became \"fixated\" on alleged voting problems.",
      "At a sentencing hearing late last year, Judge Matthew Barrett called Peters a \"charlatan\" and \"as defiant as a defendant as this court has ever seen.\" Peters has denied wrongdoing, and she insisted before her sentencing that she had \"never done anything with malice to break the law.\"",
      "Earlier this week, a federal magistrate judge rejected Peters' request to be released while she appeals her conviction.",
      "\"Tina Peters was convicted by a jury of her peers, prosecuted by a Republican District Attorney and in a Republican county of Colorado and found guilty of violating Colorado state laws including criminal impersonation,\" Democratic Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement Thursday. \"No President has jurisdiction over state law nor the power to pardon a person for state convictions. This is a matter for the courts to decide, and we will abide by court orders.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has taken an interest in Peters' case, warning in August that he would take \"harsh measures\" if she wasn't let out of state custody. The Federal Bureau of Prisons asked the state of Colorado last month to transfer her to federal custody, drawing pushback from state officials and calls for Polis to deny the request.",
      "Meanwhile, an attorney representing Peters argued in a letter\u00a0last week that Mr. Trump may have the power to pardon the former Mesa County clerk.",
      "Under the Constitution, the president's pardon power applies to \"Offences against the United States,\" which is almost universally understood not to include state crimes. But Peters' lawyer, Peter Ticktin, laid out a theory that the power could extend to the states. Ticktin acknowledged that the issue \"has never been raised in any court.\"",
      "In a statement late Thursday, Ticktin thanked Mr. Trump and argued that Peters \"needs to be released while the issues are being resolved,\" including while courts weigh whether she should be released due to the president's pardon.",
      "\"I am greatly thankful for President Trump,\" Ticktin said in an email to CBS News. \"He has always been true to his beliefs and continues to fight against injustice. God bless our President.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "Mr. Trump has intervened on behalf of others who back his false election fraud claims. Shortly after his inauguration in January, Mr. Trump offered pardons or commutations to everybody convicted in the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021.",

    "story": [
      "A leading U.S. senator is calling on federal regulators to share the results of an investigation into the dialysis industry, where critics say a \"duopoly\" has compromised the quality of critical, lifesaving kidney care.",
      "Two companies now own nearly 75% of all U.S. dialysis clinics \u2014 nearly 5,600 in total, a CBS News investigation reported earlier this year. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, said in an interview with CBS News he is troubled by the \"hallmarks of unlawful abuse of market power.\"",
      "\"The government may feel it has no leverage against two companies that provide for almost all the dialysis treatment in the country,\" Blumenthal said in an interview with CBS News. \"But it has failed to use more leverage, including its antitrust powers against those companies.\"",
      "The FTC, which polices the business world for anti-competitive conduct, had been probing whether the two companies' lock on the market impacted patient care, Blumenthal said, but any findings have not been made public. Blumenthal said he has requested the agency \"take appropriate robust enforcement action to remediate issues it has identified and protect patients, including veterans, from misconduct by these companies.\"",
      "Roughly 500,000 Americans depend on dialysis to stay alive as they wait and hope for a kidney transplant. The centers, where patients come to have their blood filtered offer\u00a0 the only available remedy for most suffering from end-stage kidney disease. Critics of the industry allege the leading companies that provide that care, Fresenius and DaVita, have become too focused on profits.",
      "\"This is emergency room care done in the mall,\" said Tom Mueller, the author of \"How to Make a Killing: Blood, Death and Dollars in American Medicine,\" who spent more than five years studying the dialysis industry. \"People are not given the tailored treatment that they need.\"",
      "The companies have for three decades been creeping towards \"a duopoly,\" according to Ryan McDevitt, a Duke University economist who spoke to CBS News earlier this year about the issue.",
      "\"This is the most concentrated health care sector across the entire U.S.,\" McDevitt said.",
      "The CBS News review of federal data found one-third of dialysis clinics failed to meet federal standards this year \u2014 nearly 2,500 of the roughly 7,600 clinics nationwide. The average score was 60 out of 100 possible points.",
      "In separate statements to CBS News, both companies highlighted their performance, saying the data reflects a track record of \"exemplary care.\"",
      "McDevitt argued that Medicare's limits on how much it reimburses clinics per patient have incentivized DaVita and Fresenius to focus on filling chairs to increase their profit margins. Both companies reject that characterization.",
      "Last year alone, DaVita delivered more than 29 million dialysis treatments, earning $391 in revenue per session, and Davita and Fresenius reported a total of $33.7 billion in revenue.",
      "McDevitt said his research found that over the last twenty years, when independent clinics are acquired by DaVita or Fresenius, their transplant referrals drop by about 10%, their patient survival rates fall by 2%, hospitalizations increase by 5%, and infection rates go up by about 12%.",
      "Criticism of the industry has been disputed by the two for-profit companies. Fresenius told CBS News in a statement this summer that the company maintains an \"unwavering focus on improving quality of life, strengthening clinical outcomes, and extending the lifespan of those we have the privilege to serve.\" DaVita said in a statement that its \"dedicated clinicians consistently deliver high-quality, individualized care in a complex clinical and regulatory environment.\"",
      "For years, health surveyors from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have conducted routine monitoring of dialysis clinics to assess their performance.",
      "Since 2013, those officials have cited U.S. dialysis centers for more than 115,000 deficiencies, including poor hand hygiene, unsanitary conditions while handling IV medications, and inadequate training.",
      "Fresenius noted that more than 65% of its dialysis centers received three stars or higher on Medicare's five-star scale \u2014 a rate the company said is higher than the national average of all U.S. dialysis providers. The company also said its employees \"take immense pride in providing best-in-class, high-quality care to our patients.\"",
      "DaVita said in a statement to CBS News that problems in clinics were \"rare and isolated\" and represent \"exceptions and do not reflect the exemplary care we consistently provide.\"",
      "\"We take every concern seriously, and if we make an error, we work immediately to resolve it,\" DaVita said in its statement. \"To mischaracterize such anomalies as systemic care failures is reckless, fear-mongering, and puts patient well-being at risk.\"",
      "Blumenthal noted that one group that has seen greater reliance on the for-profit clinics are those who served in the American military. Some 40,000 veterans depend on dialysis to stay alive as they wait and hope for a kidney transplant, the only available remedy for those suffering from end-stage kidney disease.",
      "In his letter to FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson, Blumenthal called on the agency to \"take appropriate robust enforcement action to remediate issues it has identified and protect patients, including veterans, from misconduct by these companies.\"",
      "\"This industry is ripe with predatory, monopolistic potential practices,\" Blumenthal alleged in the letter, adding that the \"anti-competitive anti consumer situation, and it cries out for the kind of investigation that the FTC would do.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Fresenius said, \"We are aware of the inquiry and are fully cooperating with the FTC. As this is an ongoing investigation, we cannot comment any further.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 09 Dec 2025 07:31:59 -0500",
    "summary": "Paleontologists have discovered and documented 16,600 footprints left by theropods, the dinosaur group that includes the Tyrannosaurus rex.",
    "story": [
      "Legend once had it that the huge, three-toed footprints scattered across the central highlands of Bolivia came from supernaturally strong monsters - capable of sinking their claws even into solid stone.",
      "Then scientists came here in the 1960s and dispelled children's fears, determining that the strange footprints in fact belonged to gigantic, two-legged dinosaurs that stomped and splashed over 60 million years ago, in the ancient waterways of what is now Toro Toro, a village and popular national park in the Bolivian Andes.",
      "Now, a team of paleontologists, mostly from California's Loma Linda University, have discovered and meticulously documented 16,600 such footprints left by theropods, the dinosaur group that includes the Tyrannosaurus rex. Their study, based on six years of regular field visits and published last Wednesday in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS One, reports that this finding represents the highest number of theropod footprints recorded anywhere in the world.",
      "\"There's no place in the world where you have such a big abundance of (theropod) footprints,\" said Roberto Biaggi, a co-author of the study led by Spanish paleontologist Ra\u00fal Esperante. \"We have all these world records at this particular site.\"",
      "Prints record dinosaur behavior \u2014 including attempts to swim",
      "The dinosaurs that ruled the earth and roamed this region also made awkward attempts to swim here, according to the study, scratching at what was squishy lake-bottom sediment to leave another 1,378 traces.",
      "The longest swim trackway studied by the researchers measured over 130 meters in length. \"To date, it remains the longest exposed swim trackway in the world,\" the authors write in the study.",
      "They pressed their claws into the mud just before water levels rose and sealed their tracks, protecting them from centuries of erosion, scientists said.",
      "\"The preservation of many of the tracks is excellent,\" said Richard Butler, a paleontologist at the University of Birmingham who was not involved in the research. He said that, to his knowledge, the number of footprints and trackways found in Toro Toro had no precedent.",
      "\"This is a remarkable window into the lives and behaviors of dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous,\" Butler added, referring to the period around 66 million years ago at the end of which an asteroid impact abruptly extinguished all dinosaurs and 75% of living species along with them, according to scientists.",
      "Footprints face preservation threats",
      "Although they've survived for millions of years, human life has threatened these traces. For decades, farmers threshed corn and wheat on the footprint-covered plateaus. Nearby quarry workers didn't think much of the formations as they blasted rock layers for limestone. And just two years ago, researchers said, highway crews tunneling through hillsides nearly wiped out a major site of dinosaur tracks before the national park intervened.",
      "Such disturbances may have something to do with the area's striking absence of dinosaur bones, teeth and eggs, experts say. For all of the footprints and swim traces found across Bolivia's Toro Toro, there are virtually no skeletal remains of the sort that litter the peaks and valleys of Argentine Patagonia and Campanha in Brazil.",
      "But the lack of bones could have natural causes, too. The team said the quantity and pattern of tracks - and the fact they were all found in the same sediment layer - suggest that dinosaurs didn't settle in what is now Bolivia as much as trudge along an ancient coastal superhighway stretching from southern Peru into northwest Argentina.",
      "The range in footprint sizes indicated that giant creatures roughly 10 meters (33 feet) tall moved in a herd with tiny theropods the size of a chicken, 32 centimeters (1 foot) tall at the hip.",
      "In presenting a snapshot of everyday behavior footprints \"reveal what skeletons cannot,\" said Anthony Romilio, a paleontologist at the University of Queensland in Australia who also did not participate in the study. Just from footprints, researchers can tell when dinosaurs strolled or sped up, stopped or turned around.",
      "It's not clear why so many dinosaurs roamed the site",
      "But the reason they flocked in droves to this wind-swept plateau remains a mystery.",
      "\"It may have been that they were all regular visitors to a large, ancient, freshwater lake, frequenting its expansive muddy shoreline,\" offered Romilio.",
      "Biaggi suggested that they were \"running away from something or searching for somewhere to settle.\"",
      "What's certain is that research into this treasure trove of a dinosaur tracksite will continue.",
      "\"I suspect that this will keep going over the years and many more footprints will be found right there at the edges of what's already uncovered,\" Biaggi said.",
      "Recent dinosaur footprint discoveries",
      "Researchers have unearthed other dinosaur footprints recently.",
      "In March, scientists in England discover a 650 foot trail of dinosaur footprints made 160 million years ago by massive sauropod dinosaurs.",
      "In January, British researchers unearthed some 200 dinosaur footprints dating back 166 million years in a find believed to be biggest in the United Kingdom. \"This is one of the most impressive track sites I've ever seen, in terms of scale, in terms of the size of the tracks,\" said Prof Kirsty Edgar, a micropaleontologist from the University of Birmingham,\u00a0told BBC News. \"You can step back in time and get an idea of what it would have been like, these massive creatures just roaming around, going about their own business.\"",
      "That discovery was announced just a few months after a team of paleontologists found\u00a0matching dinosaur footprints\u00a0on what are now two different continents, separated by thousands of miles of ocean.",
      "In October 2023, engineers in the U.K. made a\u00a0\"dramatic discovery\"\u00a0of dinosaur footprints that experts believe could be from a mantellisaurus, a type of dinosaur that had just three toes on each foot and traveled on its hind legs.",

    "published": "Fri, 12 Dec 2025 14:41:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Super-Earth TOI-561b is about 40 times closer to its host star than Mercury is to the sun.",
    "story": [
      "A rocky exoplanet outside the Earth's solar system may have an atmosphere, according to new evidence gathered by NASA researchers.",
      "The exoplanet, known as super-Earth TOI-561b, was discovered in 2020, according to NASA. Scientists have determined that the planet is ultra-hot, with a low density. It is about 1.4 times wider than Earth and orbits the sun in about 11 hours. Its host star is similar to Earth's sun in size and temperature, but the exoplanet is 40 times closer to that star than Mercury is to the sun, NASA said in a news release. Observations suggest the exoplanet has a global magma ocean and that it is surrounded by a thick layer of gas.",
      "The exoplanet's low density has surprised and baffled scientists, NASA said. It may have an unusual composition from planets in Earth's solar system. It could also be surrounded by a thick atmosphere, which would not be expected on an exoplanet with these features. But the James Webb Space Telescope helped scientists gather data that showed that unlikely scenario might be the case.",
      "Researchers used the telescope's Near-Infrared Spectrograph to measure the exoplanet's dayside temperature. If the exoplanet has no atmosphere, scientists estimated its dayside temperature would be about 4,900 degrees Fahrenheit. But the spectrograph found TOI-561b's temperature closer to 3,200 degrees Fahrenheit, far cooler than expected.",
      "Just determining the temperature of the exoplanet doesn't confirm if there is an atmosphere there, NASA said. The magma ocean could cause heat to circulate, or a thin layer of rock vapor could help cool the planet. But neither of those options is likely to account for the difference between the measured temperatures and what scientists expected.",
      "\"We really need a thick volatile-rich atmosphere to explain all the observations,\" said Anjali Piette, a researcher from England's University of Birmingham and a co-author of a study published Thursday that detailed the discoveries.",
      "Piette said an atmosphere would allow gases like water vapor to absorb some wavelengths of light, keeping the telescope's spectrograph from measuring them actually. The exoplanet may also have bright silicate clouds that can reflect starlight to cool the atmosphere, Piette said.",
      "Scientists suspect there may be some form of equilibrium between the exoplanet's atmosphere and its magma ocean, said study co-author Tim Lichtenberg, a researcher from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.",
      "\"At the same time that gases are coming out of the planet to feed the atmosphere, the magma ocean is sucking them back into the interior,\" Lichtenberg said. \"This planet must be much, much more volatile-rich than Earth to explain the observations. It's really like a wet lava ball.\"",
      "Scientists will learn more about TOI-561b as they study a data set gathered by the Webb telescope after it observed the exoplanet for more than 37 hours. The work will involve mapping the exoplanet's temperature and learning what its atmosphere may be made of.",
      "\"What's really exciting is that this new data set is opening up even more questions than it's answering,\" said Johanna Teske, the paper's lead author and a staff scientist at the Carnegie Science Earth and Planets Laboratory.",

      "A black hole inside a distant spiral galaxy is devouring material from the universe around it and creating winds at speeds never before seen by astronomers.",
      "The European Space Agency said that the black hole inside NGC 3783 has the mass of 30 million suns. The black hole consumes nearby material to power an active galactic nucleus at the center of the galaxy, the ESA said in a news release. The nucleus is \"an extremely bright and active region\" that sends out powerful jets and winds, the agency said.",

      "\"We've not watched a black hole create winds this speedily before,\" said Liyi Gu at Space Research Organisation Netherlands (SRON), in a statement. Gu led the international research team. \"For the first time, we've seen how a rapid burst of X-ray light from a black hole immediately triggers ultra-fast winds, with these winds forming in just a single day.\"",
      "Researcher Matteo Guainazzi said the winds around the black hole were created as the nucleus' tangled magnetic field suddenly untwisted, creating something similar to the coronal mass ejections that erupt from the sun \"but on a scale almost too big to imagine.\"",
      "The similarity between black holes and the sun makes \"these mysterious objects seem a little less alien,\" the ESA said. Project scientist Erik Kuulkers said the discovery \"suggests that solar and high-energy physics may work in surprisingly familiar ways throughout the universe.\"",
      "Winds from active galactic nuclei play a role in how the galaxies they are situated within develop, said ESA research fellow Camille Diez. Learning more about the nuclei and how they behave will lead to a better understanding of space, Diez said.",

      "Enduring re-entry temperatures of some 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit -- and rapidly decelerating in the process -- the Soyuz descent module, suspended beneath a large orange-and-white parachute, landed at 12:03 a.m. EST Tuesday (0503 UTC, 10:03am local time in Kazakhstan) and tipped over on its side.",
      "Braving frigid sub-freezing weather, Russian recovery crews and NASA support personnel quickly reached the charred spacecraft, opening the Soyuz's hatch, extracting the crew and making initial medical checks as the trio began re-adjusting to gravity.",
      "Briefly resting in a nearby recliner as is traditional for returning  Soyuz crew members, Kim appeared healthy and in good spirits, smiling  his thanks after Russian recovery crews presented him with a nested  matryoshka doll with his face painted on the outermost shell.",
      "After  more detailed medical checks inside a heated inflatable tent, the crew was to be flown by helicopter to  the town of Dzhezkazgan where Kim planned to board a NASA jet for the long  flight home to the Johnson Space Center in Houston. Ryzhikov and  Zubritsky will head for Star City near Moscow for debriefings and  reunions with family members.",
      "Left behind aboard the space station were NASA Crew 11 fliers Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and cosmonaut Oleg Platonov.",
      "Also on board: Soyuz MS-28/74S commander Sergey Kud-Sverchkov, flight engineer Sergei Mikaev and NASA astronaut Christopher Williams. They arrived at the space station on Nov. 27 to replace Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim.",
      "During a change-of-command ceremony on Sunday, Kim said what he will remember most from his eight months in space is \"the bond that we shared together.\"",
      "\"I firmly believe that the greatest quality of an astronaut, and a human, is not technical competence, or loyalty, or any of the myriad other things we like to ascribe to astronauts. It's love,\" he said. \"We always gave each other grace and had so much love for each other and everyone who supports us. I think that is what makes space exploration possible.\"",
      "During their stay aboard the space station, Kim and his crewmates traveled 104 million miles over 3,920 orbits. Kim focused on research and maintenance in the U.S. segment of the station while Ryzhikov and Zubritsky carried out two spacewalks.",
      "The son of South Korean immigrants and a father of three, Kim has a resume that's impressive even by astronaut standards. He is a former Navy SEAL, combat veteran and a Harvard Medical School graduate.",
      "In a pre-launch interview, Kim said he had \"some terrible moments\" in combat and ended up \"just really burnt out. I was very burnt out from the combat, from the war and the loss. ... I needed a way to continue serving, and it seemed logical that medicine would be that vehicle.\"",
      "Already a SEAL team combat medic, Kim was accepted by Harvard's medical school. Along the way, \"I probably went a little too extreme in ensuring that previous successes did not set myself up for the future.\"",
      "\"I ensured that the people I worked with in the hospital didn't know I was previously a SEAL, because I wanted my patients, I wanted my colleagues to think of me as dependable and proficient and a good physician. Not because I used to be a SEAL, but because that's who I was.\"",

    "summary": "Time magazine named \"the architects of AI\" its 2025 Person of the Year on Thursday, calling out tech industry leaders behind the rise in artificial intelligence.",
    "story": [
      "Time magazine is spotlighting key players in the artificial intelligence revolution\u00a0for its 2025 Person of the Year, the magazine announced Thursday. \"The architects of AI\" are the latest recipients of the designation, which for more than a century has been given out on an annual basis to an influential person, group of people or, occasionally, a defining\u00a0cultural theme\u00a0or idea.",
      "Previous Person of the Year title-holders have held varying roles in a vast range of occupations, with President Trump taking last year's cover and Taylor Swift capturing the one before. In 2025,",
      "Time's 2025 honorific was given to the minds and financiers behind AI's rise to renown and notoriety, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son and Baidu CEO Robin Li, who spoke directly with the magazine for its feature story.",
      "\"Person of the Year is a powerful way to focus the world's attention on the people that shape our lives,\" wrote Sam Jacobs, Time's editor-in-chief, in\u00a0an editorial piece\u00a0about the magazine's decision. \"And this year, no one had a greater impact than the individuals who imagined, designed, and built AI.\"",
      "Jacobs described 2025 as \"the year when artificial intelligence's full potential roared into view, and when it became clear that there will be no turning back or opting out,\" adding: \"Whatever the question was, AI was the answer.\"",
      "The magazine prepared two separate covers for the issue. In one, artist Jason Seiler painted an interpretative recreation of the iconic 1932 photograph \"Lunch Atop a Skyscraper,\" an image that depicted workers seated side-by-side on a steel beam hanging high above New York City during the construction of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, which became a symbol of American resilience during the Great Depression.",
      "A cast of tech industry characters at the forefront of AI development are perched on the beam in Seiler's recreation. Mark Zuckerberg, of Meta, Lisa Su, of Advanced Micro Devices,\u00a0Elon Musk, of xAI, Sam Altman, of Open AI, Demis Hassabis, of DeepMind Technologies, Dario Amodei, of Anthropic, and Fei-Fei Li, of Stanford's Human-Centered AI Institute, are all pictured, along with Huang.",
      "The second cover illustration, by artist Peter Crowther, places the same executives among scaffolding at what looks like a construction site for the giant letters \"AI.\"",
      "\"Every industry needs it, every company uses it, and every nation needs to build it,\" Huang said of balancing the pressures to implement AI responsibly and deploy it to the public as quickly as possible. \"This is the single most impactful technology of our time.\"",
      "Most of the industry figures pictured on Time's cover did not speak to the magazine for the story, so this year's spread mainly focuses on the implications \u2014 positive, negative and in between \u2014 of the companies they have built and the technology they continue forging.",
      "AI often took center stage in 2025 in investigative news reports, economic and academic studies, and in Washington, D.C., as policymakers grappled with how to regulate its evolution while tech giants scrambled to trump their competitors' inventions, as the use of some of them, like chatbots, grew to be commonplace, at times with tragic consequences.",
      "\"For these reasons, we recognize a force that has dominated the year's headlines, for better or for worse,\" Jacobs wrote in his editorial. \"For delivering the age of thinking machines, for wowing and worrying humanity, for transforming the present and transcending the possible, the Architects of AI are TIME's 2025 Person of the Year.\"",

    "story": [
      "With the world's first social media ban for teenagers under 16 now in effect in Australia, its initial political architect is celebrating a new less-digital era for millions of children \u2014 and sharing that the legislation was personally inspired by his wife, for their four children.",
      "\"She read a book called 'The Anxious Generation,' by Jonathan Haidt,\" said Peter Malinauskas, the premier of the state of South Australia. \"And I will never forget the night she finished reading the book and she put it down on her lap and she turned to me and said, 'You better do something about this!'\"",
      "Within seven months, and with strong public support, that idea fast became law across the land, winning support from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. Ten major apps including TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, Reddit and Facebook have complied to bar everyone 16 and under from their accounts and from setting up new accounts.",
      "\"Heaven forbid they might talk to one another a bit more, pick up the phone and have a chat rather than just being obsessed with the screen,\" said Maulinauskas.",
      "The ban puts the onus of responsibility on social media companies rather than parents with a penalty of up to $33 million if found to be in breach. It allows for each company to decide how best to adhere, which must be \"multi-layered,\" using more than one kind of identity verification, which could include traditional methods including national IDs and passports but also artificial intelligence \u2014 controversial over possible inaccuracies \u2014 to scan facial features for age.",
      "Malinauskas readily admits there will be growing pains.",
      "\"People will find ways around it and lots of things will go wrong, and that'll be highlighted in coming days and weeks in Australia,\" he said, \"but on balance, this is a reform that parents want so they can do their job more easily.\"",
      "He says officials from North America, Europe and Asia have been speaking with him about advancing similar legislation in Canada, the United Kingdom and Japan. Malaysia is already on track to be the next country to ban those under 16 from social media in 2026.",
      "Yet in Australia, the law already faces a legal challenge. The country's High Court accepted a legal challenge from two 15-year-olds who assert the ban violates their freedom of communication. The case could be heard as early as February.",
      "Malinauskas blames those companies for putting all children through \"a global experiment\" over the past decade with \"social media addiction and overuse because many of these platforms have had addictive algorithms.\"",
      "\"I'm really proud, really proud that we've been able to see South Australia and then Australia lead a reform that's going to make a big difference to young people's lives,\" he said.",
      "\"And the reason why politicians are looking at it is because parents know something's not right. You know, there is no better judge of what's in the best interest of a child than a parent, right?\"",

    "summary": "For thousands of parents in 39 countries, including the U.S., the goal is simple: More time outdoors, and a childhood lived offline as much as possible.",
    "story": [
      "Suffolk, England - For parents Daisy Greenwell and Joe Ryrie, freedom means looking up at the world around them instead of down at their phones, and they're determined to pass that sense of non-digital liberty on to their children.",
      "Their daughter started asking for a smartphone when she was just eight years old, because her classmates were getting them. The pressure to have a phone at such a young age surprised Greenwell, and pushed her to look more closely at the trend.",
      "She found a growing body of research suggesting that heavy smartphone use may negatively impact young people's mental health.",
      "The more she read, the more concerned she became, so Greenwell decided to take action. She posted a question on Instagram: What if we could switch the norm? What if parents united to create a \"smartphone-free childhood?\"",
      "The response was immediate.",
      "\"That post went viral,\" she told CBS News. \"Thousands of parents joined the group overnight.\"",
      "Within a couple weeks, Greenwell said there were smartphone-free childhood groups in every county in England. One year later, the grassroots campaign has expanded far beyond the U.K. borders.",
      "The group \u2014 Smartphone Free Childhood \u2014 now has chapters in 39 countries.",
      "For Greenwell, Ryrie and the thousands of families who've joined the movement, the goal is simple: More time outdoors, and a childhood lived offline as much as possible.",
      "In the U.S., the movement even inspired a cautionary viral advertisement, highlighting the dangers of giving children unrestricted access to the internet. A parent in the ad tells their child: \"There's a box in the corner with all the pornographic material ever made. I'm trusting you not to look in there, okay?\"",
      "The backlash against youth consumption of social media has drawn the attention of governments globally. On Wednesday, Australia became the first country in the world to enact a ban on social media accounts for children under the age of 16. The law compels huge tech companies such as Meta and TikTok to enforce age restrictions, or face hefty fines.",
      "In the U.K., national Culture Minister Lisa Nandy said the government would be keeping a \"close eye\" on Australia's social media ban, but added that there were no current plans to replicate the legislation.",
      "At a grassroots level, however, parents who join Greenwell and Ryrie's movement are asked to sign a pact: No smartphones for the kids before they turn 14, and no social media before 16.",
      "\"This isn't an anti-tech movement, it's a pro-childhood movement. We're not saying no smartphones ever. We're just saying children don't need unrestricted internet access in their pockets 24/7,\" Ryrie told CBS News.",
      "When asked what she'd tell busy working parents who rely on phones for convenience, Greenwell acknowledged the challenge.",
      "\"It's really tough,\" she said. \"But delaying the smartphone is free, it's simple, and it gives your child the best chance to thrive.\"",
      "Many families are turning to basic \"brick phones\" as alternatives \u2014 devices that allow calls and texts, but limit internet access. Sales of such \"dumb\" devices have risen 150% among 18-24 year olds in the United States, according to a study by the peer-reviewed journal Partners Universal Innovative Research Publication.",
      "Despite the momentum, Greenwell says there's still a cultural norm to disrupt, and available data highlights that point. One in four British kids between the ages of 5 and 7 already own a smartphone, according to the U.K.'s independent media regulator Ofcom.",
      "Greenwell said she believes real change can be driven from the community level.",
      "\"If children know several classmates are also delaying smartphones, the peer pressure dissolves,\" she told CBS News. \"It becomes easier for families to wait a few years. A brick phone in the meantime isn't that hard. We can do this.\"",

    "summary": "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, said \"there's a deal to be had\" on a plan to address health care costs after a pair of bills failed to secure enough support to advance in the Senate last week.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, said Sunday that \"there's a deal to be had\" on addressing health care costs after a pair of bills failed to secure enough support to advance in the Senate last week.",
      "\"There has to be a meeting of the minds between Democrats and Republicans,\" Cassidy said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Last week, the Senate rejected two bills aimed at lowering health care costs, as lawmakers struggle to reach consensus over how to address expiring tax credits that help millions of Americans purchase insurance under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "While Democrats sought a three-year extension of the enhanced tax credits with their bill, Republicans offered their own legislation sponsored by Cassidy. Rather than extending the enhanced tax credits, the measure would redirect funds to health savings accounts for those who use bronze plans on state exchanges, allowing people to save on premiums by switching to the lower-tier plans, while giving them the ability to use the HSA funds toward their deductibles.",
      "The Republican-led measure didn't pick up any support from Democrats during the dueling votes last week. But Cassidy said that in addition to their concern about the premiums, Democrats must acknowledge high deductibles, saying \"you've got to put cash in the patient's pocket to pay the out of pocket.\"",
      "\"I would be willing to do a short-term extension of the premium tax credit for those people with higher premiums if they will concede that we've got to do something for the $6,000 out of pocket,\" Cassidy added. \"I think there's a deal to be had here. We need to push for that deal.\"",
      "The Louisiana Republican said he's searching for a deal to address the concerns of Democrats and Republicans.",
      "\"Let's just meet,\" Cassidy said. \"Let's address our concerns, and then this Republican would be willing to do something on a short-term extension of the premium tax credits if that's what it takes to get the deal to help those folks with the more expensive premium, but also helping everybody with their deductible.\"",
      "The comments come as some senators have expressed tepid optimism in recent days about a path forward on a compromise after last week's partisan exercise. Some Republicans have said they're open to an extension of the enhanced tax credits, with some new limits and on a temporary basis, acknowledging the cliff that around 22 million Americans face with their expiration at the end of the month.",
      "Cassidy argued that with his approach, lawmakers would have until the end of March to implement a solution, \"because with these kind of accounts that people have money in, they just save the receipts, they submit them, and they get reimbursed.\"",
      "\"We can get this done,\" Cassidy said. \"And I think we can meet the concerns, both about the out of pocket, but also about the premium.\"",
      "In a separate appearance on \"Face the Nation,\" Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia responded to Cassidy's comments. Warner said lawmakers shouldn't wait to address the rising costs, urging them to \"fix it now, so people don't go into Christmas thinking they're going to not know if they're being able to afford health care.\"",
      "\"Fix the crisis right now,\" Warner said. \"Extend the subsidies, and then let's debate how we fix it.\"",

      "We wanted to hear about that journey, but she refused to talk about it, citing security concerns for those who helped her, although she has previously said she received support from the U.S. government.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO (Venezuela Opposition Leader): I am not going to give more information regarding my trip to Norway.",
      "But what am I going to say, how important it is for the Venezuelan people. This is a recognition to a nation that has fought tirelessly, courageously against a criminal narco-terrorist structure. And \u2013 and I came to receive that prize, that award, and I'm going to bring it back home to the Venezuelan people as soon as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You say you're going back home. I know you sent your own children out of Venezuelan territory in order to protect them, your sons, your daughter.",
      "Are they concerned that you plan to return to Venezuela? When are you going?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: Well, of course they are concerned, as any other Venezuelan child that has their parents or relatives back in our country, because the regime, as I said, has persecuted, tortured, killed, disappeared thousands of Venezuelans.",
      "And, recently, it has turned even more violent, because, you know, when \u2013 when a criminal regime is falling apart and they know their days are numbered, they turn even more aggressive, even more violent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you help us understand what is going on? Because we are seeing here in the U.S. an increase in the pressure campaign, more sanctions on Venezuelan individuals and vessels. We saw an armed seizure of a vessel carrying oil out of Venezuela.",
      "Selling oil on the black market is really important money for the Maduro regime. Do you endorse this idea of more seizures and possibly even a blockade?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: Look, I absolutely support President Trump's strategy.",
      "And we, the Venezuelan people, are very grateful to him and to his administration, because I believe he is a champion of freedom in this hemisphere. And that's why \u2013 and I say this from Oslo right now \u2013 I have dedicated this award to him, because I think that he finally has put Venezuela in where it should be, in terms of a priority for the United States' national security.",
      "And we do support these actions because, Margaret, we are facing not a conventional dictatorship. This is a very complex criminal structure that has turned Venezuela into a safe haven of international crime and terrorist activities, starting with Russia, Iran, Cuba, Hezbollah, Hamas, the Colombian guerrilla, the drug cartels operating freely and directed in partnership with Maduro and his regime.",
      "And, as every criminal structure is \u2013 suffers is when the inflows from their criminal activities are cut. And these, in the case of Maduro regime, comes from the oil black market, to drug trafficking, gold smuggling, arms smuggling, even human smuggling and trafficking.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It sounds like you support more sanctions and possibly more seizures of oil. But isn't there a risk that cutting off money will further hurt the already impoverished people of Venezuela? Isn't that a risk?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: Of course, what we're doing is for the well-being of the Venezuelan people. What we want to do is to save lives.",
      "But Maduro was the one who declared a war on the Venezuelan people, a war we didn't want, a war we are suffering with hundreds of thousands of killings and forced executions in the last years. And, right now, I want to be very clear with the international community.",
      "The resources Maduro gets are not going to schools or hospitals. In Venezuela, a teacher earns $1 a day. Pensions are less than $1 a month. Our children go twice a week to school. The sources, the cash the regime gets from these illegal activities goes to buy arms, to pay gang members, to spy and infiltrate, and to even further increase their illegal narcotics activities and so on.",
      "So these resources are not going for to \u2013 towards the people. They're going for corruption and crime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So it sounds like you want even more seizures and a blockade. Is that correct?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: We want every legal action through law enforcement approach, not only from the United States, also from other Caribbean, Latin American and European countries, that further block the illegal activities of the regime.",
      "Why? Because we need to increase the cost of staying in power by force. Once you arrive to that point in which the cost of staying in power is higher than the cost of leaving power, the regime will fall apart. And it's the moment where we, you know, advance into a negotiated transition, which is what in the beginning we offered Maduro when we won the presidential election by a landslide last year.",
      "But he not only refused that option, but he, as you know, unleashed the worst, most brutal repression wave we've seen in our history.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And eight million Venezuelans have fled\u2026",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: That's correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 since he came to power, during that time.",
      "But, in terms of the diplomacy, President Trump spoke with Maduro himself last month. We haven't seen any evidence, though, that diplomacy, a negotiated exit like you mentioned, is happening. Are you seeing diplomatic success?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: Well, in the last years, Venezuela has seen 17 dialogue initiatives, not once, not twice, 17.",
      "Every single time, the opposition or our allies or the United States have complied with every single thing we offered. The regime of the country has violated every single thing they offered on their own part. What did they get? They got time. They got legitimacy. They got money.",
      "And that's precisely what they think they can get again \u2013 once again. But, certainly, things have changed very much in the last months. Venezuela is a total different country. I mean, Maduro is weaker than ever. The armed forces, police are certainly divided and fractured, and our country is united, cohesive.",
      "And we finally have the administration, in this case, President Trump, with a clear strategy that truly represents a credible threat for the regime. So if we had \u2013 ever had a chance to finally move ahead into \u2013 towards democracy in our country, it's today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What evidence do you have that the military is weaker than ever? Was your escape proof of that?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: We've seen more and more members of the military finding ways to connect with us, to send messages to \u2013 to \u2013 to show that they are feeling the same of what the rest of the country is feeling.",
      "When \u2013 when they \u2013 this military go back home, they find their children, their mother, their partners saying that they are hungry, that they are persecuted, that their families have been divided. They are scared. Yes, they are scared, because repression and persecution in the military is even tougher than on civilians.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, President Trump said that land strikes to stop drug trafficking specifically will start soon. He has been saying that for weeks. Do you know what he is talking about? And has he promised you anything?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: No, I don't know. And well, if I knew, I wouldn't say it, of course. But it's not the case.",
      "We are not involved and we will not get involved into another nation's policy for their own national security.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But would you welcome U.S. military action?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: I will welcome more and more pressure so that Maduro understands that he has to go, that his time is over.",
      "And I will insist something that I have said several times before. This is not conventional regime change. This cannot be compared to other cases, like countries in the Middle East. We had an election. Regime change was already mandated by over 70 percent of the population. And what we need is support to enforce that decision.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, how do you square military action with receiving a Peace Prize? Are we at the point it's necessary?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: Well, what we're fighting for is precisely freedom in order to have democracy, and democracy in order to have peace.",
      "And in order to maintain freedom and to achieve freedom, you do need strength. The contrary would be the peace of the dead, in which you have a country under absolute oppression and simply giving in. And that's not the case.",
      "It's absolutely absurd that you see a regime, a criminal regime like Maduro, that gets support from Russia or from Iran, and then ask the Venezuelan people not to ask support from democratic countries and democratic leaders.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: That's absolute absurd. We do not have arms. We have our will. We have the power of organization and the power of love, which, at the end, I have to say that peace is ultimately an act of love.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Maduro regime maintains it won the last election and considers Machado a fugitive. The regime also refers to U.S. actions as illegal and brutal interventionism.",
      "In our next half-hour, we will speak with Machado about what's ahead in a potential post-Maduro era in Venezuela.",
      "And we will be back in one minute, so stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're now joined by the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner of Virginia.",
      "Senator, were you persuaded there by Maria Corina Machado's argument that military action, pressure is virtuous and necessary?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER (D-Virginia): Well, first of all, let me \u2013 at the top of the show, we have got this tragic shooting at Brown University and then this obviously political strike against the Jewish community in Australia, both horrible, and particularly on the first day of Hanukkah, which is the celebration of light over darkness.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: And, boy, we could use a little more light these days.",
      "Ms. Machado is a hero. She deserves to win the Nobel Prize. And one of the mistakes the Biden administration made last year, when the opposition candidates won overwhelmingly, was not put more pressure on Maduro then to leave. But the action now that Trump has chosen Maduro, who's a bad guy, and saying \u2013 and I'm not sure what his policy is, but at the very same time is pardoning, for example, a Honduran former president who was convicted in America of drug running.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: The president, who has not been willing to stand up strong against Putin, who's probably the most brutal authoritarian leader in the world, as we go on and off with Ukraine.",
      "I think it's \u2013 yes, it'd be great to get rid of Maduro. But in terms of the question\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: \u2026 Donald Trump has not come to the American people and said, here are our goals in Venezuela. We have got troops potentially in harm's way. We have got boat actions, for example, where we're blowing up boats where we can obviously interdict, as we saw with the oil tanker.",
      "I think the president needs to make the case if he's going to try to put boots on the ground in Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, at this point, all they have, as I understand it, asked for and justified to Congress were these strikes on the alleged drug boats, nothing with sovereign territory yet.",
      "But that gets to your argument about, what is the end goal? Unlike other Democrats, when it comes to the drug boats, you have said you're not ready to call them war crimes, particularly what happened on the September 2 double tap strike. You have questioned Admiral Bradley.",
      "I know you want the video released to the public. What do you think that's going to show to the public? What will that change?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, I think the video is chilling, disturbing, whatever term you want to use.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Because the idea of these two survivors hanging on to remnants of a boat, and then America taking a series of additional strikes. The Congress needs to see it, at the very minimum. I think the American public needs to see it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have seen it?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: I have seen it. It is \u2013 it is\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Only a limited number have.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: It is extraordinarily chilling.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: What I'm saying is, once you make the accusation of war crime, you can't take that back.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: And so what I have said\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But many of your Democrat colleagues have.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: And I know that.",
      "That's why I have said to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, I want to see the written execution order. I want to see the legal opinion that was about this specific strike. I want to know whether the overarching policy memorandum, which was not finished until September 5, three days after the strike, was it changed?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You \u2013 I saw you said that that's not typical, is it? Don't you normally come up with the legal justification before you take the action, rather than three days after it?",

The latest data, though, from the Consumer Price Index is up three percent year over year, Personal Consumption Index is up 2.8 percent year over year. What data is he looking at? What's your benchmark?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Well, one the things that, if you saw his presentation in Pennsylvania, as he put up a bunch of charts, which he loves to do, where he went through the individual items that have \u2013 we've already sort of made a bunch of progress on.",
      "And so, for example, under Joe Biden, prescription drugs were up nine percent. So far this year they're down 0.6 percent. Gasoline is way down. It was like the highest ever under Biden.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Eggs. He was talking about eggs. Yes.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes, he was talking about eggs.",
      "And so, I think the \u2013 the way to think about inflation, of course, is that there are like micro effects, like the time that we had the avian flu affecting drug prices.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And then macro effects, which is runaway spending, big deficits and an accommodated Fed policy. And I think that \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And now tariffs adding to some price increases according to the Fed chair.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, I \u2013 you know, I think that the tariff evidence is mixed. But the point is that we've got deficit going way, way down. So, right now, it's looking like the deficit for this year will be $600 billion lower than it was last year. That really helps lower inflation. We've got the trade deficit cut in half from last year. And so all these things are things that should continue to move us towards the Fed target of two percent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Companies aren't necessarily going to bring items down, though, in terms of pricing, right? I mean the president told \"The Wall Street Journal,\" he didn't know when all of this money, quote, \"is going to kick in.\" I think he was talking to business investment and tariffs, \"and help voters. All I can do is my job.\"",
      "When do you anticipate voters will feel this positive impact?",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Same thing, you're saying?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No, what's going to happen \u2013 I'm not saying that. What I'm saying is that people are going to see the high growth. Growth is four percent. Income growth is up about $1,200 this year. People look in their wallets and see they're doing better, which is why we had the biggest Black Friday ever. And so on.",
      "And so, I think that the sentiment \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's more higher incomes.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: The sentiment will catch up with the reality. Under Joe Biden the fact is that real purchasing power dropped by about 3,000. So far this year it's up by about $1,200 per family. And the money that we're talking about is like real money. So, for groceries, it went from $400 a month to $525 a month under Biden. So, that's like an extra more than thousand dollars a year you have to spend on groceries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Uh-huh.",

      "But I can say that \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you've got the leeway, right? Pricing (ph).",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: That what's been going on is there's been kind of a black market for oil amongst sort of this sanctioned countries. And what we're doing is we're shutting that black market down. Whether that affects prices outside of the sanctioned countries is kind of an open question. Probably not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think it will?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No, because \u2013 because there's \u2013 they're already kind of on the ropes, these countries. They're only getting oil when they get, like, sort of black fleets to sneak in and give them the oil.",

      "KEVIN HASSETT: But on the jobs picture, you know, we're going to get the data next week. And so, maybe next Sunday I'll come back and we'll talk about it because we've got two months of data coming out on Tuesday and we'll get a clearer picture because right now we just have some very difficult to pin down surveys, like the gold standard for this will be really the household survey, which we don't even get for October.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But these were CEOs. They're the people who would be doing the hiring, right? And they're saying, we're not doing it.",

I think he has very strong and well-founded views about what we ought to do. But in the end, the job of the Fed is to be independent and the \u2013 to work with the group of people that are on the Board of Governors at the FOMC, to drive a group consensus on where interest rates should be. And to do so, you know, basically with the guidance of the Fed chair. But in the end, it's a committee that votes. And I'd be happy to talk to the president every day, you know, until both of us are dead because it's so much fun to talk. And he's \u2013",

      "KEVIN HASSETT: No. No. The \u2013 he would have no weight. It's just his opinion matters if it's good. You know, if it's based on data. And then if you go to the committee and you say, well, the president made this argument and that's a really sound argument, I think, what do you think? If they reject it, then they'll vote in a different way.",

      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY (R-LA): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, your health care bill gives Americans up to $1,500 in tax-free accounts to spend on health care rather than extend these expiring ACA subsidies. On Thursday, your proposal failed 51-48, as did the Democratic proposal. So that means it looks like those receiving ACA premium subsidies will see their costs go up 114 percent. Bottom line here, did Republicans simply wait too long to come up with a health care alternative?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Well, first, Margaret, let's just kind of recap the question. We've got to do something for affordability for the people in the exchanges. And I will say that the only thing that Democrats would accept was something that would decrease the premiums. But if a family has a $6,000 out of pocket before they get into the strength of the insurance plan, then frankly the policy is catastrophic. It brings profit to the insurance company, but not benefit to the patient.",
      "So, I would argue that it actually is \u2013 there has to be a meeting of the minds between Democrats and Republicans. Let's acknowledge, you've got to put cash in the patient's pocket to pay the out of pocket. I would be willing to do a short-term extension of the premium tax credits for those people with higher premiums if they will concede that we've got to do something for the $6,000 out of pocket. I think there's a deal to be had here. We need to push for that deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you want to make sure that the average deductible is less than $6,000 is what I just heard you say there, and you're open to an",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Absolutely. The net deductible, if you will \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: That $1,500 is per person. Give me a couple \u2013 you know, for people over 50, give me a couple in their 50s with two children, 18 and 19. They would get $5,000 in an account, in their purse, pocketbook, you name it, in their pocket to pay the out of pocket for the insurance. Now, the insurance plan for that couple would be a $6,000 deductible. So, you end up decreasing the net deductible by doing this. That makes the policy actually functional for them. If the child has a sprained ankle and you bring to the urgent care, you can pay the bill, not kind of come with - - come at a \u2013 come forward out of your own pocket.",
      "By the way, I'm told that about 40 percent of Americans have less than $1,000 in their savings account. That kind of puts into relief why you need to have something in their pocket to pay the out of pocket.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "So, I know the president has said that he likes the concept of your plan, but why didn't the White House put its shoulder behind this before Thursday? Why didn't they whip votes for you? Four of your Republican colleagues crossed the aisle and voted with Democrats on their proposal.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: All four of those voted for our proposal, too. And I think that shows you that there is \u2013 there is interest in finding something which addresses both the critical problem of the out-of-pocket expense, but also the higher premiums.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is the White House behind you on this? Like, are they helping you if you're trying another \u2013",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Well, it certainly seemed like it. Their \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want this up for another vote?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Their initial plan had elements of what I am speaking about, helping people with that deductible. So, simply put, yes, the White House is there. But if you notice, our problem was not on the Republican side, our problem was on the Democratic side. So, what I'm saying is, is let's just meet together.",
      "As a physician, I can tell you, that deductible, the patient comes, she's stressed. She can't get the procedure, the x-ray, the whatever, because of her $6,000 deductible. Let's just meet. Let's address her concerns. And then this Republican would be willing to do something on a short-term extension of the premium tax credits if that's what it takes to get the deal to help those folks with the more expensive premium, but also helping everybody with their deductible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you need more White House help on this? And, sir, you're running out of time here. Do you really think you can get this done before January 1st?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Our problem is not with Republicans. Our problem has been with Democrats. But, of course, they may say that about us. So, what I am kind of searching for is a deal in which both have their concerns addressed. If you do that and you put this in place, you really have until the end of, like, March to get it done because with these kind of accounts that people have money in, they just save the receipts, they submit them and they get reimburse. It happens \u2013 it's what we do in my family. We have a flexible spending account.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: And so, we can get this done. And I think we can meet the concerns, both about the out of pocket, but also about the premium.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I also want to ask you about what's happening with the FDA right now. CBS has confirmed that there are no ongoing safety studies into the abortion drug Mifepristone. This was despite the Trump administration saying they were going to conduct one, and anti-abortion groups want this review to take place.",
      "I saw a letter the FDA commissioner sent to you last week claiming they are reviewing the evidence. Do you believe him? And if not, what are you doing about it?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: I had a conversation with the commissioner this past week. It seems as if it's taken a long time to get that study up and going, which suggests to me that it's not a priority. For the pro-life community, this should be a priority. And if we're going to make America healthy again, this seems like, my gosh, should be top priority.",
      "So, there is \u2013 I am disappointed, as well as others are disappointed, by the way this is being slow-walked. I think \u2013 I think it just needs to happen. We need to have the evidence out there.",
      "If you want to reassure the American people about something which is really top of mind, this is where they should be going.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said that Mifepristone is safe and effective and that there are side effects in less than 1 percent of patients. I \u2013 with that data point in place, why isn't the White House pressing the FDA commissioner to make this happen? There's some suggestion in reporting that it is for political concerns due to impact on the upcoming midterm races. Is this politically motivated, the slow-walking you say is happening?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: You're asking me to look into the kind of motivations of folks with whom I've not had a personal conversation. I can't do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, did the FDA commissioners say that?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: The FDA commissioners said that they're trying to get the study together. But they've been in office long enough that it could be. And so, I think that it's right to be impatient. It's right to demand more.",
      "I don't know if the decision starts with the FDA commissioner. You just suggested it starts in the White House. That might be the case. Point being, get it done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you have confidence in the FDA commissioner?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: I think the FDA commissioner is working very hard. And I think that, in many cases, he's receiving directives from on high. I don't know that for sure, but I suspect that's the case.",

The United Nations says the national guard targeted political opponents, committed sexual violence, tortured people and committed other crimes against humanity.",
      "So, from where you sit, is Maduro stepping down enough, or do you need the entire regime dismantled, in which case that sounds like a country in collapse.",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO (Venezuelan Opposition Leader): That's a very good question because certainly Maduro is the head of the structure, but it's like any other mafia system. You have families or groups that operate and sometimes even compete among each other.",
      "There are different degrees in the crimes they have committed. Certainly those that have committed crimes against humanity, that have been reported by the fact finding missions (ph) of the United Nations should face justice. Local justice and international justice.",
      "There are other members of the regime or the armed forces that have committed lesser crimes. And certainly we will search for justice, not revenge.",

      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: Well, I'm absolutely convinced that Putin wants the world to think that, and especially wants President Trump to think that. But I would ask you a question. Do you think Putin has resources to spare at this time or does he have something that's more urgent for him to invest those resources? I mean helping a regime that is going to fall apart anyway, regardless of what he does, I don't think it's a priority for him.",

      "And, you know, we work very hard to understand what's the true nature of our armed forces right now, identifying those military which we believe could be supportive of a transition to democracy and new government \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have they pledged that to you?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: Some of them, yes. And we believe that over 80 percent of our armed forces will join in support the democratic movement once the transition is in place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, tell me about that transition. What kind of support do you need to keep the country together, to prevent another refugee crisis? And do you have that pledge from the American government now?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: We will need a lot of support, advice, information, technology, not only from the United States, also from multilateral organizations, some of which we're already working together. Not only in security issues, but power supply, food supply, how do we bring \u2013 you know, put order in our financial accounts. How do we restructure our debt. How we open markets for international investment and give security to international investment in oil and gas and infrastructure, critical minerals. I mean, Venezuela is unique in terms of the amount of the natural endowments we have.",
      "And, you know, we're located three hours by plane from Florida. So, it's hard to think, you know, in this shortening of the supply chains that is in the (INAUDIBLE) shoring process taking place, a better ally in the region than Venezuela.",
      "At the same time, you know, turning Venezuela from the criminal hub of the Americas into a security shield for the United States and for the rest of the region is a top priority for all.",
      "So, you know, we have the plans ready. We have the teams ready. We know what we have to do, the first 100 hours, and the next 100 days. And most importantly, and I want to insist on this, we have the people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would that include U.S. peacekeeping troops or other troops on the ground?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: I'm \u2013 I cannot answer that question right now. I don't think that's the case. There are other countries that have offered support as well in order to strengthen democratic institutions once the government elect is in place. But the \u2013 we will have to address that once we have the, you know, the government elect in place and put in order, bringing order back to our country.",
      "And one thing that you mentioned for \u2013 about the, you know, the refugee crisis, it's going to be exactly the country. The day Maduro goes, you will see tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants coming back home from the United States and all over the world. I mean our diaspora is desperate to go back to Venezuela. So even from that perspective, it is a win-win situation to have democracy in Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think it is safe for those Venezuelans in America to go back there now? Some temporary protected status was just revoked bit the president for more than half a million Venezuelans here. Is it safe for them?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: Absolutely not. It will be safe once Maduro is gone and every single citizen will be, you know, living freedom and respect towards the law. We will bring back rule of law. We will liberate our political prisoners. And everybody will be free to speak out what they feel, what they think, what they want for the future of their \u2013 for their own future and their families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Maria Corina Machado, we thank you for your time today. And we will be watching.",

    "summary": "Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Mar\u00eda Corina Machado said she's \"absolutely\" supportive of President Trump's strategy in the country.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado said she's \"absolutely\" supportive of President Trump's strategy in the country amid his administration's increased pressure campaign against the regime of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "\"We, the Venezuelan people, are very grateful to him and to his administration, because I believe he is a champion of freedom in this hemisphere,\" Machado said of Mr. Trump on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Last week, the Venezuelan opposition leader made a daring escape from her country to collect her Nobel Peace Prize in Norway. The appearance marked the first time Machado has been seen in public in almost a year, after living in hiding in Venezuela. In an exclusive interview with \"Face the Nation,\" Machado said she dedicated the award to Mr. Trump because \"he finally has put Venezuela in where it should be, in terms of a priority for the United States national security.\"",
      "\"We have been asking this for years, so it's finally happening,\" Machado said. \"That's why I believe the regime has its days numbered.\"",
      "The U.S. has increased pressure on the Maduro regime in recent weeks, with a buildup of military assets in the region, strikes on alleged drug boats off the coast of Venezuela, new sanctions on Venezuelan individuals and vessels, along with the seizure of an oil rig.",
      "Machado acknowledged that more sanctions and more possible seizures of oil come with the risk of cutting off the already impoverished people of Venezuela. But she said \"what we're doing is for the well being of the Venezuelan people.\"",
      "\"What we want to do is to save lives, but Maduro was the one who declared a war on the Venezuelan people,\" Machado said. \"A war we didn't want. A war we are suffering with hundreds of thousands of killings and forced executions in the last years.\"",
      "Asked by Brennan whether she wants more seizures and a blockade, Machado said \"we want every legal action through law enforcement approach,\" not only from the U.S., but also from Caribbean, Latin American and European countries to \"further block the illegal activities of the regime.\"",
      "\"Why? Because we need to increase the cost of staying in power by force. Once you arrive to that point in which the cost of staying in power is higher than the cost of leaving power, the regime will fall apart, and it's the moment where we, you know, advance into a negotiated transition,\" Machado said.",
      "Maduro refused to leave after last year's presidential election, even after tallies showed the opposition winning nearly 70% of the vote. But Machado said things have changed significantly in recent months, and Venezuela is a \"total different country.\"",
      "\"Maduro is weaker than ever. The Armed Forces, police are certainly divided and fractured, and our country is united, cohesive, and we finally have the administration, in this case, President Trump with a clear strategy that truly represents a credible threat for the regime,\" she said. \"So if we had ever had a chance to finally move ahead into, towards democracy in our country, it's today.\"",
      "Outlining her argument, Machado said \"the wide majority of the military want change,\" pointing to the move to disobey an order to expel electoral witnesses from polling stations during last year's elections, and the results of the election itself. Machado said more recently, members of the military have been \"finding ways to connect with us\" by sending messages \"to show that they are feeling the same of what the rest of the country is feeling.\"",
      "Asked whether she would welcome U.S. military action in Venezuela, Machado said \"I will welcome more and more pressure so that Maduro understands that he has to go, that his time is over.\"",
      "Machado alleged that the Maduro regime has \"persecuted, tortured, killed, disappeared, thousands of Venezuelans.\" She added that \"recently it has turned even more violent because, you know, when a criminal regime is falling apart and they know their days are numbered, they turn even more aggressive, even more violent.\"",
      "The opposition leader said \"we are facing not a conventional dictatorship.\"",
      "\"This is a very complex criminal structure that has turned Venezuela into a safe haven of international crime and terrorist activities, starting with Russia, Iran, Cuba, Hezbollah, Hamas, the Colombian guerrilla, the drug cartels operating freely and directed in partnership with Maduro and his regime,\" she said.",
      "Machado said that while \"Maduro is the head of the structure,\" she alleged that it's like \"any other mafia system.\"",
      "\"There are other members of the regime or the armed forces that have committed lesser crimes,\" she said. \"And certainly we will search for justice, not revenge. But this, I'm going to insist, what we're living right now is chaos. Maduro represent chaos. We're going to put order.\"",
      "Asked whether she's concerned Russia will shore up support for the military and intelligence, Machado said \"I'm absolutely convinced that Putin wants the world to think that, especially wants President Trump to think that.\" But she added, \"do you think Putin has resources to spare at this time?\"",
      "\"I mean helping a regime that it's going to fall apart anyway, regardless of what he does, I don't think it's a priority for him,\" Machado said.",
      "On the task of keeping the country together after Maduro's regime leaves, Machado cited cooperation with key allies, saying, \"our main ally will be the United States of America.\" On the question of whether that would include U.S. troops on the ground, Machado said she doesn't \"think that's the case.\"",
      "\"There are other countries that have offered support as well in order to strengthen democratic institutions once the government-elect is in place, but that we will have to address that once we have the, you know, the government-elect in place and put in order, bringing order back to our country.\"",
      "Machado said \"the day Maduro goes, you will see tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants coming back home from the United States and all over the world.\"",
      "\"Our diaspora is desperate to go back to Venezuela,\" she said. \"So even from that perspective, it is a win-win situation to have democracy in Venezuela.\"",

One person with less severe injuries was discharged. In the afternoon, he said the conditions had not changed, but he confirmed that he had spoken to four of the victims.",
      "\"This is an incredibly upsetting and emotional time for Providence and Brown \u2014 for all of us,\" he said.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel posted on social media that a command center had been set up, as well as \"digital media intake portal to ingest images and video from the public related to this incident.\"",

      "Providence Police Chief Col. Oscar Perez, on Sunday afternoon, would not confirm if the person on the surveillance video is the person who has been detained. Perez said the investigation is progressing \"extremely fast.\"",
      "Perez also confirmed that they would not be releasing the name of the person of interest yet and would not say how the person was affiliated with the university.",

      "Investigators were not immediately sure how the shooter got inside the first-floor classroom. Outer doors of the building were unlocked but rooms being used for final exams required badge access, Smiley said on Saturday.",
      "On Sunday, university officials said remaining classes and exams for the semester have been cancelled and students are free to leave campus. Those who remain on campus will have access to services and support, Provost Francis Doyle said in a statement.",

    "title": "What are the prospects for laid-off workers?",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-are-the-prospects-for-laid-off-workers/",
    "published": "Sun, 14 Dec 2025 09:55:39 -0500",
    "summary": "In 2025, more than 1.1 million Americans were laid off from their jobs, the most since the COVID pandemic, even as corporate profits remain high. Business experts discuss the reasons why companies resort to layoffs.",
    "story": [
      "For the last few weeks, Heidi Roberts' full-time job has been trying to find one. \"I literally apply at jobs from 8:00 a.m. 'til five o'clock every day,\" she said. \"And I think I've done about 56 to 60 jobs already. And I've only had seven callbacks. So, it's just been really disheartening.\"",
      "She's been at it every day since October, when she was laid off from a financial company in Knoxville, Tennessee.",
      "She said she didn't see it coming: \"I had no idea, none at all,\" she said. \"I never thought it would be me. It's just hard getting up in the morning sometimes, 'cause you really gotta pump yourself up to do it. And I keep thinking, 'Okay, this next interview, hopefully it's gonna go well.'\"",
      "Roberts' Christmas wish is not unusual this year. In 2025, more than 1.1 million Americans have been laid off, the most since the 2020 COVID pandemic (according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas). The layoffs have hit numerous industries and companies of all sizes (including our own parent company, Paramount Skydance). The largest cuts came from the federal government (followed by technology, warehouses and retail), with tens of thousands of cuts each.",
      "\"Those are numbers that we haven't seen outside of recessionary periods like COVID or the Great Recession in 2008,\" said Andrew Challenger, a senior vice president at research firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which tracks the job market. \"It is a concerning stat, and everybody in the world is really paying close attention to it.\"",
      "Asked why so many companies today are almost simultaneously cutting down on the number of workers, Challenger replied, \"I'd say there's a couple stories that are going on simultaneously. One is that companies really over-hired in 2022 and 2023; we're seeing some economic headwinds, increased prices. And then the third piece is, we've really started to see companies discuss artificial intelligence as a reason why they're conducting job cuts at their companies.\"",
      "Layoffs \"perceived positively by the markets\"",
      "In the past companies laid off workers during periods of struggle. But Annie Lowrey, a staff writer with The Atlantic, says that's not what is happening now: \"Corporate profits are very, very high,\" she said. \"And if you look actually at businesses at how much their CEOs are making, it's just an enormous, enormous share. And I think that it reflects this divergence between the 1% and the 99%.\"",
      "Lowrey says most layoffs aren't happening because companies are in the red, but because the future of the economy looks a bit gray: \"Business leaders often like to blame uncertainty stemming from Washington. In this case, I think that they might actually really have a case. That might be the tariffs and the trade war, that might be the high cost of borrowing even if interest rates are coming down. Again, none of these in and of itself is enough to tip the massive and still quite vibrant American economy into a recession. But it's really leading to a pause that I think has now led to a freeze on hiring, and is now leading to more companies choosing to lay workers off.\"",
      "And then there's the question about the impact of artificial intelligence. According to a recent study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, AI already has the ability to replace nearly 12% of the labor market.",
      "\"The reality is, the tech is there; implementing and the practical application of that technology is still a ways away,\" said Jason Leverant, president of the national staffing company AtWork. He says when it comes to AI, at this point it's about keeping shareholders happy.",
      "\"If I'm a publicly traded firm, or otherwise, and I want to be perceived as forward thinking, I'm adopting cutting edge technology \u2013 'Hey, we're leveraging AI, we're cutting expenses, we're cutting our overhead \u2026 unfortunately, that has to deal with layoffs,'\" Leverant said. \"That sells really well. It's really, unfortunately, perceived positively by the markets.\"",
      "But while AI gets a lot of attention, the fact is it ranks sixth in reasons for layoffs, behind the overall economy and restructuring.",
      "\"It's a failure of your business model\"",
      "For more than 50 years, Bob Chapman has been at the helm of Barry-Wehmiller, a global supplier of manufacturing technology. Founded in 1885, the company now makes nearly $4 billion in annual revenue, and has 12,000 employees.",
      "Asked his response to companies who says their layoffs are necessary, Chapman replied, \"First of all, I'd say in general, it's a failure of leadership. If your business model fails, your market changes, the challenges change, and you don't adapt to it or anticipate it, you're gonna hurt people, okay? So, it's a failure of your business model.\"",
      "Chapman says layoffs should only be a last resort: \"We dehumanize this by calling it layoffs, right-sizing, downsizing. We're actually destroying people's lives.\"",
      "I asked, \"But why should you, as a CEO, concern yourself with what happens beyond the walls of this plant?\"",
      "\"Because I care about people, okay?\" Chapman replied. \"How can you run a company and not care about the people that are put in your span of care? And when you treat them as functions, you're saying they don't matter, it's just an economic transaction. And it is not just an economic transaction.\"",
      "And last week, more news, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell lowering interest rates by a quarter-percentage point, motivated by a vulnerable job market. Powell said, \"Gradual cooling of the labor market has continued. Unemployment is up three tenths.\"",
      "Instead of adding jobs, Powell says we could be losing as many as 20,000 each month. This all has many Americans feeling less than jolly this holiday season, with layoffs expected to continue into the New Year.",
      "But back in Knoxville, some good news. A few days ago, shortly after our visit, Heidi Roberts received the #1 item on her Christmas list: a new job. \"I start January the 5th,\" she said. \"So, New Year, new me, so I'm excited!\"",
      "It meant a pay cut, but she says these days any job feels like a gift.",
      "With many Americans still looking for work, what would she say to those folks now? \"I would say, keep on moving. Keep on pushing, do not give up, and just believe,\" Roberts said. \"You will find the company. Just keep on believing, and pray. I'm very blessed.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 14 Dec 2025 09:38:51 -0500",
    "summary": "An annual fundraiser in Kansas City called Thundergong! has helped more than 2,000 amputees around the country pay for prosthetic limbs through the Steps of Faith Foundation.",
    "story": [
      "It was a day before his performance at the historic Uptown Theater in downtown Kansas City, and Billy Brimblecom Jr. was already on fire. Drumming is his life's reason and rhythm. It's been that way ever since he first heard \"Wipe Out,\" that 1963 classic by The Surfers, on his dad's car radio. \"The drum solo, very famous, comes on, and I start doing that on the dash, very poorly, and he's like, 'Oh you wanna play the drums? All right!'\" Brimblecom said. \"At that moment, I was like, 'Yes, I do!'\"",
      "But 20 years ago, a doctor gave him news that he feared might have him walking to a different beat altogether: \"'Okay, there's a mass that's the size of a large apple in your ankle.' The last thing he said was, 'If it is a sarcoma, we have to remove the sarcoma, and everything that it is touching.' I said, 'So...?'\u00a0 And he said, 'The only reason you would lose your leg would be to save your life.'\"",
      "It was a sarcoma. Brimblecom went through 13 rounds of chemotherapy.\u00a0 \"The thing I feared the most was losing my leg,\" he said. \"You know, 'risking life or limb' is a turn of phrase. What does that imply? Second to death, the worst thing that you could think of is losing a limb.\"",
      "When the inevitable came, his leg was amputated right above the knee.",
      "Brimblecom's bandmates and friends rallied around him, including one of his oldest friends from Kansas City, Jason Sudeikis.",
      "Sudeikis is known as the title character in Apple TV's \"Ted Lasso,\" who has a gift for the aspirational: \"You know, I think that when you care about someone, and you got a little love in your heart, there ain't nothing you can't get through together, you know what I'm saying?\"",
      "That kind of understanding was just what Brimblecom needed from his friend, even if Sudeikis wasn't exactly sure what to say. \"You don't necessarily know how to \u2013 like, do you offer support? Solutions? You're sorta like, Oh, right, mortality. Okay,\" he said.",
      "The two had met at an improv workshop in Kansas City. Brimblecom went on to be a professional musician in Nashville, and Sudeikis landed on \"Saturday Night Live.\" In 2006, when Sudeikis learned insurance would only cover about half of Brimblecom's $60,000 prosthetic leg, he did what friends do.",
      "\"I remember you said, 'We'll just Kansas City the crap out of it!'\" Brimblecom recalled. \"And we knew what that meant.\"",
      "Sudeikis helped organize a good old fashioned Kansas City barbecue. It raised more than enough money to get Brimblecom a new leg. But that was actually the least of it. A fundraiser for a friend is now an annual friendly jam session, called Thundergong!",
      "Sudeikis brought plenty of others along for the ride, including fellow cast members like Hanna Waddingham, from \"Ted Lasso,\" and Will Forte, from \"SNL.\" They showed up to help simply because he asked.",
      "Asked how it feels, Sudeikis replied, \"Oh, it's the best. Like, last year, Flavor Flave, like, jumped in with two feet, and a clock!\"",
      "Will Forte & friends cover \"Soda Pop\" from \"KPop Demon Hunters\" at Thundergong! 2025:",
      "To date, Thundergong! has helped pay for prosthetic limbs for more than 2,000 amputees all over the country through a nonprofit called Steps of Faith, aiding amputees who lack health insurance, or have no prosthesis coverage with their health insurance. Brimblecom said, \"The thing that was preventing me from just walking around on a prosthetic leg versus using crutches, or being in a wheelchair, is insurance and money. You know, that shouldn't be a barrier.\"",
      "Brimblecom became the CEO of Steps of Faith after he tried to cheer up someone else who had lost their own leg, and he realized something: \"I went in, and I talked to the guy for five minutes. I don't even remember what I said, but I remember how I felt, and how he was looking at me. I could just see the excitement, and the hope in his eyes, and it was real positive. And I said, 'Gosh, I wish that could be my job.'\"",
      "It's not an easy job. About 500 people lose a limb every day in the U.S. The price of a prosthesis can be anywhere from a few thousand to more than $100,000. \"This is not, I can drive a Honda but choose a Ferrari,\" said Brimblecom. \"None of that applies when it comes to your limbs.\"",
      "Imagine you're a contractor like Josh Conner. In 2015 he fell two stories off a scaffolding. \"I figured if I landed on my feet, I'd be alright,\" he said. \"But that's wasn't the case.\"",
      "His heel was shattered; an infection did the rest, and he lost his leg.",
      "The first prosthesis Conner was given did not afford him very much mobility. It was all his worker's comp would pay for. He could walk with it, but not work in it.",
      "He was looking at a life on disability, until Billy Brimblecom and Steps of Faith stepped in. \"Billy just said, 'We gotcha,'\" Conner said.",
      "And what went through his mind? \"Total disbelief. It was a very emotional thing,\" Conner said.",
      "He is back to work now, on stilts no less, with a new prosthetic limb tailored specifically to him. \"Steps of Faith has given me my confidence back \u2013 you know, everything,\" Conner said. \"So, it's like a new life almost.\"",
      "Stories like that have not only kept Sudeikis coming back, but countless other actors and musicians as well. Many have become regulars, like Brendan Hunt, who sang a David Bowie song dressed as he did in \"Ted Lasso,\" as \"Piggy\" Stardust. \"The main thing is, this is a legit organization that does a really legit, you know, unimpeachably good thing,\" Hunt said. \"I would have to fight really hard to find a reason not to do it.\"",
      "It gets bigger every year, and this time around Thundergong! raised .. drum roll please \u2026 more than $1 million for Steps of Faith.",
      "Friendship is infectious. All the things friends do for each other? They're doing for strangers.",
      "\"It's about hope, confidence, surviving, and thriving,\" said Brimblecom.",
      "\"To do something that you love with people you love, to help people you may never meet, I wish it on everyone,\" said Sudeikis.",

    "published": "Sun, 14 Dec 2025 07:15:35 -0500",
    "summary": "Rod Metzer tried to gain sympathy from his ex-wife, Morgan Metzer, by pretending he had cancer, going as far as creating a diagnosis letter and a bill for his alleged treatment.",
    "story": [
      "In the early hours of New Year's Day 2021 in Canton, Georgia, Morgan Metzer was awakened to a terrifying sight. A man wearing a mask and all black clothing was standing at her bedroom doorway. The man ran and jumped on top of her. \"That's when he started pistol-whipping me,\" Morgan said. The assailant used zip ties to constrain her wrists before strangling her nearly unconscious twice.",
      "\"'You're gonna regret this, you've done really wrong now,'\" Morgan recalled the man told her in a deep and gravelly voice that he seemed to be trying to disguise. She said it sounded like Batman. Morgan Metzer's harrowing attack is the focus of this week's all-new \"48 Hours\" reported by contributor Nikki Battiste. An encore of \u00a0\"The 'Batman' Intruder\"\u00a0is\u00a0 now streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Afterward, the attacker placed a pillowcase over her head and picked Morgan up and left her on the back porch, which was connected to the bedroom. He told her not to move until she heard two car honks or he'd kill her. Then all went quiet except the sound of the stream near her secluded home.",
      "Forty minutes passed, but then terror struck again. Morgan heard someone walking towards her and up the porch steps. Initially terrified her attacker had returned, she was surprised to hear a familiar voice.",
      "\"'Oh honey, what happened?'\" Morgan remembered her ex-husband, Rod Metzer, said when he found her.",
      "Rod called 911 and law enforcement showed up to the scene. Rod's rescue of his ex-wife appeared to be an act of heroism.",
      "Rod said he had been looking out for Morgan despite their divorce, which came after a nearly 20-year history together. They started dating when Morgan was 14 and Rod was 17 before marrying in their early 20s. The couple had twins, who were spending a few days with Morgan's sister in Florida when the attack occurred.",
      "Morgan said her decision to file for divorce came after years of what she described as mental and physical abuse from Rod. Rod moved out of Morgan's home into his own apartment and Morgan was ready to move on. Their divorce was finalized just weeks before the attack.",
      "However, this new start for Morgan was cut short. Earlier in the week, Morgan said Rod called her with shocking news that he had pancreatic cancer.",
      "\"And so I rushed to go see him,\" Morgan told Battiste. \"He showed me doctors' notes and whatnot.\" She allowed Rod to stay at her home to help him cope with his diagnosis. \"I needed to be supportive still because it's the father of my children.\"",
      "During this time, Morgan said Rod was constantly trying to get back together with her. But she had no interest and on the morning of New Year's Eve, she told Rod he needed to share his health news with his parents.",
      "\"He said, 'No, absolutely not. I'm not telling anybody.' And that's when I was like, 'OK, get out,'\" Morgan recalled. Morgan said Rod left, but still spent the day texting her about reconciling. Fed up, Morgan lied and told Rod she was going to sleep at her parents' home that New Year's Eve night.",
      "How Rod knew Morgan was at her home, along with the coincidental timing of his arrival after her attack, raised questions with investigators who spoke to Rod at the scene. Rod said he was planning on spending the night at his apartment. However, he told them he heard someone knock on his ground floor apartment window and say Morgan's name. After Rod tried calling Morgan with no answer, he decided to drive to her house to check on her. He told investigators that going to her house instead of her parents' was just out of habit.",
      "After interviewing both Morgan and Rod at the scene, investigators became suspicious of Rod's story. They ordered search warrants on Rod's apartment, car and electronic devices, uncovering his internet search history. The searches included, \"How to get sympathy from your ex\" and \"How to change the sound of your voice.\" One search also stood out to investigators: \"cancer letter from hospital.\"",
      "Investigators also discovered a fake email account created by Rod, posing as a doctor, to send the cancer diagnosis letter that he showed Morgan. But there was even more.",
      "\"He had created a bill for a doctor's office to show that he was being treated for pancreatic cancer,\" said Rachel Ashe, the deputy chief assistant district attorney for Cherokee County. She said Rod \"did all of this in order to convince Morgan that he had pancreatic cancer.\" He never did.",
      "Rod Metzer eventually pleaded guilty to 14 counts relating to the attack on Morgan Metzer. He was sentenced to 70 years \u2014 25 in prison followed by an additional 45 years of probation.",

      "When Morgan Metzer glimpsed a masked figure standing in her bedroom doorway shortly after midnight on New Year's Day 2021, she thought she might just be seeing things. But then \u2014",
      "Morgan Metzer: He's standing there like a soldier, like with his fist clenched and like he was ready to go. \u2026 He ran at me and jumped on top of me. And that's when he started pistol-whipping me.",
      "Just hours earlier, she'd been ready to ring in the new year in Canton, Georgia, with her best friend, Nichole Stabasefski.",
      "Nichole Stabasefski: That's what we were looking forward to. \u2026 And I knew she was exhausted.",
      "It had been a long year for Morgan. Recently divorced, her 8-year-old twin son and daughter were spending a few days with her sister in Florida.",
      "Nichole Stabasefski: I mean we're moms. \u2026 We just wanted to hang out for a second. \u2026 We had planned for it.",
      "But after arriving at Stabasefski's, Morgan, feeling tired, decided to make it an early evening.",
      "Nichole Stabasefski: When she left, I did \u2014 I \u2014 I gave her some crap. I was like, \"what are you doing?\" \u2026 And I was like, \"You loser, fine, whatever. Text me when you get home, blah, blah, blah, see you tomorrow.\"",
      "A VIOLENT INTRUDER DRESSED IN BLACK",
      "Little could either friend have guessed that a short time later, Morgan would be in fear for her life. Her attacker had brought zip ties with him, already pre-looped and intertwined. He put Morgan's hands behind her back, slipped them on, and tightened them.",
      "Morgan Metzer: It's an out-of-body experience.",
      "Nikki Battiste: I can't imagine what you're thinking. What you're feeling.",
      "Morgan Metzer: Vulnerable, exposed. What's going to happen to my kids? \u2026 I haven't done a will. \u2026 I haven't talked to my family about who gets them. \u2026 I was like \u2026 \"they're not going to have a mom.\"",
      "Her assailant strangled her nearly unconscious twice.",
      "Morgan Metzer: It's the worst feeling in the world to think you're dying. And you feel like you're going to be tortured beforehand.",
      "Morgan's attacker sexually assaulted her.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Who did you think was attacking you?",
      "Morgan Metzer: I don't know. I just felt like it was some random person.",
      "In addition to the mask, the intruder had taken great pains to disguise himself.",
      "Morgan Metzer: Black \u2026 hoodie jacket. \u2026 Black pants, black gloves.",
      "He said very little, but when he did, Morgan says her assailant seemed to be disguising his voice \u2014 making it sound low and gravelly like the Batman movies. He also seemed to know about Morgan's personal life \u2014 specifically, her recent divorce.",
      "Nikki Battiste: He said something about your husband.",
      "Morgan Metzer: Yes. \"You're going to miss your husband.\" I said, \"No, don't hurt my husband.\"",
      "Morgan says her mind raced trying to piece together why this was happening to her.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I swear, I like went through my whole life in my head. That's how my brain was \u2026 just everywhere. I mean, 50,000 tabs opened up at one time in my brain.",
      "Her attacker demanded to know where Morgan kept her valuables.",
      "Morgan Metzer: \"Where's your jewelry? Where's,\" you know, \"all of your other nice stuff?\" And he is ripping out stuff out of my, you know, my drawers.",
      "And then \u2014",
      "Morgan Metzer: The attacker asked for my phone and the passcode to my phone.",
      "Morgan's house had an alarm system which she'd set before going to bed. An app on her phone controlled it, along with several security cameras around her home and a lock on the door of her second-floor bedroom which led out to a back porch.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I wasn't too sure what he was doing on my phone at the time until I heard a, uh, a door lock open, which was for the back porch.",
      "The attacker had unlocked the door remotely through that app on Morgan's phone. Morgan says he put a pillowcase over her head.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He got me out of the bed, walked me out to the back porch. I was naked \u2026 still with my zip tie handcuffs behind my back.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Did he just leave you there?",
      "Morgan Metzer: Yes.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did he say as he left?",
      "Morgan Metzer: He said, \"do not get up until you hear two car honks or I'll kill you.\"",
      "Morgan's property was secluded, with little chance of a neighbor seeing or hearing her on the back porch. And with that pillowcase over her head and the attacker's final words of warning ringing in her ears, Morgan had no way of knowing if he \u2014 or someone else \u2014 was watching her.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I just listened to the stream and tried to be as peaceful and calm as I could.",
      "Forty minutes passed. Then, a sound in the distance struck terror in Morgan all over again.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I hear somebody walking up.",
      "Unable to see, she feared her attacker had returned to finish the job.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I hear them shuffling, walking and they hit the stairs. \u2026 And I knew they were at the top when he hit the first board and it creaked really loud.",
      "That's when Morgan heard a very familiar voice.g",
      "Morgan Metzer: \"Oh honey, what happened?\"",
      "Morgan's grueling ordeal was finally over. And who would turn out to be her rescuer? Her ex-husband Rod Metzer.",
      "A HERO TO THE RESCUE?",
      "When Morgan's ex-husband Rod Metzer turned up at her house, he immediately called 911.",
      "911 DISPATCHER: Cherokee County 911.",
      "ROD METZER: Somebody \u2014 somebody broke in over here.",
      "ROD METZER: She was on the back porch. Uh, and \u2014 and the back door was wide open.",
      "ROD METZER: She was tied up with a hood over her head.",
      "As they waited for help to arrive, Rod tried to console Morgan. Their conversation heard on the 911 call.",

      "Nikki Battiste: Her hero.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers:\u00a0Absolutely.",
      "Sergeant Dakota Lyvers was a detective with the Cherokee County Sheriff's Department in 2021. He had a lot of questions. Exactly why had Rod gone to Morgan's home in the middle of the night?",
      "Rod moved out of Morgan's home and into his own apartment shortly after the divorce, said Lyvers.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: He was \u2026 getting ready for bed. He was brushing his teeth when he heard knocking on his window. Um, that knocking was accompanied by a voice in which he could only decipher the word \"Morgan\" was being said.",
      "Concerned, Rod said he tried calling Morgan, but she didn't answer.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did he say he was thinking? I mean, someone knocks on his window in the early morning hours of New Year's Day.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: He obviously went to the worst. Um, he thought that that something was, uh, gonna happen to Morgan or something might be happening to Morgan.",
      "Rod told investigators he'd gotten in his car and made the 12-minute drive over to his ex-wife's house. Despite being divorced, Rod said he was still looking out for Morgan. Their relationship stretched back nearly 20 years.",
      "Nikki Battiste: How old were you when you met Rod?",
      "Morgan Metzer: 14 years old.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Was it love at first sight?",
      "Morgan Metzer: Yes, it was. It was \u2014 it was scary how fast it was.",
      "Kathy Metzer: He was 17 at that time.",
      "Kathy Metzer is Rod's mother.",
      "Kathy Metzer: We were on the way to a baseball game and he said, \"Mom, you're gonna meet Morgan tonight.\" And I said, \"Who's Morgan?\" \"That's my girlfriend.\" And I said, \"What?\" He said, \"Be nice.\" (laughs)",
      "Nikki Battiste: Did Rod change at all when he was dating Morgan?",
      "Kathy Metzer: Oh, yeah. \u2026 There was nothing that she could mention that she didn't get.",
      "Nikki Battiste: How did he treat you?",
      "Morgan Metzer:\u00a0 Amazing. \u2026 He called me \"princess.\" And so he literally treated me like that.",
      "No one was surprised when the couple married in 2009. Morgan was 21 years old.",
      "Kathy Metzer: Morgan was one of the most gorgeous brides I've ever seen in my life.",
      "Kathy Metzer: Weather was perfect. It was outside, so thank goodness for the weather.",
      "Morgan Metzer: It was everything I dreamed of. My dad gave me everything I could want, you know. \u2026 It was just precious.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What was marriage like in the very beginning?",
      "Morgan Metzer: It was just awesome. \u2026 It's just you two. \u2026 You're mourning the loss of your, like, wedding being over (laughs) and your honeymoon. And it's like, \"I wanna go again!\"",
      "Unfortunately, their newly wedded bliss would be short-lived. Eight months after the wedding, Rod's younger brother Kevin, who wished the couple \"endless years of love, health and happiness,\" at their wedding, lost his battle with leukemia at the age of 19.",
      "Kathy Metzer: It really hit Rod hard. I mean, it \u2014 I don't think he was ever the same after that. \u2026 He depended on Morgan at that point, more than he did anybody. I don't think he left her side for more than an hour or two.",
      "But the next year would bring some good news to celebrate.",
      "Morgan Metzer: We got pregnant with our son.",
      "Morgan says picking his name was easy.",
      "Morgan Metzer: Kevin always wanted to be an uncle. He always talked about it, how much fun he would have.",
      "Kathy Metzer: They named him Kevin after my Kevin, Rod's brother. (cries)",
      "But the family would suffer a second, and devastating, loss. Baby Kevin was born early, with a congenital heart defect. He lived just 18 days.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He actually died on his due date.",
      "Nikki Battiste: The loss of a child is unthinkable and I would imagine tough for you and Rod.",
      "Morgan Metzer: Very tough. \u2026 Don't really remember a lot of it. It's a big blur with all the emotions.",
      "So it seemed like a miracle when, just three months later, Morgan discovered she was pregnant again. Kathy remembers the moment Rod showed her the ultrasound picture.",
      "Kathy Metzer: He says, \"what do you see?\" I said, \"a baby.\" He said, \"No. Look, what do you see?\" And I just screamed at the top of my lungs, \"two babies,\" you know. (laughs)",
      "Nikki Battiste: Twins.",
      "Kathy Metzer: Twins. They were gonna have twins.",
      "Morgan gave birth to a healthy boy and girl in 2012. It should have been a happy time but not long after, the marriage began to change.",
      "Morgan Metzer: Probably about a year after they were born, which is right around the time that Rod lost his job, is when it started going down south from there.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did Rod do for work?",
      "Morgan Metzer: He, he had so many jobs. His main one, when he lost all of his money, was he was being a day trader for himself.",
      "Rod's job loss happened to come at the same time Morgan's career was starting to flourish.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I started my own interior design business and it took off. \u2026 I just didn't expect it to boom and blow up.",
      "Morgan's company, Shiplap and Sugar, became so successful she asked Stabasefski to join her.",
      "Nichole Stabasefski: She was saying, you know, like \"I need help, I'm overwhelmed.\"",
      "Nikki Battiste: So you became business partners?",
      "Nichole Stabasefski: Yeah. \u2026 Making money. \u2026 Working our tails off, doing what we love.",
      "Morgan says her professional success, and Rod's lack of it, made for a dangerous combination. She says he began to abuse her \u2014 both physically and mentally. She recalls one Labor Day weekend. She and Rod were celebrating on a boat with friends and had just returned to their cabin.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I guess we had gotten into an argument about something, \u2026 that's the first night he beat the \u2014 he beat me.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Did you think, he hit me. I've gotta get out of here?",
      "Morgan Metzer: Yes. I had my dad come and get me.",
      "Shockingly, Morgan says Rod tried to convince her, and the people closest to her, that she was to blame for her injuries.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He convinced my parents that I was the one that did it.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did he say?",
      "Morgan Metzer: \"You were just out of control. You \u2014 you \u2014 you couldn't keep your temper. You were just whaling all over the place.\"",
      "Morgan says Rod claimed she got hurt because he was forced to physically restrain her.",
      "Morgan Metzer: And I'm like, OK, well, maybe that's my fault. \u2026 And my friends stopped talking to me then because he had no marks on him. It was all me.",
      "Morgan says that's when a new phase in the marriage began, one in which she started to doubt her own reality because, she says, Rod was gaslighting her \u2014 making her think every conflict Rod instigated actually began with her.",
      "Nichole Stabasefski: I think she thought she was crazy. You know, you get programmed to think that you're crazy, like it's all in your head.",
      "Morgan says Rod even involved their children in his deception.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He pretended I pushed him down the stairs and he literally rolled down the stairs. You know, he actually got hurt and said to the kids, \"Look, Mommy pushed me downstairs. Can you believe that?\"",
      "Morgan says Rod sexually abused her as well, although she says it took a while for her to recognize what it was.",
      "Morgan Metzer: A lot of times he's very aggressive and wouldn't take the word no. And so now looking back on it, I guess he did sexually abuse me.",
      "Morgan filed for divorce in 2020.",
      "Nikki Battiste: When Morgan decided to \u2026 go through with the divorce, how was she handling it?",
      "Nichole Stabasefski: You know, it was the first time I think I saw her have peace.",
      "The divorce was final in December and Morgan was ready to move on. But now, in the early morning hours of New Year's Day, it appeared Rod had come back into her life as her hero.",
      "CRITICAL CLUES IN THE INVESTIGATION",
      "Sergeant Lyvers and Sergeant Robert Haugh recall that when they first arrived at Morgan's house at 3 a.m. Rod's behavior had struck them as unusual.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: So, as we were walking up \u2026 Rodney was, um, seated in his car right here \u2026 with another deputy.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Did he say anything?",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: Yeah, he did. \u2026 He asked, \"Hey man, are you the guy that we've been waiting on? And I said, \"uh, yes, sir, I am.\" And then he replied, \"do your f****** job.\"",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did you think?",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: I was taken aback. I really was.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: This guy just had found his wife bound, um, and beaten on the back porch. And you would think that my arrival to help find a resolution to this, uh, would be welcoming.",
      "Immediately, Morgan's appearance startled the investigators.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: Her eye was swollen shut, black and blue. \u2026 She still had the, uh, zip tie around her one wrist. And I was shocked, and I had seen a lot in my career. And, uh, I was surprised that somebody would \u2014 would be so harsh.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did it make you think?",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: Somebody was mad.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: Absolutely. It was an emotional attack.",
      "Morgan was not only physically injured; investigators could tell she had suffered psychologically after the attacker left her.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: She was in fear that she was \u2014 someone was still back here watching her and that they were gonna kill her if she moved. And so she laid here and waited.",
      "Morgan was outside for 40 minutes before Rod arrived, but initially she thought it was just half that.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: Morgan believed it to be somewhere around 15 to 20 minutes, max. Um, that was her perception of time.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Interesting. I would've thought the opposite, that would've felt longer for her.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: I agree. \u2026 When their adrenaline's going, you know, people perceive things differently.",
      "The first thing Lyvers and Haugh did was separate Morgan, Rod and Morgan's father and brother \u2014 who came over after she called them. Then Lyvers recorded his conversation with Morgan inside the house.",
      "Safely out of earshot of her ex-husband, who was standing just outside, Morgan told investigators that she suspected her attacker was the man pretending to be her hero.",
      "MORGAN METZER: I just thought it was him.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: When you say \"him,\" you're talking about your ex-husband?",
      "MORGAN METZER: Mm-hmm.",
      "Morgan said she had no idea who her assailant was when the attack began, but then came one critical moment.",
      "Morgan Metzer: When he said \u2026 \"you're going to miss your husband,\" I said, \"no, don't hurt my husband. I love him very much.\" And I don't know what made me do that. But at that exact moment is when \u2026 the mood of the room changed. I knew I was going to live.",
      "And then there was another, even bigger clue, when her attacker lifted Morgan off the bed to place her outside.",
      "Morgan Metzer: That's when I really knew it was him.",
      "Morgan remembered something from years earlier.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I was pregnant with my kids, my twins. And sometimes you have to get help out of the bed. \u2026 The way he gently held me and got me out of bed, it was so familiar that I was like, this is him. I know it's 100% percent him.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I wasn't going to let him know that I knew it was him. Because if he did then he \u2014 I didn't know what he was going to do.",
      "She told them the attack had followed a chaotic week which began with very troubling news.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He thinks he's got pancreatic cancer.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He just called me \u2026 \u00a0and said, \"I've got pancreatic cancer.\" And so I rushed to go see him. \u2026 I said, \"you're the father of my children. \u2026 I'm here for you.\"",
      "Morgan Metzer: He showed me doctor's notes and whatnot.",
      "Rod had told no one else and Morgan explained that she'd been letting him stay at her house.",

      "Morgan told the investigators that Rod had spent the week trying to reconcile with her.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He kept begging me to get back together with me. \u2026 Just constantly haggling me.",
      "But Morgan says she had no interest. By the morning of Dec. 31, she'd had enough. Feeling the pressure of being his sole emotional support, Morgan insisted Rod share his health news with his parents.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He said, \"no, absolutely not. I'm not telling anybody.\" And that's when I was like, \"OK, get out.\"",
      "Morgan says Rod spent the day texting her.",
      "Morgan Metzer: \"You need to get back with me. I'll make enough money. You can quit your job right now.\"",
      "Fed up with it all, Morgan lied and told Rod she'd be sleeping elsewhere that New Year's Eve night.",
      "Morgan Metzer: \"Staying at my parents' house tonight. I'm turning my phone off.\" Like, give me some space.",
      "As Morgan shared her suspicions with investigators, she didn't know if they would accept what she was telling them.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I've been mentally, emotionally, physically abused.",
      "Because Rod made her feel like she was to blame for years.",
      "Morgan Metzer: That's what he's built in my brain.",
      "But that all changed when Lyvers told her he believed her.",
      "Morgan Metzer: And I just melted. \u2026 He heard me. I have not been heard in years. Nobody listened. Nobody heard me and he heard me.",
      "Rachel Ashe: That started the investigation into Rodney Metzer.",
      "Rachel Ashe is the Deputy Chief Assistant District Attorney for Cherokee County. She works exclusively on domestic violence cases. Parker, an emotional support dog, is often with her to comfort victims. Ashe says investigators were perplexed that Rod had come to Morgan's house that night after she'd told him she'd be at her parents' home.",
      "Rachel Ashe: Why did you even come here? Why didn't you go to her parents' house? Why didn't \u2014 why didn't you check with her parents?",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: He claimed it was just habit, normal.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: \"It's what I would do.\"",
      "Nikki Battiste: Were you scratching your heads?",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: Yeah.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: A little bit.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: We questioned him on it.",
      "Rod said that after hearing that knocking on his window, and someone saying Morgan's name, he tried phoning Morgan to warn her. Haugh wanted to check.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: I think that's what prompted, \"hey, where's your phone?\"",
      "Rod handed his cellphone to the investigators.",
      "Rachel Ashe: Gave them permission to look through his phone.",
      "And what they found came as a surprise.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: It was an Apple iPhone, and it had a hidden folder. \u2026 And in the hidden folder were images of Morgan \u2014 um, partially dressed.",
      "Rachel Ashe: A lot of photos of Morgan nude and those photos of Morgan nude, it was pretty apparent that she didn't know he was taking those photos of her.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: She was quite alarmed.",
      "Investigators also discovered Rod had snapped pictures of Morgan's cellphone showing text messages between her and another man. They considered these and the photos of Morgan to be an invasion of privacy.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: You didn't have that permission. Y'all don't have that relationship. She's f****** baffled that you have that. That's stalkerish.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: We knew we had to \u2026 get him in custody \u2026 while we started doing search warrants and started investigating \u2026 to prevent him from destroying evidence.",
      "ROD METZER: People make mistakes, man.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: I think you made a lot of mistakes.",
      "SGT. ROBERT HAUGH: Big, big mistakes.",
      "Nikki Battiste: So you arrested him for having taken those photos secretly?",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: That's correct.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: Stand up.",
      "ROD METZER: You're kidding me?",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: Nope, we're not kidding you. Stand up. This is not a joke. C'mon.",
      "But could investigators prove that Rod had attacked Morgan that night?",
      "ZIP TIES AND ALARMING INTERNET SEARCHES",
      "Morgan Metzer: Watched him get, uh, arrested, walk to the car, and be put in. It was kind of like, is this really happening?",
      "Nikki Battiste: Was any part of you sad?",
      "Morgan Metzer: No, not at the time. It was angry and just sore.",
      "Even as they booked Rod for taking those pictures of Morgan and her texts, Haugh and Lyvers had already developed a theory about why Rod might have attacked her.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: I believe, he thought he was going to come in and \u2014 and rescue her and be the savior and, uh \u2014 and win her back.",
      "Investigators hoped home security cameras would support their theory. But they quickly learned that all the video from the time of the attack had been erased through the app on Morgan's phone that the assailant had used to unlock her back porch door when he left. Morgan's attacker took her phone with him. It was never recovered.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Were you ever able to retrieve those missing videos from the security company?",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: No. \u2026 Once videos are deleted, they're deleted from their cloud.",
      "But since Morgan had a home security system, how did the attacker get in without setting off the alarm? It did not take long to figure out.",
      "Nikki Battiste: This is the window the attacker entered?",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: That's correct. Right here is the, uh \u2014 the window that we found the screen was actually removed.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: That basement window \u2026 had an alarm sensor that was removed from the window and put together on the windowsill. So, if the window was to open, it would appear, you know, to the alarm system that the sensor is still making contact.",
      "Investigators believed Rod had disabled the sensor while he was staying at Morgan's house that week.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I was sleeping. It was in the middle of the night.",
      "Although the home security videos had been erased, there was other video from prior to the attack. The camera on Morgan's front porch caught Rod earlier that evening.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He had sent me a picture of a check\u2026. And he's like, \"it's underneath your front porch.\"",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: It was for $56,000 and change.",
      "Morgan says the message Rod sent with the picture of the check made it seem like he was trying to make a grand gesture.",
      "Morgan Metzer: \"You should have all the money. You deserve everything,\" pretty much in a nutshell.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: I think it was to get her to come back to the house that evening because \u2026 she told Rodney she was gonna be at her parents' house for New Year's.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: Morgan returned to the house, retrieved it, and kind of made some sort of a \u2014 uh \u2014 of a gesture and she walked back into the house and put it on the kitchen countertop.",
      "Morgan's attacker took that check with him. It was never found.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did you find out about Rod's finances?",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers:: That check would've bounced.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: Yeah, he was broke.",
      "The day after his arrest, investigators executed search warrants on Rod's car and his apartment. As soon as they walked through the door, they found a key piece of evidence.",
      "Rachel Ashe: They located this bag of zip ties in his apartment. And \u2026 a portion of a zip tie.",
      "Before arriving at her house, Morgan's attacker had pre-looped the zip ties he'd put on her wrists.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: He was working in the dark. He was handcuffing somebody. You never know how much fight that person's going to put up.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: One of the zip ties actually, um, was pretty unique because it had two, um \u2014 other zip ties that had been, uh, ratcheted onto it and then cut. And so basically what we were looking at was a \u2014 a zip tie that had two extra heads.",
      "Haugh and Lyvers needed to find out if that portion of a zip tie, essentially a tail, found in Rod's apartment, lined up with one of the extra heads on Morgan's restraints. They headed to their crime lab.",
      "Nikki Battiste: So these are the zip ties that were actually found on Morgan?",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: Yes, they are.",
      "Melanie Thrasher is a crime scene technician.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: She was able to match the \u2014 this tail to one of the heads on the zip tie for Morgan's wrist.",
      "The striations on the tail found in Rod's apartment lined up exactly with those on Morgan's zip tie. A \"perfect match\" said Haugh.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did you think when you saw this?",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: That we were going to be adding charges to his, uh, existing booking. \u2026 And we had our guy. \u2026 I would've never, you know, imagined, uh, having a piece of evidence like this.",
      "But the search warrant of Rod's apartment yielded even more. There was a book \u2014",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: \"7 Ways to \u2014",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: \"To Be Her Hero.\"",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: \u2014 \"Be Her Hero,\" to \u2014 to win somebody back.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: That gave us the motive. \u2026 It added to that motive.",
      "Investigators examined Rod's browser history.",
      "Rachel Ashe:\u00a0 The searches \u2026 were very disturbing.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: He was researching \"how to change your voice.\"",
      "Rachel Ashe: \"How long to choke somebody unconscious.\"",
      "The searches also included \"How to crack an iPhone password,\" \"How to get sympathy from your ex\" and one that was especially appalling.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: He Google searched \u2026 \"cancer diagnosis letters.\"",
      "Investigators searched Rod's outgoing emails. There they found Rod had set up a fake email account to create the pancreatic cancer diagnosis letter he'd shown Morgan. And there was more.",
      "Rachel Ashe: He had created a bill for a doctor's office to show that he was being treated for pancreatic cancer. \u2026 All of this in order to convince Morgan that he had pancreatic cancer.",
      "Nikki Battiste: He wasn't sick at all?",
      "Rachel Ashe: No. \u2026 He did not have cancer.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Do you think that he faked the cancer diagnosis as a way to try to get you back or as a way to get access to your house 'cause he had this plan?",
      "Morgan Metzer: I think it was to get me back. It might have been both.",
      "On Jan. 3, two days after the attack, Lyvers and Sergeant Tom Harris interviewed Rod. They talked to him about his health.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: You said you're diabetic",
      "ROD METZER: Yes.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: What other kind of health issues do you have?",
      "ROD METZER: Nothing as far as I know of yet.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: I thought you had cancer.",
      "Lyvers confronted Rod about the cancer diagnosis he'd faked to Morgan.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: How did you tell her that \u2026 this \u2014 this cancer thing?",
      "ROD METZER: I don't know if I should talk to you guys anymore. I'm starting to get a really bad feeling. What angle you guys are coming from.",
      "Then Rod tried to turn the tables \u2014 by attempting to take the upper hand in the interview.",
      "ROD METZER: I've already learned something about you, that your facial expressions.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: Tell me.",
      "ROD METZER: And you keep scratching yourself, and you get agitated by what I say.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: I'm a 100% not agitated.",
      "ROD METZER: Mm-hmm.",
      "The investigators also questioned Rod about his internet searches.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: Has there been a time recently where you were interested in how you can change the sound of your voice?",
      "ROD METZER: Maybe.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: Tell me about that.",
      "ROD METZER: I felt like I wasn't \u2014 my voice wasn't manly enough.",
      "Then Harris lowered the boom.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: The, uh, most significant thing that we found in your apartment was a collection of zip ties.",
      "ROD METZER: Zip ties?",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: Black zip ties.",
      "ROD METZER: I don't have zip ties.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: I know you don't. We have 'em now.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: These are identical to the ones that were, uh, binding Morgan's wrists.",
      "ROD METZER: This is just starting to get squirrelly.",
      "Harris told Rod about that zip tie tail they'd recovered.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: We compared that microscopically to the zip ties that were on Morgan's wrists when the deputies found her. And wouldn't you know it? It is a perfect cut.",
      "ROD METZER: There's something funny going on here.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: Did somebody break in and put 'em there?",
      "ROD METZER: There's something funny going on here.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: Like what?",
      "ROD METZER: I don't know.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: What do you think's going on?",
      "ROD METZER: I didn't have some big-ass f****** zip ties in my apartment.",
      "But new evidence was about to say otherwise.",
      "ROD METZER PLEADS GUILTY",
      "Hours after the interview with Rod Metzer concluded, he was charged with 10 counts related to the attack on Morgan Metzer \u2014 including home invasion, kidnapping, aggravated assault, and sexual battery.",
      "MORGAN METZER: As soon as I felt that gun right here in my head, I was like \u2014",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: So, you thought \u2014",
      "MORGAN METZER: \"All right, Jesus, I'm coming.\"",
      "The next day Morgan, with her friend Nichole by her side, talked to investigators again.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: You thought you were gonna die?",
      "MORGAN METZER: Yep. I thought I was dead. But then also part of me was like, no, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna let myself die. \u2026 I have gotta fight for my kids.",
      "Harris told Morgan they'd watched the home security video of Rod arriving at her house after her attack. He rang the front doorbell but when there was no response, headed around to the back.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: I thought it was kind of interesting that he called out your name as he's walking around the side of your house.",
      "MORGAN METZER: Yes. \u2026 Like, why would you think I was outside.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What was your reaction when you learned Rod had been arrested for violently attacking Morgan?",
      "Kathy Metzer: Oh, that \u2014 that absolutely threw me under the ground. \u2026 There had to be a mistake. Rod wasn't capable of that.",
      "Two days after Rod was charged he talked to his mom Kathy on the phone.",
      "ROD METZER (jail phone call): Why is she doing this to me? She knows it wasn't me.",
      "But the evidence kept mounting. When investigators recovered those zip ties from Rod's apartment, the bag they came in was found as well.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: I brought up a \u2014 a, uh, my Lowe's app on my phone and scanned the UPC code and the UPC code came back that they were in fact sold at Lowe's.",
      "Rachel Ashe: The sheriff's office then went to the two Lowe's that we have here in Cherokee County. \u2026 And they started searching for transactions.",
      "It didn't take long. Rod Metzer had purchased those zip ties on Dec. 30 \u2014 about 36 hours before the attack; easy to find because he paid with his debit card. Investigators obtained the security video from Lowe's.",
      "Rachel Ashe: This was during COVID and this was during a period where everybody was wearing a mask, except for Rodney Metzer. So the surveillance images and the videos that were recovered from Lowe's of him purchasing those zip ties \u2026 his face is right there in the camera.",
      "Next came the security video from Rod's apartment building.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: There's actually one inside the, uh \u2014 the breezeway there, which leads to Rodney's apartment specifically.",
      "Lyvers says there was no video of Rod leaving after he said someone knocked on his window.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: What we do see is after the time of the incident that Morgan was attacked, Rodney come in, disheveled, in a hurry.",
      "Just four minutes later, Rod is caught on camera again, leaving the building, wearing completely different clothes and sneakers, and carrying a plastic bag. The time stamp was 1:24 a.m.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: We never found that bag in his car when we did the search warrant.",
      "Rachel Ashe: We just don't know where that went.",
      "Investigators can't know for sure what was in that bag but believe it had evidence Rod discarded on his drive back to Morgan's house. The attacker's mask was never found. But Deputy Chief Assistant District Attorney Rachel Ashe says they had more than enough to prove Rod was guilty.",
      "Rachel Ashe: This is a prosecutor's dream to put up because the evidence in this case was overwhelming, overwhelming.",
      "But Ashe says she wanted to offer Morgan an opportunity for quicker closure than a trial would bring in the form of a plea deal for Rod.",
      "Rachel Ashe: We went through the pros and cons of letting him plead guilty, letting him accept responsibility. \u2026 We agreed, um, we should try. He took it quickly.",
      "On Aug. 4, 2021, Rod pleaded guilty to a total of 14 counts related to Morgan's attack and the photos found on his phone.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: He agreed to serve 25 years on a 70-year sentence. So, when he gets out in 25 years, he'll serve another 45 years of probation.",
      "Nikki Battiste: I think you even described it as like a death.",
      "Morgan Metzer: It is a death. I've lost my husband. He's dead to me.",
      "At Rod's sentencing, Morgan delivered a victim impact statement several pages long.",
      "Morgan Metzer: Once I got started, it just started pouring outta me.",
      "There were no cameras in the courtroom. \"48 Hours\" asked Morgan to read her statement. Here's a portion of it.",
      "Morgan Metzer (reading her victim impact statement): Rod, not only will this statement be to my attacker, but it'll also be my last words to whom I thought was the love of my life. \u2026 The last four years being married to you was like living with a monster that constantly tried to break me down and fence me in. \u2026 It was a blessing in disguise. \u2026 I can now walk with the confidence knowing the pain you have given me is turned into power.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I walked off that stand with a thousand pounds off of my shoulders. It felt so good. It felt empowering. And I got the last word.",
      "Nikki Battiste: How was it to listen to your best friend read this incredibly powerful statement?",
      "Nichole Stabasefski: It was awesome because she did not cry. \u2026 Her voice did not shake \u2026 and she said everything she needed to say, and when she was done, she was done.",
      "Rachel Ashe: She was laying to rest this relationship. She was telling him this: \"I'm never going to be yours,\" right? \"I'm never going to be yours.\"",
      "Rod's actions that New Year's Day continue to affect everyone.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Have you been able to visit Rod in person at all?",
      "Kathy Metzer: He hasn't wanted me to.",
      "Nikki Battiste:\u00a0 Why?",
      "Kathy Metzer: He's afraid of my reaction.",
      "Rod has from Type 1 diabetes and Kathy says his health is rapidly declining in prison.",
      "Nikki Battiste: You're worried he could die.",
      "Kathy Metzer: Oh, I'm absolutely worried he's going to die.",
      "Morgan says once the ordeal was behind her, she had to take steps so she could recover, seeking therapy to help her cope.",
      "Morgan Metzer: Everything happens for a reason. God has everything happen for a reason. And I'm starting to see that right now. There's just a lot of great things that are happening with us.",
      "She says she is focused on raising her children, and helping others who find themselves in similar circumstances.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I'm trying to raise awareness for \u2026 narcissism and gaslighting. \u2026 I want to help women realize they're in a situation before it gets too bad.",
      "Nichole Stabasefski: I'm just excited to see who she continues to grow to become. \u2026 She's \u2026 beautiful and strong and resilient. So this is just a steppingstone in her journey.",

      "Joanna had tried to leave Lewis many times before, says Patricia. There was a history of abuse and a cycle that began not long after the couple started seeing each other in high school. At 17, Patricia says, Joanna came home with a black eye.",
      "Patricia Hunter: And I begged her. I said, let's go to the hospital. Let's go to the police \u2026 and she said, \"no, mom, no.\"",

      "After his statement, Mark Lewis was released. Lewis was not asked about his history of abuse or about his prior conviction.",
      "That information was more than 15 years old, says Harris, and not available to the deputy in the field.",
      "The next day, an external autopsy determined the ligature marks on Joanna's neck were consistent with suicide.",
      "A month later, when the toxicology report came back clean, the case was closed. And so began the tug-of-war between the family and the sheriff's department that would go on for years to come.",

      "Joe Hunter: My mom begged her not to go back. \u2026 on her knees, begging her. \u2026 And my mom said, OK, well, I'll drive you.",
      "Natalie Morales: How much do you think of that moment and that drive, taking her back?",
      "Patricia Hunter: All the time.",

      "A FAMILY'S ANGUISH",
      "Joe Hunter: Joanna \u2026 was the perfect person. \u2026 She was the life of the party, but she was also at the same time \u2026 probably the most compassionate, warm person I've ever known.",

      "Patricia Hunter: She thought Joseph was her gift. \u2026 Someone gave her this adorable little boy and he belonged to her.",
      "Joe Hunter: I always tried to be in charge, but she wouldn't let that happen. \u2026 Anybody that called the house \u2026 they had to go through Joanna first. \u2026 \"and you wanna talk to my brother? Why?\" (laughs) \u2026 She protected me a lot. \u2026 we were the perfect team.",
      "Mark Lewis, the son of a local preacher, was Joanna's first boyfriend. At the start, Joe didn't think he had anything to worry about.",
      "Joe Hunter: The first, maybe six to eight months, she seemed really happy.",
      "But after the abuse began, Joe confronted Mark more than once.",
      "Joe Hunter: After physically going after him \u2026 him then taking it out on her. \u2026 I had to back off a little bit from my sister. \u2026 I had been screaming at her for so long, two years straight. \u2026 I hate this guy, leave this guy, please stop. \u2026 I thought I'm gonna lose her for good. \u2026 So, I'm just gonna listen. \u2026 And then I really got the deep, deep, deep, dark secrets that she wasn't even telling my parents.",
      "And Joanna showed him her wounds.",

      "Mark Lewis had grown more powerful and influential at the Fellowship Baptist Church. He was on his way to becoming pastor.",
      "After they married, Patricia says she went to Lewis with her fears.",
      "Patricia Hunter: And I said to him \u2026 how do I know in this moment that you will never lay a hand on her again? \u2026 And I'll never forget. He kind of sneered, half smile and he looked at me and said, when she's a better woman and a better Christian, you won't have to worry about that.",
      "Joe Hunter: My sister started saying comments that he would make to her like, hey, we can help save you. Because you're half black, we can help fix that through religion. Because of your hair and the way you look, we can fix that with religion. \u2026 And you just think, how dare you?",
      "Pastor Lewis, to hear former church members tell it, was a commanding and a demanding presence with fiery sermons and an insistence on loyalty.",

      "Jacob Cantrell become a deacon there.",
      "Jacob Cantrell: I looked up to him \u2026 he was a \u2026 mentor \u2026 only to find out that I was a pawn.",
      "In hindsight, Cantrell says, Pastor Lewis had too much control over him.",
      "Jacob Cantrell: I couldn't go to my mom and dad's house \u2026 without asking Mark permission. \u2026 I was brainwashed. \u2026 he manipulated me for many years and it \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 it twisted my brain up.",
      "MARK LEWIS (preaching in church): There's no accidents with God.",

      "Natalie Morales: Now, you feel that way?",
      "Jacob Cantrell: Now, I feel that way.",
      "Daryl Snedeker: I came to the conclusion that it was probably the closest thing to a cult that I had ever experienced.",
      "Natalie Morales: And he was the leader \u2026",
      "Daryl Snedeker: The leader.",
      "Daryl Snedaker was a deputy in the Solano County Sheriff's Office and a member of the church at the time of Joanna's death. He wasn't involved in the investigation back then. At the church, he says, it didn't take long for him to lose all faith in the place and the pastor.",
      "Natalie Morales: Was there a fear then amongst the people who attended the church, did they fear Mark Lewis?",
      "Daryl Snedeker: I think the people that were his puppets, I think they acted out of fear a lot.",
      "Natalie Morales: You did whatever he asked then?",

      "Daryl Snedeker: It's disheartening. It's shocking.",
      "Joe already knew\u00a0 Lewis all too well and the years after Joanna's death were filled with anguish and frustration.",
      "Joe Hunter: No one was listening to us, no one was believing this.",
      "There were still so many questions about what happened that night. Why didn't Lewis cut Joanna down or try to administer CPR? And Joe found it particularly hard to believe Lewis was actually playing basketball for six straight hours.",
      "Joe Hunter: You never went inside to use the restroom, get a glass of water \u2026 playing basketball for this obscene amount of time \u2026 is absurd to me.",
      "But all their attempts to get the sheriff's office to take another look at Lewis were getting no results \u2014 until Patricia got a knock on the door.",
      "Patricia Hunter: It was \u2026 a reporter asking if we had heard about what had happened with him. I had no idea what he was talking about.",
      "It was 2014. Joanna had been dead a little more than two years. Pastor Mark Lewis had been arrested \u2014 accused of violence against another woman.",

      "SARAH NOTTINGHAM'S HARROWING NIGHT",
      "On that crisp fall day in 2011 when Pastor Mark Lewis said he found his wife dead, he never called Joanna's family. He did call Sarah Nottingham.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: He had asked if I heard what happened, he sounded upset. He was crying.",
      "At the time, Nottingham says, she believed in her pastor \u2014 Joanna had died by suicide. Sarah says she and Lewis became friends, then began dating about a year after Joanna's death.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: At first, it was somewhat exciting thinking that \u2026 I'm seeing a side of this person that no one else is seeing.",
      "Eventually, Nottingham says another side of Mark Lewis began to emerge.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: A lot of ... extreme manipulation, a lot of gaslighting, and a lot of verbal abuse, um, some physical. ... A push or a shove. ... And it was just more and more.",
      "And then, she says, she discovered that Lewis had been sending inappropriate text messages to an underage girl.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: You know, I'm just like, I've had enough, like, I'm done. And he said, I'm not ready for it to be over. \u2026 I would just keep telling him, you know, this is, it's over, we're done.",
      "Lewis grabbed her, she says, and tightly wrapped his arms around her.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: It was meant to be threatening. He squeezed me tight and told me, \"You've created a monster.\"",
      "Nottingham and her two young children were living with her parents in Vacaville as the pastor's threats, she says, became more frequent and frightening.",
      "Sarah Nottingham (outside her former home): The first time ... my car was vandalized, it was actually parked here (pointing at the driveway).",
      "Sarah Nottingham: He had, either himself or had somebody, smash my windshield in on my car.",
      "Nottingham was granted an order of protection against Lewis. But it did not stop what happened next in the early morning hours of Jan. 9, 2014.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: It was three something in the morning. And I woke up to our um fire alarm going off \u2026 and there was um smoke filling the hallway. And I checked on my kids.",
      "A Molotov cocktail had crashed through her parents' bedroom window.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: We were able to put the fire out ourselves. \u2026 I had never seen my dad run so fast out the door, trying to see if he could see anybody.",
      "Vacaville Police pulled over a U-Haul van within minutes, arresting the driver and two passengers. The trio quickly confessed, telling police they were hired to firebomb Sarah Nottingham's house \u2014 hired by the pastor, Mark Lewis. He was questioned by local reporters.",
      "MARK LEWIS (KVOR news report): I never\u00a0\u2014\u00a0I never gave them any money to do anything bad.",

      "Natalie Morales: What do you think you and your family survived at that time?",
      "Sarah Nottingham: Ultimately, death. \u2026 When the police came into the house, one of them said this is attempted murder and that's exactly what it was, nothing less.",

      "Natalie Morales: How do you see her death?",
      "Sarah Nottingham: By him. \u2026 There's just not a doubt in my mind.",
      "By January 2015, Lewis' thundering sermons that echoed in the Fellowship Baptist Church were a distant memory as he sat silently in a Solano County courtroom. Lewis' trial had begun for stalking Sarah Nottingham and hiring people to firebomb her parents' home.",
      "Joe Hunter: I hear about the arson charge. I hear about the stalking. \u2026 But I also feel that he needs to be convicted \u2026 for what he did to my sister.",
      "On day three of Lewis' arson and stalking trial, he changed his plea from not guilty to no contest \u2014 meaning he would not dispute the charges against him but also would not acknowledge guilt. Lewis was sentenced to eight years in prison.",
      "Natalie Morales: How important was that development then in allowing you to then go back to the sheriff's office and demand that they reopen the case?",
      "Patricia Hunter: It was huge, because there was \u2014   it isn't often that you read about a pastor hiring people to firebomb someone's house. ... Because of media pressure, we felt that now is the time where we can go back and say, \"Look at Joanna's case. Reopen it.\"",
      "The Solano County Sheriff's Office did reopen the case in 2014. Remember the churchgoer who called 911 the night Joanna died? His name is Andrew Alvarado. Back then he told authorities that he had played basketball with Pastor Mark Lewis for about six hours. Detectives decided to reinterview him and recorded the call.",
      "DETECTIVE MEHL (phone call): Was anyone else playing basketball with you?",
      "ANDREW ALVARADO: Yeah, a couple other \u2026 teenagers.",
      "This time, investigators learned a new detail.",
      "ANDREW ALVARADO (phone call): I left to go drop them off. I guess I had to go eat dinner or whatever.",
      "He had actually left the church grounds during those six hours to drive the teenagers home, he says, and wasn't sure what the pastor was doing while he was gone. \"48 Hours\" repeatedly reached out to Alvarado but never heard back.",
      "Natalie Morales: So there were gaps of time when he was not with Mark Lewis.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: Right. \u2026 That still does not change the fact that \u2026 the lack of evidence on her body does not show a second person involved in her death.",
      "Mark Lewis was not questioned during the reinvestigation.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: He ... \u2026 exercised his constitutional right to have his attorney, who did not allow him to speak to us.",
      "The sheriff's office had another forensic pathologist look at Joanna's case. Dr. Scott Luzi agreed with the original coroner: suicide. The case was closed again. And then in 2015, the county district attorney's office announced its own investigation, which included DNA testing on Joanna's bathrobe sash. The results? Her DNA was found on the sash along with an unknown male \u2014  not Mark Lewis.",
      "Natalie Morales: Was anything done to investigate that further, to \u2026 could it have been anybody else associated with Mark Lewis?",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: That DNA that was collected from there, my understanding is that it was entered into the DNA \u2014 I believe it's called CODIS, the database.",
      "CODIS is the FBI's criminal DNA database.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: It did not come up with a hit.",

      "Daryl Snedeker:\u00a0Based on what I know today, the totality of the circumstances ... \u2026 I think they did fail that family. And I think if they didn't follow up and find out whose male DNA is on that night robe, that's a catastrophic failure right there.",

      "Dr. Bill Smock is sure that Joanna Hunter was murdered and says he can prove it.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: Every injury will tell you a story if you take the time to analyze it.",
      "In 2023, Smock was hired by the Solano County Sheriff's Department to look at the case. He is a medical doctor, who, by his count, has reviewed thousands of autopsies and examined forensic evidence for police departments across the country.",
      "Smock also has been an expert witness in high profile cases \u2014 including testifying against Derek Chauvin in the 2021 George Floyd murder trial.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: What I've spent 40 years doing is analyzing injuries, reconstructing how injuries occur.",
      "And where the Solano County Sheriff's Department saw a bathrobe sash, a note and a suicide, Smock saw something else: something new.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: There was a braided nylon marine rope three feet from Joanna. \u2026 The murder weapon was there in the room with Joanna. \u2026 When you look at the photos of the mark that was created on her neck, the only thing in that closet that could have created that was the marine rope.",
      "But because he was required to sign a non-disclosure agreement, no one outside the sheriff's office saw Smock's report.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: I could not talk to the family \u2026 I could only talk to the lieutenant at Solano County regarding my findings.",
      "Here was everything the Hunters had been looking for ... but they did not even know the rope existed. Or how Smock made his determination. Smock was eventually released from the NDA and was able to show \"48 Hours\" using mannequins and red paint.",
      "Smock says Joanna's neck had two different ligature marks \u2014  one is from the sash and one is from the marine rope.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: We're gonna apply the rope \u2026 and see what type of imprint it creates. \u2026 You'll notice along the edge that there's a distinct fabric imprint, which is the type of fabric imprint we saw on Joanna's neck.",

      "Bill Smock: \u2014 when the bathrobe sash was applied to her neck.",

      "When they took up the Hunters' cause, they believed that Joanna's history of neck injuries told them they were looking at a strangulation.",
      "Casey Gwynn: The fact is that if you strangle a woman one time in an intimate relationship, she's 750 percent more likely to be killed by you.",
      "Smock, who works for Alliance for HOPE, confirmed their suspicion.",
      "But when the sheriff's office agreed to hire Smock, it also commissioned another review. This one by Dr. Brian Peterson, a pathologist and former president of the National Association of Medical Examiners. He disputed Smock's findings.",

    "published": "Sat, 13 Dec 2025 23:57:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Erika Kirk recalls the emotional fog of Charlie Kirk's assassination, addresses conspiracy theories and takes questions during a CBS News town hall hosted by Bari Weiss.",
    "story": [
      "Charlie Kirk transformed the American right through his nonprofit Turning Point USA before he was assassinated at an on-campus event in Utah three months ago. This week, his widow Erika, who now leads Turning Point, joined CBS News for a town hall where she reflected on grief, defended her husband's controversial comments and explained the \"game-time decision\" of publicly forgiving the man accused in her husband's murder.",
      "The conversation, moderated by CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss, is the first of many planned CBS News town halls and debates. Invited guests who joined the conversation included Utah Valley University student Hunter Kozak, who was the last person to speak to Charlie Kirk, and Robert Milgrim, the father of Israeli Embassy staffer Sarah Milgrim, who was shot and killed in May.",
      "Here are the highlights:",
      "Erika Kirk's message to people who sought to justify assassination: \"Tell that to my 3-year-old daughter\"",
      "Erika Kirk said anyone who sought to justify her husband's assassination is \"sick\" and said the internet has dehumanized people.",
      "\"He's a human being. You think he deserved that? Tell that to my 3-year-old daughter.\"",
      "She continued: \"You want to watch in high-res the video of my husband being murdered, and laugh, and say he deserves it? There's something very sick in your soul, and I'm praying that God saves you.\"",
      "Erika Kirk: Charlie never incited violence",
      "Charlie Kirk was known for his debates with college students, inviting them to step up to a microphone and \"prove me wrong.\"",
      "Erika Kirk said her husband encouraged people of different political beliefs and backgrounds to come to the front of the line, saying, \"'I'll put my mic down. Tell me why you believe that. That's interesting. I never thought of that. But have you thought of this?'\"",
      "A recent poll by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression and College Pulse found that 91% of undergraduates believe \"words can be violence.\" But Erika Kirk said her husband never incited violence: \"He never once said, 'Go after them because they're saying X, Y, Z and they deserve to die.'He gave them a microphone. He didn't take away a moment for them to speak back. He gave them a microphone. And what'd they do? They gave him a bullet in the neck. Totally different.\"",
      "She says her husband believed having conversations could save the world, referencing his new book, \"Stop, in the Name of God: Why Honoring the Sabbath Will Transform Your Life,\" which emphasizes that you can't communicate effectively with someone if you're not at peace with yourself.",
      "Erika Kirk: Charlie shouldn't be \"deteriorated\" to \"out-of-context\" clips",
      "Erika Kirk says some of her late husband's controversial comments, shared widely in the wake of his assassination, lacked context and that he should not \"be deteriorated\" to a few sentences.",
      "Weiss asked Erika Kirk about some of those much-shared comments: that some gun deaths are \"worth it\" to protect the Second Amendment; that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a mistake; and that if he sees a Black pilot, he's \"going to be like, boy, I hope he's qualified,\" while acknowledging \"that's not who I am, that's not what I believe.\"",
      "Erika Kirk said she'd love for people to watch the full clips instead of taking comments out of context.",
      "\"Charlie didn't care what skin color you were. He didn't care what religion you were. He loved excellence,\" she said, adding that \"his favorite word was 'earn'\u2026 He loved knowing that people worked hard to earn what they got.\"",
      "She said she didn't know the context of the \"gun deaths\" quote but said, \"There's a lot more there than just that one little sentence.\"",
      "\"My husband is not to be deteriorated to two sentences,\" she said. \"He's not. He is a thought leader, and he was brilliant of a man. So that's fine if you want to take words out of his mouth or out of context without the whole thing in perspective, but that's the problem.\"",
      "The last student to talk to Charlie Kirk asks: Will you condemn President Trump's rhetoric?",
      "Kozak was the last person to debate Charlie Kirk before he was shot. Since that day, Kozak \u2014 a self-professed liberal \u2014 has continued to call for civil political discourse. \"I think that one of the few things that we can agree on is this necessity for a conversation. I think that we need to remember that we still have to live with each other. That these are still our neighbors,\" he told \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Scott Pelley after the shooting.",
      "He attended the CBS News town hall, where he again took the microphone \u2014 this time, to ask Erika Kirk a question: \"Will you condemn the violent rhetoric of Donald Trump, the most powerful and influential person on earth?\"",
      "Kozak specifically referenced President Trump accusing six Democratic lawmakers of \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!\" and then reposting, \"HANG THEM, GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD!\" Top Democrats called for Mr. Trump to be \"condemned forcefully\" over the social media remarks.",
      "Erika Kirk didn't mention Mr. Trump by name in her response, saying the issue is \"so much deeper than one person\" and that it \"starts at the home.\"",
      "She urged parents to \"look in the mirror\" and reflect on how they're raising their children.",
      "\"You can choose to have evil in your heart or you can choose to have light,\" she said. \"What you consume and what you absorb from the outside world will manifest itself.\"",
      "Weiss asked: \"Do you think our political leaders have a responsibility to turn the temperature down right now?\"",
      "\"Well, I think everyone has a responsibility to do that, and I'm doing my part,\" Erika Kirk replied. \"I'm not in control of other people.\"",
      "Dad of Israeli Embassy staffer killed in shooting asks: Will you condemn antisemitism?",
      "Robert Milgrim, whose daughter Sarah was one of two victims of the Capitol Jewish Museum shooting in Washington, D.C., asked Erika Kirk: \"Will you here condemn the individuals spreading that hate and speak out clearly enough against antisemitism so we can prevent another tragedy?\"",
      "\"Hate is hate. It's evil,\" said Erika Kirk, adding that she and Charlie Kirk have always been \"very clear on our stance\" on Israel and the Jewish people.",
      "She said: \"What healing factor comes out of hating Jewish people? What healing factor comes out of hating Christians? What healing factor comes out? Hate in general. Nothing. Nothing. Charlie always would say very clearly, Jew hate was brain rot. He would always say it.\"",
      "Antisemitic incidents have increased nearly 900% in the U.S. over the past 10 years, according to a recent Anti-Defamation League audit.",
      "Erika Kirk's one-word message for Candace Owens",
      "Weiss asked Erika Kirk about Candace Owens, a former Turning Point USA employee and onetime friend of Charlie Kirk, who has recently been peddling conspiracy theories about his assassination. Owens has also made unfounded fraud allegations about the nonprofit \u2014 the Treasury Department last week confirmed that none of the tax-exempt entities Erika Kirk runs are under investigation by the IRS.",
      "What does Erika Kirk want to say to Owens and others making these unfounded claims?",
      "\"Stop. That's it. That's all I have to say. Stop.\"",
      "The \"game-time decision\" to forgive",
      "Erika Kirk stunned millions when she proclaimed at her husband's memorial service that she forgave her husband's accused killer.",
      "\"I forgive him because it's what Christ did and is what Charlie would do,\" she said in her powerful eulogy.",
      "She told Weiss that the moment was a \"game-time decision\" because she'd never say something she didn't mean.",
      "\"But am I gonna take that moment to say, 'Rally the troops, burn the city down, march in the streets?' Or am I gonna take that moment and unleash something like we talked about, even greater, more powerful and say, 'It's a revival.' And let that unleash, and let the Lord use it in ways that no one else could've ever imagined.\"",
      "Erika Kirk said she's not forgetting or condoning, but rather \"releasing myself from the enemy's hands where he could have a foothold in me.\"",
      "When asked if she had any words for his accused killer, she said: \"Nothing. I have nothing to say to you. Nothing.\"",
      "She added that there's a difference between forgiving someone and still wanting justice. \"We serve a just God, and I rest easy in knowing that. He's sovereign, but he's just. And so let the Lord handle that.\"",

      "At least two people were killed and nine more wounded in a shooting Saturday afternoon in a building on the campus of Brown University in Rhode Island, authorities said. The suspect has not been identified and is still at large.",
      "Authorities said that the shooting was reported in the Barus & Holley engineering building a little after 4 p.m. local time. The shooting occurred in a first-floor classroom, Providence Deputy Police Chief Tim O'Hara told reporters. The school said final exams were taking place in the building at the time of the shooting.",
      "Providence Mayor Brett Smiley   said in a news conference that eight of the wounded were taken to Rhode Island Hospital in critical condition. The hospital later said in a statement that six of those patients were in \"critical but stable condition,\" one was in critical condition, and another was in stable condition.",
      "In a follow-up news conference late Saturday night, Smiley said that a ninth victim suffered non-life-threatening injuries when they \"learned that they had received fragments from a shooting that had occurred near them.\" That victim did not sustain a gunshot wound and is expected to make a full recovery, Smiley said.",
      "Brown University President Christina H. Paxson told reporters in the second briefing that all the victims, those killed and wounded, were students.",
      "Smiley said that no arrests had been made, and a shelter-in-place was in place for the Brown University area. No weapons have been recovered, O'Hara said. A university alert told students to lock doors, silence phones and stay hidden until further notice.",
      "O'Hara told reporters the male suspect escaped from the engineering building following the shooting. It was unclear how he had entered the building, officials said, but Smiley noted that the outer doors of Barus & Holley were unlocked because the exams were taking place.",
      "\"In a building like that on a weekend, there are a lot of things going on,\" Brown Provost Francis Doyle said. \"Study sessions, student groups meeting, there are research labs in that building. So we don't have detailed knowledge of exactly what was happening, but we're working with law enforcement.\"",
      "Providence police, late Saturday night, released security video of a person believed to be the suspect leaving Barus & Holley. Smiley said that investigators do not yet know if the gunman was a student.",
      "In\u00a0the video, the suspect was wearing dark gray or black clothing and his face was not visible, O'Hara said during the second news conference. The video does not show a firearm. No weapon has been recovered.",
      "Video of person of interest in Brown shooting: pic.twitter.com/fjufQ3MTdC",
      "\"Some of the witnesses also told us that he may have been wearing a camouflage gray mask,\" O'Hara said, adding that investigators are unsure if there is video showing the suspect inside Barus & Holley.",
      "School public safety had initially reported that a suspect had been taken into custody before retracting that statement.",
      "\"There was an individual who was preliminary thought to be involved, but was later determined to have no involvement,\" Smiley said.",
      "Over 400 local and federal law enforcement officers were in the area assisting in the investigation, Smiley said.",
      "President Trump wrote in a Truth Social post that he had been briefed on the shooting.",
      "\"God bless the victims and the families of the victims!\" Mr. Trump said. The president also initially wrote that a suspect was in custody, but in a follow-up post, wrote, \"The Brown University Police reversed their previous statement \u2014 The suspect is NOT in custody.\"",

      "As part of the celebration this weekend, theaters across the country are showing a new documentary about his life, \"Dick Van Dyke: 100th Celebration.\"",
      "Van Dyke's work helped define a generation. He became one of the biggest actors of his era with the eponymous show \"The Dick Van Dyke Show,\" which ran for five years on CBS.",
      "Early in his career, Van Dyke was quoted as saying he wanted to make films his children could watch. And he got his dream when Walt Disney cast him in \"Mary Poppins\" \u2013 bad cockney accent and all \u2013 alongside the incomparable Julie Andrews. He also appeared in the equally kid-friendly \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I could have been James Bond. When Sean Connery left, the producer said, 'Would you like to be the next Bond?' I said, 'Have you heard my British accent?' Click! That's a true story!\" Van Dyke told CBS Sunday Morning in 2023.",
      "During his career, Van Dyke won four Primetime Emmy Awards, a Tony Award and a Grammy Award. He was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 1995.",

      "Van Dyke, who is just an Oscar shy of the elusive EGOT title, said he would love a shot at the Academy Award.",
      "\"I hope it's not posthumous,\" he joked.",
      "In the 1970s, Van Dyke found sobriety after battling alcoholism.",
      "\"I'm on my third generation,\" he told CBS Sunday Morning in 2023. \"I'm getting letters from little kids, and that is what I love, that they watch the movies over and over. I'm getting so much more mail today than I did during the heyday of my career.\"",
      "Now that he has hit triple digits, Van Dyke said he's gotten some perspective on how he used to play older characters.",
      "\"You know, I played old men a lot, and I always played them as angry and cantankerous,\" he told ABC News\u00a0ahead of his milestone birthday. \"It's not really that way. I don't know any other 100-year-olds, but I can speak for myself.\"",
      "He has long credited his wife, 54-year-old makeup artist and producer Arlene Silver, with keeping him young.",
      "\"As I've said, if I had known I was gonna live this long, I would've taken better care of myself!\" Van Dyke told CBS Sunday Morning. \"Yeah, 'cause I went through that whole period of alcoholism. But my wife, God bless her, makes sure that I go to the gym three days a week and do a full workout.\"",
      "Van Dyke was born in West Plains, Missouri, in 1925, and grew up \"the class clown\" in Danville, Illinois, while admiring and imitating the silent film comedians.",
      "Five years ago, while celebrating getting a Kennedy Center Honor, Van Dyke told CBS Mornings that he was looking forward to hitting the 100-year-old mark.",
      "\"George Burns made it, and I'm gonna do it too,\" he said.",
      "And now, he told ABC News that he feels lucky about turning 100. But what's hard about being 100?",
      "\"I miss movement,\" he told the outlet. \"I've got one game leg from I don't know what.\"",

Another provision would provide funding for cost-sharing reduction payments meant to lower premiums for some Affordable Care Act enrollees. The proposal would also require more transparency from pharmacy benefit managers in an effort to lower drug costs.",
      "\"While Democrats demand that taxpayers write bigger checks to insurance companies to hide the cost of their failed law, House Republicans are tackling the real drivers of health care costs to provide affordable care, increase access and choice, and restore integrity to our nation's health care system for all Americans,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said in a statement.",

We are ready to work with anyone in good faith on the other side of the aisle who wants to prevent the Affordable Care Act tax credits from expiring at the end of the month,\" Jeffries said. \"Unfortunately, House Republicans have introduced toxic legislation that is completely unserious, hurts hardworking America taxpayers and is not designed to secure bipartisan support.\"",

      "Officials said 16 people are dead after gunmen targeted the attendees of a Jewish community event\u00a0on Sunday in Australia's Bondi Beach. Another 40 people were hospitalized with injuries, including a child and two officers, according to police. One suspected gunman was also killed. He was identified as Naveed Akram, 24, a Pakistani national based in Sydney, according to a U.S. intelligence briefing and a driver's license provided by Australian police.",
      "Australian officials and international leaders have condemned it as an antisemitic terrorist attack.",
      "Police said they expect the death toll to climb. Here is what we know so far.",
      "Gunfire broke out at a Hanukkah celebration",
      "The attack took place during a Jewish holiday celebration held to mark the first day of Hanukkah. More than 1,000 people were on the beach, in a suburb of Sydney, when shots rang out, said New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon, who officially declared the shooting a \"terrorist incident.\"",
      "Numerous Australian officials have characterized the shooting as targeted. New South Wales Premier Chris Minns said it \"was designed to target Sydney's Jewish community.\"",
      "\"This is a targeted attack on Jewish Australians on the first day of Hanukkah \u2014 which should be a day of joy, a celebration of faith \u2014 an act of evil antisemitism, terrorism, that has struck the heart of our nation,\" Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said at a news conference.",
      "Video footage recorded by civilians showed frightened crowds of beachgoers fleeing the area as gunshots went off in the background.",
      "Neither officials nor police have identified the victims of the attack. Chabad, a global organization representing a branch of ultra-Orthodox Judaism, said Rabbi Eli Schlanger, with Chabad of Bondi, was among the dead, the Associated Press reported. Schlanger had been a key organizer of the Hanukkah event on Bondi Beach, according to the organization.",
      "At least two suspects",
      "Australian authorities have said at least two gunmen were suspected of carrying out the deadly mass shooting, a rare occurrence in a country where gun violence is uncommon.",
      "Lanyon said the deceased suspect was previously known to the New South Wales police force. In addition to the gunman killed at the scene of the attack, another was hospitalized with serious injuries, he said. The surviving gunman has been taken into custody. The commissioner also said officers were investigating whether a \"third offender\" was involved.",
      "A man has been lauded as a hero and praised by the police commissioner for tackling one suspect and disarming him in dramatic video footage recorded by a bystander along Campbell Parade, a main street that wraps around Bondi Beach. In the footage, the man could be seen crouched in hiding behind a parked car before wrestling the suspect and taking his weapon.",
      "Australian news outlets have identified the man seen disarming the suspect as fruit shop owner Ahmed al Ahmed, citing his relatives.",
      "Officers found explosive devices",
      "Shortly after the shooting took place, officers who responded to the scene discovered a vehicle along Campbell Parade and believed there were several improvised explosive devices inside of it, Lanyon said. The vehicle was linked to the deceased gunman, according to the police commissioner. A rescue bomb disposal crew was at the scene.",
      "Rising antisemitism in Australia",
      "Although Australia rarely experiences mass shootings, after implementing stringent gun reform laws in the wake of a deadly 1996 massacre in Tasmania's Port Arthur, antisemitic incidents have been on the rise in the country since the war in Gaza began in 2023.",
      "The Australian government appointed special envoys in 2024 to address spiking antisemitism, as well as Islamophobia, in its communities. But attacks still happened this year. One, in July, involved an arsonist who set fire to the door of a synagogue in Melbourne, while worshippers were inside.",
      "World leaders react",
      "The attack on Bondi Beach drew widespread condemnation from leaders across the globe.",
      "In the U.S., Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke out against antisemitism in\u00a0a social media post, which said: \"Antisemitism has no place in this world. Our prayers are with the victims of this horrific attack, the Jewish community, and the people of Australia.\"",
      "Rubio joined officials from numerous countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Finland, New Zealand, India, Qatar and Pakistan, who similarly shared remarks expressing sympathy for the victims and solidarity with Jewish communities, as well as denouncing antisemitism.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was among the officials in his country who responded publicly to the attack in Australia. In a\u00a0statement\u00a0released by his office, Netanyahu criticized Albanese for supporting a Palestinian state and said such support fuels antisemitism.",
      "\"Your call for a Palestinian state pours fuel on the antisemitic fire,\" Netanyahu's statement read, quoting a letter that the Israeli prime minister said he wrote to Albanese in August. \"It rewards Hamas terrorists. It emboldens those who menace Australian Jews and encourages the Jew hatred now stalking your streets.\"",
      "The American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group and charity organization, said the attack \"comes after repeated warnings, including from the Australian Jewish community itself,\" adding that \"allowing antisemitic rhetoric and demonstrations to go unchecked can\u2014and does\u2014lead to violence and death.\"",

Schlanger had been a key organizer of the Hanukkah celebration where the shooting took place.",
      "Called Hanukkah by the Sea, the event was held to mark the beginning of the Jewish holiday observed from sundown on Sunday until Monday, Dec. 22. More than 1,000 were at the beach when gunfire broke out, said Lanyon.

      "\"The scenes in Bondi are shocking and distressing,\" said Albanese in a statement. \"My thoughts are with every person affected.\"",
      "One video appeared to show someone wrestling with one of the suspected gunmen and taking his weapon from him, according to Minns, who paid tribute to that individual in some of his comments Sunday.",
      "The video was recorded by a bystander along Campbell Parade, a main street that runs parallel to Bondi Beach. In it, a man jumped up from a crouched position behind a parked car and tackled the suspect, who had just fired his weapon toward something out of view.",
      "Following a short struggle, the man disarmed the suspect, pushed him to the ground and turned the weapon on him, at which point the suspect stood up and walked in the opposite direction. The man then lowered the weapon and raised his free hand in the air. Off to the side, one person appeared to be lying unresponsive on the sidewalk beside a different vehicle.",
      "In additional footage, which was also filmed by bystanders, crowds could be seen fleeing Bondi Beach as shots rang out in the background.",
      "Minns called the man, named by relatives to Australian media as fruit shop owner Ahmed al Ahmed, a \"genuine hero.\"",
      "Rare shooting",
      "Mass shootings in Australia are rare. But researchers have recorded dramatic upticks in antisemitic incidents in the country since the Oct. 7, 2023, assault by Hamas terrorists on Israel triggered the war in Gaza, along with spikes in hate incidents against Muslim groups.",
      "In response, the Australian government appointed special envoys last year to address antisemitism and Islamophobia in its communities. However, attacks have continued to happen since then.

      "KEVIN HASSETT, DIRECTOR NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: It's great to be back.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So people are holiday shopping. They're aware of prices. The president said this week prices are coming down tremendously. The latest data, though, from the Consumer Price Index is up 3% year over year, personal consumption index is up 2.8% year over year. What data is he looking at? What's your benchmark?",
      ": Right. Well, one of the things that if you saw his presentation in Pennsylvania, as he put up a bunch of charts, which he loves to do, where he went through the individual items that we've already sort of made a bunch of progress on. And so, for example, under Joe Biden, prescription drugs were up 9%. So far this year, they're down six tenths of a percent. Gasoline is way down. It was like the highest ever under Biden--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Eggs, he was talking about eggs, yeah.",
      ": Yeah, he was talking about eggs. And so I think the way to think about inflation, of course, is that there are like micro effects, like the time that we had the avian flu affecting drug prices. And then macro effects, which is runaway spending, big deficits and then an accommodative Fed policy. And I think--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But now tariffs adding to some price increases according to the Fed chair.",
      ": Well, I- you know, I think that the tariff evidence is mixed. But the point is that we've got deficit going way, way down. So right now, it's looking like the deficit for this year will be $600 billion lower than it was last year. That really helps lower inflation. We've got the trade deficit cut in half from last year. And so all of these things are things that should continue to move us towards the Fed target of 2%.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Companies aren't necessarily going to bring items down, though, in terms of pricing, right? I mean, the- the president told the Wall Street Journal he didn't know when all of this money, quote, \"is going to kick in.\" I think he was talking to business investment and tariffs, and help voters, \"all I can do is do my job.\" When do you anticipate voters will feel this positive impact?",
      ": Right. Well, it's definitely the case that, and you guys have been covered a lot, that consumer sentiment right now is lower than anyone would like. But, you know, we find that that very often happens during a government shutdown when everybody's really upset--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the last administration called that the \"vibecession,\" right?",
      ": No, but--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --the data is good, but people feel bad.",
      ": --Yeah, but what's going to happen is--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Same thing, you're saying.",
      ": No what's- I'm not saying that. What- what I'm saying is that people are going to see the high growth. Growth is 4%. Income growth is up about $1,200 this year. People look at their wallets and see they're doing better, which is why we had the biggest Black Friday ever and so on and so--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's more higher income se--",
      ": --The sentiment will catch up with the reality. Under Joe Biden, the fact is that real purchasing power dropped by about $3,000. So far this year, it's up by about $1,200 per family. And the money that we're talking about is like real money. So for groceries, it went from $400 a month to $525 a month under Biden. So that's like an extra more than $1,000 a year. You have to spend on groceries. It's down this year for us, for the grocery package, but it's still got a lot of room to grow- to go.",

      ": --On the food stuff--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --with an eye towards that.",
      ": Yeah, if we don't make it here, then pretty much we don't tariff it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you, you mentioned gas. Oil prices globally are relatively low. We saw this Coast Guard interdiction with military forces boarding and seizing this vessel off the coast of Venezuela. Do you feel you have the leeway there, pricing-wise, to conduct more seizures or even a blockade of oil from Venezuela, without it hurting?",
      ": Well, I'm not a foreign policy guy, so what we do with Venezuela and whether we blockade is up to the president and Marco Rubio. But I could say that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But you've got the leeway, right--",
      ": --that- that what's been going on is there's been kind of a black market for oil amongst sort of this sanctioned countries. And what we're doing is we're shutting that black market down. Whether that affects prices outside of the sanctioned countries is kind of an open question. Probably not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think it will?",
      ": No, because they're already kind of on the ropes, these countries. They're only getting oil when they get like sort of black fleets to sneak in and give them the oil. And that's what we're trying to slow down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, I want to ask you about the Fed decision. The Federal Open Market Committee said job gains have slowed this year. We also saw the survey from the Business Roundtable. I'm sure you saw it. They asked CEOs what they expect to happen, and they anticipate employment will decrease in 2026 rather than increase. Are you concerned about a hiring slowdown?",
      ": The same Fed said that they were more bullish on growth for next year, right? And so I think that we're at a certain--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But on the jobs picture.",
      ": But on the jobs picture, you know, we're going to get the data next week. And so maybe next Sunday I'll come back and we'll talk about it, because we've got two months of data coming out on Tuesday. And we'll get a clearer picture because right now we just have some very difficult to pin down surveys like the gold standard for this will be really the household survey, which we don't even get for October.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But these are CEOs. They're the people who would be doing the hiring, right? And they're saying, we're not doing it.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you trust that big data?",
      ": I trust the household survey, especially. And sadly, we won't have one for October. But we're going to get one for November. And that's going to be really important for thinking about where the job market is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Employment is one of the things that the Fed watches closely. And we heard again from the president that you were on this short list to be potentially the next Fed chair, although he was conducting interviews this week. He said you and Hoover's Kevin Warsh are at the top of the list. On Friday, the president was asked how big of a role he wants to personally play in future Fed interest rate decisions. Take a listen.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE BEGINS]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think I certainly should have a role in talking to whoever the head of the Fed is, or the Fed. I don't think- you know the old days that used to happen. Nowadays, it's sort of, they think it shouldn't happen. But I've done great. I've made a lot of money, I'm very successful. I think my voice should be heard.",

I think he has very strong and well-founded views about what we ought to do. But in the end, the job of the Fed is to be independent and to work with the group of people that are on the Board of Governors, at the FOMC, to drive a group consensus on where interest rates should be and to do so, you know, basically with the guidance of the Fed chair. But in the end, it's a committee that votes. And I'd be happy to talk to the president every day, you know, until both of us are dead because it's so much fun to talk--",

      ": Excuse me?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would the president's voice have equal weighting to the voting members?",
      ": No, no, he would have no weight. It's just his opinion matters if it's good, you know, if it's based on data. And then if you go to the committee and you say, well, the president made this argument and that's a really sound argument, I think, what do you think? If they reject it, then they'll vote in a different way.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, tthat aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Dec. 14, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Louisiana Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, he joins us this morning from Baton Rouge. Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SEN. BILL CASSIDY: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So your health care bill gives Americans up to $1,500 in tax free accounts to spend on health care rather than extend these expiring ACA subsidies. On Thursday, your proposal failed 51 to 48, as did the Democratic proposal. So that means it looks like those receiving ACA premium subsidies will see their costs go up 114%. Bottom line here, did Republicans simply wait too long to come up with a health care alternative?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Well, first Margaret, let's just kind of recast the question. We've got to do something for affordability for the people in the exchanges. And I will say that the only thing the Democrats would accept was something that would decrease the premiums. But if a family has a $6,000 out of pocket before they get into the strength of the insurance plan, then, frankly, the policy is catastrophic. It brings profit to the insurance company, but not benefit to the patient. So I would argue that it actually is- there has to be a meeting of the minds between Democrats and Republicans. Let's acknowledge you've got to put cash in the patient's pocket to pay the out of pocket. I would be willing to do a short-term extension of the premium tax credits for those people with higher premiums, if they will concede that we've got to do something for the $6,000 out of pocket. I think there's a deal to be had here. We need to push for that deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you want to make sure that the average deductible is less than $6,000 is what I just heard you say there, and you're open to an--",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Absolutely. The net deductible, if you will, that $1,500 is per person. Give me a couple- for people over 50. Give me a couple in their 50s with two children, 18 and 19, they would get $5,000 in an account in their purse, pocketbook, you name it, in their pocket to pay the out of pocket for the insurance. Now the insurance plan for that couple would be 6000- $6,000 deductible. So- so you end up decreasing the net deductible by doing this. That makes the policy actually functional for them. If the child has a sprained ankle you bring to the urgent care, you can pay the bill, not kind of come with- come forward- out of your own pocket. By the way, I'm told that about 40% of Americans have less than $1,000 in their savings account. That kind of puts into relief why you need to have something in their pocket to pay the out of pocket.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I know the President has said that he likes the concept of your plan, but- but why didn't the White House put its shoulder behind this before Thursday? Why didn't they whip votes for you? Four of your Republican colleagues crossed the aisle and voted with Democrats on their proposal.",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: All four of those voted for our proposal too. And I think that shows you that there is- there is interest in finding something which addresses both the critical problem of the out of pocket expense, but also the higher premiums--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But is the White House behind you on this? Like are they helping you?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: --Well it certainly seems like it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want this up for another vote.",
      "[END CROSSTALK]",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Their initial plan had elements of what I am speaking about, helping people with that deductible. So simply put, yes, the White House is there. But if you notice, our problem was not on the Republican side, our problem was on the Democratic side. So what I'm saying is, let's just meet together. As a physician, I can tell you that deductible- the patient comes, she's stressed. She can't get the procedure, the X ray, the whatever, because of her $6,000 deductible. Let's- let's just meet. Let's address our concerns. And then this Republican would be willing to do something on a short term extension of the premium tax credits, if that's what it takes to get the deal to help those folks with the more expensive premium, but also helping everybody with their deductible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you need more White House help on this? And, sir, you're running out of time here. Do you really think you can get this done before January 1st?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Our problem is not with Republicans. Our problem has been with Democrats. But of course, they may say that about us. So what I am kind of searching for is a deal in which both have their concerns addressed. If you do that and you put this in place, you really have until the end of, like March to get it done. Because with- with these kind of accounts that people have money in, they just save the receipts, they submit them, and they get reimbursed. It happens- it's what we do in my family, we have a flexible spending account. And so we can get this done, and I think we can meet the concerns both about the out of pocket, but also about the premium.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I also want to ask you about what's happening with the FDA right now. CBS has confirmed that there are no ongoing safety studies into the abortion drug Mifepristone. This was despite the Trump administration saying they were going to conduct one and anti-abortion groups want this review to take place. I saw a letter the FDA commissioner sent to you last week claiming they are reviewing the evidence. Do you believe him? And if not, what are you doing about it?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: I had a conversation with the commissioner this past week. It seems as if it's taken a long time to get that study up and going, which suggests to me that it's not a priority. For the pro life community, this should be a priority. And if we're going to make America healthy again, this seems like, my gosh, should be top priority. So there is- I am disappointed as well as others are disappointed. By the way, this is being slow walked. I think- I think it just needs to happen. We need to have the evidence out there. If you want to reassure American people about something which is really top of mind, this is where they should be going.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said that Mifepristone is safe and effective and that there are side effects in less than 1% of patients. I- with that data point in place, why isn't the White House pressing the FDA commissioner to make this happen? There's some suggestion in reporting that it is for political concerns due to impact on the upcoming midterm races. Is this politically motivated- the slow walking you say is happening?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: You're asking me to look into the kind of motivations of folks with whom I've not had a personal conversation--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Well, did the FDA commissioner say that?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: I can't do that- but the FDA commissioner said that they're trying to get the study together, but they've been in office long enough that it could be and so I think that it's right to be impatient. It's right to demand more. I don't know if the decision starts with the FDA commissioner. You just suggested it starts in the White House. That might be the case. Point being, get it done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you have confidence in the FDA commissioner?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: I think the FDA commissioner is working very hard, and I think that in many cases, he's receiving directives from on high. I don't know that for sure, but I suspect that's the case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Dr. Cassidy, Senator Cassidy, we thank you for your time. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're now joined by the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner of Virginia. Senator, were you persuaded there by Maria Corina Machado's argument that military action pressure is virtuous and necessary?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, first of all, let me at the top of the show- we've got this tragic shooting at Brown University, and then this obviously political strike against the Jewish community in Australia. Both horrible and particularly on the first day of Hanukkah, which is a celebration of light over darkness. And boy, we could use a little more light these days. Ms. Machado is a hero. She deserves to win the Nobel Prize. And one of the mistakes the Biden administration made last year when the opposition candidates won overwhelmingly, was not put more pressure on Maduro then to leave. But the action now that Trump has chosen Maduro, who is a bad guy and saying, and I'm not sure what his policy is, but at the very same time, is pardoning, for example, a Honduran former president who was convicted in America of drug running. The president who has not been willing to stand up strong against Putin, who is probably the most brutal authoritarian leader in the world, as we go on and off with Ukraine. I think is- yes, it would be great to get rid of Maduro. But in terms of the question, Donald Trump has not come to the American people and said, here are our goals in Venezuela. We've got troops potentially in harm's way. We've got boat actions, for example, where we're blowing up boats, where we can obviously interdict, as we saw with the oil tanker. I think the President needs to make the case if he's going to try to put boots on the ground in Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, at this point, all they've, as I understand it, asked for and justified to Congress were these strikes on the alleged drug boats. Nothing with sovereign territory yet. But that gets to your argument about what is the end goal. Unlike other Democrats when it comes to the drug boats, you've said you're not ready to call them war crimes, particularly what happened on the September 2 double tap strike. You've questioned Admiral Bradley. I know you want the video released to the public. What do you think that's going to show to the public? What will that change?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I think the video is chilling, disturbing, whatever term you want to use--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Why?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Because the idea of these two survivors hanging on to remnants of a boat and then America taking a series of additional strikes. The Congress needs to see it at the very minimum. I think the American public needs to see it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've seen it?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I've seen it--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:--Only a limited number have--",
      "SEN. WARNER:-- It is extraordinarily chilling. What I'm saying is, once you make the accusation of war crime, you can't take that back, right? And so what I've said--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- But many of your Democrat colleagues have.",
      "SEN. WARNER: -- I know that. That's why I've said to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, I want to see the written execution order. I want to see the legal opinion that was about this specific strike. I want to know whether the overarching policy memorandum, which was not finished until September 5, three days after the strike, was changed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I saw you said this. That's not typical, is it? Don't you normally come up with the legal justification before you take the action, rather than three days after?",
      "SEN. WARNER: This is where I have a question. The justification was made in late July. They didn't write it down till September 5.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I don't have the answer. I also want to see the after-action report. I want to give the military every opportunity to make their case, because once you- again- once you make that claim, what it would do to how we view our military, morale, how we're viewed in the world. It's so important. But this President has not- and frankly, Pete Hegseth, even worse. Here's the guy who goes out and brags about the strikes until there's controversy, and then he kind of runs for the hills.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the President said again this week, and I'll just read it to you that land strikes on Venezuela are being considered. Land strikes on horrible people that are bringing in drugs and killing our people. It doesn't necessarily have to be in Venezuela. It's people that are bringing in drugs to our country as targets. Have you seen any legal justification to hit these people now designated as terrorists on sovereign territory, whether it's Mexico or Colombia or Venezuela?",
      "SEN. WARNER: The vast majority of the drug particularly- this is all cocaine. This is not fentanyl. The vast majority--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- In terms of the drug boats--",
      "SEN. WARNER: -- The vast majority is actually in the eastern Pacific, yet most of the strikes have been in the Caribbean. And is- this mean that suddenly you're going to be in open warfare with all of American military against any and all drug dealers? Again, the drug dealers are awful. We need to do all we can to stop them, but the President, when he puts American forces potentially in harm's way, needs to come and explain to American people what the goal is here.\u00a0 Particularly when he's then, at the same breath, pardoning the former president of Honduras, who was a convicted drug dealer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 In terms of designated terrorists, ISIS is a designated terrorist group. We just saw the first combat deaths, essentially, of the Trump administration yesterday. Three Americans killed, three injured in Syria in this apparent ambush. The head of the National Counterterrorism Center said it was an insider attack. Are you supportive of keeping the nearly 1,000 US troops in Syria. Do you have concerns that the Syrian Government isn't able to keep these infiltrators out?",
      "SEN. WARNER: First of all, condolences to the three Americans families, Armed Forces members, one an interpreter. I think our troops have played an important role. We are working closely with, for example, the Kurds. We have literally tens of thousands of ISIS family members in certain prisons in that area.--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- So, you want them to continue?",
      "SEN. WARNER: But the President- I think pulling out without a plan would be a mistake, but the President, again, has sent signals. Months ago, he said he's thinking about taking all those American soldiers out without articulating his strategy. I mean the President, if he wants to make the case to the American people of when our soldiers are in harm's way, and particularly when we're talking about the Caribbean and now potential Venezuela. This has not been an overnight. This buildup of force has been months. He owes it to all of us to come in and explain what his goal is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Domestically, we have Senator Cassidy on the program. We taped with him earlier. He says he's looking for fellow Democrats to join him in a health care deal by March, to make these health savings accounts, and he said he'll offer to extend the existing subsidies for healthcare premiums. Would you be on board with that?",
      "SEN. WARNER: First of all, we've got a crisis that hits as of Monday, tomorrow, because that's when people have to sign up--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- He says retroactively you can do it.",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, listen, it's a mess once you've signed up or you've dropped out of the system. You know, the idea that you're retroactively going to fix it. Fix it now, so people don't go into Christmas thinking they're going to not know if they'll be able to afford healthcare. And the notion- but the notion of what-\u00a0 Bill Cassidy is a good guy. I've worked with him in a lot of different efforts, but the idea that a one time $1,500 payment into your pocket is going to suddenly make up. I had a person the other day. Her current insurance is $544 a month. It'll go up to over $1,500 a month. A one time $1,500 payment is not going to meet her needs, and particularly if that would mean that things like pre-existing condition protections would disappear.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That sounds like you're not- not on board in these remaining days of 2025 Senator, I have to--",
      "SEN. WARNER: -- Fix the crisis right now, extend the subsidies, and then let's debate how we fix it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We have to leave it there. Thank you, Senator. We'll be right back.",

      "Hamas said the strike that killed Saad was a \"blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement.\" It also said it had named a new commander but did not give details.",
      "An Israel Defense Forces official asserted that Israel did not violate the ceasefire agreement because, under the deal, the military is permitted to strike targets actively engaged in terrorism.",
      "\"Hamas has been blatantly violating the ceasefire agreement and is failing to uphold its obligations,\" the military official said. \"Day after day, Hamas terrorists breach the ceasefire agreement, crossing the yellow line, threatening the lives of IDF soldiers operating in the authorized areas, and moreover undermining the ongoing efforts to maintain stability.\"",
      "The Israeli strike west of Gaza City killed four people, according to an Associated Press journalist who saw their bodies arrive at Shifa Hospital. Another three were wounded, according to Al-Awda hospital.",
      "Israel and Hamas have repeatedly accused each other of truce violations.",
      "Israeli airstrikes and shootings in Gaza have killed at least 386 Palestinians since the ceasefire took hold, according to Palestinian health officials. Israel has said recent strikes are in retaliation for militant attacks against its soldiers, and that troops have fired on Palestinians who approached the \"Yellow Line\" between the Israeli-controlled majority of Gaza and the rest of the territory.",
      "Israel has demanded that Palestinian militants return the remains of the final hostage, Ran Gvili, from Gaza and called it a condition of moving to the second and more complicated phase of the ceasefire. That lays out a vision for ending Hamas' rule and seeing the rebuilding of a demilitarized Gaza under international supervision.",
      "The initial Hamas-led 2023 terrorist attack on southern Israel killed around 1,200 people and took 251 hostages. Of the hostages who were taken into Gaza, 148 were either freed as part of previous ceasefire agreements or\u00a0rescued by Israeli forces,\u00a0according to\u00a0the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The bodies of another 57 hostages were returned or recovered, the ministry says.",
      "Israel's two-year campaign in Gaza has killed more than 70,650 Palestinians, roughly half of them women and children, according to the territory's Hamas-led Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between militants and civilians in its count.",
      "Much of Gaza has been destroyed and most of the population of over 2 million has been displaced. Humanitarian aid entry into the territory continues to be below the level set by the ceasefire terms, and Palestinians who lost limbs in the war face a shortage of prosthetic limbs and long delays in medical evacuations.",

    "summary": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Ukrainian, U.S. and European officials will hold a series of meetings.",
    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. envoys arrived in Berlin on Sunday for another round of talks intended to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, as Moscow and Kyiv stuck to their sharply opposite views of a prospective peace deal.",
      "Zelenskyy\u00a0said that Ukrainian, U.S. and European officials will hold a series of meetings. He said he will meet personally with U.S. President Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and Mr. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner in Berlin.",
      "Responding to journalists' questions in audio clips on a WhatsApp group chat, Zelenskyy emphasized the need for Ukraine to receive firm guarantees from the United States and European allies that would be similar to those offered to NATO members, after the U.S. and some European countries stonewalled Ukraine's bid to join the military alliance.",
      "\"These security guarantees are an opportunity to prevent another wave of Russian aggression,\" he said. \"And this is already a compromise on our part.\"",
      "Zelenskyy emphasized that any security assurances would need to be legally binding and supported by the U.S. Congress, adding that he expected an update from his team following a meeting between Ukrainian and U.S. military officials in Stuttgart.",
      "He said that he will meet separately with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and, possibly, other European leaders later in the evening. He said he hadn't yet received any response from the U.S. to Ukraine's latest proposals on the peace plan.",
      "Washington has tried for months to navigate the demands of each side as Mr. Trump presses for a swift end to Russia's war and grows increasingly exasperated by delays. The search for possible compromises has run into major obstacles, including control of Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, which is mostly occupied by Russian forces.",
      "Russia's President Vladimir Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw its forces from the part of the Donetsk region still under its control, among the key conditions for peace \u2014 a demand Zelenskyy again rejected on Sunday.",
      "Zelenskyy said that the U.S. had floated an idea for Ukraine to withdraw from the Donetsk and create a demilitarized free economic zone there, a proposal he rejected as unworkable.",
      "\"I do not consider this fair, because who will manage this economic zone?\" he said. \"If we are talking about some buffer zone along the line of contact, if we are talking about some economic zone and we believe that only a police mission should be there and troops should withdraw, then the question is very simple. If Ukrainian troops withdraw 5\u201310 kilometers, for example, then why do Russian troops not withdraw deeper into the occupied territories by the same distance?\"",
      "Zelenskyy described the issue as \"very sensitive\" and insisted on a freeze along the line of contact, saying that \"today a fair possible option is we stand where we stand.\"",
      "Putin's foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov, told the business daily Kommersant that Russian police and national guard would stay in parts of the Donetsk region even if they become a demilitarized zone under a prospective peace plan.",
      "Ushakov warned that a search for compromise could take a long time, noting that the U.S. proposals that took into account Russian demands had been \"worsened\" by alterations proposed by Ukraine and its European allies.",
      "Speaking to Russian state TV in remarks broadcast Sunday, Ushakov said that \"the contribution of Ukrainians and Europeans to these documents is unlikely to be constructive,\" warning that Moscow will \"have very strong objections.\"",
      "Ushakov added that the territorial issue was actively discussed in Moscow when Witkoff and Kushner met with Putin earlier this month. \"The Americans know and understand our position,\" he said.",
      "Merz, who has spearheaded European efforts to support Ukraine alongside French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, said Saturday that \"the decades of the 'Pax Americana' are largely over for us in Europe and for us in Germany as well.\"",
      "He warned that Putin's aim is \"a fundamental change to the borders in Europe, the restoration of the old Soviet Union within its borders.\" \"If Ukraine falls, he won't stop,\" Merz warned on Saturday during a party conference in Munich.",
      "Putin has denied plans to restore the Soviet Union or attack any European allies.",

      "The following is the transcript of the full interview with Nobel Peace Prize winner Mar\u00eda Corina Machado that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Dec. 14, 2025.",
      "This interview was taped on Friday, Dec. 12, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, Venezuelan opposition leader who joins us from Norway where she just received the Nobel Peace Prize. Welcome to 'Face the Nation.'",
      "MAR\u00cdA CORINA MACHADO: Thank you very much, Margaret. It's my pleasure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You face arrest by the Maduro regime. I know you went through extraordinary difficulty just getting out of the country and to Norway. You said you got support from the United States government to do so. Can you tell us what type of support?",
      "MACHADO: Actually, I prefer not to give away any details, because I do not want to increase the risk on men and women that helped me to be here. And the regime has been, you know, very cruel against those that in the past have helped other Venezuelans flee the country when they were persecuted. So in this case, I do prefer to protect them as much as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand that. The head of the private rescue organization, who said he helped you come out of Venezuela, spoke to my CBS colleague, Lilia Luciano, and said smuggling you out was very high risk because you are so well known. You traveled by land, by sea, by air. He said multiple donors paid for it. Do you know why it was so important to them for you to make it to Norway and receive that prize?",
      "MACHADO: Well, I frankly have no idea. And as I say, I am not going to give more information regarding my trip to Norway. But what am I going to say- how important it is for the Venezuelan people. This is a recognition to a nation that has fought tirelessly, courageously against a criminal, narcoterrorist structure and- and I came to receive that prize, that award, and I'm going to bring it back home to the Venezuelan people as soon as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You say you're going back home. I know you sent your own children out of Venezuelan territory in order to protect them, your sons, your daughter. I read you hadn't even seen your daughter in 16 months. That's an incredible sacrifice for anyone. Are they concerned that you plan to return to Venezuela? When are you going?",
      "MACHADO: Of course, they are concerned as any other Venezuelan child that has their parents or relatives back in our country, because the regime, as I said, has persecuted, tortured, killed, disappeared, thousands of Venezuelans, and recently it has turned even more violent because, you know when, when a criminal regime is falling apart and they know their days are numbered, they turn even more aggressive, even more violent. Just a couple of weeks ago, a 16 year old girl was kidnapped and taken away to prison just because they were looking for her brother, and since they couldn't find her brother, they took Samantha. So this is the kinds of actions that are currently happening in my country. So yes, my family is concerned, but they know I have said that I will be where I am more useful to our cause, and that's exactly what I'm going to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You believe it's important to help the cause from inside the country right now. Can you help us understand what is going on, because we are seeing here in the US an increase in the pressure campaign. More sanctions on Venezuelan individuals and vessels. We saw an armed seizure of a vessel carrying oil out of Venezuela. Selling oil on the black market is really important money for the Maduro regime. Do you endorse this idea of more seizures and possibly even a blockade?",
      "MACHADO: Look, I absolutely support President Trump's strategy, and we, the Venezuelan people, are very grateful to him and to his administration, because I believe he is a champion of freedom in this hemisphere. And that's why, and I say this from Oslo right now, I had dedicated this award to him because I think that he finally has put Venezuela in where it should be, in terms of a priority for the United States national security. And we do support these actions, because, Margaret, we are facing, not a conventional dictatorship. This is a very complex criminal structure that has turned Venezuela into a safe haven of international crime and terrorist activities, starting with Russia, Iran, Cuba, Hezbollah, Hamas, the Colombian guerrilla, \u00a0the drug cartels operating freely and directed in partnership with Maduro and his regime. And as every criminal structure is suffers, is when the inflows from their criminal activities are cut. And these, in the case of Maduro regime, comes from the oil black market to drug trafficking, gold smuggling, arm smuggling, even human smuggling and trafficking. So that's what we believe, it was so important to apply, you know, law enforcement, and we have been asking this for years, so it's finally happening. That's why I believe the regime has its days numbered.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It sounds like you support more sanctions and possibly more seizures of oil, but isn't there a risk that cutting off money will further hurt the already impoverished people of Venezuela? Isn't that a risk?",
      "MACHADO: Of course. What we're doing is for the well being of the Venezuelan people. What we want to do is to save lives, but Maduro was the one who declared a war on the Venezuelan people. A war we didn't want. A war we are suffering with hundreds of thousands of killings and forced executions in the last years. And right now, I want to be very clear with the international community, the resources Maduro gets are not going to schools or hospitals in Venezuela a teacher earns $1 a day. Pensions are less than $1 a month. Our children go twice a week to school. The sources, the cash the regime gets from these illegal activities goes to buy arms, to pay gang members to spy and infiltrate and to even further increase their illegal narcotics activities and so on. So these resources are not going for, to- towards the people. They're going for corruption and crime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So it sounds like you want even more seizures and a blockade. Is that correct?",
      "MACHADO: We want every legal action through law enforcement a- approach, not only from the United States, also from other Caribbean, Latin American and European countries that further block the illegal activities of the regime. Why? Because we need to increase the cost of staying in power by force. Once you arrive to that point in which the cost of staying in power is higher than the cost of leaving power, the regime will fall apart, and it's the moment where we, you know, advance into a negotiated transition. Which is what in the beginning we offered Maduro when we won the presidential election by landslide last year, but he not only refused that option, but he, as you know, unleashed the worst, most brutal repression wave we've seen in our history.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And 8 million Venezuelans have fled\u2013",
      "MACHADO: That's correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013since he came to power during that time, but in terms of the diplomacy, President Trump spoke with Maduro himself last month. We haven't seen any evidence though, that diplomacy, a negotiated exit like you mentioned, is happening. Are you seeing diplomatic success?",
      "MACHADO \u00a0 Well, in the last years, Venezuela has seen 17 dialog initiatives, not once, not twice, 17. Every single time the opposition or our allies or the United States have complied with every single thing we offered, the regime of the country has violated every single thing they offered on their own part. What did they get? They got time, they got legitimacy, they got money, and that's precisely what they think they can get again, once again. But certainly, things have changed very much in the last months, Venezuela is total different country. I mean, Maduro is weaker than ever. The Armed Forces, police are certainly divided and fractured, and our country is united, cohesive, and we finally have the administration, in this case, President Trump with a clear strategy that truly represents a credible threat for the regime. So if we had ever had a chance to finally move ahead into, towards democracy in our country, it's today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What evidence do you have that the military is weaker than ever? Was your escape proof of that?",
      "MACHADO: Well, first of all, we have the evidence that the wide majority of the military want change, and that was- we saw that on July 28, 2024, that the military were ordered to expel our electoral witnesses from the polling stations and to deny our right to the original tally sheets and they disobeyed that order. Even in those polling stations where we know there is a high participation of military, we won by a landslide. More recently, we've seen more and more members of the military finding ways to connect with us, to send messages to, to, to show that they are feeling the same of what the rest of the country is feeling. When, when they, this military go back home, they find their children, their mother, their partners, saying that they are hungry, that they are persecuted, that their families have been divided. They are scared. Yes, they are scared, because repression and persecution in the military is even tougher than on civilians.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So President Trump said that land strikes to stop drug trafficking specifically will start soon. He has been saying that for weeks. Do you know what he is talking about? Has he promised you anything?",
      "MACHADO: No, I don't know. And well, if I knew, I wouldn't say it, of course. But it's not the case. We are not involved, and we will not get involved into another nation's policy for their own national security.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But would you welcome U.S. military action?",
      "MACHADO: I will welcome more and more pressure so that Maduro understands that he has to go, that his time is over. And I will insist something that I've said several times before, this is not conventional regime change. This cannot be compared to other cases, like countries in the Middle East, we had an election. Regime change was already mandated by over 70% of the population, and what we need is support to enforce that decision.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you square military action with receiving a peace prize? Are we at the point it's necessary?",
      "MACHADO: What we're fighting for is precisely freedom in order to have democracy and democracy, in order to have peace. And in order to maintain freedom and to achieve freedom, you do need strength. The contrary would be the peace of the dead, in which you have a country under absolute oppression and simply given in. And that's not the case. It's absolutely absurd that you see a regime, a criminal regime like Maduro, that gets support from Russia or from Iran and then as a benefit to unknown people, not to ask support from democratic countries and Democratic leaders, that's absolute, absurd. We do not have arms. We have our will. We have the power of organization and the power of love, which at the end, I have to say that peace is ultimately an act of love.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The regime itself has done a number of things. They have revoked TV licenses for journalists to broadcast, broadcast truthfully. He has jailed journalists. The United Nations says the National Guard targeted political opponents, committed sexual violence, tortured people and committed other crimes against humanity. So from where you sit is Maduro stepping down enough? Or do you need the entire regime dismantled? In which case that sounds like a country in collapse.",
      "MACHADO: That's a very good question, because certainly Maduro is the head of the structure, but it's like any other mafia system. You have families or groups that operate and sometimes even compete among each other. There are different degrees in the crimes they have committed, certainly those that have committed crimes against humanity that have been reported by the fact finding missions of the United Nations should face justice, local justice and international justice. There are other members of the regime or the armed forces that have committed lesser crimes. And certainly we will search for justice, not revenge. But this, I'm going to insist, what we're living right now is chaos. Maduro represent chaos. We're going to put order. And this whole idea, you know, people talking about a risk of a civil war and so on. Whoever says that has no idea at all about what Venezuela is. I mean, we are certainly the most cohesive society in the region, I would dare to say, perhaps in the world. I mean, Venezuelan society has no religious, social, regional, racial confrontations or tensions on the country. 90% of our population want the same, want the regime to go immediately, and we want to work hard to live with freedom. We want no more socialism, but most of all, we want our children back home.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood, but respectfully, you also have acknowledged that the drug cartels are exploiting your country, that Russia is exploiting your country, Iran, Cuba, China. Just yesterday, Vladimir Putin spoke with Maduro and said their strategic partnership is growing. Are you concerned here that Russia is going to shore up support for the military and intelligence?",
      "MACHADO: Well, I'm, I'm absolutely convinced that Putin wants the world to think that, especially wants President Trump to think that, about that. But I would ask you a question, do you think Putin has resources to spare at this time? Or does he has-something that's more urgent for him to invest those resources. I mean helping a regime that it's going to fall apart anyway, regardless of what he does. I don't think it's a priority for him. Nonetheless, I do not underestimate what the residual actors of Chavismo might be planning to do once we are in a transition to democracy. And that will require very efficient actions to isolate and neutralize those threats. And you know, we've work very hard to understand what's the true nature of our armed forces right now, identifying those military which we believe could be supportive of a tran- transition to democracy and the new gov--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Have they pledged that to you?",
      "MACHADO: Some of them, yes, and we believe that over 80% of our armed forces would join and support the democratic movement once the transition is in place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So tell me about that transition. I- we checked and when Secretary Rubio was sworn into office, you were one of the very first phone calls that he made. On day two.",
      "MACHADO: Me and President-elect Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, it was the two of us--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --That's right, that's right, he's deeply interested. So I'm interested in what has been promised to you if and when Maduro and his regime leave, what kind of support do you need to keep the country together to prevent another refugee crisis? And do you have that pledge from the American government now?",
      "MACHADO: We will need a lot of support, advice, information, technology, not only from the United States, also from multilateral organizations, some of which we are already working together. Not only in security issues but power supply, food supply. How do we bring, you know, put order in our financial accounts? How do we restructure our debt? How we open markets for international investment and give security to international investment in oil, in gas, in infrastructure, critical minerals? I mean, Venezuela is unique in terms of the amount of the natural endowments we have. And you know, we're located at three hours by plane from Florida. So it's hard to think, you know, in this shortening of the supply chains that is in the near-shoring process taking place a better ally in the region than Venezuela. And at the same time, you know, turning Venezuela from the criminal hub of the Americas into a security shield for the United States and for the rest of the region, is a top priority for all. So, you know, we have the plans ready. We have the teams ready. We know what we have to do the first 100 hours and the next 100 days. But most importantly, and I want to insist on this, we have the people. I mean, this is something that it's- I've heard once, over and over again all analysis leave the people on the side, when that's the most important force that we have right now. That's why we are where we are right now. And the Venezuelan people want to move ahead once we conquered democracy back, would have cost- has cost us so many lives, so many- so much pain, that you will see the country taking care of it. The people will be the main source of stability. But certainly we look forward for- to cooperation with our main allies. And of course, our main ally will be the United States of America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would that include US peacekeeping troops or other troops on the ground?",
      "MACHADO: I cannot answer that question right now. I don't think that's the case. There are other countries that have offered support as well in order to strengthen democratic institutions once the government-elect is in place, but that we will have to address that once we have the, you know, the government-elect in place and put in order, bringing order back to our country. And one thing that you mentioned before about the, you know, the refugee crisis, it's going to be exactly the country. The day Maduro goes, you will see 10s of 1000s, hundreds of 1000s of Venezuelan migrants coming back home from the United States and all over the world. I mean, our diaspora is desperate to go back to Venezuela. So even from that perspective, it is a win, win situation to have democracy in Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think it is safe for those Venezuelans in America to go back there now some temporary protected status was just revoked by the president for more than half a million Venezuelans here. Is it safe for them?",
      "MACHADO: Absolutely not. It will be safe once Maduro is gone, and every single citizen will be, you know, leaving freedom and respect in towards the law. We will bring back rule of law. We will liberate our political prisoners, and everybody will be free to speak out what they feel, what they think, what they want for the future, of their own future and their families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, we thank you for your time today, and we'll be watching.",
      "MACHADO: I thank you, Margaret, for this great opportunity, and God bless Venezuela. Venezuela will be free.",

    "story": [
      "Two U.S. Army soldiers and a U.S. civilian who was serving as an interpreter were killed after shots were fired at U.S. and Syrian forces on a mission to a historic central town in Syria on Saturday, U.S. military officials said. President Trump said\u00a0that there will be a \"very serious retaliation\" after the attack, which he attributed to the Islamic State.",
      "\"This was an ISIS attack against the U.S., and Syria, in a very dangerous part of Syria, that is not fully controlled by them,\" Mr. Trump said in a\u00a0post on Truth Social on Saturday. \"The President of Syria, Ahmed al-Sharaa, is extremely angry and disturbed by this attack. There will be very serious retaliation.\"",
      "Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a post on X that the attack occurred as the soldiers were conducting a \"key leader engagement.\" He said three other service members were injured in the incident.",
      "\"Their mission was in support of on-going counter-ISIS / counter-terrorism operations in the region,\" he said, adding that the soldiers' names, as well as identifying information about their units, will be withheld until 24 hours after the next of kin notification. \"This attack is currently under active investigation.\"",
      "U.S. Central Command said the attack was a \"result of an ambush by a lone ISIS gunman in Syria,\" and that the \"gunman was engaged and killed.\"",
      "The shooting took place near Palmyra, according to Syria's state-run SANA news agency, which said two members of Syria's security force were wounded. Additional information on their condition was not immediately available.",
      "No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, and the identity of the gunman has not been released.",
      "Mr. Trump, speaking to reporters outside the White House before departing for the Army-Navy football game in Baltimore, said the three service members wounded \"seem to be doing well.\"",
      "\"We mourn the loss of three great patriots in Syria,\" he said, adding: \"Syria was fighting along with us. The president of Syria is devastated. This is an ISIS attack. We mourn the loss. We pray for their parents and loved ones.\"",
      "When asked if the U.S. would respond if forces were attacked again, Mr. Trump said: \"We will retaliate.\"",
      "U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said in a X post on Saturday that the \"savage who perpetrated this attack was killed by partner forces.\"",
      "\"Let it be known, if you target Americans \u2014 anywhere in the world \u2014 you will spend the rest of your brief, anxious life knowing the United States will hunt you, find you, and ruthlessly kill you,\" he wrote.",
      "Tom Barrack, the U.S. Ambassador to Turkey and special envoy for Syria, condemned the \"cowardly terrorist ambush\" on X.",
      "\"We mourn the loss of three brave U.S. service members and civilian personnel and wish a speedy recovery to the Syrian troops wounded in the attack,\" Barrack wrote. \"We remain committed to defeating terrorism with our Syrian partners.\"",
      "The U.S. has hundreds of troops deployed in eastern Syria as part of a coalition fighting the\u00a0Islamic State\u00a0group.",
      "Last month, Syria joined the international coalition fighting against ISIS as Damascus improved its relations with Western countries following last year's fall of President\u00a0Bashar al-Assad\u00a0when insurgents captured his seat of power in Damascus.",
      "The U.S. had no diplomatic relations with Syria under Assad, but ties have warmed since the fall of the five-decade Assad family rule. The interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, made a\u00a0historic visit\u00a0to Washington last month, where he held talks with President Trump.",
      "ISIS was defeated in Syria in 2019 but the group's sleeper cells still carry out deadly attacks in the country. The United Nations says the group still has between 5,000 and 7,000 fighters in Syria and Iraq.",
      "U.S. troops, which have maintained a presence in different parts of Syria \u2014 including Al-Tanf garrison in the central province of Homs \u2014 to train other forces as part of a broad campaign against IS, have been targeted in the past. One of the deadliest attacks occurred in 2019 in the northern town of Manbij when a blast killed two U.S. service members and two American civilians, as well as others from Syria, while conducting a patrol.",

      "The attack \"clearly reveals the subversive approach of the rebel militia and those behind it,\" the military said in a statement. The military posted a video on social media showing plumes of dense black smoke over what it said was the U.N. facility.",
      "The oil-rich Abyei is a disputed region between Sudan and South Sudan, and the U.N. mission has been deployed there since 2011 when South Sudan gained its independence from Sudan.",
      "Guterres also called for an immediate ceasefire in Sudan to allow \"a comprehensive, inclusive and Sudanese-owned political process\" to settle the conflict in the northeast African country.",
      "Sudan was plunged into chaos in April 2023 when a power struggle\u00a0between the military and the RSF exploded into open fighting in the capital, Khartoum, and elsewhere in the country. The conflict has killed\u00a0over 40,000 people - a figure rights groups consider a significant undercount.",
      "The fighting has recently centered on Kodrofan, particularly since the RSF took control of el-Fasher, the military's last stronghold in the western region of Darfur.",
      "The war has wrecked urban areas and has been marked by atrocities, including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings which the U.N. and rights groups have said amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in the western region of Darfur.",
      "The war has also created the world's worst humanitarian crisis and pushed parts of the country into famine.",

    "story": [
      "British police said Saturday they have found no evidence that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor asked one of his bodyguards to investigate Jeffrey Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre.",
      "London's Metropolitan Police in October said it was looking into media reports that the former Prince Andrew in 2011 sought information to smear Giuffre by asking a police bodyguard to find out if she had a criminal record. The Mail on Sunday newspaper claimed the then-prince passed Giuffre's date of birth and social security number to his taxpayer-funded bodyguard.",
      "In a statement on Saturday, the force said its assessment \"has not revealed any additional evidence of criminal acts or misconduct,\" and it would not open a criminal investigation.",
      "\"The Met remains committed to thoroughly assessing any new information that could assist in this matter,\" said police Central Specialist Crime Commander Ella Marriott. \"To date, we have not received any additional evidence that would support reopening the investigation. In the absence of any further information, we will be taking no further action. Our thoughts will always be with Ms. Giuffre's family and friends following her death.\"",
      "Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, alleged that in the early 2000s, when she was a teenager, she was caught up in Epstein's sex trafficking ring and exploited by Andrew and other influential men.",
      "King Charles III formally stripped his younger brother of his royal title last month after new details emerged of Andrew's relationship with Epstein and Giuffre's posthumous memoir refocused attention on her allegations.

    "story": [
      "Lindsey Vonn is back on the podium on Saturday after a World Cup downhill race that is separated by a razor-thin margin of 0.24 seconds.",
      "One day after becoming the oldest winner of a World Cup downhill, the 41-year-old American finished second in a race on Saturday in St. Moritz, Switzerland.",
      "After winning the season's opening downhill by nearly a full second on Friday, Vonn was beaten by only one racer this time: Emma Aicher of Germany was 0.24 seconds faster.",
      "Vonn attributed a mistake to landing a jump midway down her run for the gap, when she nearly lost her balance for an instant and leaned heavily on her left leg to get back up.",
      "\"I'm a little bit tired from yesterday, there was a lot of emotion,\" Vonn told Swiss broadcaster RTS. \"I thought I skied pretty well on top, then I was just out of balance, I fell on my hip. Yeah, didn't ski the bottom the way I wanted to.\"",
      "Sofia Goggia, the 2018 Olympic champion from Italy, finished third, 0.29 behind, and Breezy Johnson, the American world champion, was fourth, 0.40 back.",
      "Vonn, who is preparing for the Milan Cortina Olympics, went into first position with her run down the sun-drenched Corviglia course. But the 22-year-old Aicher came down next and quickly pushed Vonn out of the leader's seat.",
      "Vonn returned to skiing last season after nearly six years of retirement \u2014 following a partial replacement surgery on her right knee, which included inserting two pieces of titanium.",
      "The three-time Olympic medalist\u00a0told CBS Sunday Morning\u00a0in March that she \"never thought\" she would be talking about going to the Olympics again. Just talking about heading to Italy means she is \"already winning,\" she said.",
      "\"I will be at a disadvantage,\" Vonn said. \"I am 40, and at that time next year I will be 41. But I know my skiing is there. I think I'm actually skiing better now than I was last few years of my career.\"",
      "Vonn's results are shaping up to make her a top medal contender at the Olympics \u2014 and able to compete with skiers half her age. Women's Alpine skiing at the Feb. 6-22 Winter Games will be contested at Cortina d'Ampezzo, where Vonn holds the record of 12 World Cup wins.",
      "Vonn registered the top speed of 64 mph on the top section; increased her speed to 68 mph at the bottom and flew a massive 41 yards off a jump toward the end of her run",
      "Vonn also clocked the fastest time in the final sector \u2014 a sign of her increased fitness this season. She said earlier this week that she added 12 pounds of muscle during dry-land training over the summer and followed a rigid diet.",
      "When Vonn crossed the finish line and saw that she was ahead of Goggia, Vonn celebrated, thinking that she had won. She let out a scream, punched the air with one of her poles and then raised her arms over her head, shaking her head in apparent disbelief.",
      "It was Vonn's 140th podium result and it came in a record-breaking 410th World Cup race. Former Austrian skier Renate G\u00f6tschl held the previous record with 409 races.",
      "It was Aicher's third World Cup victory and second in downhill. She's a rare all-around skier capable of being competitive in all four disciplines \u2014 like Vonn at the height of her career.",
      "Aicher also finished on the podium in a slalom this season, placing third in Levi, Finland.",
      "Vonn could aim for another victory in a super-G in St. Moritz on Sunday \u2014 in a race that fellow American standout Mikaela Shiffrin is also expected to compete in.",

    "summary": "John Coale, the U.S. special envoy for Belarus, said that normalizing relations between Washington and Minsk was \"our goal.\"",
    "story": [
      "Belarusian authorities have released Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski and key opposition figure Maria Kolesnikova from prison, Pavel Sapelka, human rights advocate with the Viasna rights group, confirmed to the AP.",
      "Their release comes as authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko seeks to improve relations with Washington. The U.S. earlier on Saturday announced lifting sanctions on the country's potash sector. In exchange for sanctions relief, Lukashenko pardoned 123 prisoners, the Belta state news agency reported.",
      "A close ally of Russia, Minsk has faced Western isolation and sanctions for years. Lukashenko has ruled the nation of 9.5 million with an iron fist for more than three decades, and the country has been\u00a0repeatedly sanctioned by Western countries\u00a0both for its crackdown on human rights and for allowing Moscow to use its territory in the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Belarus has released hundreds of prisoners since July 2024.",
      "Earlier Saturday, the United States said it was lifting sanctions on Belarusian potash in the latest sign of a thaw between Washington and the isolated autocracy.",
      "John Coale, the U.S. special envoy for Belarus, made the announcement after meeting Lukashenko in Minsk on Friday and Saturday.",
      "Speaking with journalists, Coale described the two-day talks as \"very productive,\" Belarus' state news agency Belta reported Saturday.",
      "The U.S. envoy said that normalizing relations between Washington and Minsk was \"our goal.\"",
      "\"We're lifting sanctions, releasing prisoners. We're constantly talking to each other,\" he said, according to Belta. He also said that the relationship between the countries was moving from \"baby steps to more confident steps\" as they increased dialogue.",
      "The last time U.S. officials met with Lukashenko in September 2025, Washington announced easing some of the sanctions against Belarus while Minsk released more than 50 political prisoners into Lithuania. Overall, Belarus released more than 430 political prisoners since July 2024, in what was widely seen as an effort at a rapprochement with the West.",
      "Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya told The Associated Press on Saturday that sanctions relief was part of a deal between Minsk and Washington, in which another large group of political prisoners in Belarus was expected to be released.",
      "\"The freeing of political prisoners means that Lukashenko understands the pain of Western sanctions and is seeking to ease them,\" Tsikhanouskaya said.",
      "She added: \"But let's not be naive: Lukashenko hasn't changed his policies, his crackdown continues and he keeps on supporting Russia's war against Ukraine. That's why we need to be extremely cautious with any talk of sanctions relief, so that we don't reinforce Russia's war machine and encourage continued repressions.\"",
      "Tsikhnouskaya also described European Union sanctions against Belarusian potash fertilizers as far more painful for Minsk than those imposed by the U.S, saying that while easing U.S. sanctions could lead to the release of political prisoners, European sanctions should push for long-term, systemic changes in Belarus and the end of Russia's war in Ukraine.",

      "Thai officials have said they did not agree to a ceasefire, and Cambodia has not commented on Mr. Trump's claim. Its defense ministry instead said Thai jets carried out airstrikes Saturday morning. Cambodian media reported Mr. Trump's claim without elaborating.",

      "\"We regret and we're disappointed that some of the points made by President Trump have bearing upon the feeling of the Thai people, Thailand, because we consider ourselves \u2014 we are proud, in fact \u2014 to be the oldest treaty ally of the United States in the region,\" he said.",
      "The latest large-scale fighting was set off by a skirmish on Dec. 7 that wounded two Thai soldiers and derailed a ceasefire promoted by Mr. Trump that ended five days of earlier combat in July over longstanding territorial disputes.",
      "The July ceasefire was brokered by Malaysia and pushed through by pressure from Mr. Trump, who threatened to withhold trade privileges unless Thailand and Cambodia agreed. It was formalized in more detail in October at a regional meeting in Malaysia that Mr. Trump attended.",
      "About two dozen people have officially been reported killed in this past week's fighting, while hundreds of thousands have been displaced on both sides of the border.",
      "The Thai military acknowledges 11 of its troops have been killed, while estimating there have been 165 fatalities among Cambodian soldiers. Cambodia has not announced military casualties, but has said at least 11 civilians have been killed and 76 wounded.",

      "Mr. Trump's claim came after midnight in Bangkok. Thai Prime Minister Anutin had, after his call with Mr. Trump, said he had explained Thailand's reasons for fighting and said peace would depend on Cambodia ceasing its attacks first. The Thai foreign ministry later explicitly disputed Trump's claim that a ceasefire had been reached. Anutin's busy day on Friday included dissolving Parliament, so new elections could be held early next year.",
      "Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet, in comments posted early Saturday morning, also made no mention of a ceasefire.",
      "He said he held phone conversations on Friday night with Mr. Trump, and a night earlier with Malaysia's Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, and thanked both \"for their continuous efforts to achieve a long-lasting peace between Cambodia and Thailand.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 12 Dec 2025 20:13:52 -0500",
    "summary": "The move represents a thawing of sorts in the frosty relationship between the Trump administration and the Brazilian government.",
    "story": [
      "The United States removed Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes from its sanctions list on Friday after initially adding him over his role in leading the trial against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.",
      "De Moraes' wife and the Lex Institute, which she leads, were also taken off the list, according to documents from the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control. Brazil's government celebrated the move, which came after a weekend phone conversation between President Trump and Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.",
      "The Trump administration had sanctioned the judge in July, accusing him of using his position to authorize arbitrary pretrial detentions and suppress freedom of expression in Brazil.",
      "In August 2024, de Moraes also ordered that Elon Musk's X platform be suspended in Brazil over allegations it was not doing enough to target misinformation. The ban on the site was lifted two months later. At the time, Musk was a major ally of Mr. Trump and was helping finance his presidential campaign.",
      "A senior Trump administration official said the sanctions were lifted since the U.S. saw the passage of an important amnesty bill by Brazil's lower house as a signal that lawfare conditions in Brazil are improving. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the administration's views on foreign policy interests.",
      "The move represents a thawing of sorts in the frosty relationship between the two governments and follows a number of meetings and calls that both have described in positive terms. Mr. Trump had seen Lula's predecessor Bolsonaro as an ally, with the Brazilian leader even dubbed the \"Trump of the Tropics\" when he came into office.",
      "During Bolsonaro's trial, Mr. Trump called his treatment an \"international disgrace.\" In a\u00a0July 9 letter\u00a0to Lula posted to social media, Mr. Trump said the trial was a \"witch hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!\"",
      "And in announcing de Moraes' sanction in July, Secretary of State Marco Rubio alleged that the judge had \"abused his authority by engaging in a targeted and politically motivated effort designed to silence political critics through the issuance of secret orders compelling online platforms, including U.S. social media companies, to ban the accounts of individuals for posting protected speech. Moraes further abused his position to authorize unjust pre-trial detentions and undermine freedom of expression.\"",
      "Bolsonaro was accused of masterminding a plot to stay in power despite his 2022 election defeat to Lula.",
      "He was convicted and sentenced to more than 27 years in prison. The embattled 70-year-old leader started serving his sentence last month while still requesting to be put on house arrest due to his poor health. The massive upheaval his allies expected upon his arrest did not materialize, though he remains a politically powerful figure ahead of next year's elections.",
      "Brazil's current government characterized the lifting of sanctions as a \"big defeat\" for Bolsonaro's family.",
      "\"It was Lula who put this repeal [of the sanctions] on Donald Trump's desk, in a dignifying and sovereign dialogue,\" said Gleisi Hoffmann, Brazil's minister for institutional relations. \"It is a big defeat for the family of Jair Bolsonaro, traitors who have conspired against Brazil and the judiciary.\"",
      "Lula's leftist administration has long accused Eduardo Bolsonaro, a lawmaker and son of the former president, of misleading Mr. Trump on de Moraes and other members of the court. Eduardo Bolsonaro said he received the news of the sanctions being lifted from de Moraes \"with regret.\"",
      "The younger Bolsonaro, who announced in March that he would start living in the U.S. in order to lobby the Trump administration to help his father avoid jail, said he would continue to fight for Jair Bolsonaro.",
      "\"The lack of internal cohesion and the insufficient support for initiatives pursued abroad contributed to the worsening of the current situation,\" Eduardo Bolsonaro wrote on his social media channels, after Mr. Trump's reversal. \"We sincerely hope that President Donald Trump's decision will be successful in defending the strategic interests of the American people, as is his duty.\"",
      "In initially sanctioning de Moraes, the Treasury Department had cited the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which targets perpetrators of human rights abuse and corrupt officials. De Moraes said the use of the act against him was \"illegal and regrettable.\"",
      "Also in July, the Trump administration imposed a 40% tariff on Brazilian products on top of a 10% tariff imposed earlier, justifying the tariffs by saying that Brazil's policies and criminal prosecution of Bolsonaro constituted an economic emergency.",
      "However, last month the White House announced it was removing the 40% tariffs on certain Brazilian imports, including beef and coffee. The U.S. ran a $6.8 billion trade surplus last year with Brazil, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "Mr. Trump and Lula started mending fences at the United Nations' General Assembly in September, which was followed by their first private meeting in Malaysia in October and subsequent phone conversations.",
      "The Brazilian president has said he wasn't only trying to reverse the increase on tariffs but also to end the sanctions on de Moraes and some members of his government who were also hit by the measure.",
      "Separately, Lula has urged Latin American states to help avoid a conflict in Venezuela as the Trump administration orders military action against vessels allegedly linked to drug cartels.",

      "King Charles III said Friday that his cancer treatment will be reduced in the new year because of early diagnosis, effective intervention and adherence to doctors' orders.",

      "\"Early diagnosis quite simply saves lives,\" the king said Friday.",
      "\"I know, too, what a difference it has made in my own case, enabling me to continue leading a full and active life even while undergoing treatment,\" he added.",
      "The recorded message gave Charles the opportunity to reflect on his experiences in the 22 months since he announced he would undergo treatment for an undisclosed type of cancer.",
      "He said he had been deeply troubled to learn that at least 9 million people in the U.K. weren't up to date with the cancer screenings available to them.",
      "\"That is at least 9 million opportunities for early diagnosis being missed,\" he stressed.",
      "He highlighted how when bowel cancer is caught at the earliest stage, around nine in 10 people survive for at least five years. \"When diagnosed late, that falls to just one in 10,\" Charles said.",
      "Royal sources said it should not be assumed the king was being treated for bowel cancer. While the palace hasn't specified what type of cancer the king has, officials said the cancer was discovered after treatment for an enlarged prostate revealed \"a separate issue of concern.\"",
      "Charles' decision to disclose his diagnosis was a departure for Britain's royals, who have traditionally considered their health to be a personal matter and shared few details with the public.",
      "\"His majesty has chosen to share his diagnosis to prevent speculation and in the hope it may assist public understanding for all those around the world who are affected by cancer,\" Buckingham Palace said at the time.",
      "Since then, Charles has used his own story to highlight the need for early diagnosis and treatment. Cancer Research UK recorded a 33% increase in visits to its website in the weeks after the king's diagnosis, as people sought information about the signs of cancer.",
      "The monarch suspended public engagements for about two months after his diagnosis so he could focus on his treatment and recovery. But he continued with state business and retained his constitutional role as head of state.",
      "Charles returned to public-facing events in April of last year with a visit to a cancer treatment center at University College Hospital in central London, where he met with staff and shared stories with fellow cancer patients.",

This cannot be compared to other cases, like countries in the Middle East.\"",
      "\"We had an election,\" she continued. \"Regime change was already mandated by over 70% of the population, and what we need is support to enforce that decision.\"",
      "When Machado was asked how she squares military action with receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, Machado said \"in order to maintain freedom and to achieve freedom, you do need strength.\"",
      "\"What we're fighting for is precisely freedom in order to have democracy, and democracy in order to have peace,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "ADHD and Executive Function Coach Brooke Schnittman on what is behind more adult women being diagnosed with ADHD and the impact of technology and social media",
      "Chronic lateness is known to be a common annoyance, often leading to strain within relationships, experts have confirmed.",
      "And for some people who struggle to be on time, the reasons may go far beyond poor planning.",
      "Psychotherapist and author Jonathan Alpert told Fox News Digital that chronic lateness often stems from a combination of psychological patterns and neurobiological factors that people may not realize are influencing them.",
      "ALWAYS RUNNING LATE? A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION COULD BE TO BLAME, EXPERTS SAY",
      "\"For some people, it's personality-driven. They're distractible, optimistic about how long things take, or simply not tuned into the impact on others,\" the New York-based expert said.",
      "For others, the issue stems from neurobiological differences that affect how the brain manages time.",
      "Chronic lateness may not stem from poor planning, but from psychological and neurobiological factors. (iStock)",
      "That can make it harder to estimate how long tasks take or to transition from one activity to the next, leading to chronic lateness, according to Alpert.",
      "Impact on relationships",
      "In addition to disrupting schedules, chronic lateness may also strain relationships and create tension.",
      "\"Lateness erodes trust. Over time, it sends the message that someone else's time is less important, even if that's not the intent,\" Alpert noted.",
      "7 SIGNS YOU MIGHT HAVE ADHD AND WHAT STEPS TO TAKE",
      "Lateness can also become an issue in the workplace, where repeated delays can undermine teamwork and harm a person's reputation.",
      "These patterns are common among people with ADHD, who often experience what is known as \"time blindness,\" making it difficult to recognize how quickly minutes pass or how long tasks truly take.",
      "\"Adding 10 to 15 minutes of buffer between activities reduces the frantic rushing that leads to chronic lateness.\"",
      "ADHD is strongly associated with executive-function difficulties, which are the skills needed to stay organized, plan ahead and focus on essential details, according to the Attention Deficit Disorder Association.",
      "When these abilities are weaker, it becomes more challenging to gauge time, follow a schedule and meet deadlines, which can impact personal and professional relationships, experts agree.",
      "Frequent tardiness in a work setting can throw off group efforts and leave others with a negative impression of the employee. (iStock)",
      "Underlying patterns",
      "Anxiety, avoidance and perfectionism are patterns that Alpert most often sees in people who tend to run late, he noted.",
      "\"Many chronically late individuals don't intend to be disrespectful. They're overwhelmed, anxious or trying to squeeze too much into too little time,\" he said.",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "These emotional patterns often show up in different ways. For some, anxiety can make it difficult to begin even simple tasks, pushing everything behind schedule before the day has even started, according to Alpert.",
      "For others, the struggle happens in the in-between moments. Shifting from one activity to another can feel surprisingly uncomfortable, so they linger longer than intended and lose time without noticing.",
      "Anxiety is a major factor behind why some people have trouble being on time, according to experts. (iStock)",
      "Others may get caught up in the details, as perfectionism keeps them adjusting or \"fixing one more thing\" as the minutes slip away, Alpert said.",
      "TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ",
      "Another major factor, the expert shared, is that many people simply misjudge how long tasks take. Their internal sense of time is often inaccurate, which leads them to assume they can fit far more into a day than is realistically possible.",
      "\u2018Time audit\u2019",
      "Alpert often recommends that his clients perform a simple \"time audit,\" where they track how long they think a routine task will take and then time it in real life. This can help them rebuild a more accurate internal clock, he said.",

      "Men account for higher rates of nearly all major chronic diseases \u2014 yet nearly two-thirds admit that they avoid going to the doctor for as long as possible, according to a Cleveland Clinic survey.",
      "Physicians warn that once men enter their 40s, routine screenings become essential for spotting problems early, before preventable conditions turn life-threatening.",
      "\"When it comes to preventing heart attacks, strokes, fatigue, erectile dysfunction, metabolic disease and early aging, testing is essential,\" Dr. Jack Wolfson, a cardiologist in Arizona, told Fox News Digital. \"Most men have no idea what\u2019s happening inside their bodies until it\u2019s too late.\"",
      "EVEN LOW-CALORIE PROCESSED FOOD CAUSES WEIGHT GAIN, TESTOSTERONE LOSS IN MEN, STUDY SUGGESTS",
      "\"If I could give one message to every man over 40: Test, don\u2019t guess,\" he went on. \"Catch the problem early, fix it naturally, and live to 100 and beyond with vitality.\"",
      "Below, experts share some of the most important medical tests that men over 40 should discuss with their doctors \u2014 some of which are universally recommended, and others that apply to certain groups.",
      "Men account for higher rates of nearly all major chronic diseases \u2014 yet nearly two-thirds admit that they avoid going to the doctor for as long as possible. (iStock)",
      "1. Complete blood count (CBC)",
      "Dr. Andrea Caamano, M.D., a New Jersey physician specializing in endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism, recommends that this blood test is performed yearly for men in their 40s and older.",
      "\"It tells us the state of a patient\u2019s red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets, and tells of infection, allergic reactions, inflammation, anemia and clotting disorders,\" she told Fox News Digital.",
      "WHY MOST PEOPLE FALL OFF A \u2018HEALTH CLIFF\u2019 AT 75 \u2014 AND 5 WAYS TO AVOID THE DROP",
      "The CBC is especially important in men undergoing testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), as testosterone stimulates the production of red blood cells \u2014 and an overproduction will raise the risk of clots and high blood pressure, according to the doctor.",
      "\"The test\u2019s only limitation is that it does not tell us why something is happening,\" Caamano said. \"It will give us values, but not a reason when they are outside normal limits.\"",
      "\"If I could give one message to every man over 40: Test, don\u2019t guess.\"",
      "Health agencies such as the CDC, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and World Health Organization do not recommend a CBC test for every person without symptoms, but they do recommend it for people experiencing symptoms like anemia, infection, inflammation, fatigue, bleeding or bruising, or for those with a known medical condition.",
      "2. Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)",
      "This blood test is commonly performed yearly, according to Caamano, especially for men using TRT.",
      "\"This blood test measures metabolic and organ function, giving information about the kidneys and liver, and electrolyte and glucose state,\" she said. \"It is important to catch any organ issue that can pop up on its own, or that can be age- or medication-induced.\"",
      "The CDC and USPSTF recommend that all adults 18 and over should undergo routine blood pressure screening. High blood pressure is defined as 130/80 mmHg or higher. (iStock)",
      "The test can also catch things like liver and kidney disease, pre-diabetes, full-blown diabetes and electrolyte imbalances that can lead to blood pressure fluctuations and heart rhythm issues, according to the doctor.",
      "Caamano recommends that men using TRT get a baseline CMP, then get monitored every three to six months in the first year of treatment and then yearly. Organizations like the USPSTF, CDC and WHO, however, only recommend CMPs when evaluating symptoms, monitoring chronic conditions or checking medication safety.",
      "3. Blood pressure",
      "The CDC and USPSTF recommend that all adults 18 and over should undergo routine blood pressure screening. High blood pressure is defined as 130/80 mmHg or higher.",
      "Individuals aged 40 and older \u2014 or those with elevated risk \u2014 are advised to be tested every year, while younger adults with consistently normal results may be screened every three to five years.",
      "LOW TESTOSTERONE SIGNS MEN CAN\u2019T IGNORE \u2014 AND WHAT EXPERTS SAY ABOUT HORMONE THERAPY",
      "\"The use of TRT can increase blood pressure, so it is very important to monitor regularly,\" Caamano said. \"Increased blood pressure can be indicative of cardiovascular disease.\"",
      "4. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score",
      "Dr. Auda Auda, a board-certified physician at Baker Health in New York, names this as his top recommendation to protect against heart disease, which remains the No. 1 cause of death in men over 40.",
      "\"A CAC scan directly measures calcified plaque in the coronary arteries, years before symptoms develop,\" Auda told Fox News Digital. \"For many men, it\u2019s the difference between \u2018normal annual labs\u2019 and a silent, high-risk cardiovascular picture that would otherwise go unnoticed.\"",
      "A high CAC score identifies early coronary atherosclerosis, leading to targeted lifestyle changes, statins and risk modification to help prevent heart attack and stroke. (iStock)",
      "A high CAC score identifies early coronary atherosclerosis, leading to targeted lifestyle changes, statins and risk modification to help prevent heart attack and stroke, the doctor noted.",
      "The test should be done every five years if the score is 0, or every one to two years if the score is >0, Auda advised.",
      "WANT BETTER HEART HEALTH? START BY TACKLING YOUR WEAKEST LINK, CARDIAC SURGEON SAYS",
      "\"I\u2019ve had multiple men in their 40s with \u2018perfect\u2019 cholesterol come back with CAC scores in the 200-400 range, completely changing their trajectory,\" he shared.",
      "Major health agencies, such as the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA) and USPSTF, recommend CAC scoring for adults who are at intermediate risk of heart disease or when it\u2019s unclear whether they should start statin therapy.",
      "5. Advanced lipid profile",
      "Dr. Jeremy M. Liff, a board-certified neurologist in New York, puts this test at the top of his list.",
      "\"Unlike a standard cholesterol panel, which only gives you HDL (\u2018good\u2019 cholesterol) and LDL (\u2018bad\u2019 cholesterol), the advanced version breaks down the specific types of LDL particles,\" Liff told Fox News Digital. \"Some LDL particles are far more dangerous than others.\"",
      "\"Insulin resistance influences nearly every major organ, including the liver and the brain.\"",
      "The advanced lipid profile helps to prevent \"catastrophic\" cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes, according to the doctor.",
      "\"This test gives men over 40 a much clearer picture of their cardiovascular risk and whether they need major dietary or lifestyle changes,\" he said. \"By identifying dangerous LDL particle types early, men can intervene before plaque buildup becomes life-threatening.\"",
      "The advanced lipid profile helps to prevent \"catastrophic\" cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes, according to a doctor. (iStock)",
      "The advanced lipid profile may only need to be done once if the baseline looks excellent, according to the doctor. If results are poor, men should repeat the test every six months under their doctor\u2019s guidance, he advised.",
      "Major health organizations \u2014 including the ACC, AHA, Endocrine Society and USPSTF \u2014 regard advanced lipid profiles as optional decision-support tools rather than standard screening tests.",
      "6. Thyroid function",
      "This blood test can be done yearly to evaluate how well your thyroid gland is functioning, according to Caamano.",
      "\"Issues with thyroid function can lead to mood changes, fatigue, weight changes, palpitations and hair loss,\" she told Fox News Digital.",
      "The thyroid is often checked when men have symptoms such as fatigue, weight changes, palpitations or hair loss, while some physicians also order it periodically in midlife.",
      "MEN MAY NEED TO WORK TWICE AS HARD AS WOMEN TO PREVENT POTENTIALLY DEADLY DISEASE",
      "The test measures levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is made by the pituitary gland and tells the thyroid how much hormone to produce. It also measures levels of free T4 (the main hormone the thyroid releases) and free T3 (the active form that the body converts T4 into).",
      "Based on these three levels, a doctor can determine whether the thyroid is underactive or overactive.",
      "\"Issues with thyroid function can lead to mood changes, fatigue, weight changes, palpitations and hair loss,\" one doctor cautioned. (iStock)",
      "Major health agencies, such as the USPSTF, American Thyroid Association (ATA) and American College of Physicians, recommend this test for people who are at higher risk of thyroid disease, are experiencing symptoms or have autoimmune conditions.",
      "7. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)",
      "A PSA blood test measures the level of prostate-specific antigen, a protein produced by both normal and cancerous cells of the prostate gland.",
      "This test, sometimes along with a digital rectal exam, is used to screen for cancer or enlargement of the prostate, according to Caamano.",
      "EXPERT WARNS OF 'SILENT EPIDEMIC' THAT PUTS MEN\u2019S HEALTH AT SERIOUS RISK",
      "The USPSTF, American Urological Association (AUA) and American Cancer Society (ACS) recommend \"shared decision-making\" for men aged 55 to 69, warning of the risks of false positives, overdiagnosis and overtreatment with the PSA test.",
      "8. Insulin sensitivity test",
      "Some clinicians use additional markers of insulin sensitivity when taking a more proactive approach to metabolic health. These measures can provide insights that go beyond standard tests such as fasting glucose and HbA1c, which reflects average blood glucose over the past two to three months.",
      "\"Insulin resistance influences nearly every major organ, including the liver and the brain,\" Liff told Fox News Digital. \"It plays a major role in metabolic health, long-term inflammation and future disease risk.\"",
      "Poor insulin sensitivity is closely tied to fatty liver disease, cognitive decline and vascular problems. (iStock)",
      "Poor insulin sensitivity is closely tied to fatty liver disease, cognitive decline and vascular problems, according to the doctor.",
      "\"Detecting it early allows men to make changes that protect long-term organ health, including the brain,\" Liff said. \"Depending on the initial findings, a repeat every six months may be appropriate.\"",
      "Major health agencies, such as the ADA (American Diabetes Association), USPSTF, CDC and WHO, generally recommend screening for diabetes and prediabetes using fasting glucose, HbA1c or a standard oral glucose tolerance test.",
      "9. Hormone levels",
      "Caamano recommends that certain men over 40 get tested for hormones, including total testosterone, free testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol, which can be measured in a blood draw.",
      "\"These are done when men are having symptoms such as low libido, fatigue, breast enlargement or when they are using TRT,\" she told Fox News Digital.",
      "TWO KEY HEART HEALTH METRICS COULD DETERMINE HOW LONG YOU'LL LIVE",
      "Consistency is key in hormonal testing, according to the doctor. \"Testosterone should be measured in the morning, as it follows a pattern, peaking in the morning hours,\" Caamano said. \"Hormonal blood levels, along with symptoms, help determine the need for TRT.\"",
      "The Endocrine Society, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), USPSTF and the American Urological Association only recommend hormone tests when there are clear symptoms or medical indications.",
      "10. Omega-3 index",
      "Cardiologist Wolfson, who is also founder of Natural Heart Doctor, a holistic cardiology practice, calls this test \"the most powerful predictor of heart attack and sudden death risk\" \u2014 though it\u2019s not yet part of standard screening guidelines for everyone.",
      "Low omega-3 levels, specifically eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are associated with a range of medical conditions, including heart attacks, strokes, high blood pressure, insulin resistance, poor cognition, mood disorders and more, studies have shown.",
      "Omega-3 fatty acids, or fish oil, \"were associated with significant reductions in heart attacks,\" the researchers found. (iStock)",
      "\"The omega-3 index is a direct measurement of omega-3 levels inside red blood cells, making it far more meaningful than a standard blood omega-3 test,\" Wolfson told Fox News Digital.",
      "He recommends that men 40 and older get the test once per year \u2014 \"or every six months if supplementing and optimizing.\"",
      "HEART SURGEON REVEALS WHAT TO EAT (AND NOT EAT) FOR OPTIMAL CARDIAC HEALTH",
      "However, major health agencies like the AHA and the National Institutes of Health do not recommend routine omega-3 index testing for the general population, as the test is mainly used for patients with cardiovascular disease who are already considering omega-3 supplementation.",
      "11. Carotid artery ultrasound",
      "Narrowing of the carotid arteries reduces blood flow to the brain and increases the risk of stroke, according to Liff. The carotid artery ultrasound can reveal problems long before symptoms appear, potentially protecting brain health.",
      "It may be considered in some high-risk men or when a doctor suspects carotid disease.",
      "\"Reduced blood flow from plaque buildup can trigger strokes or transient ischemic attacks,\" Liff told Fox News Digital. \"Catching the narrowing early allows for treatment, lifestyle changes or close monitoring before a serious event occurs.\"",
      "Narrowing of the carotid arteries reduces blood flow to the brain and increases the risk of stroke, an expert noted. (iStock)",
      "If there is no evidence of disease, Liff recommends repeating the test every few years. \"If narrowing is detected, a specialist should follow the patient more closely,\" he advised.",
      "The USPSTF, AHA, American Stroke Association (ASA) and ACC only recommend the carotid artery ultrasound when there are neurological symptoms or high clinical suspicion of carotid disease based on medical history.",
      "12. Colon cancer screening",
      "The USPSTF, ACS and CDC now recommend screening average-risk adults for colon cancer from the ages of 45 to 75.",
      "Men with a family history of colorectal cancer should begin screenings at 40, Caamano noted. Those with a low risk level should begin screenings at 45, via colonoscopy or an at-home stool test.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "\"A colonoscopy should be done every 10 years unless polyps are found, which then drops the time to every three to five years \u2014 or for those with a family history of colorectal cancer, every five years,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"This screening is super important, as early detection can be lifesaving.\"",
      "13. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)",
      "High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is a blood test that detects low levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation in the body.",
      "Wolfson refers to this test as the \"inflammation alarm bell. \"Chronic inflammation is a major driver of heart disease, strokes, cancer, dementia, diabetes and accelerated aging,\" he told Fox News Digital, calling \"hs-CRP \u2018the single best early warning sign.\u2019\"",
      "Dubbed the \"sunshine hormone,\" vitamin D is known to predict health span, according to an expert. (iStock)",
      "The test helps to detect silent cardiovascular inflammation, early artery damage, hidden infections and inflammatory lifestyle triggers, such as poor sleep, stress, alcohol and toxins, Wolfson noted.",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "He recommends that men in their 40s and older get the test every six months, or more frequently if levels are elevated or if symptoms are present. Per major health agencies, however, there is insufficient evidence that hs-CRP should be routinely performed unless someone experiences symptoms or is at intermediate cardiovascular risk.",
      "14. Vitamin D",
      "Dubbed the \"sunshine hormone,\" vitamin D is known to predict health span, according to Wolfson.",
      "Low levels are linked to heart disease, cancer, autoimmune conditions, high blood pressure, depression, low testosterone, poor immune resilience and early aging, according to the doctor.",
      "\"It is one of the strongest indicators of lifestyle quality, including sun exposure, sleep habits, metabolic health and inflammation,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Levels may be low in men who avoid the sun or overuse sunscreen.\"",
      "TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ",
      "Wolfson recommends vitamin D testing twice per year, ideally in the winter and summer, to capture seasonal changes.",
      "While many doctors will check vitamin D in midlife, especially if someone has risk factors or related conditions, major health agencies only recommend screenings for people who have symptoms of deficiency or are at higher risk due to medical conditions or certain medications.",
      "CLICK HERE FOR MORE HEALTH STORIES",
      "Anyone seeking more information about these or other health screenings should contact a doctor for individual recommendations.",

    "story": [
      "Defense analyst Seth Jones says the People's Liberation Army suffers from corruption, poor coordination and no real war-fighting experience.",
      "China has spent decades building a land-based missile force designed to keep the United States out of a fight over Taiwan \u2014 and U.S. officials say it now threatens every major airfield, port and military installation across the Western Pacific.",
      "As Washington races to build its own long-range fires, analysts warn that the land domain has become the most overlooked \u2014 and potentially decisive \u2014 part of the U.S.\u2013China matchup. Interviews with military experts show a contest defined not by tanks or troop movements, but by missile ranges, base access and whether U.S. forces can survive the opening salvos of a war that may begin long before any aircraft take off.",
      "\"The People\u2019s Liberation Army Rocket Force \u2026 has built an increasing number of short-, medium-, and long-range missiles,\" Seth Jones of the Center for Strategic and International Studies told Fox News Digital. \"They have the capability to shoot those across the first and increasingly the second island chains.\"",
      "For years, Chinese officials assumed they could not match the United States in air superiority. The Rocket Force became the workaround: massed, land-based firepower meant to shut down U.S. bases and keep American aircraft and ships outside the fight.",
      "HIGH STAKES ON THE HIGH SEAS AS US, CHINA TEST LIMITS OF MILITARY POWER",
      "\"They didn\u2019t think that they could gain air superiority in a straight-up air-to-air fight,\" said Eric Heginbotham, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"So you need another way to get missiles out \u2014 and that another way is by building a lot of ground launchers.\"",
      "\"The People\u2019s Liberation Army Rocket Force\u2026 has built an increasing number of short-, medium-, and long-range missiles,\" Seth Jones of the Center for Strategic and International Studies told Fox News Digital.\u00a0 (CNS Photo via Reuters)",
      "The result is the world\u2019s largest inventory of theater-range missiles, backed by hardened underground facilities, mobile launchers and rapid shoot-and-scoot tactics designed to overwhelm U.S. defenses.",
      "Despite China\u2019s numerical edge, American forces still hold advantages Beijing has not yet matched \u2014 particularly in targeting and survivability.",
      "U.S. missiles, from Tomahawks to SM-6s to future hypersonic weapons, are tied into a global surveillance network the People's Liberation Army cannot yet replicate. American targeting relies on satellites, undersea sensors, stealth drones and joint command tools matured over decades of combat experience.",
      "\"The Chinese have not fought a war since the 1970s,\" Jones said. \"We see lots of challenges with their ability to conduct joint operations across different services.\"",
      "The U.S., by contrast, has built multi-domain task forces in the Pacific to integrate cyber, space, electronic warfare and precision fires \u2014 a level of coordination analysts say China has yet to demonstrate.",
      "Jones said China\u2019s defense industry also faces major hurdles.",
      "\"Most of (China\u2019s defense firms) are state-owned enterprises,\" he said. \"We see massive inefficiency, the quality of the systems \u2026 we see a lot of maintenance challenges.\"",
      "Still, the United States faces a near-term problem of its own: missile stockpiles.",
      "\"We still right now \u2026 would run out (of long-range munitions) after roughly a week or so of conflict over, say, Taiwan,\" Jones said.",
      "SKIES AT STAKE: INSIDE THE US-CHINA RACE FOR AIR DOMINANCE",
      "Washington is trying to close that gap by rapidly expanding production of ground-launched weapons. New Army systems \u2014 Typhon launchers, high mobility artillery rocket system, batteries, precision strike missiles and long-range hypersonic weapons with a range exceeding 2,500 kilometers \u2014 are designed to hold Chinese forces at risk from much farther away.",
      "Heginbotham said the shift is finally happening at scale.",
      "\"We\u2019re buying anti-ship missiles like there\u2019s no tomorrow,\" he said.",
      "If current plans hold, U.S. forces will field roughly 15,000 long-range anti-ship missiles by 2035, up from about 2,500 today.",
      "China\u2019s missile-heavy strategy is built to overwhelm U.S. bases early in a conflict. The United States, meanwhile, relies on layered air defenses: Patriot batteries to protect airfields and logistics hubs, terminal high altitude area defense (THAAD) interceptors to engage ballistic missiles at high altitude, and Aegis-equipped destroyers that can intercept missiles far from shore.",
      "Heginbotham warned the U.S. will need to widen that defensive mix.",
      "\"We really need a lot more and greater variety of missile defenses and preferably cheaper missile defenses,\" he said.",
      "A member of the People's Liberation Army stands as the maritime operations group displays YJ-19 hypersonic anti-ship missiles during a military parade to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War Two, in Beijing, China, Sept. 3, 2025.\u00a0 (Tingshu Wang/Reuters)",
      "One of Washington\u2019s biggest advantages is its ability to conduct long-range strikes from beneath the ocean. U.S. submarines can fire cruise missiles from virtually anywhere in the Western Pacific, without relying on allied basing and without exposing launchers to Chinese fire \u2014 a degree of stealth China does not yet possess.",
      "Command integration is another area where Beijing continues to struggle. American units routinely train in multi-domain operations that knit together air, sea, cyber, space and ground-based fires.",
      "Jones and Heginbotham both noted that the People's Liberation Army has far less experience coordinating forces across services and continues to grapple with doctrinal and organizational problems, including the dual commander\u2013political commissar structure inside its missile brigades.",
      "Alliances may be the most consequential difference. Japan, the Philippines, Australia and South Korea provide depth, intelligence sharing, logistics hubs and potential launch points for U.S. forces.",
      "China has no comparable network of partners, leaving it to operate from a much narrower geographic footprint. In a missile war, accuracy, integration and survivability often matter more than sheer volume \u2014 and in those areas the United States still holds meaningful advantages.",
      "At the heart of this competition is geography. Missiles matter less than the places they can be launched from, and China\u2019s ability to project power beyond its coastline remains sharply constrained.",
      "\"They\u2019ve got big power-projection problems right now,\" Jones said. \"They don\u2019t have a lot of basing as you get outside of the first island chain.\"",
      "The United States faces its own version of that challenge. Long-range Army and Marine Corps fires require host-nation permission, turning diplomacy into a form of firepower.",
      "\"It\u2019s absolutely central,\" Heginbotham said. \"You do need regional basing.\"",
      "Recent U.S. agreements with the Philippines, along with expanded cooperation with Japan and Australia, reflect a push to position American launchers close enough to matter without permanently stationing large ground forces there.",
      "A U.S.\u2013China land conflict would not involve armored columns maneuvering for territory. The decisive question is whether missile units on both sides can fire, relocate and fire again before being targeted.",
      "China has invested heavily in survivability, dispersing its brigades across underground bunkers, tunnels and hardened sites. Many can fire and relocate within minutes. Mobile launchers, decoys and deeply buried storage complexes make them difficult to neutralize.",
      "U.S. forces will field roughly 15,000 long-range anti-ship missiles by 2035, up from about 2,500 today. (Daniel Ceng/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "U.S. launchers in the Pacific would face intense Chinese surveillance and long-range missile attacks. After two decades focused on counterterrorism, the Pentagon is now reinvesting in deception, mobility and hardened infrastructure \u2014 capabilities critical to surviving the opening stages of a missile war.",
      "Any U.S. intervention in a Taiwan conflict would also force Washington to confront a politically charged question: whether to strike missile bases on the Chinese mainland. Doing so risks escalation; avoiding it carries operational costs.",
      "\"Yes \u2026 you can defend Taiwan without striking bases inside China,\" Heginbotham said. \"But you are giving away a significant advantage.\"",
      "Holding back may help prevent the conflict from widening, but it also allows China to keep firing.",
      "\"It\u2019s a reality of conflict in the nuclear age that almost any conflict is gonna be limited in some ways,\" Heginbotham said. \"Then the question becomes where those boundaries are drawn, can you prevent it from spreading? What trade-offs you\u2019re willing to accept?\"",
      "A U.S.\u2013China clash on land would not be fought by massed armies. It would be a missile war shaped by geography, alliances and survivability \u2014 a contest where political access and command integration matter as much as raw firepower.",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "For the United States, the challenge is clear: build enough long-range missiles, secure the basing needed to use them and keep launchers alive under fire. For China, the question is whether its vast missile arsenal and continental depth can offset weaknesses in coordination, command structure and real-world combat experience.",
      "The side that can shoot, relocate and sustain fire the longest will control the land domain \u2014 and may shape the outcome of a war in the Pacific.",

    "summary": "Minnesota fraud investigators faced racism accusations that effectively shielded billions in stolen funds from proper scrutiny in the massive Feeding Our Future scandal.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Digital spoke to State Sen. Mark Koran, former prosecutor Joe Teirab, and columnist Dustin Grage about how claims of \u2018racism\u2019 shielded fraud within the Somali community in Minneapolis.",
      "MINNEAPOLIS, MN - In the aftermath of the massive Feeding Our Future scandal and broader allegations of systemic fraud in Minnesota\u2019s social programs, a troubling theme has emerged: accusations of racism repeatedly used to deflect scrutiny, intimidate investigators and stall accountability.",
      "Rumors and reports of fraud in Minneapolis, primarily within the city\u2019s exploding Somali community, have been circulating for at least a decade, but criticism of the fraud has been largely dismissed by elected Democrats as \"racist\" or being underpinned by animosity toward foreigners. News stories focused on Somali fraudsters in recent years were shot down as \"racist.\"",
      "\"The whole story kind of died under these accusations that people were being racist,\" Bill Glahn,\u00a0policy fellow with Center of the American Experiment, told Fox News Digital.\u00a0\"Oh, maybe somebody stole a little bit here, a little bit there, but there's nothing systemic going on.\"",
      "Former assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Teirab, who helped take on federal prosecutions in the Feeding Our Future case, described to Fox News Digital how individuals implicated in fraud leaned on racial accusations as a shield. According to Teirab, suspects explicitly invoked race during a secretly recorded meeting with Attorney General Keith Ellison, asserting that investigators were targeting them \"only because of race.\"",
      "OMAR ACCUSED BY GOP OPPONENT OF OPENING UP THE DOOR TO MASSIVE MINNEAPOLIS FRAUD: 'DEEP, DEEP TIES'",
      "Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images; Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images; Peter Zay/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "Teirab called this tactic both deliberate and cynical. In one trial, a juror was even approached with a $120,000 cash bribe, allegedly accompanied by messaging intended to frame the investigation as racially motivated. The goal wasn\u2019t just to escape prosecution, it was to taint the system itself by threatening anyone pursuing the truth with the specter of racial bias.",
      "\"It provided cover,\" Teirab told Fox News Digital. \"Fraudsters knew the issue of race and racism was something they could use as a cudgel\u2026 It\u2019s disrespectful to use those terms when they\u2019re not appropriate, especially in a case where fraud clearly happened.\"",
      "Minnesota Republican State Sen. Mark Koran echoed Teirab\u2019s concerns, emphasizing that investigators followed the evidence, not demographics. Fraud prosecutions disproportionately affected one community simply because that\u2019s where significant fraud was uncovered, not because investigators targeted anyone based on race.",
      "\"The average Minnesotan, average legislator, doesn't care who's committing the fraud,\" Koran said. \"All right, the evidence will lead you either to or from the perpetrator. And so, if the evidence leads to the perpetrator, we need to prosecute all of them.\"",
      "Koran noted that public officials and agencies pursuing fraud were routinely branded racist for doing so. Some perpetrators were so \"emboldened,\" he said, that they sued the state to force the continuation of payments, even after red flags signaled massive irregularities.",
      "The scale, Koran argued, dwarfs what many Minnesotans understand. While federal authorities may ultimately prosecute around $2 billion in fraud, he suggested that the true annual losses across state programs could reach much higher when factoring in both blatant fraud and poor service delivery.",
      "Meanwhile, many families participated in related schemes by receiving kickbacks from fraudulent autism service providers, further complicating enforcement. Investigators simply lack the resources to chase every case, creating an environment where fraud becomes a low-risk, high-reward enterprise.",
      "MINNESOTA\u2019S FRAUD SCANDAL WAS \u2018SHOCKINGLY EASY\u2019 TO PULL OFF, IS LIKELY WORSE THAN REPORTED: EX PROSECUTOR",
      "Rep. Ilhan Omar speaks in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, during a news conference. (AP Photo/Morry Gash, File)",
      "\"For the average hardworking legal U.S. citizen doing everything right,\" Koran said, \"it\u2019s a disgusting disservice\u2026 knowing there\u2019s such blatant disregard for the value of that dollar.\"",
      "Koran suggested that the racism claims so emboldened supporters of the status quo that it contributed to Feeding Our Future suing the state of Minnesota, accusing state officials of racism for investigating the alleged fraud.",
      "Glahn told Fox News Digital that state agencies were \"cowering in fear\" over being called racist and local politicians were acutely aware that the \"racist label\" is a \"career kiss of death.\"",
      "A legislative auditor\u2019s report found Minnesota Department of Education officials felt they had to handle the nonprofit \"carefully\" because of these racism allegations and the risk of negative media coverage, and that this influenced which regulatory actions MDE did or did not take, CBS News reported.",
      "Political commentator and Townhall columnist Dustin Grage highlighted another factor enabling the fraud: media hesitation. Conservative reporters, he said, described to him hitting internal roadblocks when pitching stories about the Feeding Our Future scandal because editors feared being accused of racism.",
      "\"In newsrooms, they\u2019re told, \u2018We can\u2019t run that because we\u2019re going to be accused of being racist,\u2019\" Grage explained. That fear, combined with political pressure, allowed the scandal to grow largely unchecked until federal indictments forced it into the spotlight.",

      "Grage pointed to an early pivotal moment: Minnesota\u2019s Department of Education detected signs of fraud and briefly halted payments. Immediately, Minneapolis political figures Omar Fateh and Jamal Osman pushed back, claiming the stop was racially motivated. They even took the state to court, though their case was eventually thrown out.",
      "Yet the damage was done. Payments resumed, and crucially, Gov. Tim Walz declined to use his subpoena power to obtain Feeding Our Future's bank records, despite having the authority to do so. That inaction, Grage noted, further delayed the exposure of the fraud.",

      "The sun shines on the Minnesota state Capitol. (Steve Karnowski/Associated Press)",
      "Glahn told Fox News Digital that in addition to fear of the \"racist\" label, politicians in Minnesota understand that it is difficult to win elections without the support of the Somali community.",
      "\"The Somali community is very concentrated in Minnesota and very concentrated in Ilhan Omar's congressional district, and a few other pockets where the Somali vote swings elections, and at the state level, they're big enough that we've had some super close elections at the state level, and the Somali vote is very monolithic, votes Democrat,\" Glahn explained. \"They provided the difference in statewide elections, and then in local elections, where it's all Democrats, they're providing the difference in the primary. So if you're running in a primary against other Democrats, if you don't have the Somali vote on your side, you're not making it to the general election.\"",
      "The result of the fear to fully investigate the fraud was predictable: fraudsters exploited that hesitation, taxpayers lost billions and the vulnerable communities the programs were meant to serve suffered most.",
      "As the state continues to grapple with accountability and reform, one lesson stands out starkly. According to those who spoke to Fox News Digital, combating fraud requires courage, not only to follow the evidence wherever it leads, but to withstand the inevitable attempts to distort legitimate scrutiny into something it is not.",

Most of Venezuela\u2019s exports are now routed to Asia, with the bulk landing in China through intermediaries, according to data from Kpler.",

Beijing, now the primary destination for Venezuelan crude, has economic interests at stake but few practical avenues to challenge U.S. enforcement actions.",

Stories like that make you picture cybercriminals breaking into homes with high-tech gadgets and spying on families through smart cams. That reaction is natural. But most of these headlines leave out important context that can help you breathe a little easier.",
      "First, smart home hacking is rare. Most incidents stem from weak passwords or from someone you already know, rather than from a stranger with advanced tools. Today's smart home brands push out updates to block intrusion attempts, including patches for new AI-related vulnerabilities that often make headlines.",
      "Let's break down what actually puts a smart home at risk and what you can do to stay safe.",

      "Smart home hacking headlines can look scary, but most threats come from weak passwords rather than targeted attacks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why criminals are not circling your house with hacking gear",
      "Many people imagine cybercriminals driving around neighborhoods with scanners that look for vulnerable devices. In reality, Wi-Fi ranges and technical limits make that nearly impossible. Even high-profile hacks of casinos and large companies do not translate to criminals trying to breach residential smart locks for petty theft.",
      "Burglars still choose low-tech methods. They look for unlocked doors or easy entry points. They avoid complicated hacking tools because the payoff is too small to justify the work.",
      "So how do smart homes get hacked? Here are the real attack paths and how they work.",
      "Common ways smart homes get attacked",
      "Smart homes face a handful of digital threats, but most come from broad automated attacks rather than someone targeting your house.",
      "Bots constantly scan the internet for weak passwords and outdated logins. These brute force attacks throw billions of guesses at connected accounts. When one works, the device becomes part of a botnet used for future attacks. That doesn't mean someone is targeting your home on purpose. Bots search for anything they can breach. A strong password stops them.",
      "Some phishing emails impersonate smart home brands. Clicking a fake link or sharing login details can open the door for criminals to reach your network. Even a general phishing attack can expose your Wi-Fi info and lead to broader access.",
      "Hackers often go after company servers, not individual homes. These breaches may expose account details or stored camera footage kept in the cloud. Criminals may sell that data to others who might try to use it. It rarely leads to direct smart home hacking, but it still puts your accounts at risk.",
      "Early IoT devices had vulnerabilities that allowed criminals to intercept the data they sent and received. (IoT stands for Internet of Things and includes everyday connected gadgets like smart plugs, smart thermostats or Wi-Fi cameras.) Modern products now use stronger encryption, making these attacks extremely rare in the real world.",
      "Bluetooth issues still pop up from time to time, but most modern smart home devices use stronger security than older models. When a new flaw is discovered, companies usually release fast patches, which is why it's important to keep your apps and gadgets updated. Today, these Bluetooth risks rarely lead to real smart home problems.",

      "Who actually tries to hack smart homes",

      "Simple steps like stronger Wi-Fi security and regular updates go a long way toward protecting connected devices. (\u00a0Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Exes, former roommates or relatives often know login info. They may try to spy or cause trouble. Update all passwords if you suspect this.",
      "There have been cases where employees at security companies snooped through camera feeds. This isn't remote hacking. It's a misuse of internal access.",
      "They steal account lists and login details to sell. Others may buy those lists and try to log in using exposed credentials.",
      "Some send fake messages claiming they hacked your cameras and threaten you. Most of these scams rely on lies because they have no access at all.",
      "Some banned foreign manufacturers pose surveillance risks. The FCC maintains a list of companies that cannot sell security tech in the U.S. Always check that list before buying unfamiliar brands.",
      "Smart home devices that can raise concerns",
      "Some everyday gadgets create small but real entry points for trouble, especially when their settings or security features get overlooked.",
      "They often arrive with default passwords that owners forget to change. Older models may use outdated IoT protocols with weaker protections. Many do not get frequent security updates.",
      "Wi-Fi offers convenience but also adds risk. Weak routers and poor passwords can allow strangers to access a feed. Closed network monitors avoid Wi-Fi risks but still face basic signal interception attempts.",
      "During setup, some bulbs broadcast an open temporary network. If a criminal joins at the exact right moment, they could reach the rest of your devices. These cases are rare but possible in theory.",
      "Voice ordering can be exploited by curious kids or guests. Set a purchase PIN so no one can order items with simple voice commands.",

      "Managing diabetes already brings stress from medications and long-term health risks. Regular glucose checks only add to the weight. Most people test with finger pricks or wear a patch that needs a sensor under the skin. If you dislike needles, this part can feel like the hardest task of the day.",
      "Researchers at MIT are working on a new option. They developed a device that shines near-infrared light on your skin and reads your blood sugar without breaking the surface. It works through Raman spectroscopy, a method that looks at how light scatters when it hits molecules in your tissue.",

      "CANCER CURES COULD BE IN REACH WITH CUTTING-EDGE MEDICAL TECH, DOCTOR PREDICTS",
      "How the light-based scanner works",
      "The current setup is about the size of a shoebox. You rest your arm on top for a 30-second scan. A small beam shines through a glass window onto your skin. The light returns with tiny shifts in wavelength that reveal what molecules are present.",
      "Earlier Raman systems pulled in about 1,000 spectral bands with plenty of noise. The MIT team discovered that they only need three bands to calculate glucose levels. With fewer signals to process, the device becomes smaller, faster and more affordable. This boost also improves speed since the system no longer sorts through redundant data.",
      "In a four-hour study, a volunteer drank two glucose drinks while researchers took readings every five minutes. The new scanner matched the accuracy of two commercial glucometers the participant wore. That result surprised the team since the device is still in early development.",
      "Progress toward a wearable",
      "After perfecting the shoebox version, MIT engineers built a prototype the size of a cellphone. That unit is now in clinical testing with healthy and prediabetic volunteers. A larger trial with people who have diabetes is expected next year.",
      "The long-term goal is even more exciting. Researchers believe they can shrink the hardware to a watch size. They also want to confirm that the system reads accurately across many skin tones. If these steps succeed, a wrist-based glucose monitor could be possible.",
      "A quick 30-second scan can match the accuracy of today\u2019s commercial glucose monitors. (iStock)",
      "How this compares to other needle-free attempts",
      "This light-based method joins other ideas that try to move past needles. A recent chest strap used ECG signals to predict glucose levels. It looked promising, but it still needs time before it reaches consumers. Interest in noninvasive monitoring keeps growing since so many people want relief from the pain of repeated skin punctures or adhesive patches.",
      "HUMANOID ROBOT PERFORMS MEDICAL PROCEDURES VIA REMOTE CONTROL",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you or someone you love manages diabetes, fewer needle sticks could change your routine. A quick scan may replace the stress of drawing blood or inserting a sensor. The accuracy seen in early testing shows that noninvasive tools are not a distant dream. They could help you catch swings in your levels faster and bring more comfort to a daily task that often feels overwhelming.",

      "Cybercriminals keep getting better at blending into the software you use every day.",
      "Over the past few years, we've seen phishing pages that copy banking portals, fake browser alerts that claim your device is infected and \"human verification\" screens that push you to run commands you should never touch. The latest twist comes from the ongoing ClickFix campaign.",
      "Instead of asking you to prove you are human, attackers now disguise themselves as a Windows update. It looks convincing enough that you might follow the instructions without thinking, which is exactly what they want.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "NEW SCAM SENDS FAKE MICROSOFT 365 LOGIN PAGES",
      "The malware hides inside seemingly normal image files, using steganography to slip past traditional security tools.\u00a0 (Microsoft)",
      "How the fake update works",
      "Researchers noticed that ClickFix has upgraded its old trick. The campaign used to rely on human verification pages, but now you get a full-screen Windows update screen that looks almost identical to the real thing. Joe Security showed how the page displays fake progress bars, familiar update messages and a prompt that tells you to complete a critical security update.",
      "If you are on Windows, the site tells you to open the Run box, copy something from your clipboard and paste it in. That \"something\" is a command that silently downloads a malware dropper. The final payload is usually an infostealer, which steals passwords, cookies and other data from your machine.",
      "NEW EMAIL SCAM USES HIDDEN CHARACTERS TO SLIP PAST FILTERS",
      "Fake update screens are getting harder to spot as attackers mimic Windows with near-perfect precision. (Joe Security)",
      "The moment you paste the command, the infection chain begins. First, a file called mshta.exe reaches out to a remote server and grabs a script. To avoid detection, these URLs often use hex encoding for parts of the address and rotate their paths. The script then runs obfuscated PowerShell code filled with junk instructions to throw researchers off. Once PowerShell does its work, it decrypts a hidden .NET assembly that functions as the loader.",
      "Why is this attack so hard to detect?",
      "The loader hides its next stage inside what looks like a regular PNG file. ClickFix uses custom steganography, which is a technique that hides secret data inside normal-looking content. In this case, the malware sits inside the image's pixel data. The attackers tweak color values in certain pixels, especially in the red channel, to embed pieces of shellcode. When you view the image, everything appears normal.",
      "The script knows exactly where the hidden data sits. It extracts the pixel values, decrypts them and rebuilds the malware directly in memory. That means nothing obvious is written to disk. Security tools that rely on file scanning miss it, since the shellcode never appears as a standalone file.",
      "Once rebuilt, the shellcode is injected into a trusted Windows process like explorer.exe. The attack uses familiar in-memory techniques such as VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory and CreateRemoteThread. Recent ClickFix activity has delivered infostealers like LummaC2 and updated versions of Rhadamanthys. These tools are built to harvest credentials and send them back to the attacker with very little noise.",
      "Once the hidden code loads into a trusted Windows process, infostealers quietly begin harvesting your data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps you can take to protect yourself from the ClickFix campaign",
      "The best way to stay protected is to slow down for a moment and follow a few steps that cut off these attacks before they start.",
      "If any site tells you to paste a command into Run, PowerShell or Terminal, treat it as an immediate warning sign. Real operating system updates never require you to run commands from a webpage. When you run that command, you hand full control to the attacker. If something feels off, close the page and don't interact further.",
      "Updates should only come from the Windows Settings app or through official system notifications. A browser tab or pop-up pretending to be a Windows update is always fake. If you see anything outside the normal update flow asking for your action, ignore it and check the real Windows Update page yourself.",
      "Choose a security suite that can detect both file-based and in-memory threats. Stealthy attacks like ClickFix avoid leaving obvious files for scanners to pick up. Tools with behavioral detection, sandboxing and script monitoring give you a much better chance of spotting unusual activity early.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Password managers create strong, unique passwords for every account you use. They also autofill only on legitimate websites, which helps you catch fake login pages. If a manager refuses to fill out your credentials, take a second look at the URL before entering anything manually.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches.

      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Many attacks start by targeting emails and personal details already exposed online. Data removal services help shrink your digital footprint by requesting takedowns from data broker sites that collect and sell your information. They can't erase everything, but reducing your exposure means fewer attackers have easy access to your details.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy.

      "A convincing layout doesn't mean it is legitimate. Always look at the domain name first. If it doesn't match the official site or uses odd spelling or extra characters, close it. Attackers rely on the fact that people recognize a page's design but ignore the address bar.",
      "Fake update pages often run in full-screen mode to hide the browser interface and make the page look like part of your computer. If a site suddenly goes full screen without your permission, exit with Esc or Alt+Tab. Once you're out, scan your system and don't return to that page.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "ClickFix works because it leans on user interaction. Nothing happens unless you follow the instructions on the screen. That makes the fake Windows update page especially dangerous, because it taps into something most people trust. If you are used to Windows updates freezing your screen, you may not question a prompt that appears during the process. Cybercriminals know this. They copy trusted interfaces to lower your guard and then rely on you to run the final command. The technical tricks that follow are complex, but the starting point is simple. They need you to help them.",

    "published": "Fri, 12 Dec 2025 12:00:38 -0500",
    "summary": "ChatGPT data breach exposes personal info of users through partner Mixpanel. OpenAI confirms names, emails compromised in security incident.",
    "story": [
      "'Outnumbered' panelists react to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's admission that he 'cannot imagine' raising his newborn son without help from ChatGPT.",
      "ChatGPT went from novelty to necessity in less than two years. It is now part of how you work, learn, write, code and search. OpenAI has said the service has roughly 800 million weekly active users, which puts it in the same weight class as the biggest consumer platforms in the world.",
      "When a tool becomes that central to your daily life, you assume the people running it can keep your data safe. That trust took a hit recently after OpenAI confirmed that personal information linked to API accounts had been exposed in a breach involving one of its third-party partners.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "The breach highlights how even trusted analytics partners can expose sensitive account details. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about the ChatGPT breach",
      "OpenAI's notification email places the breach squarely on Mixpanel, a major analytics provider the company used on its API platform. The email stresses that OpenAI's own systems were not breached. No chat histories, billing information, passwords or API keys were exposed. Instead, the stolen data came from Mixpanel's environment and included names, email addresses, Organization IDs, coarse location and technical metadata from user browsers.",
      "FAKE CHATGPT APPS ARE HIJACKING YOUR PHONE WITHOUT YOU KNOWING",
      "That sounds harmless on the surface. The email calls this \"limited\" analytics data, but the label feels like PR cushioning more than anything else. For attackers, this kind of metadata is gold. A dataset that reveals who you are, where you work, what machine you use and how your account is structured gives threat actors everything they need to run targeted phishing and impersonation campaigns.",
      "The biggest red flag is the exposure of Organization IDs. Anyone who builds on the OpenAI API knows how sensitive these identifiers are. They sit at the center of internal billing, usage limits, account hierarchy and support workflows. If an attacker quotes your Org ID during a fake billing alert or support request, it suddenly becomes very hard to dismiss the message as a scam.",
      "OpenAI's own reconstructed timeline raises bigger questions. Mixpanel first detected a smishing attack on November 8. Attackers accessed internal systems the next day and exported OpenAI's data. That data was gone for more than two weeks before Mixpanel told OpenAI on November 25. Only then did OpenAI alert everyone. It is a long and worrying silent period, and it left API users exposed to targeted attacks without even knowing they were at risk. OpenAI says it cut Mixpanel off the next day.",
      "The size of the risk and the policy problem behind it",
      "The timing and the scale matter here. ChatGPT sits at the center of the generative AI boom. It does not just have consumer traffic. It has sensitive conversations from developers, employees, startups and enterprises. Even though the breach affected API accounts rather than consumer chat history, the exposure still highlights a wider issue. When a platform reaches almost a billion weekly users, any crack becomes a national-scale problem.",
      "Regulators have been warning about this exact scenario. Vendor security is one of the weak links in modern tech policy. Data protection laws tend to focus on what a company does with the information you give them. They rarely provide strong guardrails around the entire chain of third-party services that process this data along the way. Mixpanel is not an obscure operator. It is a widely used analytics platform trusted by thousands of companies. Yet it still lost a dataset that should never have been accessible to an attacker.",
      "Companies should treat analytics providers the same way they treat core infrastructure. If you cannot guarantee that your vendors follow the same security standards you do, you should not be collecting the data in the first place. For a platform as influential as ChatGPT, the responsibility is even higher. People do not fully understand how many invisible services sit behind a single AI query. They trust the brand they interact with, not the long list of partners behind it.",
      "Attackers can use leaked metadata to craft convincing phishing emails that look legitimate. (Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "8 steps you can take to stay safer when using AI tools",
      "If you rely on AI tools every day, it's worth tightening your personal security before your data ends up floating around in someone else's analytics dashboard. You cannot control how every vendor handles your information, but you can make it much harder for attackers to target you.",
      "Treat every AI account as if it holds something valuable because it does. Long, unique passwords stored in a reliable password manager reduce the fallout if one platform gets breached. This also protects you from credential stuffing, where attackers try the same password across multiple services.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "AI platforms have become prime targets, so they rely on stronger 2FA. Use an authenticator app or a hardware security key. SMS codes can be intercepted or redirected, which makes them unreliable during large-scale phishing campaigns.",
      "Another important step you can take to protect yourself from phishing attacks is to install strong antivirus software on your devices. This can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, helping you keep your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "PARENTS BLAME CHATGPT FOR SON\u2019S SUICIDE, LAWSUIT ALLEGES OPENAI WEAKENED SAFEGUARDS TWICE BEFORE TEEN\u2019S DEATH",
      "Think twice before pasting private conversations, company documents, medical notes or addresses into a chat window. Many AI tools store recent history for model improvements unless you opt out, and some route data through external vendors. Anything you paste could live on longer than you expect.",
      "Attackers often combine leaked metadata with information they pull from people-search sites and old listings. A good data-removal service scans the web for exposed personal details and submits removal requests on your behalf. Some services even let you send custom links for takedowns. Cleaning up these traces makes targeted phishing and impersonation attacks much harder to pull off.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Attackers know users panic when they hear about API limits, billing failures or account verification issues. If you get an email claiming to be from an AI provider, do not click the link. Open the site manually or use the official app to confirm whether the alert is real.",
      "Events like this show why strengthening your personal security habits matters more than ever. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "A lot of attacks succeed because devices run outdated operating systems or browsers. Regular updates close vulnerabilities that could be used to steal session tokens, capture keystrokes or hijack login flows. Updates are boring, but they prevent a surprising amount of trouble.",
      "Old accounts sit around with old passwords and old data, and they become easy targets. If you're not actively using a particular AI tool anymore, delete it from your account list and remove any saved information. It reduces your exposure and limits how many databases contain your details.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "This breach may not have touched chat logs or payment details, but it shows how fragile the wider AI ecosystem can be. Your data is only as safe as the least secure partner in the chain. With ChatGPT now approaching a billion weekly users, that chain needs tighter rules, better oversight and fewer blind spots. If anything, this should be a reminder that the rush toward AI adoption needs stronger policy guardrails. Companies cannot hide behind transparent emails after the fact. They need to prove that the tools you rely on every day are secure at every layer, including the ones you never see.",

      "A long-running malware campaign quietly evolved over several years and turned trusted Chrome and Edge extensions into spyware. A detailed report from Koi Security reveals that the ShadyPanda operation affected 4.3 million users who downloaded extensions later updated with hidden malicious code.",
      "These extensions began as simple wallpaper or productivity tools that looked harmless. Years later, silent updates added surveillance functions that most users could not detect.",

      "THIS CHROME VPN EXTENSION SECRETLY SPIES ON YOU",
      "Malicious extensions spread through trusted browsers and quietly collected user data for years. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the ShadyPanda campaign unfolded",
      "The operation included 20 malicious Chrome extensions and 125 on the Microsoft Edge Add-ons store. Many first appeared in 2018 with no obvious warning signs. Five years later, the extensions began receiving staged updates that changed their behavior.",
      "Koi Security found that these updates rolled out through each browser's trusted auto-update system. Users did not need to click anything. No phishing. No fake alerts. Just quiet version bumps that slowly turned safe extensions into powerful tracking tools.",
      "NEW EMAIL SCAM USES HIDDEN CHARACTERS TO SLIP PAST FILTERS",
      "WeTab functions as a sophisticated surveillance platform disguised as a productivity tool. (Koi)",
      "What the extensions were doing behind the scenes",
      "Once activated, the extensions injected tracking code into real links to earn revenue from user purchases. They also hijacked searches, redirected queries and logged data for sale and manipulation. ShadyPanda gathered an unusually broad range of personal information, including browsing history, search terms, cookies, keystrokes, fingerprint data, local storage, and even mouse movement coordinates. As the extensions gained credibility in the stores, the attackers pushed a backdoor update that allowed hourly remote code execution. That gave them full browser control, letting them monitor websites visited and exfiltrate persistent identifiers.",
      "Researchers also discovered that the extensions could launch adversary-in-the-middle attacks. This allowed credential theft, session hijacking and code injection on any website. If users opened developer tools, the extensions switched into harmless mode to avoid detection. Google removed the malicious extensions from the Chrome Web Store. We reached out to the company, and a spokesperson confirmed that none of the extensions listed are currently live on the platform.",
      "Meanwhile, a Microsoft spokesperson told CyberGuy, \"We have removed all the extensions identified as malicious on the Edge Add-on store. When we become aware of instances that violate our policies, we take appropriate action that includes, but is not limited to, the removal of prohibited content or termination of our publishing agreement.\"",

      "A breakthrough that turns one donor cornea into hundreds",
      "The cornea came from a healthy deceased donor and was then multiplied in the lab. Researchers used the cultured cells to print about 300 transparent implants with Precise Bio's regenerative platform.",
      "Their system builds a layered structure that looks and behaves like a natural cornea. It is designed to provide clarity, strength and long-term function.",
      "HOW A TINY RETINAL IMPLANT IS HELPING PEOPLE REGAIN THEIR SIGHT",
      "Since donor shortages prevent millions from receiving sight-saving care each year, this approach could transform access. Many patients in developed countries wait only a few days for a transplant, while others wait years due to low tissue availability. A single donor cornea that can create hundreds of implants changes that equation.",
      "The surgery used a fully 3D printed corneal implant grown from cultured human cells and restored sight to a legally blind patient. (Rambam Eye Institute)",
      "The surgery that proved it works",
      "Professor Michael Mimouni, director of the Cornea Unit in the Department of Ophthalmology at Rambam Eye Institute, led the surgical team. He described the moment as unforgettable because the lab-grown implant restored sight to a real patient for the first time.",
      "He says, \"What this platform shows and proves is that in the lab, you can expand human cells. Then print them on any layer you need, and that tissue will be sustainable and work. We can hopefully reduce waiting times for all kinds of patients waiting for all kinds of transplants.\"",
      "The procedure is part of an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial that assesses safety and tolerability in people with corneal endothelial disease. This achievement reflects years of work across research labs, operating rooms and industry. It also shows how coordinated teams can push new treatments from concept to clinical reality.",
      "How the science fits into a bigger future",
      "The breakthrough will have a permanent home in Rambam's upcoming Helmsley Health Discovery Tower. The new Eye Institute will consolidate care, training and research under one roof. It aims to speed the move from emerging science to real-world treatment for patients across Northern Israel and beyond.",
      "Precise Bio says its 3D printing system could eventually support other tissues like cardiac muscle, liver and kidney cells. That future will require long trials and extensive validation, but the path now looks more achievable.",
      "POPULAR WEIGHT-LOSS DRUGS LINKED TO SUDDEN VISION LOSS, RESEARCH SUGGESTS",
      "Professor Michael Mimouni led the surgical team at Rambam Eye Institute's Cornea Unit. (Rambam Eye Institute)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If corneal disease affects someone in your family, this work brings new hope. Donor tissue may continue to play a role in many regions, but lab-grown implants offer a way to expand access where shortages hold patients back. The success of this first transplant also suggests a future where regenerative medicine supports many types of tissue repair.",
      "This milestone also shows how long scientific breakthroughs take to reach real patients. The first 3D printed cornea design appeared in 2018 and only now reached human use. Even so, the progress feels fast when the result is restored sight.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",
      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here: Cyberguy.com.",
      "EYE DROPS MAY REPLACE READING GLASSES FOR THOSE STRUGGLING WITH AGE-RELATED VISION LOSS",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This successful transplant marks a turning point for eye care. It suggests a world where the limits of donor supply do not decide who receives sight-saving surgery. As more trial results arrive, we will see how far this technology can scale and which patients stand to benefit first.",
      "If regenerative implants become common, what medical challenge should researchers focus on next? Let us know by writing to us at Cyberguy.com",

      "FBI WARNS EMAIL USERS AS HOLIDAY SCAMS SURGE",
      "Scam emails posing as MetaMask alerts are tricking users into revealing their crypto wallet details. (Photographer: Wei Leng Tay/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "What is MetaMask and why scammers love it",
      "MetaMask is a popular crypto wallet and browser extension that lets you store tokens and connect to blockchain apps on networks such as Ethereum. Because MetaMask is widely known and trusted, criminals impersonate it in phishing campaigns that ask users to \"verify\" wallets and then harvest recovery phrases or keys.",
      "What makes this email a wallet verification scam",
      "The scam email copies MetaMask visuals and even routes through a Zendesk address to look more professional, yet the \"Verify Wallet Ownership\" button points to an unrelated domain that has nothing to do with MetaMask. That mismatch between branding and destination is a major red flag in crypto phishing attacks. It also relies on classic pressure tactics and vague corporate language. The body reads:",
      "Dear Valued User,As part of our ongoing commitment to account security, we require verification to confirm ownership of your wallet.This essential security measure helps protect your assets and maintain the integrity of our platform.Action Required By: December 03, 2025Your prompt attention to this verification will help ensure uninterrupted access to your account and maintain the highest level of security protection.",
      "Phrases like\u00a0\"Dear Valued User,\"\u00a0\"essential security measure\" and \"Action Required By\" are common in phishing emails that pretend to be MetaMask and threaten restrictions if you do not comply. Genuine MetaMask support will direct you to metamask.io or official apps and will never ask you to reveal your secret recovery phrase through a link in an unsolicited email.",
      "In this case, the message even claims to come from \"\u041c\u0435t\u0430\u041c\u0430sk.io (Support@\u041c\u0435t\u0430\u041c\u0430sk.io)\" <support@z3nbetting.zendesk.com>. That display name looks like MetaMask Support, but the real sending address is an unrelated Zendesk subdomain, which is a classic red flag. MetaMask explains that legitimate support messages only come from specific official addresses, so anything else should be treated as a scam and ignored.",
      "Why mention Zendesk can be misleading",
      "Zendesk is a legitimate customer support platform that many companies use to manage tickets and notifications. Scammers sometimes route fake alerts through such services or spoof similar addresses, so messages look like real support tickets, which can fool users who associate Zendesk branding with trust.",
      "In this case, the presence of a Zendesk-style address does not make the message safe because the link still leads away from MetaMask's official website and asks you to react to manufactured urgency.",

      "Phishing messages urging MetaMask \"wallet verification\" direct victims to fake websites that steal recovery phrases. (Photo by Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Steps to stay safe from wallet verification scam emails",
      "Taking the right precautions can protect your digital wallet and personal data from scammers.",
      "Avoid clicking buttons or links in unexpected wallet verification emails, even if they show the MetaMask logo. Instead, open your browser and type metamask.io yourself or use the official mobile app to check for any real alerts. Also, install strong antivirus software to detect malicious links, fake sites or malware that tries to capture your keystrokes.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Always confirm that the address bar shows MetaMask's official domain or your wallet provider's genuine site before you sign in. If an email link sends you to a domain that looks odd, close it immediately.",
      "Never enter your secret recovery phrase, password or private keys on a site you reached by email. MetaMask support will not ask for that information, and anyone who gets it can empty your wallet.",
      "Turn on\u00a0two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) wherever your exchange or related accounts support it, since codes from an app or key add a barrier even if a password leaks. Store backup codes safely offline, so criminals cannot reach them.",
      "REAL APPLE SUPPORT EMAILS USED IN NEW PHISHING SCAM",
      "Criminals are spoofing Zendesk-style addresses to make fraudulent MetaMask support emails appear legitimate. (Photo by Felix Zahn/Photothek via Getty Images)",
      "Data removal services can help reduce exposed personal details from data broker sites that attackers use to target victims by name and email. Less exposed information makes it harder for phishers to craft convincing wallet alerts tailored to you.",

      "Why it matters:\u00a0Auto-join saves data and speeds things up, but it also removes your control.

      "3) Push notifications",
      "These are the pop-up alerts or banners you get from apps, even when those apps are closed. Some notifications are helpful (messages, alerts, reminders). Others just bombard you with ads or updates you don't need.",
      "Why it matters:\u00a0Push notifications can keep you informed, but they also distract you, drain your battery, expose personal details on your lock screen and give apps a way to pull you back in with constant ads or engagement tactics. Managing them reduces noise and limits how much access apps have to your attention and data.",

      "These are small software updates designed specifically to fix vulnerabilities that scammers or hackers could exploit. They don't add new features; they close holes. Skipping security updates leaves your device exposed. They run quickly, often in the background and keep your phone protected from the latest threats.",
      "Why it matters:\u00a0Security updates patch weaknesses before attackers can use them, and delaying them gives hackers more time to target your device. Installing them promptly helps block malware, stop data theft and keep your phone safe from new exploits that emerge every month.",

      "Why it matters:\u00a0 Background App Refresh can quietly drain your battery, use mobile data and let apps run more often than they need to. Limiting it gives you more control over what apps do behind the scenes and reduces unnecessary tracking, resource use and surprise data charges.",

      "\"I was recently notified by two different banking institutions that someone completed an online application to open a deposit account in my name. Both banks denied the applications and sent me notifications. One bank sent an email and the other sent a letter. Neither bank will share any information with me about what information was submitted or why the applications were denied. I understand why fraudsters try to open credit accounts, but why would they try to open deposit accounts? One bank told me they could not share any information with me about the failed application due to privacy policy and the other bank said they do not save any information from declined applications from non-customers.",
      "Why would banking institutions not capture or share information about declined online applications?

Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number, and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

    "summary": "New study of 10,500+ kids reveals early smartphone ownership linked to depression, obesity, and poor sleep by age 12. Earlier phones mean higher risks.",
    "story": [
      "Jonathan Haidt joined Brian Kilmeade to discuss his new book \"The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness.\"",
      "Parents everywhere wrestle with one big question. What is the right age to let a child have a smartphone?",
      "Tweens ask for one long before many adults feel ready. At the same time, researchers keep sounding alarms about how early access may shape health and behavior. Now, a large new study gives parents even more to think about.",
      "Published in Pediatrics, the research tracked more than 10,500 children in the national Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. It found strong links between early smartphone ownership and higher odds of depression, obesity and insufficient sleep by age 12. The earlier kids got a phone, the greater their risk.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "What the study reveals about early smartphone ownership",
      "The study compared 12-year-olds who owned smartphones with those who did not. Kids with phones were more likely to show signs of depression, carry extra weight and sleep less than their peers without devices. Researchers noted that these patterns held even after accounting for income, neighborhood, parental monitoring and other factors.",
      "TEENS TURNING TO AI FOR LOVE AND COMFORT",
      "Parents can lower these risks by delaying devices, setting limits and keeping phones out of bedrooms at night. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "They also looked at children who still did not own a phone at age 12. One year later, those who had finally received one showed more mental health concerns and worse sleep than those who still did not have a device. These shifts happened quickly, which raised concerns about how powerful the change can be.",
      "Lead author Dr. Ran Barzilay explained that parents should treat the decision like a real health milestone. A device changes how kids sleep, move and socialize. That combination may create more strain for a 12-year-old than for a 16-year-old who has more maturity and self-regulation.",
      "Why age matters more than many parents expect",
      "The research shows an association, not a direct cause. Yet the patterns match earlier findings. Kids with smartphones often stay up later, scroll more and move less. That mix can disrupt physical health and emotional well-being. Adolescence is a sensitive stage when small shifts in sleep or mood can have long-lasting effects.",
      "Experts also pointed out how nearly every teen now has smartphone access. That makes the decision even harder for families who want to delay. Still, researchers say the data is strong enough to guide parents toward waiting when possible. Parents do not need perfect evidence to choose a slower timeline.",
      "Pediatric mental health experts warn that a smartphone is not a simple tool. It opens the entire internet with no natural limits. Families need clear rules and protections and those steps require real work from adults. Many parents feel pressure to hand over a device early, yet the expert urged families to trust their instincts when deciding the timing.",
      "The sleep connection families cannot ignore",
      "Most experts agree that phones disrupt sleep. A large share of preteens keep devices in their bedrooms, which leads to late-night scrolling and overnight notifications. Even the glow of the screen can make it harder to fall asleep.",
      "Researchers who study adolescent sleep and screen habits have found that many 11- to 12-year-olds keep devices within reach at night, and a notable share report being awakened by notifications. Experts in this field urge parents to move phones out of bedrooms overnight because better sleep can reduce some of the risks tied to early smartphone access.",
      "EVEN THE FUTURE KING DISCOVERS SMARTPHONES ARE A ROYAL PAIN FOR KIDS AND PARENTS",
      "Researchers found that kids who got phones sooner showed more mental health strain within a year. (Matt Cardy/Getty Images)",
      "The challenge is consistency. Many parents struggle to set rules when screens support school work, friendships and safety. Yet researchers stress that even one boundary, like no phones in bedrooms, can protect sleep and reduce stress.",
      "How parents can use this information right now",
      "No one wants to shame parents who already gave their kids a phone. Many families made the decision for safety or communication needs. The study does not claim that every early smartphone user will face health issues. It simply highlights patterns worth considering before making the call. Parents can use these insights to create a healthier plan.",
      "Readiness is more than age. Look for consistent responsibility with chores, schoolwork and device-free rules on other screens.",
      "Kids follow rules when they understand why they exist. Set limits that work for your household and adjust them as schedules and needs change.",
      "Nighttime use and notifications interrupt sleep. A \"charging station\" in the kitchen or living room solves this fast.",

      "Luigi Mangione's backpack and the circumstances surrounding his Pennsylvania arrest were the focus of this week's hearings in New York as his defense lawyers are trying to get some evidence tossed entirely.",
      "Mangione's attorneys attempted to pick apart Pennsylvania police's handling of their initial arrest of Mangione, challenging their warrantless search of the murder suspect's backpack and a delay in being read his Miranda rights. The set of pre-trial hearings is aimed at determining whether evidence will be excluded from his upcoming trial for the alleged killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told Fox News Digital he believes prosecutors will be able to argue successfully that the backpack search as well as officers' reading of Miranda rights were done within the law.",
      "\"I agree with prosecutors in this case that it was a legal search. And this is why there are some exceptions to the search warrant requirement. And the two that really would apply in this case are a search incident to an arrest or an inventory search. Both of those require an arrest. So as long as there was probable cause for an arrest, law enforcement can search anything within Mangione's wingspan,\" Rahmani said.",

      "First-year Brown University student Benjamin DiBella was in the Sciences Library at the Providence, Rhode Island, school Saturday afternoon when someone yelled that there was an active shooter on campus.",
      "There was \u2014 but in a nearby building, Barus & Holley, where a gunman opened fire on people in a classroom, authorities said, killing two and wounding nine others. The manhunt for the shooter was ongoing early Sunday.",
      "DiBella said he went to the messaging board Sidechat \u201cand saw dozens of messages, all only minutes old, noting panic and gunshots.\u201d",
      "Follow live updates.",
      "What followed was a lockdown on the ninth floor, where doors were barricaded and people scrolled news feeds for information over the next 2 1/2 hours, he said.",
      "\u201cWe were aware that police forces were gradually clearing the floors of the Sciences Library, and at times we heard them on floors above and beneath us,\u201d DiBella said.",
      "The Ivy League school warned everyone on campus to shelter in place after reports of the active shooter came in at around 4:05 p.m., instructing them to lock doors and silence phones. They were to run and, if absolutely necessary, fight.",
      "The order was still in effect at midnight for the campus and surrounding neighborhoods. A perimeter had also been established, with people still waiting in administrative buildings for a law enforcement escort to leave.",
      "Graduate student Jack DiPrimio said he was doing busywork in the lobby of an academic building about two to three blocks from where the shooting occurred.",
      "At first, he didn\u2019t think too much of the message alerts about an active shooter. \u201cI had been through so many lockdowns in school and in undergrad that I wasn\u2019t that worried,\u201d DiPrimio said.",
      "But he went outside and saw people running from Barus & Holley, and then he started getting texts about possible numbers of people injured.",
      "DiPrimio said he ran into his apartment building nearby but didn\u2019t have his keys. He recalled running out to the street again and into a nearby dorm, where a student in the building held the door open for him to run inside.",
      "Once inside, DiPrimio said he hid alone in a bathroom in the basement for four to five hours. He turned off the lights and tried to make as little noise as possible. He passed the time by scrolling on social media. About three hours in, his phone died, so he went to the Department of Public Safety across the street to charge it. After that, DiPrimio said, they let him go back into his apartment.",
      "As of 1 a.m., DiPrimio said, students and others were still in lockdown across campus waiting for law enforcement to clear their buildings. He said he keeps calling friends because he doesn\u2019t want to be alone with his thoughts.",
      "\u201cA lot of us had just finished finals and there\u2019s this crushing wave of grief and sadness,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a horrible way to end the semester.\u201d",
      "In his dorm room Saturday night, sophomore Satvik Paduri considered himself one of the lucky ones. He arrived home about an hour before the shooting and subsequent lockdown.",
      "\u201cI definitely don\u2019t feel comfortable going out of my dorm room, just because they haven\u2019t found the shooter,\u201d Paduri, 19, of Texas, said. \u201cObviously, he could be anywhere.\u201d",
      "All of Paduri\u2019s friends are safe \u2014 but there were fears when one of them, who was in the engineering building, was marked online as still being there after the shooting.",
      "\u201cIt turns out he was able to get out, but just left his phone behind in the panic,\u201d Paduri said. \u201cIt\u2019s just horrifying that something like this has occurred so close to home,\u201d he said.",
      "Atman Shah, also a sophomore, and his friend Amber were staying with friends, six in all in a dorm where four normally live. He and Amber were having a meeting at a cafe about a block away when everyone started quickly leaving.",
      "\u201cYou saw police cars with lights and sirens going like 60 mph down a residential road, and that\u2019s when we knew, \u2018OK, something serious is happening,\u2019\u201d said Shah, 19, of California.",
      "He said it seemed likely they would all spend the night in the room.",
      "The shock of the shooting and the panic of trying to reach friends who had left their phones behind had begun to ease by Saturday night, he said.",
      "\u201cAs time goes on, it just becomes a deep sadness,\u201d Shah said.",
      "Paduri and Shah both said they are fortunate neither they nor any of their friends were hurt, and their thoughts are with the victims.",
      "Both said they have some tangential experience of shootings in public places, describing gunfire at malls where their friends either worked or were shopping.",
      "\u201cBut this hits a lot closer to home,\u201d Paduri said. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking.\u201d"

      "A gunman killed two people and injured nine others after opening fire at Brown University\u2019s engineering and physics building in Providence, Rhode Island, on Saturday, officials said.",
      "The unidentified gunman left after the shooting at the Barus & Holley building, on the eastern edge of the campus, Cmdr. Timothy O\u2019Hara, deputy chief of Providence police, said Saturday night.",
      "An individual has been detained in connection with the shooting and a shelter-in-place order for the school and nearby community has been lifted, Providence Mayor Brett Smiley announced early Sunday morning.",
      "Follow live updates.",
      "A spokesperson for Brown University Health, which operates Rhode Island Hospital, where the injured were being treated, said seven people remained in critical condition and one had been stabilized. An 11th victim was identified hours after the shooting and had non-life-threatening injuries from fragments, officials said.",
      "'Person of interest' in custody",
      "The attack was reported just after 4 p.m. at Brown\u2019s Barus & Holley building, a seven-story structure home to much of the university\u2019s engineering and physics study and research, officials said.",
      "It happened inside a first-floor classroom, officials said. The outer doors of the building were open at the time because exams were taking place, Smiley said.",
      "\u201cIt is unknown how he entered the building, but we do know that he exited the Hope Street side of that complex,\u201d O\u2019Hara said.",
      "A person of interest has been detained in connection with the shooting, city officials said Sunday morning. The individual is in his 20s, but police did not release any additional details.",
      "O\u2019Hara previously described the gunman only as \u201ca male dressed in black.\u201d",
      "Providence police released security video that shows the person believed to be the shooter.",
      "The video, only a few seconds long, shows what appears to be a man in dark, loose pants, a dark jacket and possibly also in a knit cap walking down Hope Street and rounding a corner lined by a retaining wall. It does not clearly show the man\u2019s face, nor does it show what happened beforehand.",
      "A shelter-in-place order",
      "An alert on Brown\u2019s emergency information website instructed people to lock doors, silence phones and stay safe while the manhunt was underway.",
      "A shelter-in-place advisory for the campus was in effect Saturday night, including for any of the 11,000 enrolled students who remained at the Ivy League university, and for the Providence neighborhoods surrounding the school, Smiley said.",
      "On Saturday afternoon, officials walked back an earlier alert stating someone was taken into custody, leaving people in the city of roughly 190,000 in fear and uncertainty.",
      "Students hid under desks",
      "Brown is in the middle of final exams, which began Friday, continued Saturday and were scheduled to be held through next weekend, according to the university\u2019s academic calendar.",

      "\u201cWe decided to turn the lights off and close all the doors and hide under our desks,\u201d Chien told NBC affiliate WJAR of Providence.",
      "After two hours, police moved in and told those in the lab to get out as fast as possible as they cleared the building in their search for the attacker, Chien said.",
      "Smiley said Saturday night that he lives \u201cabout a block away\u201d from where the violence unfolded.",
      "He said he saw lights and sirens zooming past his house and O\u2019Hara called him to give him an update.",
      "\u201cSadly, today is a day that the city of Providence and the state of Rhode Island prayed would never come,\u201d Smiley said. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard about horrific acts of gun violence and active shooter situations in other places, but not here.\u201d",
      "President asks for prayers as federal agencies aid in response",
      "Speaking after he disembarked from Marine One at the White House on Saturday night, President Donald Trump expressed sorrow.",
      "\u201cWhat a terrible thing it is, and all we can do right now is pray for the victims and for those that were very badly hurt,\u201d Trump said.",

      "An overwhelming majority of U.S. adults are satisfied with their health insurance coverage overall, including most older Americans and those on Medicare and Medicaid, according to a new NBC News Decision Desk Poll powered by SurveyMonkey.",
      "But there is an undercurrent of frustration in the findings, too, with nearly one-quarter of respondents saying they\u2019d been denied coverage or faced a delay from their insurance in the last two years.",
      "Overall, 82% of Americans said they\u2019re satisfied with their health care coverage, including a third who said they are very satisfied with their current coverage. The group that reported being the most satisfied were older adults, with 9 in 10 Americans over 65 years old saying they were satisfied. And 42% in that age group reported being \u201cvery satisfied.\u201d",
      "Roughly 9 in 10 of those who have public health insurance coverage through Medicare or Medicaid also reported being satisfied with coverage, compared to 77% of those with private health care coverage.",
      "The findings, which are consistent with other surveys, underscore the nuances of the debate playing out in Washington and across the country around health care and affordability. They also set a marker ahead of a year that will see significant changes and cuts to Medicaid and costs likely to rise for millions of Americans. Premiums for people who get their health care through the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, are set to spike unless Congress can reach a deal to extend subsidies.",
      "Young Americans were more likely to say they were dissatisfied with their health insurance than older Americans. Just under a quarter of those under 45 years old reported being dissatisfied with health insurance coverage. The same share of college graduates and self-identified political independents also reported being dissatisfied.",
      "Challenges in receiving care, however, add another layer to the national conversation. NBC News has reported extensively on the issue of insurance claim denials and delays, and the issue is at the center of the nationally watched New York case against Luigi Mangione, who is accused of murdering a health insurance company CEO. And about a quarter of Americans (24%) said their health insurance company has delayed or denied their health care service, treatment or medication in the past two years, according to the survey.",
      "Women were six points more likely than men to report that their coverage has been delayed or denied (27% to 21%).",
      "Americans with private health care coverage were slightly more likely (26%) than those with public health care coverage (23%) to say they have been delayed or denied coverage in the past two years.",
      "When it comes to Obamacare, 46% said they would rather keep it and 24% said they\u2019d rather repeal it. Another 31% were not sure what to do.",
      "Notably, those with private health care coverage, such as a plan through their or their spouse\u2019s employer, were just as likely (47%) as those with public health care coverage (46%) to say they want to keep the ACA.",
      "Majorities of Democrats (79%), majorities of Black Americans (61%), women under 30 years old (59%) and all adults under 30 (52%) also want to keep it.",
      "A majority of Republicans (56%) and people who identify as members of Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement (69%) said they want to repeal the ACA. Four in 10 men 65 and older also said they want to repeal it.",
      "With health insurance prices a growing issue for Americans heading into the 2026 midterm elections, 57% of respondents said they trust the Democratic Party to handle the issue, versus 43% who said they trust the Republican Party.",
      "Women overall trust the Democratic Party more than the Republican Party to handle health care costs (64%-36%) whereas men were evenly split, 50%-50%.",
      "The NBC News Decision Desk Poll powered by SurveyMonkey surveyed 20,252 adults online from Nov. 20 to Dec. 8 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 1.9 percentage points. Percentages may not add up to 100 due to rounding."

      "Meanwhile, other teams expected to stand atop their divisions are in jeopardy of falling short. Buffalo, which has won five consecutive AFC East titles, will see that streak snapped if it loses to New England on Sunday. Tampa Bay\u2019s hold on the NFC South, which it has won the last four years, is tenuous at best.",

The Chicago Bears started Dec. 7 in first place in their conference. When the day ended with a loss, they had tumbled all the way to the seventh and final playoff spot.",

Yet even with that losing record, they still control their path to winning their division with four weeks to play in the NFL\u2019s regular season.

Jackson\u2019s five-game streak without throwing multiple touchdowns is the longest of his career as a starter.",

      "Raiders (2-11) at Eagles (8-5): While it has been a difficult season for Saquon Barkley running the ball, his 52-yard gain last week gives him 15 runs of 50-plus in his career. Only Adrian Peterson (16) has more.",

      "An ad for the clothing brand American Eagle became one of the biggest controversies of the year after it touted actor Sydney Sweeney\u2019s \u201cgreat jeans\u201d in a denim-focused fall campaign. Many online accused the brand of promoting eugenics via perceived racial undertones in the ad\u2019s messaging, while others on the right lauded the campaign as a blow to \u201cwokeness.\u201d The ad even drew the attention of Trump, who called it \u201cthe \u2018HOTTEST\u2019 ad out there.\u201d It became one of several instances when Sweeney became a lightning rod for online discourse. In an interview with People magazine published earlier this month, Sweeney, 28, addressed the ad, saying \"\u201cI\u2019m against hate and divisiveness. In the past my stance has been to never respond to negative or positive press but recently I have come to realize that my silence regarding this issue has only widened the divide, not closed it.\u201d",

When the kiss cam landed on them, the pair immediately hid their faces \u2014 prompting lead singer Chris Martin to speculate that they were having an affair.

      "TODAY lifestyle contributor Jill Martin ventured to Venice to chat about Season 5 with Collins and her onscreen and real life friend, Ashley Park, who plays Mindy.",
      "Among the topics of their talk? What inspired the sudden strand switch-up for Collins' character.",
      "\"So did Emily get the bob, or did Lily get the bob?\" Martin asked in a segment that will air on TODAY on Dec. 15.",
      "\"Lily got the bob,\" Collins clarified. \"Usually Lily gets the haircuts first, and then Marylin (Fitoussi, the show's costume designer) is inspired by the haircuts to create the new wardrobe for the next season. And then I always go to Darren (Star, the show's creator) and I'm like, 'Hey, can I keep it?'\"",
      "Throughout the series, which returns for Season 5 on Dec. 18, Emily has rarely strayed from her signature long, brunette locks. Except, of course, that time she decided to cut her own bangs in the Season 3 premiere.",
      "As it turns out, this was another case of art imitating life for Collins.",
      "\"In the season with the bangs, we created part of the storyline, you know, Ashley coming in, and being like, 'No!'\" the actor said.",
      "\"Trauma bangs,\" Park noted.",
      "Collins' real-life bob was a bit more of a dramatic mane move than getting bangs. She told Jill it's a style she wouldn't have considered sporting earlier in her life. But her hairstylist, Gregory Russell, convinced her to try it, since he'd always wanted to see her with shorter hair.",
      "\u201cI really love changing my hair, which is ironic, because growing up, I was like, \u2018I never want to cut or color my hair.\u2019 And so I did it, and I didn\u2019t know how people would react. I was like, \u2018Is there going to have to be a wig next season or whatever?'\" she recalled.",
      "Luckily, Star was down to keep the hairstyle, and the duo proceeded to debate if they should write it into the show.",
      "\u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Well, we already did that with the bangs.\u2019 So there was one moment, I believe it was cut (from the show) but there was a moment in the very first episode when I go into the Rome office and I sit down. Philippine (Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu, who plays Sylvie) comes in, and the first thing she says is, \u2018You cut your hair.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Oh, thanks.\u2019 And she\u2019s like, \u2018It\u2019s not a compliment. We\u2019ve gotta go,\u2019\u201d she remembered.",
      "Park wanted to make sure the merits of Collins' haircut were acknowledged so she improvised a bit while filming.",
      "\u201cI added a line. Because when Mindy comes to Rome, I remember being like, \u2018Wait, hold up. I know that Lily got this haircut, but I feel like Mindy would at least be, like, \u2018Love your hair!\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Martin was also curious to know if becoming a mother inspired Collins' new shorter hairstyle. In January 2025, Collins announced that she had welcomed her first child with her husband Charlie McDowell.",
      "\"No, it didn\u2019t. I always wanted to do it. I had a very short haircut when I was 25 and then it grew out. But then I just kept it growing. No, it is more practical, perhaps,\" she said.",
      "Regardless of her motivation for chopping her hair, the end result is fabulous, if you ask Park.",

      "Opening night for her \u201cEras Tour\u201d occurred on March 17, 2023, in Arizona, but as revealed in Swift\u2019s new docuseries, \u201cThe End of an Era,\u201d physical preparation for it started six months before her rehearsals.",
      "So Swift is hopefully forgiven for what she wore the first day of rehearsals.",
      "Per footage in the first episode of \u201cThe End of an Era,\u201d Swift arrived to the first rehearsal of the tour wearing a grey Philadelphia Eagles sweatshirt.",
      "The Eagles are one of the Kansas City Chiefs known rivals in recent sports history, having met at the Super Bowl in 2023 and again in 2025.",
      "Swift and Kelce, tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs, have been dating since at least September 2023, when she appeared at Arrowhead Stadium for a game against the Chicago Bears.",
      "But the \u201cEras Tour\u201d \u2014 and all the preparation required for it \u2014 massively predates their relationship. (In fact, Kelce attending the \u201cEras Tour\u201d in July 2023 led to them meeting in the first place, after a missed friendship bracelet connection.)",
      "Before she started dating Kelce, Swift, who was born in Pennsylvania, had previously alluded to her love of the Philly team. In her 2020 song \u201cGold Rush,\u201d she briefly sings about her \u201cEagles T-shirt hanging from the door.\u201d Then, amid speculation that the lyric could refer to the team or the \u201cHotel California\u201d band, Swift said onstage in Philadelphia in May 2023, \u201cGuys, like, c\u2019mon. I\u2019m from Philly. Of course it\u2019s the team.\u201d",
      "In the docuseries, Swift is seen wearing an Eagles sweatshirt in multiple clips from that rehearsal.",
      "As she arrived at the rehearsal space, she already had tears in her eyes. While shaking the hand of one of her fellow performers, she said, \u201cI\u2019m weirdly emotional right now. It\u2019s so nice to meet you, I\u2019m Taylor.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never seen the boss come into rehearsal crying with tears of happiness and passion about their job,\u201d dancer Whyley Yoshimura said about the moment.",
      "The \u201cEras Tour\u201d went on to kick off just weeks after her then-beloved Eagles lost to the Chiefs in the Super Bowl. That matchup made headlines for being the first Super Bowl to see two brothers \u2014 you guessed it, Travis and his brother, Jason Kelce \u2014 face off on opposing teams.",
      "Unfortunately for Philly fans, by the 2025 Super Bowl, when the Eagles got their revenge and defeated the Chiefs 40-22, Swift had already switched allegiances, proudly supporting Travis Kelce.",
      "Regarding football, she has since said, \u201cThe whole season I am locked in on what that man is doing on the field.\u201d",
      "Jason Kelce, Travis Kelce\u2019s brother and former Philadelphia Eagles center, has yet to comment on the sweatshirt\u2019s appearance."

    "story": [
      "Warning: Spoilers from \u201cWake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery.\u201d",
      "Benoit Blanc has stumbled into a contemptuous congregation hiding a murderous secret in his latest whodunnit, \u201cWake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery.\u201d",
      "Set in a small upstate New York town, the third installment in the \u201cKnives Out\u201d franchise from director and writer Rian Johnson tackles religion, false prophets and, of course, a complicated murder.",
      "The film \u2014 now streaming on Netflix \u2014 is mostly told through the perspective of a young priest named Jud, played by Josh O\u2019Connor, who is sent to help run a modest parish led by Monsignor Jefferson Wicks, portrayed by Josh Brolin. After meeting Wicks and developing a strained dynamic with him, he also meets the monsignor\u2019s loyal congregation: Wicks\u2019 right-hand woman Martha (Glenn Close), doctor Nat (Jeremy Renner), lawyer Vera (Kerry Washington) struggling author Lee (Andrew Scott), chronically ill concert cellist Simone (Cailee Spaeny), failed politician Cy (Daryl McCormack) and groundskeeper Samson (Thomas Haden Church).",
      "During one service, the monsignor delivers a disparaging and chaotic homily, his speciality, before stepping into a compact side room to collect himself while Jud briefly takes over. Seconds later, Jud and the churchgoers hear a loud thud before finding Wicks lying on the ground, dead. Baffled by how the murderer pulled off their plan, local police chief Geraldine (Mila Kunis) enlists the help of renowned detective Benoit Blanc, played by Daniel Craig, to unravel the case.",
      "Compared to the previous films, \u201cWake Up Dead Man\u201d has a darker tone and more violence. Johnson tells TODAY.com that he wanted to \u201cground\u201d the third movie and its themes in a subject that was \u201cvery personal for me.\u201d",
      "\u201cI grew up very Christian. I\u2019m not a believer anymore, but it\u2019s something I have a lot of complicated feelings about,\u201d he shares.  \u201cSo the challenge of seeing if we can make a big, entertaining, fun whodunnit and at the same time, in a complicated and generous way \u2014 not just a finger wagging way \u2014 look at those issues of faith and Christianity in America right now.\u201d",
      "He adds, \u201cThat seemed like a worthy challenge.\u201d",
      "A big reason he was able to pull it off: Craig\u2019s portrayal of Blanc. Johnson says that the actor\u2019s performance, while hilarious and captivating, is rooted in basic human decency and empathy. He also notes that in each of his \u201cKnives Out\u201d movies he has paired Blanc with a good-hearted protagonist who anchors the film. For \u201cWake Up Dead Man\u201d the relationship between Blanc, a nonbeliever, and O\u2019Connor\u2019s Jud, a devoted priest, is at the center of the movie.",
      "Johnson reveals that Jud was the most difficult character to pin down when he worked on the script because of his arc.",
      "\u201cI hope the movie lands in an emotionally satisfying place for the audience\u2026that was definitely the biggest challenge. But I feel really, really proud of the result,\u201d he says.",
      "Each film in the \u201cKnives Out\u201d franchise is named after a song. Johnson teases that \u201cWake Up Dead Man,\u201d the title of a 1997 U2 song from the band\u2019s album \u201cPop\u201d that is always playing in his head, fit perfectly for the flick\u2019s unexpected twist.",
      "\u201cFor reasons that\u2019ll become more clear once you see the movie, it makes a lot of sense for this film,\u201d he shares.",
      "Read on to find out how Blanc pieces together the clues to solve \u201cWake Up Dead Man,\u201d and how the film\u2019s clever title comes to fruition.",
      "How Does \u2018Wake Up Dead Man\u2019 End?",
      "\u201cWake Up Dead Man\u201d includes the most on-screen deaths in the \u201cKnives Out\u201d franchise, as Wicks isn\u2019t the only character who is brutally murdered. During a stormy night, the Wicks family tomb, where the monsignor was buried, miraculously opens from the inside and a man resembling Wicks emerges. (Hence the movie\u2019s title.) The revived man then follows a hooded figure into the woods. Jud, watching from afar, goes after the two of them. He is knocked unconscious and awakens to find Samson impaled with a garden hook. Meanwhile, another hooded figure is seen meeting with Nat at his home in the middle of the night.",
      "Blanc discovers a disheveled Jud, who believes he is responsible for Samson\u2019s murder and needs to confess. But before Jud can turn himself in to Geraldine, he and Blanc travel to Nat\u2019s home. There, they find the doctor\u2019s body disintegrated in a tub filled with toxic chemicals, leaving only his bones.",
      "Overcome by guilt, Jud goes to speak to Geraldine. As he tries to confess, Blanc interrupts him and reveals to Jud, Geraldine and the rest of the monsignor\u2019s followers that he knows who the killer is.",
      "The detective explains in his delightful Southern accent that the monsignor collapsed after drinking a poisoned flask following his homily. He says that when the rest of the congregation joined Jud to investigate the body, the killer\u2019s accomplice, Nat, secretly stabbed Wicks, who was already dead.",
      "While relaying the evidence, Blanc abruptly pauses and says he cannot continue. He\u2019d prefer the culprit admit their sins. After most of the congregation leaves the church, Martha remains and confirms she is the killer. She recalls that when she was a little girl, Wicks\u2019 father, Prentice, swallowed his family\u2019s inheritance \u2014 a rare jewel \u2014 prior to his death to prevent his children and the church from becoming corrupted by greed. She was the only one who knew the truth about the location of the jewel and chose to keep it to herself for decades.",
      "But when Jud arrived at the parish, she decided to share her secret with the monsignor during confession. She instantly realized she had made a mistake and plotted to kill Wicks so he couldn\u2019t get the jewel. She teamed up with Nat, since he had access to drugs they could use to spike Wicks\u2019 flask. Their convoluted plan also contained another crucial step: they removed Wicks\u2019 body from his coffin and instead Samson, Martha\u2019s husband, would take his place. The switch allowed the groundskeeper to remove the jewel from Prentice\u2019s corpse and lie in the casket until he received a signal. Then, he would perform the \u201cmiracle\u201d of exiting the Wicks tomb, bringing more parishioners and prestige to the church.",
      "However, the plan went awry when Samson met with Nat in the woods after leaving the tomb. Nat stabbed Samson with the garden tool and stole the jewel. Martha discovered Nat\u2019s betrayal, went to his home, inconspicuously snatched the jewel and pushed the doctor into the toxic tub, killing him.",
      "After revealing how she pulled off her crimes, Martha dies in Jud and Blanc\u2019s arms, as she willingly ingested the same poison Wicks drank.",
      "While chatting to TODAY.com about the killer\u2019s reveal, Kerry Washington, whose character is one of the few that has a happy ending, says she didn\u2019t see it coming when she first read the script.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way when I got to the end that I would have been able to guess it,\u201d she says. \u201cI tried while I was reading it, and I just never would have.\u201d"

      "What the 13-year-old didn\u2019t expect, however, was being crowned the platform\u2019s top listener of the artist \u2014 quite a feat, considering Swift has over 100 million listeners on Spotify and was the second most-streamed artist of 2025, behind only Bad Bunny.",
      "She learned of her No. 1 status through Spotify Wrapped's new Fan Leaderboard feature.",
      "\u201cThink you\u2019re one of your top artist\u2019s biggest fans? This year, you might see where you rank among their listeners worldwide, based on your total minutes listened,\u201d an announcement on Spotify\u2019s website reads.",
      "According to screenshots and screen recordings of Wood\u2019s Spotify Wrapped, she is Swift\u2019s No. 1 listener. Spotify declined to comment for this story.",
      "Wood personally amassed a total of 449,000 minutes listened to Swift, which Spotify equated to 312 days. Most of her minutes are from enjoying her favorite song, \u201cThe Albatross,\u201d from Swift\u2019s 2024 album \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d which she streamed 83,601 times in 2024.

      "\u201cAt first, I was like, \u2018Is my Spotify glitching?\u2019\u201d she adds.",
      "On Dec. 4, Wood shared her Spotify listening feat on TikTok. The video, with over 10 million views, showed screenshotted proof of Wood\u2019s top listener title as she reacted in shock, writing on the video: \u201cBefore you ask YES I have a therapist.\u201d",
      "Wood\u2019s video amassed reactions \u2014 and skepticism. Wood followed up with another video of her scrolling through her Spotify Wrapped results on her mom\u2019s phone, to prove her case.",
      "Before you ask: Yes, Wood does listen to Swift while she sleeps, which helped rack up her dayslong minutes-listened number.",
      "Wood says she listens to music when she falls asleep because she \u201ccan\u2019t sleep otherwise.\u201d It\u2019s a habit that dates back to a sweet childhood memory.",

      "Wood says she never gets sick of \u201cThe Albatross\u201d \u2014 even on the 83,601st listen. \u201cThe Albatross\u201d plays on the legend of the albatross, a seabird said to bring bad luck to sailors and is now associated with burdens. Swift likens the albatross to a person, or more specifically \u201ca woman, here to destroy you.\u201d",
      "For her, this 2024 song is a background song she can play while relaxing or scrolling online, and it\u2019s also a song she can tune her full attention to when she wants to belt the lyrics.",

      "\u201cSo just having a song that I really just look back and I\u2019m like, \u2018This song has been with me through some of the hardest times and some of the easiest times of my life,\u2019\u201d she says.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s just so crazy to think like there was once an 11-year-old girl who was scared to even go to school, like literally just waiting for the \u2018Tortured Poets Department\u2019 to come out and now there\u2019s a 13-year-old girl who can\u2019t go a day without listening to it,\u201d Wood says.",

      "No, most characters were created for the film. However, some actors drew inspiration from a number of people for their role.",

But Bernie had a similar education to me, (went to an) all-girls school and stuff, so I kind of brought in a lot of my own background and made it my own.\u201d",

      "\u201cThere were 5- to 6-foot waves, maybe even bigger waves than that, and we were doing this in the middle of the night,\u201d Bryan Stern, who heads the Tampa, Florida-based Grey Bull Rescue Foundation, told NBC News. \u201cIt was pitch black, almost no moonlight.

      "With climate change steadily dismantling the icy habitat essential to their existence, new research suggests polar bears are rapidly rewiring their own genetics in a bid to survive.",
      "The species is being forced to adapt to the harsher reality of a warming Arctic, in what scientists believe is the first documented case of rising temperatures driving genetic change in a mammal.",
      "Researchers from the University of East Anglia in Britain say these findings, published Friday in the journal Mobile DNA, offer a rare glimmer of hope for the species.",
      "\"Polar bears are still sadly expected to go extinct this century, with two-thirds of the population gone by 2050,\" Alice Godden, who is the lead author of the study, told NBC News.",
      "\"I believe our work really does offer a glimmer of hope \u2014 a window of opportunity for us to reduce our carbon emissions to slow down the rate of climate change and to give these bears more time to adapt to these stark changes in their habitats.\"",
      "Building on earlier University of Washington research, Godden\u2019s team analyzed blood samples from polar bears in northeastern and southeastern Greenland. In the slightly warmer south, they found that genes linked to heat stress, aging and metabolism behaved differently from those in northern bears.",
      "\u201cEssentially this means that different groups of bears are having different sections of their DNA changed at different rates, and this activity seems linked to their specific environment and climate,\" Godden said in a university press release.",
      "She said this shows, for the first time, that a unique group of one species has been forced to \"rewrite their own DNA,\" adding that this process can be considered \"a desperate survival mechanism against melting sea ice.\"",
      "The Arctic Ocean has repeatedly experienced record-high temperatures in the past few years, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) monitoring data shows.",
      "Researchers say warming ocean temperatures have reduced vital sea ice platforms that the bears use to hunt seals, leading to isolation and food scarcity.",
      "This led to genetic changes as the animals\u2019 digestive system adapts to a diet of plants and low fats in the absence of prey, Godden told NBC News.",
      "\"Food availability is a real problem for these bears \u2014 everywhere, but most prominently in the south,\" she said. \"This may suggest their body shape and composition is also changing in response to their warmer environments.\"",
      "The lead researcher said that her team decided to focus on the southern group of bears because the area's warmer climate serves as a glimpse of what is to come for other bear populations later this century if current trends in climate change continue.",
      "The International Union for Conservation of Nature estimates there are currently about 26,000 polar bears worldwide. Scientifically known by its Latin name Ursus maritimus, meaning \"sea bear,\" the animals are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, meaning they are considered to be facing \"a high risk of extinction in the wild.\"",
      "The study \"does not mean that polar bears are at any less risk of extinction,\u201d Godden said, though the discovery may \u201cprovide a genetic blueprint for how polar bears might be able to adapt quickly to climate change.\u201d",
      "Godden added: \"We all must do more to mitigate our carbon emissions to help provide and extend this window of opportunity to help save this wonderful vital species.\""

    "summary": "Can children and teenagers be forced off social media en masse?",
    "story": [
      "Can children and teenagers be forced off social media en masse? Australia is about to find out.",
      "More than 1 million social media accounts held by users under 16 are set to be deactivated in Australia on Wednesday in a divisive world-first ban that has inflamed a culture war and is being closely watched in the United States and elsewhere.",
      "Social media companies will have to take \u201creasonable steps\u201d to ensure that under-16s in Australia cannot set up accounts on their platforms and that existing accounts are deactivated or removed.",
      "Australian officials say the landmark ban, which lawmakers swiftly approved late last year, is meant to protect children from addictive social media platforms that experts say can be disastrous for their mental health.",
      "\u201cWith one law, we can protect Generation Alpha from being sucked into purgatory by predatory algorithms described by the man who created the feature as \u2018behavioral cocaine,\u2019\u201d Communications Minister Anika Wells told the National Press Club in Canberra last week.",
      "While many parents and even their children have welcomed the ban, others say it will hinder young people\u2019s ability to express themselves and connect with others, as well as access online support that is crucial for those from marginalized groups or living in isolated parts of rural Australia. Two 15-year-olds have brought a legal challenge against it to the nation\u2019s highest court.",
      "Supporters say the rest of the world will soon follow the example set by the Australian ban, which faced fierce resistance from social media companies.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always referred to this as the first domino, which is why they pushed back,\u201d Julie Inman Grant, who regulates online safety as Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner, said at an event in Sydney last week.",
      "Social media companies will be responsible for enforcing the ban, paying fines of up to 49.5 Australian dollars (about $32 million) for serious or repeated breaches. Children and parents will not be punished for any infringements.",
      "Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, X, Snapchat and Reddit are all set to be age-restricted under the law, according to a list shared by the eSafety Commissioner. All of the platforms have said they will comply, and some have taken action before the ban even takes effect, with Meta saying last month that it would start closing Instagram, Threads and Facebook accounts on Dec. 4.",
      "The ban has broad support in Australia, where a YouGov poll last year found that 77% of respondents were in favor of it. Supporters say it will encourage children to prioritize in-person interactions, boosting their social skills.",
      "\u201cSocial media is a misnomer,\u201d said Jen Hummelshoj, 45, mother of 12-year-old Nina. \u201cThe apps want kids to be focused on their phone and not their friends.\u201d",
      "Nina does not have a phone or any social media accounts. She supports the ban\u2019s intent, arguing that social media is an overpowering distraction for young people.",
      "\u201cWhen I\u2019m trying to chat to someone, they might say, \u2018Just a minute,\u2019 and they\u2019re doing something on social media,\u201d she said in a phone interview from Canberra.",
      "According to a national study the Australian government commissioned this year, 96% of children ages 10 to 15 use social media. Seven out of 10 of them have been exposed to harmful content and behavior, including misogynistic material, fight videos and content promoting eating disorders and suicide.",
      "One in 7 also reported having experienced grooming-type behavior from adults or older children, and more than half said they had been the victims of cyberbullying.",
      "William Young, 14, said most social media platforms, in their current form, were unsafe for children, citing Snapchat as an example.",
      "\u201cYou can friend anyone without knowing who they are. It deletes messages after they\u2019ve sent. \u2026  It\u2019s just not a good platform,\u201d he said in a phone interview from Perth.",
      "He implored the affected platforms to \u201cdo right\u201d by young people and prioritize making their platforms safer.",
      "The platforms say they share that goal and insist that the ban will actually make young users less safe.",
      "\u201cDisconnecting teens from their friends and family doesn\u2019t make them safer \u2014 it may push them to less safe, less private messaging apps,\u201d Snap said in a statement last month.",
      "The platforms also argue that young users may turn to new, unregulated apps that push them into darker corners of the internet or may try to circumvent the ban by using virtual private networks, or VPNs, which Australian teenagers do not dispute.",
      "\u201cYoung people are going to find another way around it,\u201d Chloe Song, 14, said in a Zoom interview from Melbourne. \u201cStrict parents create, like, sneaky kids.\u201d",
      "She said she and her peers would benefit more from better digital literacy programs in their schools.",
      "\u201cThe next generation is in our hands,\u201d said Chloe, who is a member of Project Rockit, a youth-driven Australian movement against bullying, hate and prejudice.",
      "If young people are blocked from social media, \u201cwe just don\u2019t learn the life skills and we don\u2019t learn the experience of going through and knowing what\u2019s safe and what\u2019s not,\u201d she said.",
      "Susan Grantham, a social media researcher at Griffith University in Brisbane, described the ban as a \u201cstep in the right direction\u201d but not a solution on its own.",
      "\u201cSocial media is not going away. Instead, we need to create well-balanced digital citizens,\u201d she said.",
      "What rankles many young Australians about the ban is what Noah Jones described as a lack of consultation on \u201clegislation that specifically affects us.\u201d",
      "Noah, 15, one of two teenagers suing the Australian government over the ban, said he and his peers have \u201csolutions to all the negatives of social media.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we just got asked, we all could\u2019ve worked it out,\u201d he said in emailed comments.",
      "Noah argues the ban will deny young people freedom of political communication, an implied right in Australia\u2019s constitution, and deprive them of an essential educational tool.",
      "\u201cDo you want 15-year-old boys to have no clue about consent? Do you want teenagers who don\u2019t know about the dangers of vaping? Both topics I\u2019ve learned about on social media,\u201d he said.",
      "Wells, the communications minister, said that the center-left government would not be intimidated by legal challenges and that it \u201cremains steadfastly on the side of parents.\u201d",
      "Others are relieved by the ban, including Aalia Elachi and her father, Dany.",
      "Dany Elachi said Aalia\u2019s behavior changed within days of her receiving a smartphone at age 10.",
      "\u201cWe found that she retreated into her room, into her own private world, her own private space, and we didn\u2019t think that was, in the long run, going to be healthy for her,\u201d he said in a phone interview from Sydney.",
      "When the phone malfunctioned after a couple of months, Aalia\u2019s parents never replaced it.",
      "Now 16, Aalia will be able to legally use social media, but she has never had any accounts and said that is not about to change.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still as tech literate as the next 16-year-old. I just don\u2019t have TikTok or Instagram eating up hours of my childhood every day,\u201d Aalia told lawmakers in the state of New South Wales last month.",
      "\u201cHaving firm boundaries around social media hasn\u2019t made my life smaller,\u201d she said. \u201cMy hope is over the next few years, I won\u2019t be the exception, but the norm.\u201d"

      "Israel heavily restricts any import materials it considers \u201cdual use\u201d \u2014 covering building supplies and machinery, as well as agricultural equipment and medicine. It says these goods could be repurposed for military use by Hamas or used by the group to garner support.",
      "Gaza\u2019s Government Media Office said in a statement that Israel had blocked about 300,000 \u201ctents, mobile homes, and caravans\u201d from entering the enclave since a U.S.-brokered ceasefire came into effect on Oct. 10.",

      "Images of female runners also spread online. Some showed them documenting the marathon and posing with their medals after they finished the 26.2-mile race. Some were without a hijab, while others wore headband-style coverings that sat across the forehead and scalp but did not conceal their ponytails or braids.",
      "Right after the race the island\u2019s public prosecutor told Mizan Online that warnings about the need to follow national laws, religious norms and professional rules in holding the marathon had been ignored.",
      "The organizers \u201cdid not take these warnings seriously\u201d and violated \u201cpublic decency\u201d by allowing women to compete without the legally required headscarf, or hijab, Ali Salemizadeh said.",
      "Iran\u2019s Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution, a conservative-dominated body that sets the country\u2019s cultural and educational policies, also criticized the race in a statement reported by the state-run broadcaster, the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB).",
      "Calling the behavior \u201cshame breaking and organized,\u201d it said security and judicial bodies should identify and deal firmly with such movements to prevent similar cases from happening again.",

      "The intense crackdown that followed has largely stifled the protest movement, with new detentions and legislation.",

      "\u201cThe issue of hijab is not a simple matter and cannot be resolved through compulsion or confrontation,\u201d the broadcaster quoted Pezeshkian as saying. He added that the government must act \u201cpersuasively,\u201d rather than rely on force.",

    "story": [
      "SANTIAGO, Chile \u2014 As Chileans vote on Sunday, even detractors of ultra-conservative former lawmaker Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast say the candidate whose radical ideas lost him the past two elections is likely to become the country\u2019s next leader.",
      "Kast\u2019s commanding lead in the polls over his rival in the presidential runoff, communist Jeannette Jara, shows how the hard-liner agitating for mass deportations of immigrants has seized the mantle of the traditional right in a country that once defined its post-dictatorship democratic revival with a vow to contain such political forces.",
      "Many voters are frustrated with the options",
      "But much is also up for grabs about Chile\u2019s political direction.",
      "Kast\u2019s claim to a popular mandate depends on his margin of victory on Sunday over Jara, the center-left governing party candidate who narrowly beat him in the first round of elections last month.",
      "Although various right-wing parties won around 70% of the vote in that election and later endorsed Kast, substantial support for Franco Parisi \u2014 a populist center-right candidate who described himself as an alternative to Kast\u2019s \u201cfascism\u201d \u2014 revealed that, between the contrasting ideologies of the front-runners, sit hundreds of thousands of centrist voters with no real representation.",
      "\u201cBoth are too extreme for me,\u201d said Juan Carlos Pileo, 44, who plans to cast a blank ballot Sunday, as voting is now mandatory in Chile\u2019s elections. \u201cI can\u2019t trust someone who says she\u2019s a communist to be moderate. And I can\u2019t trust someone who exaggerates the amount of crime we have in this country and blames immigrants to be fair and respectful.\u201d",
      "Kast raises expectations but reality is a different story",
      "Even if elected, it remains uncertain whether Kast, an admirer of U.S. President Donald Trump, can implement his more grandiose promises. They include slashing $6 billion in public spending over just 18 months without eliminating social benefits, deporting over 300,000 immigrants in Chile with no legal status and expanding the powers of the army to fight organized crime in a country still haunted by Gen. Augusto Pinochet\u2019s military dictatorship from 1973 to 1990.",
      "For one, Kast\u2019s far-right Republican Party lacks a majority in Congress, meaning that he\u2019ll need to negotiate with moderate right-wing forces that could bristle at those proposals, significantly shaping policy and his own legacy.",
      "Political compromises could temper Kast\u2019s radicalism, but also jeopardize his position with voters who expect him to deliver quickly on his law-and-order campaign promises.",
      "At each campaign event, Kast has taken to ticking off the number of days remaining until Chile\u2019s March 11 presidential inauguration, warning immigrants without legal status that they should get out before they \u201chave to leave with just the clothes on their backs.\u201d",
      "Jorge Rubio, 63, a Chilean banker in Santiago, the capital, said he and like-minded Chileans are \u201calso counting down the days, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re voting for Kast.\u201d",
      "Boric\u2019s left-wing government is under fire",
      "As the pandemic shuttered borders, transnational criminal organizations like Venezuela\u2019s Tren de Aragua seized clandestine migration routes to gain a foothold in Chile, long considered among Latin America\u2019s safest and wealthiest countries. Homicides hit a record high in 2022, the first year of President Gabriel Boric\u2019s tenure.",
      "Kast insists that Boric\u2019s government is too soft on immigration and crime, which the far-right leader argues are connected although the data does not necessarily support his narrative. Boric\u2019s approval rating has hovered around just 30% for the past two years.",
      "\u201cWe are living through a moment of psychosis, thanks to this government,\u201d said Nati P\u00e9rez, an 87-year-old Peruvian who immigrated to Chile over a decade ago, heading to vote for Kast at an old railroad terminal in central Santiago that was converted into a vast polling center for the day. \u201cHe\u2019s not against immigrants, he\u2019s against crime. Venezuela sent all their criminals here.\u201d",
      "Others say the firebrand former student protester who came to power in 2021 pledging to transform Chile\u2019s market-led economy, has risen to the occasion. Boric went from criticizing the use of police force on the campaign trial to pouring money into the security forces. He sent the military to reinforce Chile\u2019s northern border, stiffened penalties for organized crime and created the country\u2019s first public security ministry.",
      "\u201cI actually thought this government would be worse. I have to admit that it has improved security,\u201d said Mariano Jara, 55, emerging from a polling station where he said he voted for Kast. \u201cThere\u2019s always more that can be done. There\u2019s room to get tougher.\u201d",
      "Chile\u2019s homicide rate has fallen in the last two years, now on par with the rate in the United States. But that has done nothing to change the widespread feeling of insecurity.",
      "In Chile, just 39% of people feel safe walking alone at night, according to a recent Gallup survey of 144 countries. That\u2019s around the same figure as in Ecuador, which is now in the midst of a violent, drug-driven crime wave. In Libya, where fractious militias jostle for political power, over 70% of people said they feel safe.",
      "Crime and migration overshadow all other concerns",
      "As Boric\u2019s former minister of labor, Jara became popular as the architect of the administration\u2019s most important welfare measures.",
      "That matters little now. Voters\u2019 concerns have forced her to switch gears. She has vowed to toughen border security, register undocumented migrants, tackle money laundering and step up police raids.",
      "But promises to restore law and order are more persuasive coming from an insurgent outsider who has made security a key part of his agenda for years.",
      "\u201cKast has been smart and strategic in focusing on migration and security,\u201d said Luc\u00eda Dammert, a sociologist and Boric\u2019s first chief of staff. \u201cIt has been very difficult for the Jara campaign to move him away from those issues.\u201d",
      "Learning from his previous two failed presidential runs, Kast has avoided topics that fire up his critics \u2014 such as his German-born father\u2019s Nazi past, nostalgia for Pinochet\u2019s dictatorship and opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion.",
      "When asked about his deeply conservative values, Kast, a devout Catholic and father of nine, says only that they remain the same. His supporters, including voters who previously spurned him over his stance on social issues, now say they\u2019re willing to trade abstract human rights concerns for increased safety on the streets.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not very nice to hear that he\u2019s going to separate immigrant children from their parents, it\u2019s sad, that\u2019s going to be a problem for me,\u201d said Natacha Feliz, a 27-year-old immigrant from the Dominican Republic, referring to a recent interview in which Kast said immigrant parents without legal status who didn\u2019t self-deport would be obliged to hand their kids over to the state.",
      "\u201cBut this is happening everywhere, not just in Chile. Let\u2019s just hope that our security situation improves.\u201d"

      "Three other U.S. personnel were wounded in the attack in Palmyra, Sean Parnell, the Pentagon\u2019s chief spokesperson said on X. The attack occurred as the soldiers \"were conducting a key leader engagement\" in \"support of ongoing counter-ISIS operations,\" he said.",

      "The U.S. military has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly stationed in the northeast, where they work with local security to prevent the resurgence of the Islamic State. The U.S. and other nations have re-engaged with Damascus under al-Sharaa, since rebels ousted former President Bashar al-Assad."

      "Tripoli's Red Castle museum has reopened for the first time since the 2011 uprising that toppled Moammar Gadhafi, unveiling a trove of treasures that span millennia, from ancient mummies to relics of Libya's turbulent and fascinating history.",
      "Formerly known as As-Saraya Al-Hamra, the fortress that houses the museum has long been a central landmark in Libya\u2019s capital, Tripoli. It houses an extensive collection of artifacts tracing 5,000 years of history, from prehistoric times through to Libya\u2019s Roman, Greek and Islamic eras.",
      "Collections include Islamic art and architecture as well as objects from Italian colonial rule, World War II and Libya's independence, with galleries dedicated to the prehistoric period and ancient Libyan tribes, such as the Garamantes.",
      "\u201cThe reopening of the National Museum is not just a cultural moment but a live testimony that Libya is building its institutions,\u201d Abdulhamid al-Dbiebah, prime minister of the Government of National Unity, said at a ceremony on Friday awash with fireworks at the site.",
      "The museum closed in February 2011 during the NATO-backed uprising against Gadhafi, as anti-government protesters in the northeastern city of Benghazi began calling for the leader to step down and for the release of political prisoners. As protests intensified, demonstrators took control of Benghazi and unrest spread to Tripoli, with the Libyan government using lethal force against demonstrators.",
      "When rebels launched their first attack on the Libyan capital in August that year, a group of armed men were reported to have entered the national museum, incorrectly believing it to conceal the entrance of a secret government tunnel. The museum\u2019s artifacts were largely left intact, though a 1960s Volkswagen Beetle belonging to Gadhafi was among the regime-linked objects vandalized.",
      "Gadhafi was eventually toppled with the help of an international coalition that included the U.S.",
      "Renovations for the museum, built in the 1980s and opened by Gadhafi, began in March 2023 by the Tripoli-based GNU.",
      "The reopening of the national museum indicates a recovery in the country\u2019s cultural sector, despite unresolved political dynamics. The country remains divided between administrations in the west and east that have not had a unified budget in more than a decade.",
      "But with a planned election on the horizon in 2026, Hager Ali, a research fellow at the German Institute for Global and Area Studies, said the museum's opening carries a political message.",
      "The reopening is \"kind of like a proof of concept of the western government that they are stable, especially in the forerun of elections,\" she told NBC News on Saturday, referring to the GNU.",
      "\"There really isn\u2019t anything that isn\u2019t political right now in Libya,\" she added. \u201cThis is very much a kind of a symbol that everyone can get behind.\"",
      "Since renovations began, Libya has recovered 21 artifacts that were smuggled out of the country after Gadhafi\u2019s fall, notably from France, Switzerland and the United States, the chairman of the board of directors of the antiquities department, Mohamed Farj Shakshoki, told Reuters ahead of the opening.",
      "Libya houses five UNESCO World Heritage sites, which in 2016 were all declared \"endangered\" due to instability and conflict.",
      "The historic town of Ghadames in western Libya was among the sites under threat, but conservation work spearheaded by the Managing Libya's Cultural Heritage project led to the site being officially removed from UNESCO's List of World Heritage in Danger in July."

    "story": [
      "When Volodymyr Zelenskyy last asked Ukrainians to vote for him, he was a political newbie, a former comedian eager to change his country and talk with Russia to end a protracted conflict.",
      "Six years later, Zelenskyy \u2014 transformed by the Kremlin\u2019s full-scale invasion \u2014 is facing sudden pressure from the United States to hold a new election, even as he navigates Washington\u2019s push for a peace deal that could threaten Ukraine\u2019s future.",
      "President Donald Trump, frustrated by a lack of progress in peace talks, criticized Zelenskyy this week for \u201cusing war not to hold an election.\u201d It\u2019s a narrative that Moscow has exploited to label Zelenskyy\u2019s government \u201cillegitimate\u201d and thus impossible to negotiate with.",
      "Yet an election would currently be illegal, since Ukrainian law prohibits holding elections while martial law is in effect.",
      "Nonetheless, Zelenskyy now appears to be playing ball. But huge questions hang over the idea, from security to logistics, given the fierce fighting on the front lines and the daily Russian aerial assaults on Ukraine\u2019s cities.",
      "\u201cI do not want Ukraine to have a weak position, so that someone could use the absence of elections as an argument against Ukraine,\u201d Zelenskyy said Thursday. Elections could happen in 60 to 90 days, he has said, provided that Ukraine\u2019s allies help provide security on the ground.",
      "Ukraine was scheduled to hold a presidential election in early 2024, but it was postponed because martial law was introduced after Russia\u2019s February 2022 attack.",
      "After Trump\u2019s comment, Zelenskyy said he had asked lawmakers to prepare proposals \u201cenabling changes to the legal framework\u201d that would make elections possible.",
      "Beyond martial law, there are two major challenges, Zelenskyy said: security and the army.",
      "First, how would Kyiv ensure that people who come out to vote won\u2019t be hit in a sudden missile or drone strike? The Kremlin\u2019s attacks regularly plunge Ukrainian cities into frigid darkness for hours, which could complicate voting and ballot counting.",
      "\u201cElections always involve crowds,\u201d said Kyiv-based political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko. \u201cWhat do you do about air raid alerts and safeguarding electoral paperwork? If a siren goes off, do you just grab a bunch of election protocols and run into a shelter? I am having a hard time imagining how that could work.\u201d",
      "The White House did not respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment on how the U.S. might help.",
      "Kyiv would also have to figure out how hundreds of thousands of soldiers fighting on the front lines would vote.",
      "Some forces could perhaps be rotated out to vote in relatively safer areas, but Ukraine is already low on manpower and could risk jeopardizing critical battlefield positions.",
      "To that end, Zelenskyy has called for a ceasefire during the election process. The Kremlin swiftly shot down the suggestion, having long rejected any ceasefire before a full peace deal is reached.",
      "Without a pause in fighting, more than 800,000 personnel in Ukraine\u2019s armed forces would be effectively shut out of any election process, said Yevheniia Kravchuk, a lawmaker with Zelenskyy\u2019s Servant of the People party. It would be unsafe for people overseeing the voting, too, she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see any observers coming to the front line where you can be killed by a first-person view (FPV) drone like every 15 minutes,\u201d Kravchuk said in an audio message sent to NBC News on WhatsApp.",
      "Kravchuk pointed to the country\u2019s five different presidents since Vladimir Putin came to power in Russia in 2000. \u201cUkrainians understand that during the war, the first goal is to survive and to keep the country, keep the sovereign state,\u201d she said.",
      "Zelenskyy has been under domestic pressure, too, thanks to a corruption scandal. But even his opponents seemed skeptical of a wartime vote.",
      "It would take at least half a year after the end of martial law to organize elections that would be truly free and fair, said opposition lawmaker Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze. \u201cBut discussing all of this right now has little to do with the reality on the ground,\u201d Klympush-Tsintsadze, who represents the European Solidarity Party, said in an audio message on WhatsApp. \u201cWe are very far from the real end of this war,\u201d she added.",
      "Another complicating factor is that millions of Ukrainians fled the country when the war broke out and now live overseas. Millions more have been internally displaced by the fighting or now live in areas occupied by Russia (about 20% of Ukraine\u2019s territory), so simply working out who is eligible to vote and how to reach them would pose an immense challenge, said Fesenko.",
      "Trump and Putin may think that the lack of an election undermines Zelenskyy\u2019s legitimacy, but Ukrainians don\u2019t seem to agree.",
      "An opinion poll conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology in September found  that 63% of Ukrainians believe elections should be held only after a final peace agreement and a complete end to the war. Only 11% support holding elections right now, even without a ceasefire, according to the poll.",
      "Should an election be held in the near future, there is only one candidate who could challenge Zelenskyy, Fesenko said \u2014 Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the former commander in chief.",
      "Zaluzhnyi has remained a popular figure after leading the Ukrainian army through much of the war. He was sacked by Zelenskyy in early 2024 and is now serving as Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to Britain. Although Zelenskyy\u2019s position has been weakened by the corruption scandal, the president would still be a front-runner alongside Zaluzhnyi, Fesenko said. \u201cIt\u2019s just these two,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone else has much lower ratings.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the fourth year of the war, everyone is deeply exhausted,\u201d marketing specialist Ivan Datsko told NBC News on the phone from Kyiv on Wednesday.",
      "Datsko, 33, said he felt that elections could be held but that there must at least be a ceasefire. \u201cNo rockets, no [drones] \u2014 and conditions that allow our soldiers to rotate safely. And of course, all Ukrainians who have left the country must also have the opportunity to vote,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIf all these conditions are met, it could become a strong step toward real peace talks,\u201d Datsko added. \u201cFirst, silence on the front line, then elections, and after that, an agreement that truly protects Ukraine from future aggression and gives us a chance for peace and a normal life,\u201d he said.",
      "Russia has accused Zelenskyy of trying to cling to power. Last month, Putin said signing a peace deal with Zelenskyy would be \u201cpointless\u201d because he has lost his legitimacy after being too \u201cafraid\u201d to run again. The Kremlin said Friday that Zelenskyy\u2019s declared readiness for an election may simply be his latest attempt to freeze the conflict before negotiating a deeper peace deal \u2014 something Moscow has frequently rejected.",
      "Other countries have held elections in wartime and elected officials\u2019 democratic mandate becomes weaker the longer they are postponed, but elections also need to be practically possible, said Janina Dill, an international law expert on the use of force and a professor of global security at the University of Oxford.",
      "\u201cAnd calls for an election must not be used to weaken Ukrainian agency and resolve in the midst of an existential struggle for national survival,\u201d Dill added."

      "United States special envoy Steve Witkoff is on his way to Berlin, Germany, to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders for peace negotiations aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, a senior White House official told NBC News.",
      "Witkoff has spearheaded talks with Ukraine and Russia since President Donald Trump took office in January, but multiple high-level meetings between the U.S. and the two warring nations have yet to produce results as disagreements remain over the content of a peace plan.",
      "Trump, who has pushed for a deal to be in place by Christmas, has signaled that his patience is running thin.",
      "European leaders have focused on how to support Ukraine in the event of a peace deal, with talks ongoing over security guarantees and funding. But long-time American allies in Europe have struggled to balance the mounting pressure from Washington with their reluctance to give in to Russia\u2019s hard-line demands.",
      "Zelenskyy said Ukraine submitted a 20-point plan to the U.S. on Wednesday, as it sought to balance out a 28-point U.S.-backed plan whose original version was seen as too favorable to Moscow.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s proposal included separate documents on security guarantees, to prevent Russia from attacking again, and on rebuilding Ukraine\u2019s war-hit cities.",
      "The issue of ceding territory remains a major sticking point in negotiations, and Russian President Vladimir Putin last week reiterated his goal to take eastern Ukraine \u201cby force\u201d unless his unwavering demands are met.",
      "Zelenskyy said there was still no common understanding on the land issue and that Ukrainians should vote on any territorial concessions in a referendum.",
      "Russia has continued its bombardment of Ukraine as talks continue. Ukraine's southern port city of Odesa and the surrounding region suffered major blackouts on Saturday after a large overnight Russian attack on the power grid across the country.",
      "Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant also temporarily lost all offsite power overnight for the 12th time, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Saturday, citing its Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi.",
      "Zelenskyy said in a post on X: \"It is important that everyone now sees what Russia is doing \u2013 every step they take in terror against our people, all their attacks, for this is clearly not about ending the war. They still aim to destroy our state and inflict maximum pain on our people.\"",
      "Witkoff's visit to Berlin comes as the European Union agreed Friday to indefinitely freeze Russian assets worth 210 billion euros ($246 billion) held in Europe, as it considers using those assets to fund Ukraine\u2019s war effort.",
      "The indefinite freeze appears to be a bid to convince Belgium, where much of that money is held at Euroclear, to agree to plans that would loan a large chunk of the money to Ukraine to cover its military and civilian budget needs in 2026 and 2027.",
      "Belgium opposed the plan because it fears legal retaliation by Russia, which has condemned the freezing of its assets as theft, but the agreement includes a guarantee that Belgium would not be left alone to foot the bill should a potential Russian lawsuit prove successful.",
      "Zelenskyy said Thursday that negotiators are wrestling with the question of territorial possession in U.S.-led peace talks on ending the war with Russia, including the future of Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donetsk region and the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, one of the world\u2019s 10 biggest atomic plants.",
      "Speaking to reporters in Kyiv on Friday, Zelenskyy said the U.S. is offering as a compromise to create a \u201cfree economic zone\u201d in the Ukraine-controlled parts of the eastern Donbas which Russia has demanded that Ukraine cede.",
      "Among the issues Zelenskyy shared were that Russia wants to incorporate the entire Donbas, which Ukraine opposes. He also said the U.S. proposed turning Donbas into a \u201cfree economic zone.\u201d That would mean Ukrainian forces withdraw from Donbas and Russia refrains from entering the parts of Donbas it does not currently occupy.",
      "\u201cThey see it as Ukrainian troops withdrawing from the Donetsk region, and the compromise is supposedly that Russian troops will not enter this part of Donetsk region. They do not know who will govern this territory,\u201d he said, adding that Russia is referring to it as a \u201cdemilitarized zone.\u201d",
      "NATO chief Mark Rutte struck a drastic note Thursday as he urged allies to step up defense efforts. \u201cWe are Russia\u2019s next target,\u201d he said, warning of a conflict that could be on \u201cthe scale of war our grandparents and great-grandparents endured.\u201d"

      "He also embarked on overseas trips within Europe, marking Holocaust Memorial Day at Auschwitz-Birkenau in January, and praying with Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican in October. Queen Elizabeth II, who died in 2022, avoided overseas travel during her last years on the throne, because of her advancing age and a series of health scares.",
      "The palace spokesperson said that Charles had \"taken great comfort and encouragement from being able to continue leading a full and active life throughout his treatment,\" continuing with public engagements and overseas tours.",

      "A skydiving trip in Australia took a harrowing turn when one person\u2019s parachute became entangled in the tail of the plane, stranding them at 15,000 feet.",
      "The aircraft, a Cessna 208 Caravan, was carrying one pilot and 17 parachutists, including a camera operator, on Sept. 20 as they attempted a 16-person formation jump over the northernmost part of the state of Queensland.",
      "The camera operator stepped out first, holding on to the fuselage of the plane. When the first skydiver emerged, a handle securing their reserve chute got caught on the plane\u2019s flap over the wing, prompting the chute to deploy inadvertently, according to a video and a report about the incident released Thursday by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau.",
      "The chute dragged the skydiver backward, knocking the camera operator off the plane and into free fall. The skydiver, who has not been publicly identified, flew straight into the plane\u2019s horizontal stabilizer on the left side of the tail, and the chute became wrapped around it, leaving the skydiver suspended.",
      "The pilot, unaware of what had happened, felt the aircraft suddenly pitch up, and noticed the airspeed rapidly decreasing. Believing the aircraft had stalled, the pilot increased power to regain airspeed but reduced it after being told a skydiver was hung up on the tail.",
      "Thirteen other parachutists exited the plane in quick succession, while two remained in the doorway. They watched as the skydiver used a hook knife \u2014 which is not mandatory equipment \u2014 to cut through 11 ropes connected to the chute, enabling it to tear free in about 50 seconds.",
      "But that was only the first problem.",
      "The skydiver then deployed the main parachute, but it was tangled with the remnants of the reserve chute. The skydiver fell about 7,000 feet from the plane before the main lines fully unwound from the dangling reserve line and functioned normally for the remainder of the descent, the report said.",
      "All parachutists landed safely, including the camera operator and the first skydiver, who sustained minor leg injuries from hitting the horizontal stabilizer.",
      "Meanwhile, the pilot was having control difficulties because the impact of the skydiver had damaged the horizontal stabilizer, which still had part of the reserve chute wrapped around it.",
      "The pilot, who was wearing an emergency parachute, was prepared to bail out from the plane if necessary, but was ultimately able to land safely at Tully Airport, officials said.",
      "According to the report, the Far North Freefall Club, which organized the jump, now requires all parachutists to carry a hook knife.",
      "\u201cCarrying a hook knife \u2014 although it is not a regulatory requirement \u2014 could be lifesaving in the event of a premature reserve parachute deployment,\u201d ATSB Chief Commissioner Angus Mitchell said, adding that parachutists should be mindful of their handles, especially when exiting a plane."

      "Will this Saturday see a shocking, sad and incredibly premature end to Mohamed Salah\u2019s career at Liverpool, as one of the greatest players in their history could suddenly say goodbye after a truly incredible meltdown?",
      "It feels like \u201cThe Egyptian King\u201d is about to be dethroned and sensationally leave Liverpool, despite being their star player, becoming a Premier League legend over the last few years and still being one of the best forwards on the planet.",
      "Why?",
      "And how did things devolve so quickly for a club that won the league last season in dominant fashion and then added several star players in the offseason?",
      "Last weekend, Salah fumed publicly about being named as a substitute in Liverpool\u2019s last three games, including never seeing the pitch against Leeds before he lost the plot and was left out of the squad for Liverpool's huge 1-0 win at Inter Milan on Tuesday as a consequence of his incredible rant to reporters.",
      "\u201cI have done so much for this club down the years and especially last season,\u201d Salah said. \u201cNow I\u2019m sitting on the bench and I don\u2019t know why. It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus. That is how I am feeling. I think it is very clear that someone wanted me to get all of the blame,\" he said.",
      "\u201cHow I see it now is like you throw Mo under the bus because he is the problem in the team now. But I don\u2019t think I am the problem. I have done so much for this club. The respect, I want to get it. I don\u2019t have to go every day fighting for my position because I earned it. I am not bigger than anyone, but I earned my position. It\u2019s football. It is what it is.\u201d",
      "Imagine Tom Brady being benched by the New England Patriots. Would he be happy about it? Nope. Would he say something like this in public about it? Probably not.",
      "For a current NFL comparison, this would be similar to the Kansas Chiefs benching Patrick Mahomes because of their poor record this season. How would he react?",
      "That is why Salah\u2019s public comments have caused so much uproar. You keep things like this in-house. Now you\u2019ve created one heck of a mess and you\u2019re watching everyone scramble around you, at a time when reigning Premier League champions Liverpool are already scrambling and struggling for wins.",
      "Ahead of their game against Brighton this Saturday, Liverpool manager Arne Slot is noncommittal on whether Salah will be welcomed back into his squad. Slot, who looks genuinely hurt and disappointed with the situation, is one of the nice guys and has let Salah stew on his comments and put the ball in his court when it comes to reconciliation.",
      "Liverpool is unbeaten in the four games since Salah was benched and have genuinely improved their overall performance. Has Slot made the right call? Time will tell. But right now, he has the upper hand.",
      "Given Salah\u2019s truly unbelievable words to reporters, it seems likely he\u2019s played his last game for Liverpool. He will head to Morocco after Saturday\u2019s game as he will captain Egypt during the Africa Cup of Nations tournament. He\u2019s not scheduled to be back at Liverpool until after the January transfer window opens. The timing of Salah\u2019s meltdown is clearly significant. If he\u2019s going to stay on the bench, he wants out. In Salah\u2019s eyes, Liverpool have a month to figure it out.",
      "Most think we will never see Salah, who has been instrumental in Liverpool's return to glory and its winning two Premier League titles, a Champions League trophy and several other trophies over the last decade, in a Liverpool jersey again.",
      "It\u2019s sad. It\u2019s a shame. But even if nobody wants to admit it, it has been heading this way for a few months.",
      "Salah, 33, has been hammered by Liverpool club legends, fans and pretty much everyone else after his rant. Salah, the third-highest scorer in the club's famed history with 250 goals, was not meant to end his legendary Liverpool career this way. He was supposed to lead them to more titles and build on his wonderful 2024-25 season, as he put together one of the greatest campaigns the Premier League has ever seen.",
      "But his drop off this season, like Liverpool\u2019s as a team, has been stark. The reigning champs are languishing in the middle of the pack and have won just two of their last 10 games in the Premier League to all but end their hopes of back-to-back titles.",
      "That downturn has come amid a summer of huge spending on new superstars who have been slow to gel, the tragic death of forward Diogo Jota in July, which has hit Salah and his Liverpool teammates extremely hard, and the departure of long-time star Trent Alexander-Arnold.",
      "New superstars Alexander Isak, Hugo Ekitike and Florian Wirtz (who cost a combined $400 million this summer) played well together as a trio without Salah at Inter Milan in midweek, and Dominik Szoboszlai started in Salah\u2019s place on the right and is a more defensive, robust option. For Liverpool as a team, it\u2019s working right now, sans Salah.",
      "If Salah is to leave Liverpool in the coming weeks, will he even be allowed on the Anfield pitch against Brighton to say goodbye on Saturday? Will most of Liverpool\u2019s fans inside the hallowed ground greet him with warmth? Or will he be lambasted for the way he\u2019s aired Liverpool\u2019s dirty laundry in public? The bitter divide he\u2019s created was the last thing Liverpool needed as they continue to struggle on the pitch.",
      "Does Salah have a point with some of his rant? Maybe.",
      "He\u2019s been nowhere near his best \u2014 most would say that\u2019s been the case since he signed his huge new contract in April \u2014 but neither has the majority of Liverpool\u2019s players this season. But it\u2019s the fact that he sees himself as undroppable and a guaranteed starter no matter what that has upset Slot, Liverpool legends and fans the most.",
      "Even if you think you\u2019re irreplaceable, as all super-talented and driven athletes like Salah usually do, you can\u2019t say it out loud. Or you shouldn\u2019t.",
      "Salah probably deserves some extra leeway amid Liverpool\u2019s struggles. But with the team going through its biggest slump in a  decade, all eyes have been on Salah. And he wasn\u2019t performing. Even if he didn\u2019t think he was the main problem, now he is.",
      "The problem Salah has is that you can clearly make the argument that Liverpool looks like a better, more solid and balanced team since Slot dropped him. It is scoring goals and looking cohesive and fluid in attack. Hence, Salah\u2019s rant to remind everyone just how important and special he is and how he deserves more respect and shouldn\u2019t have to play by the same rules as everyone else. But he does. Even if he doesn\u2019t see eye-to-eye with the manager.",
      "\u201cI said many times before that I had a good relationship with the manager and all of a sudden, we don\u2019t have any relationship,\u201d Salah said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but it seems to me, how I see it, that someone doesn\u2019t want me in the club.\u201d",
      "Compared to his public outburst on his contract situation last November, the difference this time is that most Liverpool fans aren\u2019t on Salah\u2019s side. These comments were so strong that it has probably cost Salah a statue outside Anfield. Will this be remembered 25 years from now? Probably.",
      "But why now? Why did he decide to go all-in on the club and Slot?",
      "Because it\u2019s not only about Salah lashing out and making sure everyone knows he\u2019s not the problem at Liverpool. It\u2019s about him ending this on his terms. He knows he\u2019s heading away on international duty with Egypt for the next few weeks, at least, and he may be sold by the start of January.",
      "Salah wants to control the situation and, in his eyes, these comments have allowed him to do it. It also puts pressure on Slot, and Salah may think that by the time he returns in January, Slot may be fired if Liverpool\u2019s poor form in the league continues.",
      "But after saying what he did, Salah now doesn\u2019t control his Liverpool farewell. If he\u2019s not on the bench and in the matchday squad against Brighton on Saturday, then usually he would not be  permitted to be on the pitch around the game.",
      "\u201cI said to my family, come to the Brighton game \u2014 I don\u2019t know if I am going to play or not, but I am going to enjoy it,\u201d Salah said. \u201cIn my head, I\u2019m going to enjoy that game because I don\u2019t know what is going to happen now. I will be in Anfield to say goodbye to the fans and go to the Africa Cup. I don\u2019t know what is going to happen when I am there.\u201d",
      "Will Liverpool put Salah\u2019s comments aside to allow him to say an emotional goodbye to fans at Anfield this weekend? That would make the hierarchy and Slot look weak if the rift with Salah isn\u2019t resolved before Saturday.",
      "Salah\u2019s Liverpool career may have already ended the moment he opened his mouth in the mixed zone last weekend, and now he has to deal with the consequences.",
      "If this is it for Salah, it\u2019s a sad end to one of the greatest careers in Premier League history. Liverpool\u2019s Egyptian King looks set to step off his throne quietly and without any kind of adulation or grand send-off from Anfield."

      "Some social media users in the Netherlands said they couldn't stomach it, so McDonald's has withdrawn an advertisement  generated entirely by artificial intelligence.",
      "Entitled \u201cthe most terrible time of the year,\u201d the 45-second video was released on the fast-food giant's YouTube channel for the country Saturday.",
      "As a reworked version of the Andy Williams song \u201cIt\u2019s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year\u201d plays in the background, a series of mishaps befall people at Christmas.",
      "Presents are knocked off the top of a car by a low bridge, carol singers have their sheet music blown away and even Santa Claus' sled gets stuck in traffic.",
      "Other scenes show a man breaking bones as he slips while ice skating, a woman being dragged off by a tram after her coat gets caught in the door and a man hanging from his feet after he tried to put up Christmas lights on his house.",
      "Customers are then advised to escape the festive \u201cmadness\u201d and \u201chide out in McDonald\u2019s till January\u2019s here.\u201d",
      "The humorous take on the festive period did not go down well with some social media users, some of whom denounced the use of AI to create it.",
      "One X user, Ian Fisch, called it \u201cunsettling\u201d while another, Richard Roeper said that McDonald\u2019s succeeded if it was going for \u201ccreepy,\u201d \u201cpoorly edited\u201d and \u201cinauthentic\u201d content.",
      "Even setting aside the AI \u201cslop,\u201d the ad itself came across as \u201cso cynical and unfun,\u201d British voice actor Jon Cartwright wrote on X.",
      "\u201cRegardless of being made with AI, this is just a bad idea for a commercial,\" another X user, Bobby Stapleton, said in a post.  Most people enjoy Christmas and \u201cnobody wants negative vibes,\u201d he added.",
      "After hearing the feedback, McDonald\u2019s Netherlands said in an email to NBC News on Wednesday that it had removed the ad.",
      "While \"it was intended to reflect the stressful moments that can occur during the holidays in the Netherlands,\" the company recognizes \"that for many of our guests, the season is 'the most wonderful time of the year,'\" it said.",
      "The short film was created for McDonald's Netherlands by the U.S. production company The Sweetshop Films and the Dutch advertising agency TBWA/Neboko.",
      "Neither company responded immediately when NBC News reached out for comment Thursday.",
      "But Sweetshop Films CEO Melanie Bridge defended the use of AI in a LinkedIn post, the Agence France Presse news agency reported Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s never about replacing craft, it\u2019s about expanding the toolbox. The vision, the taste, the leadership... that will always be human,\u201d AFP quoted Bridge as saying in the post which has subsequently been deleted.",
      "\u201cAnd here\u2019s the part people don\u2019t see: the hours that went into this job far exceeded a traditional shoot. Ten people, five weeks, full-time.\u201d",
      "And some social media users expressed sympathy for the production team.",
      "\u201cThis is absolutely devastating for the AI artists who put their time and effort into creating this,\u201d wrote one X user, posting under the name Chris.",
      "\u201cYes, it was AI generated, but there were still real people behind it making creative decisions, refining prompts, and crafting the final piece,\u201d the user added.",
      "Others were quick to argue back with comments raising broader concerns of AI's impact on the creative job market.",
      "AI-generated content has become increasingly popular in advertising, with major corporations like Coca-Cola using the technology.",
      "After facing significant backlash last year, the soft drinks giant steered clear of showing AI humans close up. Instead computer generated polar bears, rabbits, and squirrels took center stage this year."

    "summary": "The Customs and Border Protection proposal would apply even to countries that don't require visas to enter.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration plans to require travelers from more than 40 countries to provide their social media histories from the last five years to enter the U.S., according to a notice published Tuesday in the Federal Register.",
      "The data would be \u201cmandatory\u201d for new entrants to the U.S., who hail from 42 countries that are part of the visa waiver program, according to the notice from Customs and Border Protection.",
      "Residents of the United Kingdom and Germany are among the countries from which visitors do not require visas to visit the U.S., which, according to the notice, could add an extra hurdle for travelers. British citizens and people of other waived countries currently can complete \u201cElectronic System for Travel Authorizations\u201d in lieu of obtaining visas.",
      "Providing social media histories would now be part of the requirements to complete the ESTA, according to the proposal.",
      "The Trump administration has increased restrictions on people entering the U.S., and President Donald Trump ran a campaign that focused on border and immigration crackdowns.",
      "In addition to social media histories, Customs and Border Protection would add other new data collection fields, including email addresses and telephone numbers used in the last five years, as well as the addresses and names of family members, the notice reads.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman said the proposal is not final, and it is not clear how applicants would be required to provide their social media.",
      "A spokesperson for CBP said in a statement Wednesday that the proposal \"is simply the first step in starting a discussion to have new policy options to keep the American people safe.\"",
      "\"The Department is constantly looking at how we vet those coming into the country, especially after the terrorist attack in Washington DC against our National Guard right before Thanksgiving,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "The U.S. public has 60 days to comment on the proposal, the Federal Register notice reads.",
      "The U.S. next year will host FIFA World Cup events, which are sure to draw fans from around the world, including from the U.K. and other countries where visitors do not require visas.",
      "A Trump administration official told NBC News that while World Cup ticket holders may be fast-tracked, they would still be subject to the same requirements as other travelers.",
      "\u201cThe FIFA PASS enables ticket holders in countries that have long wait times to get a priority appointment, but it does not change the visa application process whatsoever,\" the official said. \"We employ the same vetting process for everyone for national security purposes.\"",
      "In June, the State Department announced it was requiring people seeking certain types of visas to enter the U.S. to change their social media profiles to public.",
      "The Electronic Frontier Foundation, an advocacy group, called that move unprecedented and said the U.S. restriction was intended to \"surveil and suppress foreign students\u2019 social media activity.\"",
      "Last week the State Department announced that it would expand an \"online presence review\" to include H-1B applicants and their dependents.",
      "Since Trump returned to office in January, the State Department has also sought to revoke visas for people in the U.S. who have protested about the war in Gaza.",
      "The Trump administration has also announced plans to clamp down on various forms of legal immigration after an Afghan national was named as the suspect in the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., last month. The suspect has pleaded not guilty.",
      "CORRECTION (Dec. 10, 2025, 4:52 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated who would be affected by the administration\u2019s plan. Travelers from 42 countries would be affected, not all foreign visitors."
