    "story": [
      "Actor Daniel Dae Kim more than made the nominee list for the Tony Awards",
      "The first monologue Daniel Dae Kim ever performed was by David Henry Hwang.",
      "He had to do one for his college summer program at the National Theater Institute in Connecticut. Kim chose a scene from \u201cFOB,\" Hwang's play about the assimilation struggles of a Chinese American. So, it's fitting that 35 years later Hwang \u2014 the first Asian American to win the Tony Award for best play \u2014 would be the one to bring Kim into the Tony spotlight.",
      "Known for TV series such as \u201cLost\u201d and \u201cHawaii Five-0,\u201d Kim, 56, is the first Asian nominee in the category of best leading actor in a play in the Tonys\u2019 78-year history for his work in a Broadway revival of Hwang\u2019s \u201cYellow Face.\u201d",
      "\u201cI can imagine a lot of things, but I did not imagine this scenario with David,\u201d Kim said. \u201cThat I would be in a play with him, that we would both be nominated for Tony Awards and we would be able to call each other friends.\u201d",
      "In the semi-autobiographical show, which ran last fall at the Roundabout Theatre Company, Kim played a satirical version of Hwang. The show also scored nods for best play revival and best performance by a featured actor in a play for first-time nominee Francis Jue, an original 2007 cast member.",
      "You could not have scripted a better ending for a play that was written in response to the musical \u201cMiss Saigon\u201d casting white actors as Asian characters.",
      "Kim's performance was filmed in November and PBS will broadcast \u201cYellow Face\u201d on Friday. The Tonys, airing on CBS on June 8, also will put a spotlight on the play.",
      "This groundbreaking nomination seems like the perfect karmic reward for Kim, who has spent years advocating for greater Asian representation. At the pandemic's height, the Korean American actor was a constant media presence speaking out against anti-Asian hate. He also jump-started a campaign for veteran actor James Hong, then 91, to get a Hollywood star.",
      "He woke up to the news of his nomination after people were able to get around his phone's \u201cdo not disturb\u201d mode. His competition includes George Clooney and Cole Escola.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019d be a huge surprise if I won, but I will say that even getting the nomination is a win especially when you put it in the context of our community and what this means for Asian Americans,\u201d said Kim, whose previous Broadway credits include \u201cThe King and I.\u201d",
      "He admits it's surprising and \u201ca little sad\u201d that no other Asian actor has been in this category. There\u2019s still never been an Asian nominee for best lead actress in a play.",
      "\u201cOf course, the barrier we really want to break is to actually have someone win, and hopefully that happens sooner rather than later, whether it\u2019s me or not.\u201d",
      "Kim is one of seven Asian acting nominees this year. Only three acting trophy winners have been Asian. One was Lea Salonga for \u201cMiss Saigon\u201d and another was Ruthie Ann Miles for \u201cThe King and I.\u201d Coincidentally, the first was BD Wong for best featured actor in Hwang's Tony-winning play, \u201cM. Butterfly.\u201d Hwang takes special pride in helping actors break glass ceilings.",
      "\u201cI get to feel like, \u2018Oh, maybe I\u2019m actually able to make a difference\u2019 and change the culture in the way that my little-kid-self would have loved but would not have thought possible,\" said Hwang, who now has his fourth career Tony nomination. He was last nominated 22 years ago.",
      "For a long time, Hwang felt the only way to get a play with Asian characters made was to set it outside America because \"Broadway audiences are not interested in Asian Americans.\u201d",
      "Historically, productions with Asian ensembles have been musicals set in \u201cthe exotic lands of Asia,\u201d such as \u201cThe King and I,\" said Esther Kim Lee, a theater studies professor at Duke University and author of \u201cThe Theatre of David Henry Hwang.\" \u201cFlower Drum Song,\u201d set in San Francisco, was an exception but the songs and book were by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II. Hwang actually revised the book in 2002.",
      "\u201cIt's 2025. We finally see an actual Asian American play with an Asian American lead,\u201d Lee said. \u201cYou can have \u2018The King and I\u2019 and have great actors and they may get Tony Awards, but it\u2019s really not about Asian Americans. That this has happened with \u2018Yellow Face\u2019 is just incredible.\u201d",
      "The show's two-month run brought the Roundabout a 50% increase in first-time audience members \u2014 \u201ca powerful statement,\" Kim said.",
      "\u201cOne of the nicest compliments I would hear after the show when I would go to the stage door is, \u2018This is the first Broadway show I\u2019ve ever seen,\u2019\" Kim said. \u201cThat meant a lot to me because bringing Asian Americans into the theater is important and bringing younger people into the theater is important just for the health of theater in general.\u201d",
      "Besides discussing whitewash casting, \u201cYellow Face\u201d examines the pain of the main character's immigrant father. The role is based on Hwang's father's experience being wrongly accused of laundering money for China. With the current anti-immigrant and anti-DEI climate, the show's airing on PBS feels especially vital to Hwang.",
      "\u201cWhenever there\u2019s a conflict between America and any Asian country, Asian Americans are the first to get targeted,\u201d Hwang said.",
      "PBS is also where in 2020 the five-episode history docuseries \u201cAsian Americans\" aired for Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage Month. Kim was a narrator and remains \u201cunequivocally proud\" of the project.",
      "Five years after the rise of anti-Asian hate crimes, Kim sees \u201cYellow Face\u201d simply making it to Broadway as a victory.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to get preachy, but I will say that the goal with spotlighting and elevating people of color is not to threaten the establishment,\u201d Kim said. \u201cThe goal was really to say everyone can contribute to our society. Everyone can be a positive force for change.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Cannes Film Festival has barred French actor Th\u00e9o Navarro-Mussy from attending the premiere of the competition entry \u201cCase 137.\u201d",
      "CANNES, France -- The Cannes Film Festival barred French actor Th\u00e9o Navarro-Mussy from attending the premiere of the competition entry \u201cCase 137,\" in what's believed to be a first for the festival in the #MeToo era.",
      "Festival director Thierry Fremaux confirmed to the French magazine T\u00e9l\u00e9rama that Navarro-Mussy would not be allowed to attend the red carpet premiere of \u201cCase 137\" (\"Dossier 137\" in France) on Thursday night at Cannes. He has a supporting role in the film.",
      "T\u00e9l\u00e9rama reported that Navarro-Mussy was accused of rape by three former partners in 2018, 2019 and 2020. The case was dropped last month due to lack of evidence, but T\u00e9l\u00e9rama reported the three woman plan to appeal.",
      "\u201cIt is because there is an appeal, and therefore the investigation is still active, that the case is not suspended,\" Fremaux told the French magazine. \u201cWhen a legal decision becomes final, the situation changes.\u201d",
      "Representatives for Navarro-Mussy didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Representatives for the Cannes Film Festival referred inquires to Fremaux's comments to T\u00e9l\u00e9rama.",
      "Navarro-Mussy's attorney, Marion Pouzet-Gagliardi told T\u00e9l\u00e9rama: \u201cI have received no information indicating that any proceedings are ongoing. This proposed complaint with civil party status has, to my knowledge, not been legally filed.\"",
      "The decision marks a shift for the Cannes Film Festival, which has sometimes been criticized for welcoming men accused of sexual misconduct. But some say now that the festival is evolving as the #MeToo movement has made belated inroads into the French film industry.",
      "This year's Cannes opened hours after French actor Gerard Depardieu was found guilty of sexual assault and handed a 18-month suspended prison sentence. When asked about the Depardieu verdict, Juliette Binoche, Cannes jury president, said that \u201cthe festival is following this trend in social and political life.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe festival is in step with what\u2019s happening today,\u201d Binoche said. \u201c#MeToo took some time to gain strength. We reacted very strongly recently.\"",
      "On Thursday, the French production company of \u201cCase 137,\u201d Haut et Court, said it last week received a warning about the situation.",
      "\u201cEven though the allegations largely predate the production of the film, we agreed with the festival management that the person in question will not accompany the film to Cannes, out of respect for the plaintiffs and their right to be heard, while also respecting the presumption of innocence of the accused,\u201d the company said in a statement.",

      "South Korean artist BIBI has released her sophomore album \u201cEVE: ROMANCE,\u201d blending genre-defying sounds with philosophical themes",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean artist BIBI released her highly anticipated sophomore album \u201cEVE: ROMANCE\u201d on Wednesday, delivering a project that blends her signature genre-defying sound with philosophical twists.",
      "The singer, songwriter and actor, who moves fluidly between pop, R&B, hip-hop and electronic music, has built a reputation for her bold, unapologetic presence in an industry often defined by careful image management. Her latest album features 14 tracks, including six new songs alongside previously released hits like \u201cBam Yang Gang\u201d and \u201cDerre.\u201d",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press, BIBI explained the meaning behind the album\u2019s lead single \u201cApocalypse,\u201d which carries a more poetic Korean title meaning \u201cThe Apple Tree of the End Times.\u201d",
      "\u201cI thought, if there was the fruit of knowledge of good and evil at the beginning, then this would be the apple tree at the end of times,\u201d BIBI said.",
      "\u201cYou know that saying \u2014 when asked what you\u2019d do if the world ended tomorrow, some say they\u2019d plant an apple tree, others say they\u2019d have an orgy. ... But to me, they felt like the same thing. Both are, in essence, acts of planting seeds.\u201d",
      "Her interpretation, merging ideas of creation, pleasure, and existential finality, may come across as provocative in a conservative South Korean society where open discussions about sex remain rare and often taboo.",
      "\u201cIn reality, everything has an end, and what each person chooses to do in that moment is their own,\u201d she added. \u201cIt can\u2019t be labeled as good or bad. After all, isn\u2019t the very idea of good and evil ambiguous?\u201d",
      "One of Korea\u2019s fastest-rising stars with a growing international presence, BIBI reflected on the surprising success of \u201cBam Yang Gang.\u201d The song, which means a chestnut jelly snack in Korean, became a viral sensation in South Korea last year while she was too busy to notice.",
      "\u201cI was filming two dramas simultaneously, so I was really busy,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t really feel it at that time. Actually, I felt it more this year because people introduce me saying, \u2018Last year was the year of Bam Yang Gang.\u2018\u201d",
      "Despite her growing popularity, BIBI aspires to maintain an element of \u201cambiguity\u201d in her artistry.",
      "\u201cI want to be a mysterious artist. Like \u2018Gacha!\u2019 \u2014 that kind of feeling. Like you don\u2019t know what you\u2019ll get from a Gacha machine,\u201d she explained, referencing the Japanese toy vending machines known for their randomized collectibles.",
      "The album includes \u201cPygma girl,\u201d a track that reimagines the Greek myth of Pygmalion by reversing traditional muse-artist dynamics, suggesting the subject is the art itself rather than merely inspiring the creator.",
      "\u201cMidnight Cruise,\u201d another standout track, was written after she dreamt about her late grandfather before her Coachella performance in 2024.",
      "BIBI will kick off her first global tour in Seoul on May 16, before heading to the United States and Canada. She will then continue across Asia, with stops including Hong Kong and cities in Japan. The tour will conclude in Australia and New Zealand this October.",

      "One would think the job of making the NFL schedule has got somewhat easier the past couple years as the league has come up with more broadcast windows, including making Christmas Day a permanent fixture",
      "NBC Sports president Rick Cordella put it best when summarizing what the NFL's scheduling department goes through each year.",
      "\u201cI have five kids at home and you never satisfy them all. Just try and do your best, so I think it\u2019s a little bit of that,\u201d Cordella said Wednesday afternoon after he had a chance to look at the \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d slate for the upcoming season. \u201cThey have really, really hard jobs. I have no doubt. We\u2019re all campaigning. We\u2019re all leveraging. We all pay a lot of money for these rights and we all want the same thing.\u201d",
      "One would think the job has gotten somewhat easier the past couple years as the league has come up with more broadcast windows, including making Christmas Day a permanent fixture.",
      "The trade off though is that this is the third year under the league's broadcast deals that all of the games are up for bid for every network.",
      "CBS remains the primary home of the AFC, with the NFC on Fox, but if there is a great NFC matchup during a week when CBS has the doubleheader, that game will end up on CBS. That is the case in Week 1 with Detroit visiting Green Bay in the 4:25 p.m. EDT spot.",
      "Hans Schroeder, the NFL's executive vice president of media distribution, said this year's rotation of the NFC North facing the AFC North and NFC East created a lot of favorable matchups to divide among all the network's broadcast partners.",
      "\u201cWe love every schedule in May. Hopefully we love it in December too,\u201d said Schroeder, who is in his second year leading the league's scheduling team. \u201cWe have a lot of great matchups, and the flexibility of those new TV deals that every game could go into any widow, I think that's the key and to marry that with a team that is relentless in their effort, I think led to a fun and really great schedule.\u201d",
      "Even though the league announced the release date during the first round of the NFL Draft on April 24, the schedule wasn't totally finalized until Tuesday.",
      "Because some of the games started to be announced on Monday during network upfront presentations to advertisers, those matchups were locked in on Sunday night.",
      "The biggest final-minute decision with the early announced games came with the Fox Week 16 Saturday doubleheader on Dec. 20. The league knew it wanted Packers vs. Bears and Eagles vs. Commanders, but didn't finalize the home teams until Sunday night.",
      "If ever there was a year where the league could opt to move the Buffalo-Kansas City game from CBS to prime time, this was the one.",
      "However, the Week 9 matchup will again be on CBS and is the only 4:25 p.m. game on Nov. 2. Going into this season, Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen have faced each other nine times, including the playoffs. The first matchup in 2020 was on Fox with the rest being on CBS.",
      "\u201cTo be documenting the story of these franchises and star quarterbacks, we're thrilled to keep telling it,\u201d CBS Sports president and CEO David Berson said.",
      "CBS also got what could be the most-watched game during the regular season with Kansas City visiting Dallas on Thanksgiving Day. The most-watched Thanksgiving game was in 2022 when the New York Giants win over Dallas averaged 42.06 million on Fox.",
      "The Chiefs and Bills are both slated to have nine games on CBS.",
      "It is rare that a Super Bowl rematch airs on the network that carried the game, but Fox gets Kansas City visiting Philadelphia on Week 2 in the 4:25 p.m. EDT window.",
      "Getting the rematch satisfied a couple of requests that Fox made to the league. The network wants more variety in its late afternoon window, and is also getting more quality matchups when the top AFC teams play on their network.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to be so reliant on the Dallas Cowboys. I think we hear complaints sometimes that fans feel like it gets a little bit monotonous that our 4:25 window is dominated by one team,\u201d said Mike Mulvihill, Fox Sports president, insight and analytics. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly still going to have our share of Dallas games, but we\u2019re going to have some Philly in there too. We\u2019re also going to have Buffalo, Cincinnati, Kansas City, Detroit, Washington. I think it is pretty different than what you\u2019re used to seeing on Fox, and I think it\u2019s actually going to be a little bit better.\u201d",
      "NBC not only has the Kickoff game between Dallas and Philadelphia on Sept. 4, it has the matchup between the last two NFL MVPs when Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens visit Allen and Buffalo on Sept. 7 on \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d.",
      "ABC will have 13 \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d games \u2014 11 simulcasts with ESPN and two exclusive games. There will also be two MNF doubleheaders on Sept. 15 and Oct. 20. The Week 7 doubleheader will have the late game between Houston and Seattle streamed on ESPN+.",
      "\u201cThursday Night Football on Prime Video\u201d features all 14 playoff teams from last year as well as 10 divisional matchups. Prime Video concludes its regular-season slate with Denver at Kansas City on Christmas night. The Black Friday game between Chicago and Philadelphia will also include an NBA doubleheader afterward.",
      "Derek Carr's retirement did not have any impact on New Orleans' schedule. The Saints were already in a rebuilding mode under new coach Kellen Moore and join Cleveland and Tennessee as the only teams not slated to make a prime time appearance.",
      "Pittsburgh is already a national brand, so the waiting game on if Aaron Rodgers suits up in black and yellow or who will be Mike Tomlin's quarterback also didn't have much of a factor. The Steelers \u2014 along with AFC North rivals Baltimore and Cincinnati \u2014 have four prime time games.",
      "However, in case Rodgers decides to sign with Pittsburgh, his Week 1 opponent will be at the New York Jets and former Steelers quarterback Justin Fields.",

      "An athlete will aim to be the first person to swim around Martha's Vineyard to educate the public on sharks",
      "VINEYARD HAVEN, Mass. -- Lewis Pugh has followed an unspoken rule during his career as one of the world\u2019s most daring endurance swimmers: Don\u2019t talk about sharks. But he plans to break that this week on a swim around Martha\u2019s Vineyard, where \u201c Jaws\u201d was filmed 50 years ago.",
      "The British-South African was the first person to complete a long-distance swim in every ocean of the world \u2014 and has taken on extreme conditions everywhere from Mount Everest to the Arctic.",
      "\u201cOn this swim, it\u2019s very different: We\u2019re just talking about sharks all the time,\u201d joked Pugh, who will, as usual, wear no wetsuit.",
      "For his swim around Martha\u2019s Vineyard in 47-degree (8-degree Celsius) water he will wear just trunks, a cap and goggles.",
      "Pugh, 55, is undertaking the challenge because he wants to change public perception around the now at-risk animals \u2014 which he said were maligned by the blockbuster film as \u201cvillains, as cold-blooded killers.\u201d He will urge for more protection for sharks.",
      "On Thursday, beginning at the Edgartown Harbor Lighthouse, he will swim for three or four hours in the brutally cold surf, mark his progress and spend the rest of his waking hours on the Vineyard educating the public about sharks. Then, he'll get in the water and do it again \u2014 and again, for an estimated 12 days, or however long it takes him to complete the 62-mile (100-kilometer) swim.",
      "He begins the journey just after the New England Aquarium confirmed the first white shark sighting of the season, earlier this week off the coast of Nantucket.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to test me not only physically, but also mentally,\u201d he said, while scoping out wind conditions by the starting line. \u201cI mean every single day I\u2019m going to be speaking about sharks, sharks, sharks, sharks. Then, ultimately, I\u2019ve got to get in the water afterwards and do the swim. I suppose you can imagine what I\u2019ll be thinking about.\u201d",
      "Pugh said the swim will be among the most difficult he\u2019s undertaken, which says a lot for someone who has swum near glaciers and volcanoes, and among hippos, crocodiles and polar bears. No one has ever swum around the island of Martha's Vineyard before.",
      "But Pugh, who often swims to raise awareness for environmental causes \u2014 and was this year named the United Nations Patron of the Oceans \u2014 said no swim is without risk and that drastic measures are needed to get his message across: Around 274,000 sharks are killed globally each day \u2014 a rate of 100 million every year, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science.",
      "\u201cIt was a film about sharks attacking humans and for 50 years, we have been attacking sharks,\u201d he said of \u201cJaws.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s completely unsustainable. It\u2019s madness. We need to respect them.\u201d",
      "He emphasizes that the swim is not something nonprofessionals should attempt. He\u2019s accompanied by safety personnel in a boat and kayak and uses a \u201cShark Shield\u201d device that deters sharks using an electric field without harming them.",
      "Pugh remembers feeling fear as a 16-year-old watching \u201cJaws\u201d for the first time. Over decades of study and research, awe and respect have replaced his fear, as he realized the role they play in maintaining Earth\u2019s increasingly fragile ecosystems.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m more terrified of a world without sharks, or without predators,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cJaws\u201d is credited for creating Hollywood\u2019s blockbuster culture when it was released in summer 1975, becoming the highest grossing film up until that time and earning three Academy Awards. It would impact how many viewed the ocean for decades to come.",
      "Both director Steven Spielberg and author Peter Benchley have expressed regret over the impact of the film on viewers\u2019 perception of sharks. Both have since contributed to conservation efforts for animals, which have seen populations depleted due to factors like overfishing and climate change.",
      "Discovery Channel and the National Geographic Channel each year release programming about sharks to educate the public about the predator.",
      "Greg Skomal, marine fisheries biologist at Martha\u2019s Vineyard Fisheries within the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries, said many people tell him they still won't swim in the ocean because of the sheer terror caused by the film.",

      "But Skomal, who published a book challenging the film's inaccuracies, said \u201cJaws\u201d also inspired many people \u2014 including him \u2014 to study marine biology, leading to increased research, acceptance and respect for the creatures.",

      "Skomal said the biggest threat contributing to the decline of the shark population now is commercial fishing, which exploded in the late 1970s and is today driven by high demand for fins and meat used in food dishes, as well as the use of skin to make leather and oil and cartilage for cosmetics.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ve really moved away from this feeling, or the old adage that, \u2018The only good shark is a dead shark,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely morphing from fear to fascination, or perhaps a combination of both.\u201d",

      "DENVER -- An alligator that appeared in numerous TV shows and films over three decades, most notably the 1996 Adam Sandler comedy \u201cHappy Gilmore,\u201d has died at a gator farm in southern Colorado.",
      "Based on his growth rate and tooth loss, Morris the alligator was at least 80 years old when he died, the Colorado Gator Farm said in a Facebook post Sunday. He was nearly 11 feet (3.3 meters) long and weighed 640 pounds (290 kilograms).",
      "\"He started acting strange about a week ago. He wasn\u2019t lunging at us and wasn\u2019t taking food,\u201d Jay Young, the farm\u2019s owner and operator, said in a video as he tearfully stroked Morris' head in an animal enclosure.",
      "\u201cI know it's strange to people that we get so attached to an alligator, to all of our animals. ... He had a happy time here, and he died of old age,\" he said.",
      "Morris, who was found in the backyard of a Los Angeles home as an illegal pet, started his Hollywood career in 1975 and retired in 2006, when he was sent to the Colorado Gator Farm in the tiny town of Mosca. He appeared in several films, including \u201cInterview with the Vampire,\u201d \u201cDr. Dolittle 2\" and \u201cBlues Brothers 2000.\" He also appeared on \u201cCoach,\u201d \u201cNight Court\u201d and \u201cThe Tonight Show with Jay Leno\u201d featuring the late wildlife expert Steve Irwin.",
      "But his most famous role was in \u201cHappy Gilmore,\u201d a film about a failed and ill-tempered hockey player who discovers a talent for golf. The title character played by Sandler confronts Morris after hitting a golf ball that ends up in the gator's mouth.",
      "Sandler posted a tribute to Morris on Instagram on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cWe are all gonna miss you. You could be hard on directors, make-up artists, costumers \u2014 really anyone with arms or legs \u2014 but I know you did it for the ultimate good of the film,\" Sandler wrote. \"The day you wouldn\u2019t come out of your trailer unless we sent in 40 heads of lettuce taught me a powerful lesson: never compromise your art.\u201d",
      "The Colorado Gator Farm, which opened to the public in 1990, said it plans to preserve Morris' body.",
      "\u201cWe have decided to get Morris taxidermied so that he can continue to scare children for years to come. It\u2019s what he would have wanted,\" the farm posted on Facebook on Monday.",

      "A former model has reproached one of Harvey Weinstein\u2019s lawyers for suggesting that her sexual abuse allegations against the ex-studio boss are lies",
      "NEW YORK -- A former model reproached one of Harvey Weinstein \u2019s lawyers for suggesting that her sexual abuse allegations against the ex-studio boss are lies.",
      "\u201cYou should be ashamed of yourself,\u201d Kaja Sokola retorted. In her fifth and final day of testimony at Weinstein's sex crimes retrial, she maintained that she was telling the truth and that Weinstein's alleged conduct in her teens had changed the course of her life.",
      "\u201cIt changed the course of your life in that you got $3.5 million from false accusations?\u201d defense lawyer Mike Cibella pressed, referring to compensation she was awarded through civil proceedings in recent years.",
      "\u201cNo. That\u2019s very unfair,\" Sokola said softly. \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d",
      "During her days on the witness stand, she said Weinstein repeatedly offered to foster her acting ambitions but then made unwanted physical advances, beginning when she was 16 in 2002.",
      "Weinstein, 73, faces a sexual assault charge related solely to her allegation that he forced oral sex on her when she was 19. He also faces charges based on two other women's claims. He has pleaded not guilty to all the charges, and his attorneys assert that his accusers had consensual sexual encounters with the Oscar-winning producer because they wanted movie and TV work.",
      "Weinstein's lawyers grilled Sokola about her requests for career help from him after the alleged assault, her motives for her civil lawsuits and criminal trial testimony, as well as her personal struggles, and even a private journal she kept for an alcohol-abuse program in her native Poland.",
      "After apparently getting the decade-old writings via the witness' sister, the defense was allowed to bring up portions in which Sokola said two other men had sexually assaulted her over the years but didn't say the same about Weinstein. Instead, she wrote that he promised her help but didn't deliver.",
      "Sokola testified Wednesday that she had left out Weinstein's alleged sexual abuse partly because she couldn't come to terms with it at the time. Also, she said, her sponsor was in the film business in Poland and knew who Weinstein was.",
      "Cibella questioned that explanation, noting that the text mentioned only \u201cHarvey W\u201d and nothing about his profession. Sokola said her sponsor nonetheless knew his identity because they talked about it.",
      "Tearing up as she spoke, she said she hadn\u2019t seen the black notebook for 10 years, never gave anyone permission to share it and was stunned and appalled to be confronted with it in court.",
      "\u201cI felt very violated,\u201d said Sokola, now 39 and a psychotherapist.",
      "She was the second of Weinstein's accusers to testify at the retrial, and the only one who wasn't involved in his first trial in 2020. That proceeding led to a landmark #MeToo-era conviction that was subsequently overturned, setting up the retrial. Prosecutors decided to add Sokola's allegations to it.",
      "Another woman, Miriam Haley, already has told jurors at the retrial that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006. The third accuser, Jessica Mann, is expected to testify in the coming days or weeks. She alleges that Weinstein raped her in 2013.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name people who allege they have been sexually assaulted unless they give permission to be identified. Haley, Mann and Sokola have done so.",

      "The killings of the entertainment executive and his wife in their wealthy Beverly Hills neighborhood were brutal. Their son Lyle Menendez was the one who called 911, with the brothers initially claiming the killing was Mafia-related or connected to their father\u2019s business dealings.",
      "Lyle Menendez was attending Princeton University, and his younger brother Erik Menendez was a tennis star.",
      "The brothers were later arrested, charged and convicted for their parents\u2019 deaths.",
      "The brothers have argued that they committed the crimes in self-defense after years of abuse by their father.",

      "Here\u2019s what to know:",
      "Coming on the heels of the O.J. Simpson trial, the nation was hungry for true crime TV. The brothers\u2019 first trial was one of the first to be almost entirely televised on Court TV. It spawned documentaries, television specials and dramatizations.",
      "The Netflix drama \u201c Monsters: Lyle and Erik Menendez Story \u201d and the documentary \u201cThe Menendez Brothers,\u201d released in the fall of 2024, have been credited for bringing new attention to the case.",

      "\u201cYou did not deserve what I did to you, but you inspire me to do better,\u201d Erik Menendez said, addressing his family.",
      "Jesic issued his decision immediately after the brothers spoke, granting them a new sentence of 50 years to life.",
      "The brothers are immediately eligible for parole under California\u2019s youthful offender law because they committed the crime at ages 18 and 21, both under the age of 26.",
      "Parole suitability hearings are conducted by a state board to determine if a person should be released. An inmate will be scheduled for their first hearing no later than six months following their eligibility date, according to board policy.",
      "They already have a hearing before the board scheduled for June 13 in a clemency petition they\u2019ve submitted to Gov. Gavin Newsom. It\u2019s not yet clear if that will serve as their formal parole hearing or if a separate one will be scheduled.",
      "Newsom ordered the state parole board to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment for him to determine their danger to the public if released.",
      "Anne Bremner, a trial lawyer in Seattle, said the brothers will have some pressure on them to prepare for the parole board and impress upon them that they should be let out.",
      "\u201cMy guess is the parole board has been watching this and of course they\u2019ve done these risk assessments already,\u201d she said. They know \u201cwho these two are, what their alleged crimes were and what they\u2019ve done since the time that they were incarcerated until today.\u201d",
      "If they are denied at their first parole hearing, they will continue to receive subsequent hearings until they are granted release.",
      "If parole is granted, Newsom could still move to override the board. If he lets the parole decision stand, the brothers would be released from prison.",
      "In May 2023, the brothers\u2019 attorneys also filed a petition for habeas corpus to the court, asking for a new trial in light of new evidence of their sexual abuse. LA prosecutors have filed a motion opposing that petition, but its status is unclear.",

      "Authorities say a man who attacked rapper Tory Lanez in a California prison is an inmate serving a life sentence for second-degree murder who was previously convicted for an in-prison assault with a deadly weapon",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Authorities said Tuesday that a man who attacked rapper Tory Lanez in a California prison is an inmate serving a life sentence for second-degree murder who was previously convicted for an in-prison assault with a deadly weapon.",
      "Lanez was in fair condition a day after the attack in a housing unit at the California Correctional Institution in Tehachapi, where he\u2019s serving a 10-year sentence for shooting hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion in the feet, Pedro Calderon Michel, spokesman for the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, said in an email.",
      "Authorities did not specify how Lanez was attacked, but a message posted on the rapper\u2019s Instagram account Monday evening said Lanez was stabbed 14 times and both his lungs collapsed.",
      "Prison officials identified the alleged attacker as Santino Casio, 42. He has been put in restricted housing pending an investigation by the prison and the Kern County District Attorney\u2019s Office.",
      "Casio has been in the facility since 2004, after he was sentenced to life, with parole possible, for convictions of second-degree murder and first-degree attempted murder. In 2008, he was sentenced to six more years for assault by a prisoner with a deadly weapon, and in 2018 he was sentenced to two more years for possession and manufacture of a deadly weapon by a prisoner.",
      "An email seeking comment sent to an attorney who previously represented Casio was not immediately answered.",
      "The prison is about 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of Los Angeles in the mountains of the Mojave Desert and houses about 1,700 medium- and maximum-security inmates.",
      "In December 2022, Lanez was convicted of three felonies: assault with a semiautomatic firearm; having a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle and discharging a firearm with gross negligence.",
      "Megan, whose legal name is Megan Pete, testified during the trial that in July 2020, after they left a party at Kylie Jenner\u2019s Hollywood Hills home, Lanez fired the gun at the back of her feet and shouted for her to dance as she walked away from an SUV in which they had been riding.",
      "She had bullet fragments in both feet that had to be surgically removed. It wasn\u2019t until months after the incident that she publicly identified Lanez as the person who had fired the gun.",
      "A judge rejected a motion for a new trial from Lanez\u2019s lawyers, who are appealing his conviction. They had no immediate comment after the attack.",
      "Megan recently alleged that Lanez was harassing her from prison through surrogates, and in January a judge issued a protective order through 2030 ordering him to stop any such harassment or any other contact.",
      "The 32-year-old Canadian Lanez began releasing mixtapes in 2009 and saw a steady rise in popularity, moving on to major label albums, two of which reached the top 10 on Billboard\u2019s charts.",

      "CANNES, France -- One hundred years after Charlie Chaplin made dinner rolls dance and ate his shoe like it was a fine meal, \u201cThe Gold Rush\u201d has been vividly brought back to life in a new restoration that premiered Tuesday at the Cannes Film Festival.",
      "On the opening day of its 78th edition, Cannes debuted a 4K restoration of \u201cThe Gold Rush,\u201d one of Chaplin\u2019s most beloved silent masterpieces. The screening, held just before the festival\u2019s official opening ceremony, was part of a new day-one tradition for restored films, festival director Thierry Fremaux said before the screening at Cannes\u2019 Debussy Theatre.",
      "Years in the making, this \u201cGold Rush\u201d pristinely restores Chaplin\u2019s Tramp to all his downtrodden glory. The 1925 Alaskan frontier comedy may be marking its centenary, but it looks bracingly fresh in the restoration carried out by La Cineteca di Bologna.",
      "The restoration was more complicated than most because it included an extensive search for any missing footage. In 1942, Chaplin edited the film and re-released it with sound effects, music and narration. That version landed two Oscar nominations, but the restoration sought to get as close to the 1925 original as possible.",
      "In \u201cThe Gold Rush\u201d Chaplin's lone prospector ambles through the snowy Alaskan wilds in pursuit less of gold than some food and perhaps companionship. His antic, cliff-dangling struggles make up much of the film's deft slapstick, but the Little Tramp's humble, sweet hopes for romance greatly exceed his strike-it-rich ambitions.",
      "The film's premiere drew two grandchildren of Chaplin: Kiera Chaplin and Spencer Chaplin.",
      "\u201cWhat to say about \u2018The Gold Rush?' said Spencer Chaplin. \u201cIt was his biggest production to date. He built the set \u2014 it was almost like a tourist attraction in L.A. at the time. He built the mountains.\u201d",
      "The screening in Cannes drew a packed house in one of Cannes' largest theaters, a crowd that the Chaplin descendants warmly surveyed.",
      "\u201cOur grandfather would be really proud to see this, a hundred years later, to see all you here and interested in seeing the film,\u201d said Kiera Chaplin.",

      "A former model testifying in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s retrial on sexual assault charges is being questioned about a private journal she wrote a decade ago",
      "NEW YORK -- A former teen fashion model testifying in Harvey Weinstein \u2019s retrial on sexual assault charges was confronted on the stand Tuesday with a private journal where defense attorneys say she wrote about people who sexually abused her.",
      "As one of Weinstein\u2019s lawyers began to question her about the handwritten journal, Kaja Sokola protested that it shouldn\u2019t be discussed in open court as she\u2019d written it as part of a substance abuse treatment program years ago.",
      "\u201cThis is very inappropriate,\u201d she pleaded as the attorney began to cite portions of the text, which they say was originally written in Polish in 2015. \u201cPlease don\u2019t read that. This is my personal things. I\u2019m not on trial here.\u201d",
      "Judge Curtis Farber dismissed the jury for a lunch break as Sokola began to get emotional.",
      "He assured her later that he would allow the jury to hear limited questioning around the document. The judge also said he had concerns about the journal\u2019s completeness and authenticity, wondering how defense lawyers had obtained what appears to be private medical records.",
      "\u201cThis might backfire tremendously\u201d for the defense, Farber said at one point, as prosecutors also strongly opposed inclusion of the journal as evidence in the trial. \u201cThat\u2019s the risk they\u2019re willing to take.\u201d",
      "Sokola, who is now a 39-year-old psychotherapist, continued to push back. Her testimony was expected to resume Tuesday afternoon after a lunch break.",
      "\u201cThis is unethical,\u201d she insisted to the judge. \u201cI would never do this to my patient, and I would never do this to myself.\u201d",
      "Michael Cibella, one of Weinstein\u2019s lawyers, told Farber that the defense team intends to question Sokola on a part of the journal where she describes at least five sexual assaults she\u2019s suffered over her life.",
      "Weinstein, they say, is not among those she named, though he does appear elsewhere in the journal. They say she references her frustration and disappointment after a \u201cHarvey W\u201d had led her along, \u201cpromising me help\u201d but \u201cnothing came out of it.\u201d",
      "Sokola testified last week that Weinstein exploited her dreams of an acting career to subject her to unwanted sexual advances, starting days after they met in 2002, while she was a 16-year-old on a modeling trip to New York.",
      "Some of those allegations are beyond the legal time limit for criminal charges, but Weinstein faces a criminal sex act charge over Sokola\u2019s claim that he forced oral sex on her in 2006.",
      "Prosecutors added the charge to the landmark #MeToo case last year, after an appeals court overturned Weinstein\u2019s 2020 conviction. The guilty verdict pertained to allegations from two other women, who also have testified or are expected to testify at the retrial.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty and denies ever sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "His lawyers, in their cross-examination of Sokola that began Friday, have sought to raise doubts about her allegations, portraying her as a wannabe actor who tried to leverage her consensual relations with the former studio boss.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name people who allege they have been sexually assaulted, but Sokola has given her permission to be identified.",

      "A Gustav Mahler festival featuring all his symphonies and other major works is taking place at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam through May 18",
      "AMSTERDAM -- When Klaus M\u00e4kel\u00e4 climbed the Concertgebouw podium and turned to the audience at the orchestra\u2019s third Gustav Mahler Festival in 105 years, the conductor could see the writing on the wall.",
      "Facing him was \u201cMAHLER\u201d etched in gold on a cartouche and shining in a spotlight, centered in a permanent position of honor among the 17 composers enshrined across the balcony front. And sitting in the first row directly behind the sign Friday night was Marina Mahler, the composer\u2019s 81-year-old granddaughter.",
      "\u201cIt was just as it should be. I was terribly moved and excited at the same time,\u201d she said after the final note of Symphony No. 1. \u201cIt affected me in the deepest possible way.\u201d",
      "All 10 of Mahler's numbered symphonies are being presented in order along with his other major works from May 8-18, ending on the 114th anniversary of his death at age 50.",
      "\u201cThis is in a way the first orchestra that really trusted in Mahler,\u201d M\u00e4kela said.",
      "Joining the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra are the Budapest Festival Orchestra, NHK Symphony Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Berlin Philharmonic, with conducting split among M\u00e4kel\u00e4 (Symphonies 1 and 8), Iv\u00e1n Fischer (2 and 5), Fabio Luisi (3 and 4), Jaap van Zweden (6 and 7), Kirill Petrenko (9) and Sakari Oramo (10). Programs are simulcast to a 1,500-seat amphitheater in Amsterdam's Vondelpark.",
      "\u201cWe have a U.S. orchestra for the first time in this festival,\u201d said Simon Reinink, who headed the planning as general director of The Concertgebouw (the building, as opposed to the orchestra). \u201cWe also thought why shouldn\u2019t we invite an Asian orchestra?\u201d",
      "Mahler's first champion was Willem Mengelberg, who conducted the entirety of the first Mahler Festival in 1920 to celebrate his 25th anniversary as the Concertgebouw's chief conductor. A second festival was held in 1995 to mark the 75th anniversary of the first festival and a 100th anniversary celebration was planned for 2020 and canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "\u201cMahler is really in the DNA of the orchestra,\u201d said Dominik Winterling, managing director of Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. \"You feel it because we have a certain tradition, which is also passed on from generation to generation.\"",
      "Bruno Walter and Leonard Bernstein were Mahler's other primary proponents in the 20th century.",
      "\u201cMy father, who was a musician, always told me: `Mahler was a great conductor and a good composer with some problems. Usually the form is not perfect and it\u2019s formless,'\u201d Iv\u00e1n Fischer said of S\u00e1ndor Fischer, also a conductor.",
      "When Bernstein led the Vienna Philharmonic in all of Mahler's symphonies over a decade starting in the mid-1960s, there was resistance.",
      "\u201cIn intervals, in corridors, everywhere musicians talk to each other, there was this: `Yes, it\u2019s good music but a little kitsch. Well, why does he need these bombastic effects?'\" Iv\u00e1n Fischer recalled. \u201cReally the cult of Mahler, where everybody started to love it, came after this cycle of Bernstein in Vienna but it was a spirit of the time. I think what created the breakthrough was that you didn\u2019t feel that music had to comport to certain norms and so it was a little liberation of the '60s, the time of free love, Beatles.\"",
      "Mahler has gained acceptance. The Fifth Symphony's adagietto was conducted by Bernstein at Sen. Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s funeral and is featured in Luchino Visconti's 1971 film \u201cDeath in Venice\u201d and 2022's \u201cT\u00e1r.\u201d No. 2 sets a mood in a current Tony Award nominee, \u201cThe Picture of Dorian Gray.\u201d",
      "Though just 29, M\u00e4kel\u00e4 was a natural fit to lead off with the first symphony because he becomes both Concertgebouw chief conductor and CSO music director for the 2027-28 season. His exuberantly stepped down two dozen steps toward the podium to open his program with Anders Hillborg's \u201cHell Mountain,\u201d a world premiere commissioned for the festival that quotes two of Mahler's works.",
      "Van Zweden, who has a home a short walk from the Concertgebouw, was to open the canceled 2020 festival with the New York Philharmonic, when he was its music director. Van Zweden first heard Mahler When he was 6 or 7, van Zweden heard a fourth symphony led by Bernard Haitink, the Concertgebouw's chief conductor from 1961-88. A violinist in his youth, van Zweden became the orchestra's youngest concertmaster at age 19.",
      "\u201cThe scores of Mahler, what he gave us is a GPS system about the road of his life,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is such a human and we are such a witness of all the emotional roller-coasters and beauty and sadness and everything in his life during that performance. That is a different experience than a Tchaikovsky symphony.\u201d",
      "Luisi first heard Mahler when he attended a Fifth Symphony as a 15-year-old in Genoa, Italy.",
      "\u201cIt was overwhelming. I didn\u2019t know that this music could be so passionate and intense all the time \u2014 such a long symphony with a lot of different characters, different feelings, different moods,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI remember getting out of that concert shaking in pleasure and surprise.\u201d",
      "M\u00e4kel\u00e4 used a new edition of the score for No. 1 compiled by Michael Waterman, the fifth member of his family to play in the Concertgebouw in a lineage dating to 1950. With the help of his mom Cleora and friend Silvio Scambone, Waterman compiled markings going back to 1967. He now is working on editions of Nos. 5 and 9 based on notations dating to Mengelberg, who headed the orchestra from 1895-1945 before he was banned for his collaboration with Nazis.",
      "On Saturday, Fisher took a five-minute break between the first and second movements of No. 2, specified by Mahler but not often followed. In a hall famous for its precise acoustics, he drew breathtaking playing from horns that scampered on and off stage like NFL special teams.",
      "\u201cSo you hear these trumpets from heaven, everywhere, different directions,\u201d he said.",
      "M\u00e4kel\u00e4 is convinced Mahler has become more accessible in current times.",
      "\u201cIt speaks to the audience now because it\u2019s music that everyone can relate to,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s so personal, it somehow gives you a possibility to self-reflect.\u201d",

      "Before fans tune in for the annual song contest, they can enjoy Ncuti Gatwa\u2019s Doctor and Varada Sethu's Belinda Chandra attending the Interstellar Song Contest in an episode of the sci-fi series.",
      "In real life, the Eurovision Song Contest is an annual musical competition and TV event that sees 37 countries compete for a crystal microphone trophy over a four-hour live broadcast. In the interstellar version, aliens from 40 different worlds vie to win, also by singing.",
      "Davies says it took three years to pull it off the doubleheader because they had to work with the BBC to set the schedule and storylines in stone to ensure a perfect alignment.",
      "Britain\u2019s Sam Ryder took a \u201cSpace Man\u201d to Eurovision before, in 2022. Now, Gatwa will read out the U.K.\u2019s jury scores during the song contest's grand final, held this year in Basel, Switzerland.",
      "Talking to The Associated Press, Davies says that both Eurovision and \u201cDoctor Who\u201d share the DNA of old-fashioned Saturday night television, making the combination \u201cirresistible.\u201d",
      "This conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "DAVIES: I almost think every episode of \u201cDoctor Who\u201d is a great big celebration, sort of noise and color and spectacle, and that sums up Eurovision as well. In pitching this to Disney+ as well it\u2019s like, \u201cLook we\u2019re going out in 60 of your territories\u201d and Eurovision itself has a viewing figure that some years is bigger than the Super Bowl. There\u2019s not many shows that can say that on planet Earth.",
      "DAVIES: It\u2019s enormous fun. It could be said if you\u2019ve never seen a single Eurovision Song Contest in your life, you can still come along and watch this. It\u2019s the kind of thing we\u2019d have made up for a \u201cDoctor Who\u201d story anyway.",
      "One day I\u2019ll do that \u201cABBA Voyage\u201d story where the holograms come to life and start killing people. That\u2019s the best idea ever. We\u2019ve got to do that one then. Can you imagine? That would be just amazing. I think there might be some copyright problems with that but we\u2019d overcome them.",
      "The actual pitch for the story to Juno (Dawson), who wrote it, was Eurovision meets \u201cDie Hard.\u201d So as you will see, the moment it starts, there\u2019s trouble, someone\u2019s out to sabotage it. There are villains behind the scenes trying to disrupt the program. All chaos is let loose and the rest of the episode is spent saving people\u2019s lives after that.",
      "DAVIES: I think there\u2019s four songs in total (by Murray Gold). Obviously we don\u2019t get to all 40 planets with their songs, but it was a very big production. We had to hive this off into its own production unit. There are scenes in the television gallery, where 40 different monitors have output of 40 different screens. And that\u2019s all been fed in live. That\u2019s not done with green screen afterwards, that\u2019s all stuff they\u2019d already shot. Crowds, acts, rehearsals, backstage, presenters, all of that stuff, playing onto that set, so it\u2019s terribly complicated.",
      "DAVIES: Frankly, they\u2019re all expensive. It was a lot, yes. It had to be planned very far in advance, more than any. Once you plan something carefully, then it costs less just because you\u2019re not busking. We allocate each story more or less the same amount of money. So I think it ends up costing as much as the others, but it just looks so good because they had so much time to plan it.",
      "DAVIES: We never say that. I don\u2019t know why, but we just don\u2019t ever do it. I don\u2019t think they\u2019d tell me. I\u2019d faint.",
      "DAVIES: Yes, I will be. This will be a great night. I always sit and watch \u201cDoctor Who\u201d \u2014 I\u2019m old-fashioned \u2014 on its old-fashioned BBC One transmission at 7 o\u2019clock at night.",
      "I know people who have Eurovision parties, which I\u2019ve never gone to actually. Look at my life, it\u2019s devoted to television. I can\u2019t bear other people talking over it. That would just be a nightmare. So I will be sitting in. I\u2019ll get some nice dinner. I\u2019ll be a very happy man.",
      "DAVIES: I would like to go on a date with the man from Cyprus (Theo Evan). He\u2019s beautiful. I do like the U.K. entry this year (\u201cWhat the Hell Just Happened?\u201d by Remember Monday). I have a theory it\u2019s being underestimated in Great Britain. Just because we\u2019re so used to losing. We\u2019ve won five times, everyone. But this country gets a bit cynical about Eurovision sometimes. But I love our song. I think it\u2019s got a very memorable chorus.",

      "CANNES, France -- The 78th Cannes Film Festival got underway Tuesday, kicking off two weeks of French Riviera frenzy. Here are five things to look for at this year\u2019s Cannes:",
      "It might still be springtime, but, make no mistake, multiple Oscar campaigns will be launched in Cannes.",
      "Recent Cannes editions have produced several best-picture winners, including Bong Joon Ho\u2019s \u201cParasite\u201d and this year\u2019s winner, \u201cAnora\u201d by Sean Baker. The sway Cannes has on the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences has only grown in recent years as the academy has expanded its overseas membership \u2014 many of them European voters who closely follow the buzz in Cannes.",
      "At the Oscars in March, three Cannes entries \u2014 \u201cAnora,\u201d \u201cEmilia Perez\u201d and \u201cThe Substance\u201d \u2014 were among the 10 best-picture nominees. Less heralded movies can also emerge. The Latvian animated charmer \u201cFlow\u201d premiered last year in Cannes before its upset win at the Oscars.",
      "Before we get to the Academy Awards, though, Cannes will hand out its own prize, the Palme d\u2019Or.",
      "Deliberations by the jury (headed this year by Juliette Binoche ) are held entirely in private, so predicting the Palme is no easier than it was guessing the next pope. That doesn\u2019t stop bookies from handicapping the race and plenty of guesswork up and down the Croisette.",
      "This year\u2019s competition lineup features two previous Palme winners in Julia Ducournau (who returns with \u201cAlpha,\u201d her follow-up to \u201cTitane\u201d) and Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne (two-time winners, back this year with \u201cThe Young Mother\u2019s Home\u201d).",
      "Some of the movies that could be in the mix include Lynne Ramsay\u2019s \u201cDie, My Love,\u201d Jafar Panahi\u2019s \u201cA Simple Accident\u201d and Mascha Schilinksi\u2019s \u201cSound of Falling.\u201d Or it could be Chie Hayakawa\u2019s \u201cRenoir,\u201d Joachim Trier\u2019s \u201cSentimental Value\u201d or Ari Aster\u2019s \u201cEddington.\u201d Or it could be \u2026 well, you get the idea.",
      "Cannes has a power to burnish even the most established stars, and its red carpet will, for the next 10 days, host a nonstop parade of them. (And they will be clothed, as per Cannes\u2019 latest etiquette protocol.)",
      "Among those on tap are Tom Cruise with \u201cMission Impossible: Final Reckoning\u201d on Wednesday; Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d with Denzel Washington; Wes Anderson\u2019s \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d with a cast featuring Benicio Del Toro and Michael Cera; Ari Aster\u2019s \u201cEddington,\u201d with Joaquin Phoenix, Pedro Pascal and Emma Stone; and Oliver Hermanus\u2019 \u201cThe History of Sound,\u201d with Paul Mescal and Josh O\u2019Connor.",
      "O\u2019Connor also stars in Kelly Reichardt\u2019s \u201cThe Mastermind,\u201d scheduled as one of the festival\u2019s last premieres.",
      "Three stars are coming to Cannes with their first features behind the camera: Scarlett Johansson (\u201cEleanor the Great\u201d), Kristen Stewart (\u201cThe Chronology of Water\u201d) and Harris Dickinson (\u201cUrchin\u201d). All are premiering in the Cannes sidebar Un Certain Regard, which means they won\u2019t have quite the pressure of the competition lineup. But there\u2019s no calm or easygoing section of Cannes, and each could emerge from the festival either minted as a filmmaker or humbled by critics.",
      "While Cannes movie screens light up with films, deal making transpires along the Croisette. Cannes draws studios, producers and sales agents all on the hunt for acquisitions. But when U.S. President Donald Trump last week announced that he wants to enact tariffs on films made outside the U.S., it threw a giant wrench in the border-crossing dealmaking that Cannes specializes in. Yet with little detail on any possible tariffs and widespread doubt over its feasibility, the buying and selling of movies might not be slowed.",

      "It marked the first time Kardashian has confronted the men accused of tying her up at gunpoint in her hotel suite during Fashion Week and stealing more than $6 million in jewelry.",
      "Her appearance is the emotional peak of a trial that has gripped France and reignited global debates over celebrity, privacy, and digital-age exposure.",
      "THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP\u2019s earlier story follows below.",
      "Kim Kardashian has arrived at a Paris courthouse to testify against the men accused of robbing her at gunpoint in 2016, an event that reshaped her life and redefined celebrity security in the age of social media.",
      "This will be the first time she has faced the alleged assailants since that night, when she begged for her life as masked men bound her with zip ties and stole over $6 million in jewelry.",
      "Kardashian\u2019s appearance is expected to be the emotional centerpiece of a trial that has captivated France, where the suspects \u2014 mostly in their 60s and 70s \u2014 are nicknamed \u201cthe grandpa robbers.\u201d",
      "Authorities say the group tracked her via her Instagram posts. Two defendants have admitted being at the scene.",
      "Her lawyers say she is ready to confront those who attacked her, with dignity.",
      "Earlier, Kardashian 's childhood friend and then stylist told the court that she heard the celebrity beg for her life during the robbery that transformed the way the world viewed fame in the digital age.",
      "Simone Harouche, who was sharing their two-floor hotel suite during Fashion Week, said she heard a terrified Kardashian yelling: \u201c\u2018I have babies and I need to live.\u2019 That is what she kept on saying, \u2018Take everything. I need to live.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cI was scared that she was raped or violated. I thought the worst,\u201d Harouche said. Kardashian was \u201cscreaming with terror in her voice.\u201d",
      "One of the most recognizable figures on the planet, Kardashian is set to face 10 men accused of orchestrating the heist \u2014 a crime that shook the fashion world and redefined the risks of being visible, female and famous in the Instagram era.",
      "Harouche told the court the trauma \u201cforever\u201d changed her friend, whom she\u2019s known since age 12, robbing her of a basic human right: freedom.",
      "\u201cShe now has a completely different lifestyle,\u201d she said. \u201cIn terms of security, she can\u2019t go alone, she doesn\u2019t go alone to places anymore. To lose your sense of freedom ... it\u2019s horrible.\u201d",
      "Kardashian\u2019s testimony is expected to recount how the attackers demanded her ring and left her fearing she would never see her children again.",
      "David De Pas, the lead judge, asked Harouche whether Kardashian had made herself a target by posting images of herself with \u201cjewels of great value.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo,\u201d Harouche replied. \u201cJust because a woman wears jewelry, that doesn\u2019t make her a target. That\u2019s like saying that because a woman wears a short skirt that she deserves to be raped.\u201d",
      "Twelve suspects were originally charged. One has died. Another was excused due to illness. Most are in their 60s and 70s \u2014 nicknamed les papys braqueurs, or \u201cthe grandpa robbers\u201d \u2014 and authorities describe them as a seasoned and coordinated criminal gang.",
      "Two defendants have admitted being at the scene. The others deny involvement, and one claims he didn\u2019t know who Kardashian was. But police say the group tracked her via social media, where she had posted images of her jewelry, her hotel, and her schedule \u2014 exposing her vulnerability.",
      "The heist turned Kardashian into a cautionary tale of hyper-visibility. At the time, she was at the height of her influence \u2014 a style icon, social media pioneer and one of the most photographed women in the world.",
      "Fashion legend Karl Lagerfeld criticized her after the robbery, telling The Associated Press she was \u201ctoo public\u201d with her wealth. Yet, as details emerged in the days after the heist, public sentiment shifted. The image of Kardashian \u2014 alone, bound, and pleading for her life \u2014 reframed her in the public eye.",
      "In the aftermath, Kardashian pulled back from the spotlight. She developed severe anxiety and later described symptoms of agoraphobia.",
      "\u201cI hated to go out,\u201d she said in a 2021 interview. \u201cI didn\u2019t want anybody to know where I was \u2026 I just had such anxiety.\u201d",
      "Later, she acknowledged that constant sharing had made her vulnerable: \u201cPeople were watching,\u201d she said. \u201cThey knew what I had. They knew where I was.\u201d",
      "Harouche, who hid in a downstairs bathroom during the robbery, said she also suffered trauma. She sought counseling for post-traumatic stress and left the celebrity styling world to become an interior designer.",
      "\u201cThat experience was very stressful for me. It made me fearful of being around celebrities,\" she said.",
      "Harouche said she went to bed before the robbery. Kardashian entertained friends upstairs. Screams jolted Harouche from her sleep.",
      "From inside the locked bathroom, she texted Kardashian\u2019s sister Kourtney and Kardashian\u2019s bodyguard that \u201csomething is very wrong,\u201d Harouche testified.",
      "Later, after the robbers had gone, she said she heard Kardashian hopping down the stairs with her ankles still bound to find her.",
      "\u201cShe was beside herself,\u201d Harouche said. \u201cShe just was screaming.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A Paris court has found actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu guilty of sexually assaulting two women on a film set in 2021",
      "PARIS -- French movie star G\u00e9rard Depardieu on Tuesday was found guilty of sexually assaulting two women on the set of a movie in which he starred and was given an 18-month suspended prison sentence by a Paris court.",
      "He was also fined a total of 29,040 euros (around $32,350), and the court requested that he be registered in the national sex offender database.",
      "The 76-year-old actor was convicted of having groped a 54-year-old set dresser and a 34-year-old assistant during the filming of \u201cLes Volets Verts\u201d (\u201cThe Green Shutters\u201d) in 2021. The case was widely seen as a key post-#MeToo test of how French society and its film industry address allegations of sexual misconduct involving prominent figures.",
      "Depardieu, who has denied the accusations, didn't attend the hearing in Paris. Depardieu\u2019s lawyer said that his client would appeal the decision.",
      "\u201cIt is the victory of two women, but it is the victory of all the women beyond this trial,\u201d said Carine Durrieu Diebolt, the set dresser's lawyer. \u201cToday we hope to see the end of impunity for an artist in the world of cinema. I think that with this decision we can no longer say that he is not a sexual abuser. And today, as the Cannes Film Festival opens, I\u2019d like the film world to spare a thought for G\u00e9rard Depardieu\u2019s victims.\"",
      "Depardieu\u2019s long and storied career \u2014 he told the court that he\u2019s made more than 250 films \u2014 has turned him into a French movie giant. He was Oscar-nominated in 1991 for his performance as the swordsman and poet Cyrano de Bergerac.",
      "In recent years, the actor has been accused publicly or in formal complaints of misconduct by more than 20 women, but so far only the sexual assault case has proceeded to court. Some other cases were dropped because of a lack of evidence or the statute of limitations.",
      "During the four-day trial in March, Depardieu rejected the accusations, saying he\u2019s \u201cnot like that.\u201d He acknowledged that he had used vulgar and sexualized language on the film set and that he grabbed the set dresser's hips during an argument, but denied that his behavior was sexual.",
      "The court, composed of a panel of three judges, concluded that Depardieu\u2019s explanations in court were \u201cunpersuasive\u201d and \u201cnot credible\" and stressed both accusers' \u201cconstant, reiterated and substantiated declarations.\u201d",
      "The court also said that both plaintiffs have been faced with an \u201caggressive\u201d defense strategy \u201cbased on comments meant to offend them.\u201d The judges therefore considered that Depardieu\u2019s lawyer comments in court aggravated the harm to the accusers and justified higher fines.",
      "Depardieu\u2019s lawyer, J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous, regretted that the court \u201cconsidered that questioning the accusations is an additional assault ... which means that now the defense, even in this type of trial, is no longer accepted.\"",
      "The set dresser described the alleged assault, saying the actor pincered her between his legs as she squeezed past him in a narrow corridor.",
      "She said he grabbed her hips then started \u201cpalpating\u201d her behind and \u201cin front, around.\u201d She ran her hands near her buttocks, hips and pubic area to show what she allegedly experienced. She said he then grabbed her chest.",
      "The woman also testified that Depardieu used an obscene expression to ask her to touch his penis and suggested he wanted to rape her. She told the court that the actor\u2019s calm and cooperative attitude during the trial bore no resemblance to his behavior at work.",
      "The other plaintiff, an assistant, said that Depardieu groped her buttocks and her breasts during three separate incidents on the film set.",
      "The Associated Press doesn\u2019t identify by name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to be named. Neither woman has done so in this case, although one has agreed to be pictured.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very moved,\" one of the plaintiffs, the set dresser, told reporters after the verdict. \u201cI\u2019m very, very much satisfied with the decision, that\u2019s a victory for me, really, and a big progress, a step forward. I feel justice was made.\u201d",
      "Some figures in the French cinema world have expressed their support for Depardieu. Actors Vincent Perez and Fanny Ardant were among those who took seats on his side of the courtroom.",
      "French media reported last week that Depardieu was shooting a film directed by Ardant in the Azores archipelago, in Portugal.",
      "The actor may have to face other legal proceedings soon.",
      "In 2018, actor Charlotte Arnould accused him of raping her at his home. That case is still active, and in August 2024 prosecutors requested that it go to trial.",
      "For more than a half-century, Depardieu stood as a towering figure in French cinema, a titan known for his commanding physical presence, instinct, sensibility and remarkable versatility.",
      "A bon vivant who overcame a speech impediment and a turbulent youth, Depardieu rose to prominence in the 1970s and became one of France\u2019s most prolific and acclaimed actors, portraying a vast array of characters, from volatile outsiders to deeply introspective figures.",
      "In recent years, his behavior toward women has come under renewed scrutiny, including after a documentary showed him repeatedly making obscene remarks and gestures during a 2018 trip to North Korea.",

      "DiCaprio praised De Niro as \u201cthe archetype\u201d actor, while also praising the 81-year-old performer \u2014 a fierce critic of U.S. President Donald Trump \u2014 for \u201cfighting for our democracy.\u201d When the crowd rose to its feet for a lengthy ovation for De Niro, DiCaprio handed him the Palme. \u201cThanks, kiddo,\u201d said De Niro.",
      "After thanking the festival, De Niro quickly turned to speaking about Trump, who recently said he wants to enact a tariff on films made outside the country.",
      "\u201cArt is the truth. Art embraces diversity. And that's why art is a threat to the autocrats and the fascists of the world,\u201d said De Niro. \u201cAmerica's philistine president has had himself appointed head of one of America's premier cultural institutions. He has cut funding and support to the arts, humanities and education. And now he announced a 100% tariff on films made outside the United States. You can't put a price on connectivity.\u201d",
      "The opening ceremony, which preceded the premiere of Am\u00e9lie Bonnin\u2019s French romance \u201cLeave One Day,\u201d was attended by Tarantino, who emerged to grandly declare the festival open, and then promptly dropped the mic and walked off stage.

      "\u201cTruth is under assault,\u201d said Strong. \u201cSpecifically at this temple of film, the role of film is increasingly critical because it can combat those forces in the entropy of truth, and can communicate truths, individual truths, human truths, societal truths, and affirm and celebrate our shared humanity.\u201d",
      "Berry, responding to Cannes' new protocols on attire for the red carpet, said she had \u201can amazing dress\u201d with a long train for the opening ceremony but wore something else instead. Cannes has outlawed nudity and dresses with long trains for its evening premieres at the Palais.",

      "CANNES, France -- The Cannes Film Festival red carpet is perhaps the most rigidly controlled red carpet in the world. Now, the festival has added a new stipulation: no nudity.",
      "While nudity was never previously endorsed at the festival, Cannes updated its dress policy on the eve of its 78th edition to read that \u201cnudity is prohibited on the red carpet, as well as in any other area of the festival.\u201d",
      "While a no-shirt-no-service policy is standard in places far less glamorous than Cannes, the policy tweak sparked widespread attention Monday because of the recent trend of sheer and \u201cnude dresses, \u201d such as Bianca Censori's Grammys appearance.",
      "Asked for clarity on the policy, Cannes press officers said the festival \u201cmade explicit in its charter certain rules that have long been in effect.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe aim is not to regulate attire per se, but to prohibit full nudity on the red carpet, in accordance with the institutional framework of the event and French law,\u201d it said.",
      "Cannes also noted that \u201cvoluminous outfits, in particular those with a large train, that hinder the proper flow of traffic of guests and complicate seating in the theater are not permitted.\u201d",

      "Behind so many award-winning careers, high-profile productions, beloved institutions and in-depth research projects there is often a quieter story of early support from the government",
      "NEW YORK -- Poet Marie Howe, one of this year's winners of the Pulitzer Prize, says being a writer is often less a career than a vocation. You rely on teaching and other outside work and seek support from foundations or from a government agency, like the National Endowment for the Arts.",
      "\u201cEverybody applies for an NEA grant, year after after year, and if you get it, it's like wow \u2014 it's huge,\" says Howe, a Pulitzer winner for \u201cNew and Selected Poems\u201d and a former NEA creative writing fellow. \u201cIt's not just the money. It's also deep encouragement. I just felt so grateful. It made a big, big difference. It gives you courage. It says to you, \u2018Go on, keep doing it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Behind so many award-winning careers, high-profile productions, beloved institutions and in-depth research projects there is often a quieter story of early support from the government \u2014 the grants from the NEA or National Endowment for the Humanities that enable a writer to complete a book, a community theater to stage a play, a scholar to access archival documents or a museum to organize an exhibit.",
      "For decades, there has been a nationwide artistic and cultural infrastructure receiving bipartisan support, including through the first administration of Donald Trump.",
      "Now that is changing \u2014 and drastically.",
      "Since returning to office in January, the president has alleged that federal agencies and institutions such as the NEA, NEH, PBS, the Kennedy Center and the Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS) were advancing a \u201cwoke agenda\u201d that undermined traditional values.",
      "Trump has ousted leaders, cut or eliminated programs and dramatically shifted priorities: At the same time the NEH and NEA were forcing out staff members and canceling grants, they announced a multimillion-dollar initiative to support statues for Trump's proposed \"National Garden of American Heroes,\u201d from George Washington to Shirley Temple.",
      "\u201cAll future awards will, among other things, be merit-based, awarded to projects that do not promote extreme ideologies based upon race or gender, and that help to instill an understanding of the founding principles and ideals that make America an exceptional country,\" reads a statement on the NEH website.",
      "Individuals and organizations across the country, and across virtually every art form, now find themselves without money they had budgeted for or even spent, anticipating they would be reimbursed.",
      "Electric Literature, McSweeney's and n+1 are among dozens of literary publications that received notices their grants have been rescinded. Philadelphia's Rosenbach Museum & Library had to halt a project to create an online catalog after losing a near-$250,000 grant from the IMLS. The Stuttering Association for the Young, which manages a summer music camp, has a $35,000 gap.",
      "\u201cOur fundraising allows kids to attend our summer camp at a greatly reduced cost so the lost funds make it harder to fulfill that commitment,\" says the association's director, Russell Krumnow, who added that \u201cwe planned our programming and made decisions with those funds in mind.\u201d",
      "\u201cGovernment money ought to be consistent. It ought to be reliable,\u201d says Talia Corren, co-executive director of the New York-based Alliance of Resident Theatres, which assists hundreds of nonprofit theater companies. \u201cYou need to make decisions based on that money.\u201d",
      "The NEA, NEH and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting were among the institutions established 60 years ago, during the height of President Lyndon Johnson's \u201cGreat Society\u201d domestic programs. At various times, they have faced criticism for supporting provocative artists, such as photographer Robert Mapplethorpe in the 1980s. But they have endured, in part, because of their perceived economic benefits, distributed through as many congressional districts as possible.",
      "Arts advocates contend that, like other forms of federal aid, the importance of an NEA or NEH grant isn\u2019t just the initial money, but the \u201cripple\u201d or \u201cmutliplier\u201d effect. Government backing often carries the kind of prestige that makes a given organization more desirable to private donors.",
      "The millions of dollars channeled through state arts and humanities councils in turn support local projects. Funding for a theater production helps generate jobs for the cast and crew, brings in business for neighboring restaurants and bars and parking garages and spending money for the babysitter hired by parents having a night out.",
      "Actor Jane Alexander was just beginning her stage career when the endowment helped fund the 1967 Arena Stage production of Howard Sackler's drama about boxer Jack Johnson, \u201cThe Great White Hope,\" which starred Alexander and James Earl Jones and eventually won the Pulitzer Prize. Alexander, who headed the NEA in the 1990s, remembered how Arena co-founder Zelda Fichandler worried that the endowment might hurt business by supporting other theaters in Washington.",
      "\u201cAnd I remember my late husband (Robert Alexander) who was artistic director of the Living Stage Theatre Company at the time, saying to her, 'No, it doesn\u2019t work that way. A rising tide floats all boats,\" she says.",
      "In the short term, organizations are seeking donations from the general public and philanthropists are attempting to fill in fiscal holes. The Mellon Foundation recently announced an \u201cemergency\u201d $15 million fund for state humanities councils. At the Portland Playhouse in Oregon, artistic director Brian Weaver says that donors stepped in after the theater lost a $25,000 NEA grant just a day before they were to open a production of \u201cJoe Turner's Come and Gone,\u201d",
      "But Weaver and others say private fundraising alone isn't a long-term solution, if only because individuals incur \u201cdonor fatigue\u201d and philanthropists change their minds. Jane Alexander remembers when the Arena theater in Washington founded a repertory company, supported in part by the Rockefeller Foundation.",
      "\u201cIt was like the National Theatre in Britain,\" she says. '\"We felt so proud that we can have a repertory company of 30 players rotating players through the season. It was very, very exciting. And we had, you know, voice lessons, we had fencing lessons. We were going to become the great company. And guess what happened? Rockefeller\u2019s priorities changed.\u201d",

      "\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d made a meal of it. \u201cBattlestar Galactica\u201d tried to consider the effect on survivors of losing a planet of people. But it hasn't fit in the swashbuckling world of \u201cStar Wars.\u201d How could the mission to destroy the Death Star have quickly concluded if Princess Leia needed to mourn the loss of nearly all her loved ones on Alderaan?",
      "\u201cAndor\u201d changed all that. Coping with inner pain has been a theme throughout its two-season run, which comes to a close Tuesday when Disney+ releases a series-finale trilogy of episodes. It starts with its title character, who is left rootless by the deaths and destruction around him.",
      "\u201cEverything has been taken away from him since day one,\u201d Diego Luna, who plays Cassian Andor, said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd he has to understand that home is inside. That he can be home. That home can be there. And therefore there\u2019s a reason to fight.\"",
      "The three final episodes take Andor and the rest of the characters up to the events of \u201cRogue One,\u201d the 2016 film that spawned the streaming prequel series. Tony Gilroy, who wrote \u201cRogue One\u201d and is the show runner for \u201cAndor,\u201d has loved playing in the Star Wars galaxy, but he\u2019s made it clear his real mission is to tell universal stories of the effects of war, revolution and colonization on human (and occasionally non-human) souls.",
      "Nearly every character he\u2019s created is ravaged in one way or another, and even the lighthearted moments of the series are fraught with emotional pain. (Spoilers ahead for episodes 1-9 of Season 2.)",
      "When Andor goes undercover as a moussed-and-mulleted fashion designer named Varian Skye and makes small talk with a hotel staffer, he learns the man's family was killed in a notorious massacre by Grand Moff Tarkin, the imperial leader who would later order the destruction of Leia's world.",
      "And in a widely-memed moment of drunken techno dancing by senator and secret rebel Mon Mothma at her daughter's wedding, she is, as Genevieve O'Reilly who played her said, \"dancing to stop herself from screaming\" after tacitly agreeing to have an old friend murdered for the cause.",
      "No one on \u201cAndor\u201d undergoes more trauma than Bix Caleen, played by Adria Arjona. While still dealing with the fallout of being tortured by an imperial doctor in the first season, she is nearly raped early in the second and has been surrounded by death. Arjona said seeing the script was daunting.",
      "\u201cShe has to go from PTSD to sort of being addicted to droppers, which help her sleep and get over the nightmares, to then her last final decision,\u201d Arjona told the AP. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot. And reading it was incredibly scary.\u201d",
      "An utterly new for \u201cStar Wars\u201d set of scenes between Cassian and Bix explore both the explicit and subtle difficulties of intimate relationships amid trauma. Cassian must comfort Bix, but she doesn't want her pain to define her.",
      "The two try to take a trip to the neighborhood bodega, but even that is subsumed by his fear for her.",
      "Cassian and Bix also must deal with the difficulty of the lives they take for the cause.",
      "Han Solo never mourned the stormtroopers he blasted, but the \u201cAndor\u201d duo killed a young imperial soldier during a mission and it haunts the home life they\u2019re trying to build.",

      "Bix is among the major characters who won\u2019t go on to \u201cRogue One\u201d or other existing \u201cStar Wars\u201d stories. \u201cAndor\u201d lets her complete her emotional arc with a tear-jerking but well-earned set of scenes.",
      "\u201cThe last speech, I still haven\u2019t been able to watch it,\u201d she told the AP. \u201cI was a mess! It took me takes and takes of me absolutely just bawling through that scene until finally it gets to what I believe they used.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- One week into a new job, Lisa Grouette discovered something missing come Sunday night: the sinking feeling of dread she used to experience before going to work every Monday.",
      "Groutte spent 10 years at an insurance agency with a boss whom she alleges screamed at her, slammed his hands on the desk, insulted her appearance and punched things. He falsely accused her of taking money and threatened to withhold an employment recommendation if she quit, she says.",
      "Fearing she wouldn\u2019t land another job if she left the toxic workplace, she stayed. \u201cIt was this implied, \u2018You\u2019re stuck,'\" Grouette, 48, recalled.",
      "But eventually, she found a way out. When a full-time job opened up at a newspaper where she worked a part-time photography job, she resigned from the insurance agency. The new position paid $400 less per month, but Grouette reduced her expenses to make it work.",
      "\u201cYou can't put a price tag on it,\u201d she said. \"It was the best 400 bucks a month I've ever spent, worth every penny. I was a little tight at first, but it didn't matter because I was happy.\u201d",
      "As mental health awareness increases, so are conversations about about what constitutes unhealthy behavior and the kinds of treatment people will not \u2014 or should not \u2014 tolerate for a steady paycheck.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re developing language now around things like toxic workplaces,\u201d said Jennifer Tosti-Kharas, a professor of organizational behavior at Babson College in Massachusetts.",
      "Younger generations entering the workforce, including millennials and members of Generation Z, are less willing to endure bullying behavior from colleagues and managers, and better at establishing boundaries, she said.",
      "At the start of her own career, \u201cif I encountered toxicity in the workplace, I had more of a \u2018Suck it up\u2019 attitude,\" said Tosti-Kharas, who identifies as a member of Generation X. \u201cI don\u2019t think we were as vocal about taking care of our mental health as we should have been.\u201d",
      "Conflicts and difficult relationships may be inevitable in any work environment. But there's a difference between an occasional disagreement and persistent abuse.",
      "\u201cWhat makes something toxic: it\u2019s more pervasive, more consistent over time,\u201d Tosti-Kharas said. \u201cYou may have tried some things and it\u2019s not getting better. ... It\u2019s very deeply entrenched.\u201d",
      "Possible indications of an emotionally harmful workplace include a widespread lack of trust and fear of being shot down if you speak up, she said.",
      "Loud screamers aren't the only kind of toxic co-workers and supervisors. There are quieter forms of toxicity, such as passive-aggressive behavior by leaders who use sarcasm, backhanded compliments, indirect criticism and exclusion to control their employees, according to Alana Atchison, a clinical psychologist based in Chicago.",
      "\u201cIt is a relationship where you can\u2019t communicate clearly or directly, so you have to silence yourself. You can\u2019t say truly what you need to say and feel safe,\u201d Atchison said.",
      "To spot a potentially toxic environment when applying for a new job, follow your gut instincts and consider warning signs. For example, frequent ads for the same position may reflect high turnover resulting from a negative environment. You can also search employee reviews online.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m reading Glassdoor reviews like crazy to see what the environment is like, what the culture is like, on anyplace I\u2019m applying to, because I can\u2019t lose my hair again over a job,\u201d said Grouette, who recently was laid off after several successful years at the newspaper.",
      "When on the receiving end of toxicity, consider whether the offending behavior says more about the person perpetuating it than the recipient.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a smokescreen to hide their deficits,\u201d Atchison said. \u201cIf someone feels insecure about their role or fears being overshadowed, they might resort to undermining others, gossiping or sabotaging projects to regain a sense of control or safety.\u201d",
      "Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Atchison's clients have increasingly complained about toxic work environments. She attributes that in part to the social isolation that accompanied lockdowns and restrictions on public activities.",
      "\u201cSocializing is a skill set, and that skill set has declined,\" she said.",
      "If you find yourself in a toxic work situation, talking about it with a trusted friend or professional therapist can help you process what is happening and develop a plan to deal with it, instead of letting it fester in your mind.",
      "Stephanie Strausser, 42, a video production manager, said she sought support from friends and family members when she worked under an extreme micromanager who made her feel unsafe and whose decisions she considered unethical.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t hide it or keep it in. Talk to people. Even if you\u2019re talking to ChatGPT,\" Strausser advises those who find themselves in similar circumstances. \"Don\u2019t internalize it. And don\u2019t take someone\u2019s perception as fact.\u201d",
      "Amanda Szmuc, a Philadelphia lawyer who considers some of her past work environments to have been toxic, recommends documenting your concerns in case it becomes necessary to escalate them.",
      "Writing down the details of troubling interactions as they happen and keeping copies of inappropriate messages or approved meeting recordings may come in handy if the human resources department gets involved, for example.",
      "Maintaining a record may also help you avoid gaslighting and reinforce your determination to protect yourself.",
      "If leaving a toxic environment isn't financially possible or you want to try to make your circumstances more bearable, think about exploring ways to limit your interaction with the difficult party may be an option.",
      "Possibilities may include negotiating a role that puts distance between you and the toxic person, such as working different shifts or on different projects, Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "You can also set deadlines for yourself to keep things from deteriorating, according to Szmuc. Examples: \u201cI\u2019m going to give this two weeks. Is there any improvement?\u201d she said. \u201cIs there a way internally where I can maybe change my circumstances or get someone else\u2019s opinion?\u201d",
      "Ideally, an employee who feels mistreated could appeal to someone from human resources or the offending employee's manager with evidence to show a pattern of conduct violations and disciplinary action would be taken, Tosti-Kharas said.",

      "Missouri lawmakers have approved a referendum seeking to repeal an abortion-rights amendment passed by voters six months ago",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- Six months after Missouri voters approved an abortion-rights amendment, Republican state lawmakers on Wednesday approved a new referendum that would seek the amendment's repeal and instead ban most abortions with exceptions for rape an incest.",
      "The newly proposed constitutional amendment would go back to voters in November 2026, or sooner, if Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe calls a special election before then.",
      "Republican senators used a series of rare procedural moves to cut off discussion by opposing Democrats before passing the proposed abortion-rights revision by a 21-11 vote. The measure passed the Republican-led House last month.",
      "Immediately after the vote, protestors erupted with chants of \u201cStop the ban!\u201d and were ushered out of the Senate chamber.",
      "The Senate then blocked further Democratic debate and gave final approval to a separate measure repealing provisions of a voter-approved law guaranteeing paid sick leave for workers and cost-of-living increases to the minimum wage. That measure does not go back to the ballot. It will instead become law when signed by Kehoe, who has expressed his support for it.",
      "After taking the sweeping votes, the Senate effectively ended its annual legislative session \u2014 two days ahead of a constitutional deadline to wrap up work.",
      "Democrats were outraged by the legislative actions and vowed to retaliate by slowing down any Senate work next year.",
      "\u201cOur rights are under attack,\u201d Democratic state Sen. Brian Williams said during debate. He accused Republicans of \u201ctrying to overturn the will of the voters.\u201d",
      "Republicans contend they are simply giving voters a second chance on abortion \u2014 and are confident they will change their minds because of the new rape and incest exceptions.",
      "\u201cAbortion is the greatest tragedy in the world right now,\u201d Republican state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman said while explaining her efforts to repeal the abortion-rights amendment. If someone's fine with \u201ctaking the life of an innocent, then probably you can justify whatever you want.\u201d",
      "Some GOP lawmakers said they needed to repeal the paid sick leave requirement, which kicked in May 1, because it's adding costs that threaten the financial viability of small businesses. Republicans had been negotiating with Democrats over an alternative to exempt only the smallest businesses before scrapping that and opting for the full repeal.",
      "Missouri lawmakers have a history of altering voter-approved policies. They previously tried to block funding for a voter-approved Medicaid expansion and authored changes to voter-approved measures regulating dog breeders and legislative redistricting.",
      "Missouri's abortion policies have swung dramatically in recent years.",
      "When the U.S. Supreme Court ended a nationwide right to abortion by overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022, it triggered a Missouri law to take effect banning most abortions. But abortion-rights activists gathered initiative petition signatures to reverse that.",
      "Last November, Missouri voters narrowly approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing a right to abortion until fetal viability, generally considered sometime past 21 weeks of pregnancy. The amendment also allows later abortions to protect the life or health of pregnant women and creates a \u201cfundamental right to reproductive freedom\u201d that includes birth control, prenatal and postpartum care and \u201crespectful birthing conditions.\u201d",
      "A limited number of surgical abortions have since occurred in Missouri, but medication abortions remain on hold while Planned Parenthood wrangles with the state over abortion regulations.",
      "The new measure seeks to repeal the abortion-rights amendment and instead allow abortions only for a medical emergency or fetal anomaly, or in cases of rape or incest up to 12 weeks of pregnancy. It also would prohibit gender transition surgeries, hormone treatments and puberty blockers for minors, which already are barred under state law.",
      "Polling indicates \u201cthat most voters are opposed to most abortions in Missouri but do want to allow for abortions with limited exceptions,\u201d said Sam Lee, director of Campaign Life Missouri.",
      "The ballot title that voters will see doesn't explicitly mention repealing Amendment 3. Instead, it says the new measure would \u201censure women's safety during abortions, ensure parental consent for minors\" and \u201callow abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest.\u201d It also states that it will \u201cprotect children from gender transition,\u201d among other provisions.",
      "Democratic state Sen. Tracy McCreery called the measure \u201can attempt to mislead and lie to the voters,\u201d echoing similar accusations that Republicans had made against the original Amendment 3.",
      "An abortion-rights coalition that includes Planned Parenthood affiliates, the American Civil Liberties Union and others planned a rally Thursday at the Missouri Capitol and vowed a vigorous campaign against the measure.",
      "\u201cAbortion rights won in this state six months ago, and mark my words: Missourians will protect reproductive freedom again,\u201d said Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains Votes.",

    "story": [
      "The Environmental Protection Agency says it will roll back limits on several types of what are known as forever chemicals in drinking water",
      "On Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to weaken limits on some harmful \u201cforever chemicals\u201d in drinking water roughly a year after the Biden administration finalized the first-ever national standards.",
      "The Biden administration said last year the rules could reduce PFAS exposure for millions of people. It was part of a broader push by officials then to address drinking water quality by writing rules to require the removal of toxic lead pipes and, after years of activist concern, address the threat of forever chemicals.",
      "President Donald Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks.",
      "Now, we know the EPA plans to rescind limits for certain PFAS and lengthen deadlines for two of the most common types. Here are some of the essential things to know about PFAS chemicals and what the EPA decided to do:",
      "PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the nation\u2019s air, water and soil.",
      "They were manufactured by companies such as 3M, Chemours and others because they were incredibly useful. They helped eggs slide across nonstick frying pans, ensured that firefighting foam suffocates flames and helped clothes withstand the rain and keep people dry.",
      "The chemicals resist breaking down, however, which means they stay around in the environment.",
      "Environmental activists say that PFAS manufacturers knew about the health harms of PFAS long before they were made public. The same attributes that make the chemicals so valuable \u2013 resistance to breakdown \u2013 make them hazardous to people.",
      "PFAS accumulates in the body, which is why the Biden administration set limits for two common types, often called PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion that are phased out of manufacturing but still present in the environment.",
      "There is a wide range of health harms now associated with exposure to certain PFAS. Cases of kidney disease, low-birth weight and high cholesterol in addition to certain cancers can be prevented by removing PFAS from water, according to the EPA.",
      "The guidance on PFOA and PFOS has changed dramatically in recent years as scientific understanding has advanced. The EPA in 2016, for example, said the combined amount of the two substances should not exceed 70 parts per trillion. The Biden administration later said no amount is safe.",
      "The EPA plans to scrap limits on three types of PFAS, some of which are less well known. They include GenX substances commonly found in North Carolina as well as substances called PFHxS and PFNA. There is also a limit on a mixture of PFAS, which the agency is also planning to rescind.",
      "It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for these types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration\u2019s limits. But most utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.",
      "For the two commonly found types, PFOA and PFOS, the EPA will keep the current limits in place but give utilities two more years \u2014 until 2031 \u2014 to meet them.",
      "Some environmental groups argue that the EPA can't legally weaken the regulations. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.",
      "\u201cThe law is very clear that the EPA can\u2019t repeal or weaken the drinking water standard,\u201d said Erik Olson, a senior strategist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "Environmental activists have generally slammed the EPA for not keeping the Biden-era rules in place, saying it will worsen public health.",
      "Industry had mixed reactions. The American Chemistry Council questioned the Biden administration's underlying science that supported the tight rules and said the Trump administration had considered the concerns about cost and the underlying science.",
      "\u201cHowever, EPA\u2019s actions only partially address this issue, and more is needed to prevent significant impacts on local communities and other unintended consequences,\u201d the industry group said.",
      "Leaders of two major utility industry groups, the American Water Works Association and Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, said they supported the EPA's decision to rescind a novel approach to limit a mix of chemicals. But they also said the changes do not substantially reduce the cost of the PFAS rule.",
      "Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.",
      "They did, however, get an extension.",
      "\u201cThis gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time. Some utilities are just finding out now where they stand,\u201d said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry communications firm.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy wanted an assurance from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. before he would vote to put him in charge of the nation's $1.7 trillion health department.",
      "Kennedy's history of promoting conspiracy theories or misspeaking about vaccines alarmed Cassidy, he said during a confirmation hearing earlier this year.",
      "So, the Louisiana senator asked: \"Can I trust that that is now in the past?\"",
      "Kennedy didn't give a direct answer that day. Now three months into the job, however, Kennedy's habit of casting doubts on vaccines has returned in interviews on television shows, public speeches and social media posts.",
      "Kennedy will make his first appearance as health secretary before Cassidy\u2019s powerful Senate health committee on Wednesday, when he's expected to face intense scrutiny about the thousands of job he's eliminated at the Department of Health and Human Services, the steep cuts he's made to vaccination campaigns and his response to a measles outbreak that\u2019s sickened 1,000 people.",
      "He will speak about the agency\u2019s budget request for the year, which includes a $500 million boost for his \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d initiative to promote nutrition and healthier lifestyles. The proposed budget also makes deep cuts, including to infectious disease prevention, maternal health and preschool programs.",
      "The secretary plans to \"share his vision on how HHS\u2019 transformation will improve health outcomes, eliminate redundancies to save the American taxpayer, and streamline operations to improve efficiency and service,\u201d HHS said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s supporters, meanwhile, have viewed his first three months in the job as a successful delivery of \u201cMAHA\u201d agenda items: He's pressured food companies to ditch artificial dyes, promised to study the cause of autism, vowed to reverse fluoride recommendations and earned buy-in from several Republican governors to ban soda from the food stamp program, for example.",
      "But many eyes and ears will be on Kennedy's dialogue with Cassidy, who extracted a number of guarantees from Kennedy about his approach to vaccines. Those included promises to keep the current childhood vaccination schedule, use the current vaccine monitoring system and not remove statements that say vaccines do not cause autism on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.",
      "\u201cI will watch carefully for any effort to wrongfully sow public fear about vaccines between confusing references of coincidences and anecdote,\u201d Cassidy said earlier this year, after voting in favor of Kennedy's nomination.",
      "Kennedy has since delivered a mixed message on vaccines that public health experts have said are hampering efforts to contain the measles outbreak. He's offered endorsements of vaccinations but continued to raise questions about their efficacy or safety. He's said the childhood vaccine schedule will be examined in a study of autism's causes. He\u2019s called the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine \u2014 a shot given to children to provide immunity from all three diseases \u2014 \u201cleaky,\u201d although it offers lifetime protection from the measles for most people. He's also said they cause deaths, although none has been documented among healthy people.",
      "At the agency, too, he's made moves that support the anti-vaccine movement. He hired a man who has published research that suggests vaccines cause developmental delays to oversee a study on autism. And he's terminated some research and public health funds dedicated to vaccines.",
      "Kennedy, who has rejected the anti-vaccine label, has regularly said that he is \u201cpro-safety\" and wants more research on vaccines, although decades of real-world use and research have concluded they safely prevent deadly diseases in children.",
      "\u201cHis longstanding advocacy has always focused on ensuring that vaccines, and other medical interventions, meet the highest standards of safety and are supported by gold-standard science,\u201d HHS said in a statement. \u201cAs he did during confirmation, Secretary Kennedy is prepared to address questions surrounding this topic.\u201d",

      "U.S. District Judge Irene Berger issued a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit filed against Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services by a coal miner who was diagnosed with a respiratory ailment commonly known as black lung disease.",
      "Nearly 200 workers at a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health facility in Morgantown were told last month that their jobs were being terminated as part of restructuring within Health and Human Services. Berger ordered that jobs be restored within NIOSH's respiratory health division in Morgantown, although her ruling didn't specify a number. The division is responsible for screening and reviewing medical exams to determine whether there is evidence that miners have developed black lung.",
      "Federal law mandates that regular health screenings be made available to coal miners. Those diagnosed with black lung also are given the option to transfer to other positions in a mine to protect them from continued dust exposure without a pay reduction.",
      "Berger said the defendants \u201clack the authority to unilaterally cancel\u201d the Coal Workers Health Surveillance Program within NIOSH. She ordered both the surveillance and job transfer programs to be restored, saying that \u201cthere be no pause, stoppage or gap in the protections and services\" mandated by the federal Mine Safety and Health Act.",
      "Poisonous silica dust has contributed to the premature deaths of thousands of mine workers from black lung disease. Plaintiff Harry Wiley, a West Virginia mine electrician who has worked in coal mines for 38 years, was diagnosed with early-stage black lung last November.",
      "Canceling the health surveillance program would \"cost lives,\u201d Berger wrote. \u201cRemaining in a dusty job may reduce the years in which Mr. Wiley can walk and breathe unassisted, in addition to hastening his death. It is difficult to imagine a clearer case of irreparable harm.\u201d",
      "The judge gave Kennedy 20 days to show the federal government is complying with her order.",
      "An email seeking comment from Health and Human Services wasn't immediately returned Tuesday night.",
      "Wiley's attorney, Sam Brown Petsonk, said the preliminary injunction \u201chad to happen, and the public, I think, understands the absolute necessity of this program. It cannot be hindered. It cannot be whittled away. It\u2019s essential because it saves the lives of some of he hardest-working people in this entire world.\u201d",

      "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore has signed a bill into law to make Maryland the first state to use money collected from a surcharge on insurance plans sold under the Affordable Care Act to pay for an abortion grant program",
      "ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- Maryland will become the first state to use money collected from a surcharge on insurance plans sold under the Affordable Care Act to fund a program to pay for abortions, regardless of a patient's insurance coverage, under a measure signed into law Tuesday by Democratic Gov. Wes Moore.",
      "The law will make about $25 million available when it takes effect July 1, because a $1 surcharge has been unused and growing over the last 15 years since the ACA took effect in 2010. It's estimated to make about $3 million available annually in future years.",
      "\u201cThe lieutenant governor and I were very clear from Day 1 \u2014 that Maryland will always be a safe haven for abortion access,\u201d Moore said, highlighting the measure among SOME 170 bills signed at a ceremony.",
      "The program will be paid for through the transfer of certain insurance premium funds collected by carriers that can only be used for abortion coverage in accordance with the ACA. Supporters say other states have access to a similar surplus of funds through their state exchange insurance systems.",
      "\u201cIf programs like ours are duplicated across the country, we could help millions of Americans access essential abortion care \u2014 without relying on taxpayer dollars,\u201d said Del. Lesley Lopez, a Democrat from Maryland's Montgomery County, in the suburbs of the nation's capital.",
      "Officials in New York and Illinois already have reached out to Maryland officials to learn more about the program, said Lopez, who sponsored the bill.",
      "A dozen states require abortion coverage in ACA marketplace plans, according to KFF, a nonprofit that researches health care issues. They are California, Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.",
      "\u201cThis money exists in every state that has abortion as a required type of care under their state\u2019s benefit exchanges,\" Lopez said. \"It\u2019s basically all the blue states that mandated abortion be covered when the Affordable Care Act was starting to be implemented.\u201d",
      "The law creates a grant program fund in the state's health department to improve access to abortion clinical services. It requires the department to award grants to nonprofit organizations to support equitable access.",
      "Lynn McCann-Yeh, co-executive director of the Baltimore Abortion Fund, which helps pay costs associated with abortion for people who live in Maryland or who travel there, said it\u2019s hard to keep up with an annual budget of about $2 million.",
      "\u201cWe would need many, many more times over that to fully be able to meet the full logistic and medical support for each caller,\u201d she said.",
      "She said the $3 million that would be made available annually under the new law could make a major difference. The fund could apply to administer a share of that money.",
      "\u201cThe $3 million is a great start, but it will take more than that and it will take sustained funding,\u201d she said.",
      "Maryland's legislature is controlled by Democrats, who hold a 2-1 advantage over Republicans in voter registration statewide. Last year, Maryland voters approved a constitutional amendment with 76% support to enshrine abortion rights in the state's constitution, in response to the 2022 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. The court's decision in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization gave control over abortion to the states.",
      "\u201cI think before the Dobbs decision, there just wasn\u2019t quite the same type of urgency as there is now,\" Lopez said. \"We\u2019ve seen abortion bans in some form or another in double digits in states across the country, so we\u2019ve got to make sure that we shore up all the support we can in a state like Maryland that has it as a constitutionally protected right.\u201d",
      "Twelve states currently enforce abortion bans with limited exceptions at all stages of pregnancy. Four more have bans that kick in after about six weeks, which is before many women know they\u2019re pregnant.",
      "The Dobb decision and an influx of people from other states seeking abortions in Maryland has made the financial need more urgent, supporters of the law say.",
      "Maryland has been seeing an increase in patients from other states where abortion has been banned. Last year, 15% of abortions in Maryland were obtained by patients from other states, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights. That's a decrease from 20% in 2023.",

      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. health regulators announced plans Tuesday to phase out fluoride-containing supplements sometimes used to strengthen children\u2019s teeth, opening a new front in Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s effort against a mainstay of dental care.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration said it will conduct a scientific review of the products by late October with the aim of removing them from the market. It was not immediately clear whether the agency planned to formally ban the supplements or simply request that companies withdraw them.",
      "The products targeted by the FDA are sometimes recommended for children and teens who are at increased risk of tooth decay or cavities because of low fluoride in their local drinking water. They usually require a prescription from a pediatrician or dentist. Fluoride-based tablets and lozenges are designed to be chewed or swallowed. Companies also sell drops for babies and infants.",
      "FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the products pose a risk when swallowed by children because they may interfere with healthy gut bacteria that are critical to digestion, immunity and other key bodily functions. He also referenced studies showing possible associations between excess fluoride intake and other problems, including decreased IQ.",
      "Previous reviews by public health experts and dental professionals have not shown any serious health risks with the products.",
      "As state and local governments begin removing fluoride from their water, the need for supplemental fluoride is expected to grow.",
      "Officials in Utah \u2014 the first U.S. state to ban fluoride from drinking water \u2014 recently made fluoride supplements available without a prescription.",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 1962, the agency set guidelines for how much should be added to water.",
      "Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer, has called fluoride a \u201cdangerous neurotoxin\u201d tied to a range of health dangers. Last month, he announced a task force to scrutinize fluoride's use, while at the same time saying he would order the CDC to stop recommending it.",
      "A report last year by the federal government\u2019s National Toxicology Program concluded that drinking water with more than twice the CDC\u2019s recommended level was associated with lower IQs in kids. The study was based on research conducted in Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan and Mexico.",
      "\u201cEnding the use of ingestible fluoride is long overdue,\u201d Kennedy said in a statement Tuesday. \"This decision brings us one step closer to delivering on President Trump\u2019s promise to Make America Healthy Again.\u201d",
      "An influential government health panel recommends fluoride supplements for children between the ages of six months and 5 years if they live in areas with low fluoridation levels. The U.S. Preventative Services Task Forces judged the recommendation to have \u201chigh certainty\u201d of benefit, based on the available evidence.",
      "A 2010 paper from the American Dental Association recommended supplemental fluoride for children up to 16 years old who are at high risk of cavities. The recommendation was based on a review of studies across different age groups. The most common side effect associated with the products is spotting or discoloration of the teeth, caused by extra fluoride.",
      "The FDA regulates most dental products, including fluoride-containing toothpastes, supplements, mouthwashes and rinses.",
      "In recent weeks those products have increasingly been targeted with lawsuits and legal actions.",
      "Last week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced an investigation into the marketing of fluoride toothpastes by Colgate-Palmolive and Proctor and Gamble. A press release from his office described the companies' promotions as \u201cmisleading, deceptive and dangerous.\u201d",

      "California\u2019s governor once again called upon the state\u2019s cities and counties to ban homeless encampments",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- California's governor called upon the state's cities and counties to ban homeless encampments this week, even providing blueprint legislation for dismantling the tents lining streets, parks and waterways throughout much of the state.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, made homelessness a priority of his administration when he took office in 2019. It had previously been an issue primarily for mayors and other local officials, but Newsom pumped money into converting old motels into housing and launched other initiatives to tackle the issue.",
      "Still, he has repeatedly called out cities and counties to do their part, and on Monday, he unveiled draft language that can be adopted by local governments to remove encampments. Here is what to know:",
      "Newsom\u2019s model ordinance includes prohibitions on \u201cpersistent camping\u201d in one location and encampments blocking sidewalks and other public spaces. It asks cities and counties to provide notice and make every reasonable effort to identify and offer shelter before clearing an encampment.",
      "Organizations representing California's cities and counties balked at the suggestion that they are to blame for street conditions. They say they need dedicated, sustained funding over multiple years for permanent projects instead of sporadic, one-time funding.",
      "Carolyn Coleman, executive director and CEO of the League of California Cities, said that eight in 10 cities have policies to address encampments but they need money to address the root causes of homelessness, such as more housing.",
      "The California State Association of Counties said the state has not provided as much money to address homelessness as it says it has and that half of the money has gone to housing developers.",
      "Studies have shown that encampment bans and other punitive measures make it even harder for people to find stable housing and work, said Alex Visotzky with the National Alliance to End Homelessness.",
      "People may lose critical documents or lose contact with a trusted case manager, forcing them to start all over again.",
      "In Los Angeles, Jay Joshua watches over a small encampment in which he also lives. He says encampments can be a safe space for those living there.",
      "Major cities with Democratic mayors have already started cracking down on encampments, saying they present a public health and safety hazard.",
      "In San Francisco, new mayor Daniel Lurie vowed to clean up city sidewalks. In San Jose, Mayor Matt Mahan has proposed arrests if a person refuses shelter three times.",
      "Newsom can't make cities and counties adopt an encampment ban.",
      "But the proposed encampment legislation was paired with an announcement of $3.3 billion in grant money for facilities to treat mental health and substance abuse disorders, suggesting that he could condition state funding on compliance.",
      "In 2022, he paused $1 billion in state money for local government, saying that their plans to reduce homelessness fell short of the acceptable.",

      "A listeria outbreak linked to ready-to-eat sandwiches and snacks has sickened at least 10 people in the U.S., and a producer is voluntarily recalling dozens of products sold to retail stores, hospitals, hotels, airports and airlines, federal officials said.",
      "The products were made by Fresh & Ready Foods LLC and were sold in Arizona, California, Nevada and Washington.",
      "Those who fell ill and were hospitalized were in California and Nevada. The outbreak has been simmering for many months: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said cases date to December 2023.",
      "Listeria poisoning is caused by a particularly resilient type of bacteria that can survive and grow even during refrigeration. About 1,600 people are infected with it \u2014 and 260 die \u2014 each year in the U.S., according to the CDC.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know:",
      "The voluntary recall covers more than 80 specific products distributed between April 18 and April 25. The products have \u201cUse By\u201d dates from April 22 to May 19.",

      "When the bacteria get into a food processing plant, they can be tough to eradicate.",
      "Foods contaminated with the bacteria can make people sick. Symptoms can be mild and include fever, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. More serious illness can include headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions.",
      "Listeria poisoning is tricky because symptoms can start quickly, within a few hours or days after eating contaminated food. But they also can take weeks or up to three months to show up.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to change the pricing model for some medications is facing fierce criticism from the pharmaceutical industry before he\u2019s even signed an executive order he says will lower the costs of drugs",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's plan to change the pricing model for some medications is already facing fierce criticism from the pharmaceutical industry before he's even signed the executive order set for Monday that, if implemented, could lower the cost of some drugs.",
      "Trump has promised that his plan \u2014 which is likely to tie the price of medications covered by Medicare and administered in a doctor\u2019s office to the lowest price paid by other countries \u2014 will significantly lower drug costs.",
      "\u201cI will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION\u2019S POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World,\u201d the Republican president posted on social media on Sunday, pledging to sign the order on Monday morning at the White House.",
      "But the nation's leading pharmaceutical lobby on Sunday pushed back, calling it a \u201cbad deal\u201d for American patients. Drugmakers have long argued that any threats to their profits could impact the research they do to develop new drugs.",
      "\u201cImporting foreign prices will cut billions of dollars from Medicare with no guarantee that it helps patients or improves their access to medicines,\u201d Stephen J. Ubl, the president and CEO of PhRMA, said in a statement. \u201cIt jeopardizes the hundreds of billions our member companies are planning to invest in America, making us more reliant on China for innovative medicines.\u201d",
      "Trump's so-called \u201cmost favored nation\u201d approach to Medicare drug pricing has been controversial since he first tried to implement it during his first term. He signed a similar executive order in the final weeks of his presidency, but a court order later blocked the rule from going into effect under President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "The pharmaceutical industry has argued that Trump\u2019s 2020 attempt would give foreign governments the \u201cupper hand\u201d in deciding the value of medicines in the U.S.",
      "It's likely that Trump's executive order Monday will only impact drugs covered by Medicare Part B, the insurance for doctor\u2019s office visits. Medicare beneficiaries are responsible for picking up some of the costs to get those medications during doctor\u2019s visits, and for traditional Medicare enrollees there is no annual out-of-pocket cap on what they pay.",
      "A report by the first Trump administration found that the U.S. spends twice as much as some other countries in covering those drugs. Medicare Part B drug spending topped $33 billion in 2021.",
      "Trump has played up the announcement, saying it will save taxpayers big money.",
      "\u201cOur Country will finally be treated fairly, and our citizens Healthcare Costs will be reduced by numbers never even thought of before,\u201d Trump added.",
      "But many Americans won't see the savings.",
      "Trump's proposal would likely only impact certain drugs covered by Medicare and given in an office \u2014 think infusions that treat cancer, and other injectables. But it could potentially bring billions of dollars in savings to the government \u2014 not necessarily the \u201cTRILLIONS OF DOLLARS\u201d Trump boasted about in his post.",
      "Medicare provides health insurance for roughly 70 million older Americans. Complaints about U.S. drug prices being notoriously high, even when compared with other large and wealthy countries, have long drawn the ire of both major political parties, but a lasting fix has never cleared Congress.",
      "More common prescription drugs filled at a pharmacy would probably not be covered by the new order.",
      "Trump\u2019s post formally previewing the action came after he teased a \u201cvery big announcement\u201d last week. He gave no details, except to note that it wasn\u2019t related to trade or the tariffs he has announced for much of the world.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a very, very big announcement to make \u2014 like as big as it gets,\u201d Trump said last week.",
      "He came into his first term accusing pharmaceutical companies of \u201cgetting away with murder\u201d and complaining that other countries whose governments set drug prices were taking advantage of Americans.",
      "On Sunday, Trump took aim at the industry again, writing that the \u201cPharmaceutical/Drug Companies would say, for years, that it was Research and Development Costs, and that all of these costs were, and would be, for no reason whatsoever, borne by the \u2018suckers\u2019 of America, ALONE.\u201d",
      "Referring to drug companies\u2019 powerful lobbying efforts, he said that campaign contributions \u201ccan do wonders, but not with me, and not with the Republican Party.\u201d",

      "Vaccination teams are part of an effort by health authorities across Mexico to contain the country\u2019s biggest measles outbreak in decades",
      "CUAUHTEMOC, Mexico -- In a rickety white Nissan, nurse Sandra Aguirre and her vaccination team drive past apple orchards and cornfields stretching to the desert horizon. Aguirre goes door to door with a cooler of measles vaccines. In one of Latin America's biggest Mennonite communities, she knows many will decline to be vaccinated or even open their doors. But some will ask questions, and a handful might even agree to get shots on the spot.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re out here every single day,\u201d said Aguirre, pausing to call out to an empty farm, checking for residents. \u201cTo gain trust of the Mennonites \u2013 because they\u2019re reserved and closed-off people \u2013 you have to meet them where they\u2019re at, show a friendly face.\u201d",
      "Aguirre's work is part of an effort by health authorities across the country to contain Mexico's biggest measles outbreak in decades, as cases climb not only here but in the U.S. and Canada. In Mexico, cases have been concentrated in the Mennonite community \u2014 long skeptical of vaccines and distrustful of authorities \u2014 in the northern border state of Chihuahua.",
      "Officials say results of their campaign alongside Mennonite leaders have been mixed \u2014 they cite tens of thousands of new vaccinations in Chihuahua, but infections have ballooned and spread past the community to Indigenous and other populations.",
      "Federal officials have documented 922 cases and one death in Chihuahua. Officials, health workers and local leaders say the numbers are likely underestimated, and misinformation about vaccines and endemic distrust of authorities are their biggest obstacles.",
      "Pressed against the fringes of the small northern city of Cuauhtemoc, the Mennonite settlement here spans about 40 kilometers (25 miles). With 23,000 residents, it's one of Cuauhtemoc's primary economic engines, but it's an isolated place where families keep to themselves. Some have turned to social media and anti-vaccine websites for research. Others use little technology but visit family in the United States, where they also hear misinformation \u2014 which then spreads through word of mouth.",
      "Chihuahua is a particularly worrisome place, officials say \u2014 as a border state, the risk that the preventable disease will continue spreading internationally and affect the most vulnerable is high.",
      "\u201cWe have a massive flow of people,\u201d said Alexis Hern\u00e1ndez, a Cuauhtemoc health official. \u201cThat makes things a lot more complicated.\u201d",
      "Mexico considered measles eliminated in 1998. But its vaccination rate against the virus was around 76% as of 2023, according to the World Health Organization \u2014 a dip from previous years and well below the 95% rate experts say is needed to prevent outbreaks.",
      "Mexico\u2019s current outbreak began in March. Officials traced it to an 8-year-old unvaccinated Mennonite boy who visited relatives in Seminole, Texas \u2014 at the center of the U.S. outbreak.",
      "Cases rapidly spread through Chihuahua's 46,000-strong Mennonite community via schools and churches, according to religious and health leaders. From there, they said, it spread to workers in orchards and cheese plants.",
      "Gloria Elizabeth Vega, an Indigenous Raramuri woman and single mother, fell sick in March. Because she's vaccinated, measles didn't occur to her until she broke out in hives. Her supervisor at the cheese factory \u2014 who also caught measles \u2014 told her she had to take 10 days of leave and docked her pay 40% for the week, Vega said.",
      "It's rare for vaccinated people to get measles, but officials say that may account for up to 10% of cases here, though they're milder.",
      "Vega tucked herself away in the back of her two-room home, hoping her daughter and mother \u2014 also vaccinated \u2014 wouldn\u2019t get sick. She wishes people would think of others when considering vaccination.",
      "\u201cThey say, \u2018Well, I have enough to be fine,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut they don\u2019t think about that other person next to them, or wonder if that person has enough to live off of.\u201d",
      "Vaccination isn't required in Mexico. Schools can request vaccination records, federal health department spokesman Carlos Mateos said, but they cannot deny anyone access to education.",
      "In Chihuahua, some schools started reaching out to parents for copies of vaccination cards and encouraging shots, said Rodolfo Cort\u00e9s, state health ministry spokesman.",
      "It's unknown how many in the Mennonite community have gotten the vaccine \u2014 which is safe, with risks lower than those of measles complications.",
      "Gabriella Villegas, head of vaccination at a clinic treating Mennonites with measles, estimated 70% of community members are not vaccinated. Other health authorities estimated the vaccination rate around 50%.",
      "Mennonites who spoke to The Associated Press \u2014 most on condition of anonymity, fearing backlash \u2014 repeatedly cited vaccine misinformation. One man said U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a long record of promoting anti-vaccine views and has called vaccination a personal choice, is a hero.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t accept vaccines; it\u2019s that easy. Because that\u2019s where freedom of expression comes in,\u201d said the man, Jacob Goertzen. \"If we can\u2019t make out own decisions, we don\u2019t live in a democracy.\u201d",
      "Hern\u00e1ndez, Cuauhtemoc\u2019s health director, said outside influences affect community vaccine views.",
      "\u201cThe Mennonite population has a lot of access to social media and family members in the U.S. and Canada, where there are a lot of myths that have taken hold and many more \u2018anti-vaccine\u2019 groups than we have in Mexico,\u201d he said.",
      "During nurse Aguirre's vaccination drive, one man simply said people here \u201cprefer to cure themselves in their own way.\" A mother described getting sick with measles as a \"privilege\" and spoke of putting her unvaccinated 5- and 7-year-olds in a party so everyone could get sick and recover \u2014 a risky tactic doctors have long denounced.",
      "Mexico's lone death from measles was a 31-year-old Mennonite man in the settlement who had diabetes and high blood pressure, underlying conditions that often complicate sicknesses.",
      "Most people in Indigenous and other communities quickly agreed to vaccinate, officials told AP, but in Mennonite areas crews have to do more vigorous outreach \u2014 the door-to-door visits, follow-up calls and conversations, and involvement of local leaders.",
      "In Cuauhtemoc's settlement, that's leaders like Jacob Dyck Penner. As colony president, he and other leaders closed school for two weeks to slow infections, have made a push to show residents they\u2019re working with health authorities, and are encouraging vaccination.",
      "Leaders translate health information into Low German, the native language of most of the community. Penner and others are assisting vaccination teams, making sure families know how to access health services.",
      "\u201cWe had to find this way, together with doctors, to not pressure people or inspire distrust, so they can take their time and make their own decision to accept (being vaccinated),\u201d Penner said.",
      "Medics report more people visiting clinics, seeking vaccines for measles and other diseases. Still, Penner said, there a swath of people will always reject vaccinations.",
      "Health officials like Hern\u00e1ndez say they're concerned in particular for vulnerable populations including Indigenous groups, many of whom have fewer resources to cope.",
      "Vega, the single mother who got measles, said her job at the cheese factory was once a blessing, providing health insurance and steady pay.",
      "But the forced leave and docked pay left her reeling. She said she's living paycheck to paycheck and wonders how she'll pay the bills \u2014 her daughter's school supplies, lunches, tennis shoes.",
      "\u201cI have a daughter to keep afloat,\" she said. \"It\u2019s not like I have the option to wait and pay for things, for food.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration\u2019s dismantling of USAID has put more than 8,000 health workers in South Africa\u2019s national HIV program out of work",
      "JOHANNESBURG -- The Trump administration's dismantling of USAID has put more than 8,000 health workers in South Africa's national HIV program out of work, the country's health minister said Thursday, as he outlined the impact of U.S. funding cuts on the biggest AIDS treatment project in the world.",
      "The cuts have also closed down 12 specialized HIV clinics that were run by non-governmental organizations in South Africa and funded by the United States Agency for International Development through the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi told reporters.",
      "He said health authorities are now registering the more than 60,000 patients who were served by those clinics at state health facilities to continue their life-saving treatment.",
      "South Africa has nearly six million people on HIV medication, more than any other country in the world.",
      "The clinics that were defunded by the U.S. were largely treating what are known as \u201ckey populations,\u201d Motsoaledi said. They include gay men and sex workers who are considered at higher risk of HIV infection and who sometimes face stigma at public health facilities.",
      "Motsoaledi said that the Trump administration had terminated around $436 million annually in funding for HIV treatment and prevention in South Africa, which made up part of the $2.5 billion a year program. The South African government and other donors fund the rest.",
      "Viral load testing \u2014 which measures how much the HIV virus is present in the blood of patients on treatment \u2014 had decreased by 21% since the aid cuts began to take effect in February, the health minister said. He didn\u2019t give figures on how the testing program to find those who are HIV positive had been affected.",
      "HIV treatment and prevention is one of the areas that has been impacted most by the termination of U.S. foreign aid, especially in sub-Sahara Africa.",
      "The head of the United Nations AIDS agency told The Associated Press in February that the number of new HIV infections globally could jump more than six times by 2029 because of the funding cuts.",
      "Motsoaledi denied South Africa's national program was on the brink of collapse, but outlined significant problems like personnel shortages, funding shortfalls, and the difficulties in locating HIV positive persons that need to start treatment.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s move to terminate more than 90% of foreign aid through the USAID agency has undermined a near 20-year effort to stop HIV deaths in the country worst-hit by the disease. U.S. funding has been critical for South Africa's efforts to stop people dying of AIDS, largely through helping provide free antiretroviral medication that stops the virus replicating in the body.",
      "\u201cWe must put it categorically clear that under no circumstances will we allow this massive work performed over a period of more than a decade and a half to collapse and go up in smoke because President Trump has decided to do what he has done,\u201d Motsoaledi said. \u201cIf we do so, we will have thrown massive investment in time, money and human resources away. And at any rate, we don\u2019t want to go back to the period where death was the order of the day.\u201d",
      "South Africa has around 7.7 million people living with HIV, according to the U.N. AIDS agency. Not all of them are on treatment despite it being free. South Africa has recently embarked on a drive to get 1 million more people on treatment.",
      "The 8,061 health workers who lost their jobs make up more than half of the health workers funded by USAID through PEPFAR, Motsoaledi said. He said South Africa still has more than 250,000 health workers in the HIV program paid by the government and other donors.",
      "While South Africa still has donors like the Global Fund providing financial assistance for its HIV program, Motsoaledi said it was lobbying other governments and aid agencies for assistance, but no new funding had been secured aside from the R1 billion ($55.3M) that the Global Fund has allocated for antiretroviral medication.",

      "German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt says that the number of people turned back at the country\u2019s borders increased by 45% in the new government\u2019s first week in office after it stepped up police checks at its frontiers",
      "BERLIN -- Germany's interior minister said Thursday that the number of people turned back at the country\u2019s borders increased by nearly half in the new government\u2019s first week in office after it stepped up police checks at its frontiers, and that those rejected included asylum-seekers.",
      "The government under Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who made tougher migration policy a central plank of his campaign for Germany\u2019s election in February, took office on May 6. The following day, Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt said more police would be stationed at the border to curb irregular migration and some asylum-seekers trying to enter Europe\u2019s biggest economy would be turned away.",
      "Speaking on Thursday as he visited the Kiefersfelden crossing on Germany\u2019s southern frontier with Austria, Dobrindt said 739 people were turned back at the borders over the past seven days, a 45% increase over the previous week\u2019s figure of 511.",
      "Of the 51 people who sought asylum at the border in the past week, 32 were rejected while the rest were identified as belonging to \u201cvulnerable groups\u201d and allowed into Germany, he said. The previous week, all 44 people who sought asylum at the border were allowed in.",
      "\u201cI want to break the logic of criminal gangs and smugglers who promise people that, in exchange for paying 5,000 ($5,607), 10,000 or 20,000 euros, they will bring them into the German welfare system,\u201d Dobrindt said. \u201cThis logic must be broken and it must be clear that if you are standing at Germany\u2019s border you don\u2019t automatically come into our country.\u201d",
      "Germany\u2019s previous government already had introduced checks at the country\u2019s borders with neighboring nations, which the new administration is stepping up.",

      "Britain's prime minister says his government is talking with several countries to host rejected asylum seekers as they wait to be deported",
      "TIRANA, Albania -- Britain is talking with several countries to host rejected asylum seekers as they wait to be deported, the U.K. prime minister said Thursday.",
      "Prime Minister Kier Starmer said on a visit to Albania that the \u201creturn hub\u201d concept was a \u201creally important innovation\u201d that could more effectively tackle irregular migration. He did not name the countries he was in discussions with or offer more details.",
      "Albania already had a five-year agreement with Italy to potentially shelter up to 36,000 migrants annually while their asylum requests were fast-tracked by Italy. Under the original deal - which differs from what the U.K. is proposing - Italy would take back any migrants whose requests are rejected and attempt to deport them. But the plan has, so far, failed due to repeated challenges in Italian courts.",
      "In April, Italian authorities changed their migrant disembarkation agreement to a variation of the \u201creturn hub\u201d model and transferred 40 people to Albania who lacked Italian residency permits and whose asylum requests had been denied. It was the first time a European Union country sent rejected asylum seekers to a non-EU country that was neither their own nor one they had transited through on their journey.",
      "Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama said the agreement with Italy was a \u201cone off\u201d and that Tirana had turned down several requests for similar deals with other countries, ruling out the possibility that the U.K. would send rejected asylum-seekers there.",
      "The Conservative U.K. government that was voted out of power in July had planned a controversial program to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda, which they said was a safe third country. Starmer called his predecessor's program a gimmick and scrapped it on his first days in office.",
      "Under that program, asylum seekers would be flown to Rwanda, which would decide whether to grant asylum there.",
      "Under the \u201creturn hubs\u201d Starmer is discussing, migrants whose asylum claims are rejected by the U.K. would be sent to a third country to await deportation. A spokesperson for Starmer said the goal is to prevent failed asylum seekers from using stall tactics, such as starting a family in Britain, to prevent being sent back.",
      "Migration expert Meghan Benton said there's a lot of confusion between the different programs set out by the U.K. and other European countries. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of legal and moral differences between them,\u201d Benton, who leads Global Programs at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, said. While the Rwanda deal shifted the U.K.'s responsibility for asylum to a third country, Starmer's proposal involves people who have exhausted their asylum claims, Benton explained.",
      "Several European countries, including the Netherlands and Sweden, are looking to do the same, Benton added. The \u201creturn hubs\u201d concept has also been supported by the European Commission as a way to deter irregular migration.",
      "During his visit to Albania Thursday, the British prime minister also said a joint task force has helped significantly reduce the number of Albanian migrants trying to reach the UK. His government is in talks with Western Balkan countries to set up similar task forces, aiming to cut through the tangle of bureaucracy that hinders progress in reducing migrant arrivals, he added.",
      "The number of Albanians crossing the English Channel in unsafe inflatable rafts in search of higher-paying jobs has dropped from 12,000 in 2022 to some 600 in 2024.",
      "\u201cQuite an incredible reduction,\u201d Starmer said at a news conference with Rama. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s a signal and an example of what can be done when two countries work together in this way.\u201d",
      "While the number of Albanians arriving on English shores has fallen, the total number of migrants crossing the channel on small boats has increased by more than 30% so far this year, compared to the same period last year, according to an AP analysis of data released by the Home Office.",
      "Top British officials in 2022 called Albanians\u2019 arrivals \u201can invasion,\u201d sparking a diplomatic spat. Rama had called that a \u201ccrazy narrative\u201d and an attempt to cover up for the U.K.\u2019s failed border policies. Albanians cannot seek asylum status in the U.K., which considers Albania to be a safe country.",
      "In the same year, London and Tirana signed an agreement to return Albanians arriving on boats in the U.K. London also has funded projects, especially in northeastern Albania  where most of the illegal newcomers were from.",
      "Rama pledged to continue the partnership with Britain on discouraging migrant arrivals from Albania.",
      "Starmer's visit to Albania is the first by a British prime minister. The two countries also signed a statement of intent for defense industry cooperation to work together on the manufacture of military vehicles in Albania.",
      "The British leader will take part Friday in the European Political Community in Tirana, a forum that gathers European leaders with the aim of boosting security and prosperity across the continent.",

      "But Latvia\u2019s intelligence agency said Wednesday that they might actually be Russian saboteurs and spies.",
      "In its annual report, Latvia\u2019s Defence Intelligence and Security Service, known by Latvian acronym MIDD, offered advice on how to identify possible reconnaissance and sabotage operatives.",
      "It's an increasingly relevant concern given regional tensions and a string of arson and other acts of sabotage, which Western governments blame on Russia \u2014 allegations that Moscow has repeatedly denied.",
      "The list of telltale signs is striking: slovenly appearance, mismatched military or sportswear, and a knack for asking locals suspicious questions. According to the security service, such groups may linger near military or critical infrastructure sites, pose as humanitarian workers or stay in remote areas without showing any interest in nature.",
      "Some may carry specialized medical kits, maps or radios \u2014 items better suited for clandestine operations than camping trips.",
      "The Latvian guidance comes as countries across the region, including new NATO members Sweden and Finland, have been issuing booklets with advice on how to survive war or a natural disaster.",
      "Nearby Poland is now preparing its guidelines, while Norway recently published a book with advice on how to survive for one week.",
      "\u201cWe live in an increasingly turbulent world,\u201d it says. \u201cEven though in Norway most things generally function as they normally would, we must remain aware that extreme weather, pandemics, accidents, sabotage \u2014 and in the worst case acts of war \u2014 can impact us.\u201d",
      "MIDD, one of Latvia\u2019s three security services, alongside the State Security Service and the Constitution Protection Bureau, warned that Russian saboteurs might also attempt to incite unrest or assassinate \u201csocially significant individuals.\u201d",
      "Their activities might also be focused on \u201cstudying the position of the target country\u2019s society and inciting unrest directed against the existing government.\u201d",
      "The agency cautioned that appearances can deceive.",
      "\u201cThe Ukrainian experience shows that Russian special services are able to adapt,\u201d the report says. Not all spies will fit the mold, and suspicions must be judged in context.",
      "It also warns that if a sabotage group is spotted, leave the James Bond heroics to the professionals.",
      "\u201cIf you do think you might have spotted a sabotage group on Latvian soil, MIDD does not recommend tackling them yourself,\" it said. \"Instead report your suspicions to the State Police, special services, or the nearest armed forces unit.\u201d",

      "British investigators say the superyacht of British tech magnate Mike Lynch, which capsized last August off the coast of Sicily at the cost of seven lives, was knocked over by \u201cextreme wind\u201d and could not recover",
      "LONDON -- The superyacht of British tech magnate Mike Lynch, which capsized last August off the coast of Sicily at the cost of seven lives, was knocked over by \u201cextreme wind\u201d and could not recover, British investigators said Thursday.",
      "Billionaire entrepreneur Lynch, 59, and his daughter Hannah, 18, were among the dead when the 56-meter (184 feet) Bayesian sank Aug. 19 last year. The boat trip was a celebration of Lynch's acquittal in a fraud case in the U.S. in June.",
      "In an interim report on the disaster, Britain's Marine Accident Investigation Branch said the boat was \u201cvulnerable\u201d to winds that were even lighter than the ones that tipped it over. The report was based on \u201ca limited amount of verified evidence\u201d as a criminal investigation by Italian authorities has restricted its access to the wreck and other pieces of evidence, it said.",
      "The agency, which is investigating the disaster because the Bayesian was registered in the U.K, said the \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d were \u201cunknown to either the owner or the crew,\u201d as they were not included in the stability information book carried on board.",
      "The report stated that the Bayesian was sailed to the site where it sank the day before in order to \u201cshelter\u201d from forecast thunderstorms. It said the disaster occurred at 4:06 a.m. local time, when wind speeds exceeded 70 knots (81 mph.), \u201cviolently\u201d knocking the vessel over to a 90-degree angle in under 15 seconds,",
      "It said that at the time of the incident, the vessel was in a \u201cmotoring condition\u201d with its sails lowered, while the centerboard, which is used to help stabilize it, was in a \u201craised\u201d position.",
      "\u201cYou have the wind pushing the vessel over and then you have the stability of the vessel trying to push the vessel back up right again,\" said Simon Graves, an MAIB investigator. \u201cAnd what our studies found was that they show that the Bayesian may have been vulnerable to high winds and that these winds were likely to have been evident at the time of the accident.\u201d",
      "Inquest proceedings in the U.K. are looking at the deaths of Lynch and his daughter, as well as Morgan Stanley International bank chairman Jonathan Bloomer, 70, and his wife, Judy Bloomer, 71, who were all British nationals.",
      "The others who died in the sinking were U.S. lawyer Chris Morvillo and his wife Neda Morvillo, and Canadian-Antiguan national Recaldo Thomas, who was working as a chef on the vessel.",
      "Fifteen people, including Lynch\u2019s wife, Angela Bacares, were rescued.",
      "A project to move the Bayesian into an upright position and lift it to the surface has been paused since May 9 when a diver died during underwater work. Recovery work is set to resume from Thursday.",
      "Further details such as \u201cescape routes\u201d will be included in the final report, according to Graves.",
      "\u201cOnce we get access to the vessel we\u2019ll be able to tell a fuller picture of activities on board and the sequence of events,\" he said.",
      "No date has been set for when the final report will be published.",

      "TOKYO -- Japan's air force has begun emergency safety inspections on all of its nearly 200 military training aircraft after one of the planes crashed minutes after takeoff, officials said Thursday.",

      "Their operation has been suspended since the crash and they will remain grounded until the cause is identified and safety checks are completed, Hiroaki Uchikura, the air force chief of staff, told reporters on Wednesday.",
      "The crash is the latest in a series of defense aircraft accidents in recent years and comes at a time when Japan is accelerating a military buildup to deter China's influence in the region and double its defense spending, raising concern that funding for weapons may be prioritized over safety measures.",
      "The crashed plane was a 36-year-old T-4 operated out of Nyutabaru Air Base, in the southern prefecture of Miyazaki. It wasn't fitted with a voice recorder or a flight data recorder, a setback for the investigation.",
      "Defense Minister Gen Nakatani on Thursday announced plans to promptly fit the training aircraft with voice and flight data recording equipment.",
      "The JASDF said Thursday the plane experienced trouble when it reached an altitude of 4,000 feet (1,200 meters) about one minute after takeoff. Kyodo News agency said that air traffic control didn't receive any contact from the T-4 aircraft about an emergency.",
      "The force said the plane was lost from radar two minutes after departure and crashed into a reservoir called the Iruka pond, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) northeast of the air base.",
      "Witnesses told the NHK national broadcaster that they heard a loud noise like thunder at the time of the crash.",

      "The Office for National Statistics said growth, as measured by gross domestic product, increased by 0.7% in the first quarter of the year from the final three months of 2024, with the country's dominant services sector doing particularly well.",
      "The first quarter increase makes the British economy the fastest-growing among the Group of Seven leading industrial nations.",

      "But he said that to demonstrate to U.S. President Donald Trump that Ukraine is seeking an end to the 3-year-old war that he had decided to send officials from Ankara to Istanbul for the meeting.",
      "Their aim is \u201cto attempt at least the first steps toward de-escalation, the first steps toward ending the war \u2014 namely, a ceasefire.\u201d",
      "THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP\u2019s earlier story follows below.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin stayed away Thursday from proposed direct peace talks on ending the war in Ukraine, leaving Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy waiting in the Turkish capital of Ankara after he had challenged the Kremlin leader to face-to-face negotiations.",
      "With Putin absent, the Russian delegation was in Istanbul \u2014 more than 400 kilometers (almost 300 miles) west of Ankara \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t clear whether the sides would even meet for their first such talks since March 2022, following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of its neighbor the previous month.",
      "Zelenskyy said the Russian delegation appeared to be merely \u201ca theater prop\u201d following a weekend of diplomatic brinksmanship between Moscow to Kyiv in the 3-year-old war.",
      "Putin\u2019s absence punctured hopes of a breakthrough in peace efforts that were given a push in recent months by the Trump administration and Western European leaders amid the intense maneuvering. It also raised the prospect of intensified international sanctions on Russia that have been threatened by the West.",
      "Speaking at the airport in Ankara, Zelenskyy said the next steps for talks would be decided after his meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who welcomed him with an honor guard at the presidential palace in Ankara.",
      "\u201cNow, after three years of immense suffering, there is finally a window of opportunity,\u201d Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said at a NATO meeting taking place separately in Turkey. \u201cThe talks ... hopefully may open a new chapter.\u201d",
      "The war has killed tens of thousands of soldiers on both sides and more than 12,000 Ukrainian civilians, according to the U.N., and continues along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line. Russian forces are preparing a fresh military offensive, Ukrainian government and Western military analysts say.",
      "At least five civilians were killed and 29 injured in the past day, according to authorities in five eastern regions of Ukraine where Russia\u2019s army is trying to advance.",
      "The diplomatic maneuvering began over the weekend when European leaders met Zelenskyy in Kyiv and urged the Kremlin to agree to a full, unconditional 30-day ceasefire as a first step toward peace. Putin later responded by proposing direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul. Then came Zelenskyy's challenge to Putin for face-to-face talks.",
      "After days of silence, the Kremlin finally responded Thursday, with spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying Putin has no plans to travel to Istanbul in the next few days.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump said he was not surprised that Putin was a no-show. Trump had pressed for Putin and Zelenskyy to meet but brushed off Putin\u2019s apparent decision not to attend.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was possible for Putin to go if I\u2019m not there,\u201d Trump told reporters at a meeting with business executives in Doha, Qatar, on the third day of his visit to the Middle East.",

      "Peskov said Putin has no plans to meet with Trump in the coming days.",

      "Also absent from the talks were Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Putin\u2019s foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov, both of whom represented Russia at the talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia in March.",
      "The top-level Ukrainian delegation included Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, and the head of the Ukrainian presidential office Andriy Yermak, a Ukrainian official said. Zelenskyy will sit at the negotiating table only with Putin, said presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak.",
      "Details about whether, when and where the Ukrainian delegation might meet their Russian counterparts were unclear. Russia said the talks have been postponed until the afternoon \u201cat the initiative of the Turkish side\u201d",
      "Tass said the talks were to take place in a presidential office on the Bosporus, in Istanbul.",
      "Putin met Wednesday evening with senior government officials and members of the delegation in preparation for the talks, Peskov said. Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, General Staff chief Valery Gerasimov, and National Security Council secretary Sergei Shoigu also attended.",
      "The Kremlin billed Thursday\u2019s talks as a \u201crestart\u201d of peace negotiations that were held in Istanbul in 2022 but quickly fell apart. Moscow accused Ukraine and the West of wanting to continue fighting, while Kyiv said Russia\u2019s demands amounted to an ultimatum rather than something both sides could agree on.",
      "Russia's delegation then was also headed by Medinsky.",
      "Putin's proposal came after more than three months of diplomacy kickstarted by Trump, who promised during his campaign to end the devastating war swiftly \u2014 though it's been hard to pull off. The Trump administration in recent weeks indicated that it might walk away from the peace effort if there was no tangible progress soon.",
      "Sybiha, the Ukrainian foreign minister, met with U.S. State Secretary Marco Rubio and Sen. Lindsey Graham on Wednesday night in the Turkish city of Antalya, which is hosting NATO foreign ministers to discuss new defense investment goals as the U.S. shifts its focus to security challenges away from Europe.",
      "Sybiha reaffirmed Ukraine\u2019s support for Trump\u2019s mediation efforts and thanked the U.S. for its continued involvement, urging Moscow to \u201creciprocate Ukraine\u2019s constructive steps\u201d toward peace. \"So far, it has not,\u201d Sybiha said.",
      "On Thursday morning, Sybiha also met with other European foreign ministers, including his French counterpart Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, who in a post on X reiterated the call for a ceasefire and the threat of \u201cmassive sanctions\u201d if Russia doesn't comply.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a very difficult spot right now, and we hope that we can find the steps forward that provide for the end of this war in a negotiated way and the prevention of any war in the future,\" Rubio said Thursday.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer accused Putin of \u201cstanding in the way of peace.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was only one country that started this conflict -- that was Russia. That was Putin. There\u2019s only one country now standing in the way of peace -- that is Russia, that is Putin,\u201d he said in a visit to Tirana, Albania.",
      "Barrot echoed that sentiment: \u201cIn front of Ukrainians there is an empty chair, one that should have been occupied by Vladimir Putin,\u201d he said. \u201cVladimir Putin is dragging his feet and in all evidence does not want to enter into these peace discussions.\u201d",

      "The twisting path, intended to represent migrants' unexpected journeys, stands on the Fenix museum, the newest attraction on Rotterdam's waterfront.",

      "\u201cAs long as we exist as human beings, we move and we migrate. And we will always keep on doing that. And that\u2019s what we show in Fenix,\u201d said the museum\u2019s director, Anne Kremers.",
      "As the museum's construction continued last year, the hard-right Dutch government announced unprecedented measures aimed at reining in migration, including a reintroduction of border checks. It shattered a long-held image of the Netherlands as a nation that welcomed new arrivals.",
      "The museum's viewing platform looks out across Rotterdam, whose 650,000 inhabitants represent over 170 nationalities. The city is the largest port in Europe.",
      "Many of those departing Rotterdam in the early part of the 20th century made the trans-Atlantic journey on the Holland America Line, a shipping company founded by the Van der Vorm family in 1873. The family has been the primary financial backer for the Fenix project, via Dutch art foundation Droom en Daad (Dream and Action).",
      "Art can sometimes provide a better basis for discussion of politically loaded topics like migration, said Cathrine Bublatzky, an anthropologist who studies the intersection of art and migration.",

      "Both leading candidates support continued U.S. military engagement in Europe. Trzaskowski puts greater emphasis on deepening ties with the European Union, while Nawrocki is more skeptical of Brussels and promotes a nationalist agenda.",
      "When Law and Justice held power, it repeatedly clashed with EU institutions over judicial independence, media freedom and migration.",
      "While Poland is a parliamentary democracy, the presidency wields significant influence. The president serves as commander-in-chief, holds veto power, shapes foreign policy and plays a symbolic role in national discourse.",
      "Under Duda, the office largely advanced the conservative agenda of Law and Justice. Since Prime Minister Donald Tusk\u2019s centrist coalition came to power in late 2023, Duda has blocked key reforms aimed at restoring judicial independence and repairing relations with the EU.",
      "\u201cThe stakes are enormous for the ruling coalition and for those concerned with the future of Polish democracy,\u201d said Jacek Kucharczyk, president of the Institute of Public Affairs, a Warsaw think tank. \u201cThis is about democratic reform and restoring the rule of law \u2014 and that can only happen with cooperation from the next president.\u201d",
      "The election is also pivotal for Law and Justice, Kucharczyk noted: \u201cIts future as a dominant political force may hinge on the outcome.\u201d",
      "Both Trzaskowski and Nawrocki have pledged to support Ukraine and maintain strong defense ties, but their visions for Poland diverge sharply on the role of the EU and domestic social policy.",
      "Trzaskowski, 52, is a former presidential contender and a senior figure in Civic Platform, the centrist party led by Tusk. He is running on a pro-European platform and has pledged to defend judicial independence and rebuild democratic institutions.",
      "Supporters describe him as a modernizer who represents a cosmopolitan, outward-facing Poland. He speaks foreign languages, has marched in LGBTQ+ parades and appeals to younger, urban voters. Trzaskowski's progressive views highlight an evolution of the once more conservative Civic Platform.",
      "Nawrocki, 42, represents how the party backing him, Law and Justice, is turning further to the right as support for the hard right surges.",
      "Nawrocki, who is not a Law and Justice party member, heads the state-backed Institute of National Remembrance, which investigates Nazi and communist-era crimes. He has drawn praise from conservatives for dismantling Soviet monuments and promoting patriotic education, but he faces criticism for inexperience and playing on anti-German and other resentments. He has also been embroiled in some scandals.",
      "Earlier this month, Nawrocki met with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House \u2014 a symbolic moment welcomed by Law and Justice-friendly media as proof that he would be the best man for keeping the relationship with the United States strong. Critics viewed it as interference by Trump's administration.",
      "This week Nawrocki was joined on the campaign trail by Romanian nationalist George Simion, who faces a runoff vote for the presidency on Sunday. Simion is viewed by critics as pro-Russian, leading Tusk to tweet: \"Russia is pleased. Nawrocki and his pro-Russian Romanian counterpart George Simion on the same stage five days before the presidential elections in Poland and Romania. Everything is clear.\u201c",

      "Before becoming Pope Leo XIV, Cardinal Robert Prevost presided over one of the most revolutionary reforms of Pope Francis\u2019 pontificate by having women serve on the Vatican board that vets nominations for bishops",
      "VATICAN CITY -- Before becoming Pope Leo XIV, Cardinal Robert Prevost presided over one of the most revolutionary reforms of Pope Francis' pontificate by having women serve on the Vatican board that vets nominations for bishops.",
      "But he also has said decisively that women cannot be ordained as priests, and despite having worked for years in Peru where women often lead church communities, seems noncommittal on whether women could ever serve in any ministerial capacity.",
      "Nevertheless, the women who have worked closely with Prevost in recent years have praised his leadership style, ability to listen and respect for their opinions. In interviews with The Associated Press, they say they expect that as pope, Leo will continue to promote women in church governance positions, albeit with limits.",
      "Maria Lia Zervino was among the three women Francis appointe d to the Dicastery for Bishops in 2022 to review possible appointments. It was a job previously held by cardinals and bishops, an old boy\u2019s club that has jealously guarded the secret process behind the appointment of bishops.",
      "Zervino rejoiced when Prevost was elected pope, saying the respect he showed for her and other women on the board and their opinions gave them faith in him as a leader.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m convinced that he doesn\u2019t need to learn how to work (with women), how to let them speak, to listen to them, to have them participate in decisions, because that\u2019s what he does anyway,\u201d said Zervino, the Argentine former head of the World Union of Catholic Women\u2019s Organizations.",
      "Zervino said she expected Leo would continue Francis' reform processes, albeit in his own style.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a simple man, serene, always with that smile that we saw that seems to come from an interior peace,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cSo when you see someone who is balanced, peaceful and respectful and who welcomes what you say and is always ready to hear the other, you have faith in him.\u201d",
      "At a 2023 gathering of bishops on the future of the Catholic Church, Prevost was asked at a news conference about women in church leadership positions. He said it was \u201ca work in progress\u201d and that there would be a \u201ccontinuing recognition of the fact that women can add a great deal to the life of the church on many different levels.\u201d",
      "But he drew some very clear lines.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re all familiar with the very significant and long tradition of the church, and that the apostolic tradition is something that has been spelled out very clearly, especially if you want to talk about the question of women\u2019s ordination to the priesthood,\u201d he said in the Oct. 25, 2023, briefing.",
      "Catholic women do much of the church\u2019s work in schools and hospitals and are usually responsible for passing the faith to the next generation. But they have long complained of second-class status in an institution that reserves the priesthood for men.",
      "Prevost acknowledged Francis had created two commissions to study whether women could be made deacons, who perform many of the same functions as priests. While he said the issue was still open, he warned that turning women into clerics \u201cdoesn\u2019t necessarily solve a problem, it might make a new problem.\u201d",
      "Just because a woman in society can be president doesn't mean there's an \u201cimmediate parallel\u201d in the church, he argued.",
      "\u201cIt isn\u2019t as simple as saying that at this stage we\u2019re going to change, if you will, the tradition of the church after 2,000 years on any one of those points,\u201d he said.",
      "Deacons are ordained ministers who preside at weddings, baptisms and funerals. They can preach but cannot celebrate Mass. Married men can be ordained as deacons while women cannot, although historians say women served as deacons in the early Christian church.",
      "Karlijn Demasure, emeritus professor of practical theology at St. Paul University in Ottawa, served on a Vatican commission with Prevost proposing reforms to the authority of bishops and how they are selected. She said Prevost was absolutely convinced of the need to involve lay people and nuns in the selection of bishops, at least at an initial level.",
      "\u201cHe listens well,\u201d Demasure said. \u201cHe hears what has been said, and if he doesn\u2019t agree, he says it but in a nice way: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t say it like this, or I wouldn\u2019t do it like that.\u2019\u201d",
      "She said Prevost was quiet, \u201cprudent and private.\u201d She wonders, though, what will happen with the work of the commission, one of 10 groups that are studying particularly thorny questions, such as the role of women, and were due to report back to the pope by July.",
      "Sister Nathalie Becquart, one of the highest-ranking women at the Vatican, worked with Prevost during Francis\u2019 meeting, known as a synod, on the future of the church. She also happens to be his neighbor, living in the same Palazzo Sant\u2019Uffizio inside the Vatican gates, and was among the well-wishers who greeted Leo when he came home the night of his May 8 election.",
      "Becquart posted a joyous selfie with the pope in the courtyard in one of the first private moments after his election. \u201cI had time to greet him, not just as a neighbor,\" she said.",
      "Becquart recalled that she had been at a conference of the 900 nuns who run the world's female religious orders when the white smoke came out of the Sistine Chapel chimney. It didn't bother her that the nuns had no vote in the conclave, since the cardinals \u201ccould see that the church is the people of God.\u201d",
      "\"Synodality is about feeling we are from the same body, we are interdependent, we have a deep inner connection, and for me that was a deep spiritual experience I could never imagine before,\u201d she said.",
      "Also during the conclave, advocates for women\u2019s ordination set off pink smoke flares over the Vatican to protest their exclusion from the priesthood and the election process.",
      "\u201cThe discrimination and exclusion of women is a sin, and we\u2019re here to say the next pope will inherit this question and needs to work quickly to correct it,\u201d said Kate McElwee, executive director of the Women\u2019s Ordination Conference.",
      "Hofstra University researcher Phyllis Zagano, who was on Francis\u2019 first Vatican commission on women deacons, remains optimistic. She pointed to Prevost\u2019s acknowledgement that the deacon issue was still open and that he ministered in Peru, a region that has pushed for years for the church to recognize women as ministerial deacons to help offset the priest shortage.",
      "In a column for Religion News Service, Zagano noted that a recent proposal for a new Amazonian liturgical rite, published last month by the Amazonian bishops conference, contained explicit recommendations for women to be ordained as deacons. When Francis in 2020 considered official requests from Amazonian bishops for female deacons, he dodged the issue.",
      "\u201cWomen deserve the ordained diaconal ministry of women,\u201d she said in an interview.",

      "\u201cWe continue to advocate for Dr. Yang\u2019s interests and wellbeing at every opportunity and I have certainly asked our ambassador to convey that very directly to Dr. Yang,\u201d Albanese added.",

      "\u201cI feel all of your support beside me as I stagger through the hardest and darkest chapter of my life, allowing me to immerse in the warmth of humanity,\u201d Yang wrote.",

      "Yang expected he would one day sit side by side with his readers \u201csharing laughter, tears and dreams.\u201d",
      "\u201cDear Prime Minister Albanese, words are now failing me. Tears blur my vision. I can only use a silent voice to thank you and all the people who care for and love me,\u201d Yang wrote.",

      "The Hague-based court\u2019s American staffers have been told that if they travel to the U.S. they risk arrest.",
      "Some non-governmental organizations have stopped working with the ICC and the leaders of one won\u2019t even reply to emails from court officials.",
      "Those are just some of the hurdles facing court staff since U.S. President Donald Trump in February slapped sanctions on its chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, according to interviews with current and former ICC officials, international lawyers and human rights advocates.",
      "The sanctions will \"prevent victims from getting access to justice,\u201d said Liz Evenson, international justice director at Human Rights Watch.",
      "Trump sanctioned the court after a panel of ICC judges in November issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister, Yoav Gallant.",
      "Judges found there was reason to believe that the pair may have committed war crimes by restricting humanitarian aid and intentionally targeting civilians in Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas in Gaza \u2014 charges Israeli officials deny.",
      "Staffers and allies of the ICC said the sanctions have made it increasingly difficult for the tribunal to conduct basic tasks, let alone seek justice for victims of war crimes or genocide.",
      "A spokesperson for the ICC and for Khan declined to comment. In February, ICC President Judge Tomoko Akane said that the sanctions \u201cconstitute serious attacks against the Court\u2019s States Parties, the rule of law based international order and millions of victims.\u201d",
      "The February order bans Khan and other non-Americans among the ICC\u2019s 900 staff members from entering the United States. It also threatens any person, institution or company with fines and prison time if they provide Khan with \u201cfinancial, material, or technological support.\u201d",
      "The sanctions are hampering work on a broad array of investigations, not just the one into Israel's leaders.",
      "The ICC, for example, had been investigating atrocities in Sudan and had issued arrest warrants for former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir on charges that include genocide. That probe has ground to a halt even as reports mount of new atrocities in Sudan, according to an attorney representing an ICC prosecutor who is fighting the sanctions in U.S. courts. The prosecutor, Eric Iverson, filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration seeking protection from the sanctions.",
      "Her client \"cannot do, what I would describe as, basic lawyer functions,\u201d said Allison Miller who is representing Iverson in the suit.",
      "American staffers at the organization, like Iverson, have been warned by its attorneys that they risk arrest if they return home to visit family, according to ICC officials. Six senior officials have left the court over concerns about sanctions",
      "One reason the the court has been hamstrung is that it relies heavily on contractors and non-governmental organizations. Those businesses and groups have curtailed work on behalf of the court because they were concerned about being targeted by U.S. authorities, according to current and former ICC staffers.",
      "Microsoft, for example, cancelled the Khan\u2019s email address, forcing the prosecutor to move to Proton Mail, a Swiss email provider, ICC staffers said. His bank accounts in his home country\u202fof the United Kingdom have been blocked.",

      "Staffers at a non-governmental organization that plays an integral role in the court\u2019s efforts to gather evidence and find witnesses said the group has transferred money out of U.S. bank accounts because they fear it might be seized by the Trump administration.",

      "Said one such official: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how the court makes it through the next four years.\"",
      "Trump, a staunch supporter of Netanyahu, issued his sanctions order shortly after re-taking office, accusing the ICC of \u201cillegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel.\u201d Washington says the court has no jurisdiction over Israel.",

      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Netanyahu has dismissed the ICC's allegations as \u201cabsurd,\u201d and Israel\u2019s Knesset is considering legislation that would make providing evidence to the court a crime.",

      "Inside the court, staffers have been coping with dark humor, joking about how they cannot even loan Khan a pen or risk appearing on the U.S. radar.",
      "This is not the first time the ICC has drawn Trump\u2019s ire. In 2020, the former Trump administration sanctioned Khan\u2019s predecessor, Fatou Bensouda, and one of her deputies over the court\u2019s investigation into alleged crimes committed in Afghanistan while the United States military was operating in the country.",
      "President Joe Biden rescinded the sanctions when he took office several months later.",
      "Three lawsuits are now pending from U.S. court staff and consultants against the Trump administration arguing that the sanctions infringe on their freedom of expression. Earlier this week Iverson, the lawyer investigating genocide in Sudan, won temporary protection from prosecution but if other U.S. citizens at the court want a similar assurance, they would have to bring their own complaint.",
      "Meanwhile, the court is facing an increasing lack of cooperation from countries normally considered to be its staunchest supporters.",
      "The ICC has no enforcement apparatus of its own and relies on member states. In the last year, three countries \u2013 including two in the European Union \u2013 have refused to execute warrants issued by the court.",

Last year, just weeks before Khan announced he was requesting arrest warrants for the Israeli officials, two court staff reported the British barrister had harassed a female aide, according to reporting by the Associated Press.",
      "Khan has categorically denied the accusations that he groped and tried to coerce a female aide into a sexual relationship. A United Nations investigation is underway, and Khan has since been accused of retaliating against staff who supported the woman, including demoting several people he felt were critical of him.",

      "Trump plans to address troops at Qatar\u2019s al-Udeid Air Base, which was a major staging ground during the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and supported the recent U.S. air campaign against Yemen\u2019s Iran-backed Houthis. The president has held up Gulf nations like Saudi Arabia and Qatar as models for economic development in a region plagued by conflict as he works to entice Iran to come to terms with his administration on a deal to curb its nuclear program.",
      "Before addressing the troops, Trump will take part in a roundtable with business leaders. The group includes top executives from Boeing, GE Aerospace and Al Rabban Capital.",
      "Later Thursday, he will travel to Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates for the final leg of his Mideast tour. He will visit the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque and be honored with a state visit with UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan at the Qasr Al Watan palace.",
      "Trump has also used his trip to announce plans to recognize the government of Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa and to ease sanctions on the war-torn country. The U.S. has deployed more than 1,000 troops in Syria for years to suppress a return of the Islamic State group.",
      "Trump heaped praise on al-Sharaa \u2014 who was tied to al-Qaida and joined insurgents battling U.S. forces in Iraq before entering the Syrian civil war \u2014 after the two met in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday. The president called al-Sharaa a \u201cyoung, attractive guy. Tough guy. Strong past. Very strong past. Fighter.\u201d",
      "It was a stark contrast from earlier years, when Al-Sharaa was imprisoned by U.S. troops in Iraq. Until December, there was a $10 million U.S. bounty for his arrest.",
      "Trump, speaking in Saudi Arabia on his first day in the region, told Gulf leaders, \u201cIt\u2019s really incredible what you\u2019ve done. In the end, the so-called nation builders wrecked far more nations than they built, and the \u2018interventionalists\u2019 were intervening in complex societies that they did not even understand themselves.\u201d",
      "The Qatari base houses some 8,000 U.S. troops, down from about 10,000 at the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.",
      "The gas-rich Gulf country has spent some $8 billion over two decades in developing the base, built on a flat stretch of desert about 20 miles (30 kilometers) southwest of Qatar\u2019s capital, Doha. The base was once considered so sensitive that American military officers would say only that it was somewhere \u201cin southwest Asia.\u201d",
      "Trump said he and the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, would also see a demonstration of American air capability, as the U.S. leader looks to boost defense exports to the region.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re buying a lot of that equipment actually,\u201d Trump said Wednesday when he and Sheikh Tamim signed a series of bilateral and business agreements between the two countries. \u201cAnd I think we\u2019re going to see some of it in action tomorrow at the \u2014 we won\u2019t call it an air fair, but its going to be sort of an air fair. We\u2019re going to be showing a display that\u2019s going to be incredible. They have the latest and the greatest of our planes and just about everything else.\u201d",
      "Among the agreements the two leaders signed on Wednesday was a document clearing the way for Qatar to purchase American-made MQ-9B drones \u2014 the export version of the Reaper.",
      "Trump told al-Sharaa that he wanted the new government to take control of prisons in Syria holding Islamic State fighters and their family members, who are currently guarded by U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters. If it comes to pass, it would further reduce the need for U.S. troops in the country.",

      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Australia\u2019s newly reelected Prime Minister Anthony Albanese met with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto on Thursday, in a visit aiming to strengthen his country\u2019s economic and defense ties with its closest major neighbor.",
      "Albanese arrived in the capital, Jakarta, on Wednesday evening, a day after his new government was sworn in, to promote the importance of building stronger ties with Southeast Asia\u2019s largest economy.",
      "\u201cThat is \u2026 a signal to our region of the importance that we place on this region. We will be in the fastest growing region of the world in human history,\u201d Albanese said in an interview last week with the Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "He described Subianto as a \u201cgood friend of mine\" and hailed the two countries' close relations.",
      "Albanese\u2019s center-left Labor Party won a second three-year term in an emphatic election victory May 3.",
      "He was welcomed by Subianto in a ceremony at Merdeka Palace in Jakarta where he was escorted by dozens of motorized troops and cavalry while about 3,200 schoolchildren waved the flags of both countries along the streets, according to Indonesia's presidential office.",
      "The two leaders' talks are expected to \u201cproduce several concrete agreements that could bring direct benefits to the people of both countries,\" the office said.",
      "Albanese\u2019s two-day visit is an indication of the countries' strategic closeness. Their discussions will also include food security, energy, trade and other bilateral priorities, Indonesia's Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a statement.",
      "Newly elected Australian prime ministers typically make their first bilateral visit to Asia, usually Indonesia.",
      "In his first visit to Indonesia after his inauguration in 2022, Albanese also visited Makassar, the capital of South Sulawesi province with close ties to Indigenous Australians.",
      "Albanese\u2019s second visit to Jakarta comes amid global economic upheaval sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's \u201creciprocal tariff\u201d trade policy.",
      "Australia was hit during its election campaign with a global-minimum 10% tariff on exports to the U.S. despite trading with its bilateral free trade partner at a deficit for decades, while Indonesia is subject to 32%. The two countries have for the past month negotiated with Washington for a better trade deal.",
      "Media reports said last month that Russia told Jakarta it wants to base long-range warplanes in Papua, the most eastern Indonesian province, a plan that was raised as a security issue during the Australian election campaign. Indonesia has told Australia that no such Russian base would be allowed.",
      "Given their geographical proximity, Indonesia and Australia have traditionally maintained close ties with each other, including in matters of security and defense, despite the fact that each country has chosen to respond differently to the rivalry between the U.S. and China in the region.",
      "The two neighbors last year signed a historic Defense Cooperation Agreement that will allow more complex joint activities and exercises. Canberra hailed the agreement as the \u201cdeepest and most significant\u201d defense deal in the two countries\u2019 bilateral ties.",
      "Albanese will head on to Rome on Friday morning to attend the inauguration of Pope Leo XIV on Sunday.",

      "Argentina\u2019s right-wing President Javier Milei has issued a decree curbing immigration to the South American nation, a move coinciding with the immigration restrictions put in place by the Trump administration",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Argentina's right-wing President Javier Milei issued a decree on Wednesday curbing immigration to the South American nation, a move coinciding with the immigration restrictions put in place by the Trump administration.",
      "Milei's abrupt measures and declaration that newcomers were bringing \u201cchaos and abuse\u201d to Argentina \u2014 a country built by millions of immigrants that has long prided itself on its openness \u2014 drew criticism from his political opponents and prompted comparisons to U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Milei's government welcomed those comparisons to its close American ally, with presidential spokesperson Manuel Adorni saying it was \u201ctime to honor our history and make Argentina great again.\"",
      "Wednesday's executive order tightens restrictions on citizenship, requiring immigrants to spend two uninterrupted years in Argentina or make a significant financial investment in the country to secure an Argentine passport.",
      "Immigrants seeking permanent residency must show proof of income or \u201csufficient means\u201d and have clean criminal records in their home countries.",
      "The decree makes it much easier for the government to deport migrants who enter the country illegally, falsify their immigration documents or commit minor crimes in Argentina. Previously, authorities could only expel or deny entry to a foreigner with a conviction of more than three years.",
      "It also asks the judiciary to fast-track otherwise lengthy immigration court proceedings.",
      "\u201cFor some time now, we\u2019ve had regulations that invite chaos and abuse by many opportunists who are far from coming to this country in an honest way,\u201d Adorni told reporters.",
      "The presidential spokesperson is also the top candidate for Milei\u2019s La Libertad Avanza party in the key Buenos Aires legislative elections on Sunday. Their hard-right bloc is trying to win over conservative voters from Argentina's center-right in the high-stakes midterm-election year.",
      "That timing fueled criticism, especially as the country has seen no recent surge of migration.",
      "Argentina's most recent national census, from 2022, showed that the nation of 46 million had just 1.93 million foreign residents \u2014 the lowest share of immigrants since record-keeping began in 1869.",
      "\u201cOnce again, politicizing migration for electoral purposes and distorting reality,\u201d Pablo Ceriani Cernadas, vice president of a U.N. committee that protects the rights of migrants, wrote on social media.",
      "In a big shift, the new decree also charges foreigners to access Argentina's public health care and education while mandating that all travelers to the country hold health insurance. Adorni claimed that public hospitals had spent some $100 million on treating foreigners last year, without offering evidence.",
      "\u201cThis measure aims to guarantee the sustainability of the public health system, so that it ceases to be a profit center financed by our citizens,\u201d he said.",
      "Despite bouts of xenophobia in moments of political turmoil, immigration is rarely a matter of debate in Argentina, a nation largely developed by waves of European immigrants in the 19th century. In more recent years the country has welcomed foreigners across the region, the Arab world, Asia and, lately, Russia, offering newcomers a path to citizenship and ensuring their free access the nation's extensive and decent public education and health systems.",
      "Public universities and hospitals are now buckling under Milei's sharp spending cuts as he seeks to reverse years of massive budget deficits. Adorni said the decree allows universities to introduce fees for foreign students.",
      "Right-wing politicians long have railed against what Adorni described Wednesday as \u201chealth tours,\u201d in which patients hop over the border and get treatment before returning home.",
      "Already, several northern provinces and the city of Buenos Aires have started charging non-resident foreigners to access health care.",

      "Indigenous women in India have watched their villages\u2019 common areas under threat from climate change",
      "KORAPUT, India -- At a small stream in India's eastern state of Odisha, Indigenous villagers catch eels and fish for a dinner celebrating an annual harvest festival. The bounty of communal farming, foraging and fishing marks the start of a new season.",
      "But the fish and other resources have been dwindling.",
      "\u201cNowadays, the rains come late, affecting our farming, leading to a decrease in production,\u201d said Sunita Muduli, a Paraja tribeswoman from Putpondi village. She stood on freshly tilled fields that would be sown again with millet before the increasingly unpredictable monsoon rains.",
      "The Indigenous Adivasis have lived in these villages for millennia. They continue traditional practices of farming millet and rice and foraging leaves and fruit from the forest to make plates, the local brew and more.",
      "With those practices under pressure from a changing climate, they are making their most significant effort yet to speak up for their community's needs, advocating for Indian authorities to protect and restore their lands as the nation of more than 1.4 billion people tries to adapt to a warming world.",
      "Women are leading the way. Muduli and others from 10 villages, with help from a local nongovernmental organization, have surveyed and mapped out resources that are dwindling and what needs restoring.",
      "Comparing state government data from the 1960s with their results, they found that common areas in many of their villages had shrunk by up to 25%.",
      "The women have created what are known as dream maps, showing their villages in their ideal states. The most prominent of their bright colors is green.",
      "Muduli and others plan to submit their maps and surveys to local government officials, the first step in requesting village development funds to preserve or restore their common areas. The women estimate that $2 million might be needed \u2014 an ambitious ask when India's poorer regions often struggle to secure and implement government projects.",
      "Still, the women believe they have a 50-50 chance of success.",
      "\u201cWe want to make sure these resources are available for our children,\u201d Muduli said.",
      "This is the first time that many of the women are formally leading an outward-facing community effort. They say it's giving them more confidence in speaking up about community needs.",
      "\u201cOur forest contains an abundance of diverse resources. Unfortunately, rainfall has reduced, temperatures have risen and our forest cover has dwindled. However, once we acquire the rights we deserve, our priority will be to revitalize and flourish our forest,\" said Saita Dhangada Majhi of Pangan Pani village.",
      "They seek rights over their common lands that will require outsiders, including authorities, to seek villagers' permission to make any changes to them.",
      "India is among the world's most vulnerable countries to climate impacts. According to the 2025 Climate Risk Index, the country between 1993 and 2022 was subject to 400 extreme events \u2014 including floods, heat waves and cyclones \u2014 causing 80,000 deaths and economic losses nearing $180 billion.",
      "Odisha is one of India's poorest states and among the most vulnerable to climate impacts. A study by researchers from Odisha's Fakir Mohan University published in 2023 found that food production there had decreased by 40% in the last 50 years due to climate change.",
      "Most Indian farmers rely on rain-fed agriculture, with about half of all farmed land dependent on downpours. As the monsoons become more unpredictable, livelihoods are affected.",
      "India's Indigenous people feel those impacts the most as their traditions depend greatly on forests and natural produce, said Bidyut Bidyut Mohanty of the Odisha-based nonprofit Society for Promotion of Rural Education and Development. The organization helped the Odisha villages with the dream mapping process.",
      "Climate change is affecting \u201ctheir very existence,\u201d Mohanty said, asserting that they have not contributed to the problem but are paying the price.",
      "The forest commons are \u201cnot only considered the lungs but are also a hidden kitchen for Indigenous communities,\u201d he said.",
      "The women's survey found that resources available a decade earlier had either dwindled or disappeared. In Muduli's village, the number of fruits such as mango, guava, java plum and Indian gooseberry had dropped drastically. Resources used to make traditional instruments and other items had become more rare.",
      "Climate experts said the Odisha project can be a model to be replicated across India and other nations. United Nations reports have said 80% of the world's biodiversity lies in regions controlled by Indigenous peoples.",
      "Women from marginalized and vulnerable communities are affected the most by climate change, and the Indigenous women of Odisha are an inspiration, said Neha Saigal, a gender and climate expert at Bengaluru-based Asar Social Impact Advisors who is familiar with the mapping project.",
      "\u201cThey are actually leading from the front,\u201d she said.",
      "Their work could be critical in deciding where India\u2019s efforts on climate change should be focused, Saigal added, noting that the country is working on a national adaptation plan.",
      "It is not clear whether the dream maps will become part of that plan. The women behind them say their project has given them formal understanding of what they and their communities have long known intuitively.",
      "They want to pass that on for generations to come.",
      "\u201cForest is our life,\" said Purnima Sisa of Badakichab village. \"We have taken birth in this forest, and one day we will die in the forest. It is our life and livelihood.\u201d",

      "The producer price index \u2014 which tracks inflation before it hits consumers \u2014 fell 0.5% last month from March, the first drop since October 2023 and the biggest in five years. Compared to a year earlier, producer prices rose 2.4% last month, decelerating from a 3.4% year-over-year gain in March, the U.S. Labor Department reported Thursday.",

      "Economists had forecast that producer prices rose modestly in April.",
      "Services prices fell 0.7%, the biggest drop in government records going back to 2009, on shrinking profit margins at wholesalers and retailers. Wholesale food prices fell 1%, and egg prices plunged 39%, though they are still up nearly 45% from a year ago because of bird flu.",

      "Sales at retail stores and restaurants rose just 0.1% in April from March, the Commerce Department said Thursday. That is much lower than the previous month's 1.7% gain, which reflected a surge in car sales as consumers sought to get ahead of President Trump's 25% duty on auto imports that went into effect this month.",
      "Last month's tiny increase after the March surge makes it harder to get a clear read on consumer spending trends and reflects the ongoing turmoil and uncertainty in the economy in the wake of Trump\u2019s stop-and-go tariff policies. Many publicly-traded companies have withdrawn or held off on the traditional practice of forecasting their revenues and earnings for the rest of this year because the economic landscape has become so chaotic.",
      "Meanwhile, Americans are increasingly gloomy about the economy\u2019s prospects, according to sentiment surveys, but it's not yet evident whether that will translate into reduced spending and slower economic growth.",
      "In April, sales were flat or down for many retailers: They plunged 2.5% at sporting goods stores, which saw prices jump last month, according to the government's inflation report earlier this week. Sales dropped 0.4% at clothing stores, while they ticked down 0.2% at health and personal care stores and slipped 0.1% at auto dealers.",
      "Gas station sales dropped 0.5%, even as prices declined 0.1%. The figures aren't adjusted for price changes.",
      "Still, there were signs that at least some Americans were willing to spend. Sales at restaurants and bars jumped a healthy 1.2% last month, a sign many consumers boosted their discretionary spending.",
      "And sales at home and garden centers jumped 0.8%, the biggest gain since 2022, which suggests Americans are pursuing more home renovations as elevated mortgage rates cooled home sales.",
      "Trump imposed sky-high tariffs on imports from China last month that fueled fears of a recession, higher inflation, and even the specter of empty shelves by the winter holidays. But on Monday the U.S. and China announced a deal that sharply reduced the duties, partly assuaging those concerns.",

      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. applications for jobless benefits held steady last week as layoffs remain low despite uncertainty over how President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs will impact the economy.",
      "The number of Americans applying for unemployment aid was unchanged at 229,000 for the week ending May 10, the Labor Department said Thursday. That\u2019s in line with the 230,000 new applications analysts forecast.",
      "Weekly applications for jobless benefits are seen as representative of U.S. layoffs and have mostly bounced around a healthy range between 200,000 and 250,000 since COVID-19 ravaged the economy and wiped out millions of jobs five years ago.",
      "Even though Trump has paused or rolled back many of his tariff threats, concerns remain about a global economic slowdown that could upend the U.S. labor market, which has been a pillar of the American economy for years.",
      "Last week, the Federal Reserve held its benchmark lending rate at 4.3% for the third straight meeting after cutting it three straight times at the end of last year.",
      "Fed chair Jerome Powell said the risks of both higher unemployment and inflation have risen, an unusual combination that complicates the central bank\u2019s dual mandate of controlling prices and keeping unemployment low.",
      "Powell said that tariffs have dampened consumer and business sentiment but that data has not yet shown significant harm to the economy.",
      "Also on Thursday, the government reported that inflation at the wholesale level fell unexpectedly in April for the first time in more than a year. However, new retail sales data showed that Americans pulled back their spending in April after stocking up on goods the month before to get ahead of expected price increases due to tariffs.",
      "On Monday, the U.S. and China agreed to a 90-day pause in their trade war, giving financial markets a boost and at least temporarily relieving some of the anxiety over the impact of tariffs on the U.S. economy.",
      "Trump is attempting to reshape the global economy by dramatically increasing import taxes to rejuvenate the U.S. manufacturing sector.",
      "Contraction has already begun in the U.S., where the economy shrank at a 0.3% annual pace from January through March as Trump\u2019s trade wars disrupted business. First-quarter growth was slowed by a surge in imports as companies in the U.S. tried to bring in foreign goods before Trump\u2019s massive tariffs went into effect.",
      "Trump has also promised to drastically downsize the federal government workforce, which occupied much of the initial weeks of his second term.",
      "It\u2019s not clear when the job cuts ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 or \u201cDOGE,\u201d spearheaded by billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk \u2014 will surface in the weekly layoffs data. Many of the cuts are being challenged in the courts, though the federal government staff reductions are already being felt, even outside of the Washington, D.C. area.",
      "Despite showing some signs of weakening during the past year, the labor market remains robust, with plentiful jobs and relatively few layoffs.",
      "Earlier this month, the government reported that U.S. employers added a surprisingly strong 177,000 jobs in April and the unemployment rate held at a historically healthy 4.2%.",
      "Many economists still anticipate that a negative impact from trade wars will materialize this year for American workers.",
      "On Tuesday, Microsoft began laying off about 6,000 workers, nearly 3% of its workforce and its largest job cuts in more than two years as the company spends heavily on artificial intelligence.",
      "Other companies that have announced job cuts this year include Workday, Dow, CNN, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines and Facebook parent company Meta.",
      "The Labor Department's report Thursday said that the four-week average of claims, which softens some of the week-to-week fluctuations, rose by 3,250 to 230,500.",

      "Walmart\u2019s first quarter profit slipped and it said it must raise prices due to higher costs from tariffs implemented by President Donald Trump",
      "NEW YORK -- Walmart\u2019s first-quarter profit slipped, and it said it must raise prices due to higher costs from tariffs implemented by President Donald Trump.",
      "The nation\u2019s largest retailers posted strong quarterly sales Thursday and said it expects sales growth of 3.5% to 4.5% in the second quarter.",
      "Like many other U.S. companies, however, it did not issue a profit outlook for the quarter because of the chaotic environment, with stated U.S. tariff policies changing constantly. The company maintained its full-year guidance issued in February.",
      "Many Americans have pulled back on spending as they grow uneasy about the economy. Government data revealed slowing sales growth for retailers Thursday. Walmart said Thursday that its consumers remain cautious and selective. Trump\u2019s tariffs on China and other countries threaten the low-price model that is at the core of Walmart\u2019s success.",
      "Trump\u2019s threatened 145% import taxes on Chinese goods were reduced to 30% in a deal announced Monday, with some of the higher tariffs on pause for 90 days.",
      "Retailers and importers had largely stopped shipping shoes, clothes, toys, and other items with the duties so high, but many will now resume importing from China in the narrow window, hoping to avoid sparse shelves this fall. Yet many retailers say they must raise prices to tariff costs. And they are also bracing for higher shipping costs fueled by a surge of companies scrambling to get their goods on ships to the U.S.",
      "Walmart has built in hedges against some tariff threats. Two-thirds of Walmart\u2019s merchandise is sourced in the U.S., with groceries driving much of that. Groceries account for roughly 60%, of Walmart\u2019s U.S. business.",
      "Still, Walmart isn\u2019t immune.",
      "\u201cWe will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible,\u201d Walmart's CEO Doug McMillon told industry analysts Thursday. \u201cBut given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren\u2019t able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins.\u201d",
      "McMillon said price increases on the shelves will feel more gradual, but they had already begun as early as April, and they accelerated in May. The company said it has been focused on back-to-school receipts.",
      "McMillon said that it imports general merchandise from all over the world from dozens of countries. But China, in particular, represents a big chunk of volume in certain categories like electronics and toys.",
      "Tariffs on countries like Costa Rica, Peru and Colombia are raising costs on groceries like bananas, avocados, coffee and roses, he said. Walmart is absorbing costs on general merchandise within departments and not yet passing along rising costs in some cases.",
      "Walmart is also asking suppliers to change input materials for components, for example, using fiberglass instead of aluminum, which Trump hit with tariffs in early March.",
      "Walmart earned $4.45 billion, or 56 cents per share, in the quarter ended April 30, down from $5.10 billion, or 63 cents per share, in the same period last year.",
      "Adjusted earnings per share were 61 cents, exceeding the 58 cent projections from industry analysts, according to FactSet.",
      "Revenue rose 2.5% to $165.61 billion, just short of analyst estimates.",
      "Walmart\u2019s U.S. comparable sales \u2014 those from established physical stores and online channels \u2014 rose 4.5% in the second quarter, though that\u2019s slowed from a 4.6% bump in the previous quarter, and a 5.3% increase in the third quarter of 2024.",
      "Shares fell 4% at the opening bell Thursday.",
      "Business was fueled by health and wellness items as well as groceries. Sales were weaker in home and sporting good, which was offset by robust sales of toys, automotive goods and kid\u2019s clothing, the company said.",
      "Global e-commerce sales rose 22%, up from 16% in the previous quarter.",
      "Walmart is among the first major U.S. retailers to report financial results and the numbers can provide a hint as to the mood of the American shopper and how the tariffs are impacting its business.",
      "Earlier this month, Amazon announced higher first-quarter profit and sales, underscoring the online behemoth\u2019s hold on shoppers looking for low prices in an uncertain economy.",
      "Amazon brought in foreign goods before Trump\u2019s tariffs took effect. And CEO Andy Jassy said that many of its third party sellers did the same.",

      "ANTALYA, Turkey -- Estonia warned on Thursday that Russia appears willing to defend with military force its shadow fleet of aging tankers dodging international sanctions to keep oil revenue and equipment flowing, even through the territorial waters of European countries.",
      "Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said that a Russian fighter jet entered NATO airspace in recent days after Estonia\u2019s navy had intercepted a suspected shadow fleet ship in its waters.",
      "Tsahkna said the navy stopped the ship, the Jaguar, because it was flying no flag and apparently had no insurance. The Russian warplane appeared on the scene while the ship was stopped.",
      "\u201cThis fighter jet violated NATO territory, for one minute. This is something very new,\u201d he told reporters at a NATO meeting in Antalya, Turkey. He said that NATO aircraft scrambled to intercept the Russian fighter.",
      "\u201cWe need to understand that Russia has officially tied and connected itself to the Russian shadow fleet,\u201d Tsahkna said, and underlined the importance of air patrols over the Baltic Sea, saying that \u201cwe need to understand that the situation is really serious.\u201d",
      "The shadow fleet is made up of aging tankers bought used, often by nontransparent entities with addresses in non-sanctioning countries such as the United Arab Emirates or the Marshall Islands, and flagged in places like Gabon or the Cook Islands.",
      "Some of the vessels are owned by the Russian state Sovcomflot shipping company. Their role is to help Russia\u2019s oil exporters avoid the $60 per barrel price cap imposed by Ukraine\u2019s allies.",
      "The European Union has been targeting the ships, which sometimes also carry stolen Ukrainian grain, with sanctions. In February, 70 vessels believed to be part of the shadow fleet were added to more than 50 already listed.",
      "EU foreign ministers are expected next week to slap sanctions on dozens more.",

      "Dick\u2019s said Thursday that it expects to run Foot Locker as a standalone unit and keep the Foot Locker brands, which include Kids Foot Locker, Champs Sports, WSS and Japanese sneaker brand atmos.",
      "\u201cSports and sports culture continue to be incredibly powerful, and with this acquisition, we\u2019ll create a new global platform that serves those ever evolving needs through iconic concepts consumers know and love, enhanced store designs and omnichannel experiences, as well as a product mix that appeals to our different customer bases,\" Dick's CEO Lauren Hobart said in a statement.",
      "Both companies are led by women. Hobart became CEO at Dick's in 2021, while Mary Dillon has served as CEO of Foot Locker since 2022.",
      "Foot Locker announced a turnaround plan in 2023 in part to help improve its relationship with big brands. Speaking at the J.P. Morgan Retail Round Up Conference last month, Dillon said that Foot Locker is working closely with Nike, specifically in categories including basketball, sneaker culture and kids.",
      "Earlier this month Skechers announced that it was being taken private by the investment firm by 3G Capital in a transaction worth more than $9 billion.",
      "The retail industry has been growing increasingly concerned over Trump\u2019s trade war with other countries, particularly China. Athletic shoe makers have invested heavily in production in Asia.",
      "Shares of sporting goods and athletic shoe companies have been under pressure all year. Foot Locker's stock has plunged 41% this year. It is also facing pressure elsewhere, with major athletic companies like Nike and Adidas shifting their sales strategies.",
      "Skechers had fallen almost 8% this year.",
      "About 97% of the clothes and shoes purchased in the U.S. are imported, predominantly from Asia, according to the American Apparel & Footwear Association. Using factories overseas has kept labor costs down for U.S. companies, but neither they nor their overseas suppliers are likely to absorb price increases due to new tariffs.",
      "Foot Locker, based in New York City, offers Dick's a lot of potential, namely its huge real estate footprint, and would give the Pittsburgh company its first foothold overseas.",
      "Foot Locker has about 2,400 retail stores across 20 countries in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. It also has a licensed store presence in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The company had global sales of $8 billion last year.",
      "Jefferies analyst Jonathan Matuszewski said that about 33% of Foot Locker's sales come from outside the United States. He anticipates that the combined company would generate approximately 12% of sales internationally on a pro forma basis.",
      "The deal also broadens Dick\u2019s customer base, with sneaker collectors anxiously anticipating new drops from Foot Locker.",
      "Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said in an emailed statement that Foot Locker, which has a 4.3% share of the sporting goods market, would give an immediate boost to Dick's.",
      "\u201cIt would also give Dick\u2019s substantially more bargaining power with national brands, especially in the sneaker space,\u201d he added.",
      "Foot Locker shareholders can choose to receive either $24 in cash or 0.1168 shares of Dick\u2019s common stock for each Foot Locker share that they own.",
      "Dick\u2019s said that it anticipates closing on the Foot Locker deal in the second half of the year. The transaction still needs approval from Foot Locker shareholders.",

She was a single mother when she got a bachelor\u2019s degree in developmental psychology and when she discovered she couldn\u2019t earn enough to pay off her loans, she went back to school and got a master\u2019s degree. Her salary never caught up. Things only got worse.",
      "Around 2008, when she consolidated her loans, she was paying $1,000 a month, but years of missed payments and piled-on interest meant she was barely putting a dent in a bill that had ballooned to $250,000. When she sought help to resolve her debt, she says the loan company had just one suggestion.",
      "\u201cThey said, \u2018Move to a cheaper state,\u2019\u201d says Farro, who rents a 400-square-foot casita from a friend. \u201cI realized I was living in a different reality than they were.\u201d",
      "Student loan debt among older people has grown at a staggering rate, in part due to rising tuitions that have forced more people to borrow greater sums. People 60 and older hold an estimated $125 billion in student loans, according to the National Consumer Law Center, a six-fold increase from 20 years ago. That has led Social Security beneficiaries who have had their payments garnished to balloon by 3,000% over the same period, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "An estimated 452,000 people aged 62 and older had student loans in default, according to a January report from CFPB.",
      "Debbie McIntyre, a 62-year-old adult education teacher in Georgetown, Kentucky, is among them. She dreams of retiring and writing more historical fiction, and of boarding a plane for the first time since high school. But her husband has been out of work on disability for two decades and they\u2019ve used credit cards to get by on his meager benefits and her paycheck. Their rent will be hiked $300 when their lease renews. McIntyre doesn\u2019t know what to do if her paycheck is garnished.",
      "She floats the idea of bankruptcy, but that won\u2019t automatically clear her loans, which are held to a different standard than other debt. She figures if she picks up extra jobs babysitting or tutoring, she could put $50 toward her loans here and there. But she sees no real solution.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what more I can do,\u201d says McIntyre, who is too afraid to check what her loan balance is. \u201cI\u2019ll never get out of this hole.\u201d",
      "Braxton Brewington of the Debt Collective debtors union says it\u2019s striking how many older people dial into the organization\u2019s calls and attend its protests. Many of them, he says, should have had their debts cancelled but fell victim to a system \u201criddled with flaws and illegalities and flukes.\u201d Many whose educations have left them in late-life debt have, in fact, paid back the principal on their loans, sometimes several times over, but still owe more due to interest and fees.",
      "For those who are subject to garnishment, Brewington says, the results can be devastating.",
      "\u201cWe hear from people who skip meals. We know people who dilute their medication or cut their pills in half. People take drastic measures like pulling all their savings out or dissolving their 401ks,\u201d he says. \u201cWe know folks that have been driven into homelessness.\u201d",
      "Collections on defaulted loans may have restarted no matter who was president, though the Biden administration had sought to limit the amount of income that could be garnished. Federal law protects just $750 of Social Security benefits from garnishment, an amount that would put a debtor far below the poverty line.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re basically providing people with federal benefits with one hand and taking them away with another,\u201d says Sarah Sattelmeyer of the New America think tank.",
      "Linda Hilton, a 76-year-old retired office worker from Apache Junction, Arizona, went through garnishment before COVID and says she will survive it again. But flights to see her children, occasional meals at a restaurant and other pleasures of retired life may disappear.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to mean restrictions,\u201d says Hilton. \u201cThere won\u2019t be any travel. There won\u2019t be any frills.\u201d",
      "Some debtors have already received notice about collections. Many more are living in fear. President Donald Trump has signed an executive order calling for the Department of Education\u2019s dismantling and, for those seeking answers about their loans, mass layoffs have complicated getting calls answered.",
      "While Education Secretary Linda McMahon says restarting collections is a necessary step for debtors \u201cboth for the sake of their own financial health and our nation\u2019s economic outlook,\u201d even some of Trump\u2019s most fervent supporters are questioning a move that will make their lives harder.",
      "Randall Countryman, 55, of Bonita, California, says a Biden administration proposal to forgive some student debt didn\u2019t strike him as fair, but he\u2019s not sure Trump\u2019s approach is either. He supported Trump but wishes the government made case-by-case decisions on debtors. Countryman thinks Americans don\u2019t realize how many older people are affected by policies on student loans, often thought to be the turf of the young, and how difficult it can be for them to repay.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s a young person\u2019s problem today,\u201d he says, \u201cis an old person\u2019s problem tomorrow.\u201d",
      "Countryman started working on a degree while in prison, then continued it at the University of Phoenix when he was released. He started growing nervous as he racked up loan debt and never finished his degree. He\u2019s worked a host of different jobs, but finding work has often been complicated by his criminal record.",
      "He lives off his wife\u2019s Social Security check and the kindness of his mother-in-law. He doesn\u2019t know how they\u2019d get by if the government demands repayment.",
      "\u201cI kind of wish I never went to school in the first place,\u201d he says.",

      "MIAMI BEACH, Fla. -- Elmo, Abby Cadabby and the rest of the \u201cSesame Street\u201d gang will get some high-profile help as they travel down a new road.",
      "The Sesame Workshop \u2013 founded in 1969 and currently working on its 56th season, but its first that will not be distributed by PBS or HBO \u2013 received the Elevate Prize Catalyst Award Wednesday, which will provide the nonprofit a $250,000 grant as well as support in promoting its work from the Elevate Prize Foundation. Previous winners of the award include Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai, actor Michael J. Fox, and NBA great Dwyane Wade.",
      "\u201cThey haven\u2019t just entertained generations \u2013 they\u2019ve educated, advocated and inspired real change,\u201d Elevate Prize Foundation CEO Carolina Garcia Jayaram, said as she presented the award to The Sesame Workshop at the foundation\u2019s Make Good Famous Summit in Miami Beach, Florida. \u201cAnd their work hasn\u2019t just been confined to the screen. Through their nonprofit, they\u2019ve expanded their mission globally. They\u2019ve created real world programs that bring education, health and hope to millions of children in over 150 countries.\u201d",
      "Sal Perez, the show\u2019s executive producer and a Sesame Workshop vice president, said the organization planned to use the award to let more people know that its nonprofit work extends beyond the TV show.",
      "\u201cWe do a lot of work around the world with direct services, trying to provide content for families that talks about some of those harder to talk about subjects, whether it\u2019s trauma, whether it\u2019s homelessness and things of that nature. So this is an opportunity to highlight that kind of work.\u201d",
      "Perez told The Associated Press in an interview before the ceremony that there would be news about Sesame Workshop\u2019s future released \u201cin the coming days.\u201d Last year, Warner Bros. Discovery decided not to renew its deal for new episodes that air on HBO and Max, though episodes will remain on the streaming service until 2027.",
      "\u201c\u2019Sesame Street\u2019 is not going to go away,\u201d Perez said. \u201cIt will never go away. It\u2019s obviously been a beloved show for so long.\u201d",
      "However, there are changes coming to the new season, which currently has no distribution deal. Perez said the segments on the new season will be longer and \u201creally focused on character,\u201d while also focusing on its audience's emotional well-being and development.",
      "\u201cThe more kids want to hang out with our characters on \u2018Sesame Street,\u2019 the more they\u2019re going to take in those lessons,\u201d said Perez, adding that there would also be updates to the show's look and feel. The new season will also feature more exploration of the \u201cSesame Street\u201d neighborhood and a look inside the legendary two-story brownstone at 123 Sesame Street.",
      "Though Sesame Workshop does not currently receive any government funding, Perez urged viewers to support public media, especially following President Donald Trump's recent executive order to cut funding to PBS and NPR.",
      "\u201cWe believe in the power that public funding has for children\u2019s media,\" he said. \"I think people should support their local PBS affiliates and support children\u2019s media because it is an entry point for children to really start to see the world outside of their homes.\u201d",
      "Jayaram said she felt the time was right to for the Elevate Prize Foundation to stand with The Sesame Workshop and its work.",
      "\u201cThis is a foundation that\u2019s about social impact,\" she said. \"So the symbolism of us joining forces with a children\u2019s program is to say that even though our leaders are grown adults, it\u2019s the child in all of us that we need to revive and remember our essential values as humans.\u201d",
      "Famed roommates Bert and Ernie were on hand to receive the award alongside Perez with their trademark banter. \u201cWe are so proud to make the Catalyst,\u201d joked Ernie. \u201cOne day we'd also like to make the Dog-alist.\u201d",
      "In a video acceptance, Abby and Elmo took their own swing at explaining the award.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a spark that makes good change happen \u2013 kinda like magic,\u201d explained Abby.",
      "\u201cElmo really likes being a catalyst,\u201d said Elmo.",

      "Colombian lawmakers have once again blocked President Gustavo Petro\u2019s efforts to overhaul labor laws",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Lawmakers in Colombia on Wednesday once again blocked President Gustavo Petro's efforts to overhaul the country\u2019s labor laws, this time by rejecting a referendum that would have asked voters whether workdays should be limited to eight hours and whether workers should receive double pay if they work during holidays.",
      "Petro asked Congress earlier this month to approve the 12-question referendum to give voters a chance to decide on the changes that lawmakers themselves had already rejected twice. He had warned lawmakers against blocking the referendum, saying before thousands of people gathered for a Labor Day demonstration on May 1 that if they did not approve it, Colombians would punish them at the polls during the 2026 legislative elections.",
      "After an intense debate Wednesday, 49 senators voted against the measure and 47 in favor.",
      "Petro, Colombia's first leftist president, characterized the vote as fraudulent. He has repeatedly accused lawmakers of blocking his social initiatives and ignoring the demands of Colombians.",
      "Had lawmakers approved the referendum, voters would have answered questions such as whether daytime workdays should end at 6 p.m. and whether open-ended contracts should be offered to workers to prioritize job stability.",
      "In a rarely used maneuver, a group of congressmen on Wednesday successfully appealed the March dismissal of Petro's proposed labor reform. The move allows lawmakers to again debate his proposals and potentially approve them. Lawmakers face a June 20 deadline to do so.",

      "NEW YORK -- The chair of Tesla sold more than $230 million of company stock since Elon Musk's endorsement of Donald Trump triggered boycotts and protests against his cars, sending its profits and stock price plunging.",
      "More than half of Robyn Denholm's cash haul came from sales in the first four months this year as Tesla stock fell by one-third, according to filings reviewed by The Associated Press. In total, she unloaded hundreds of thousands of shares \u2014 more than half her holdings as dictated by a pre-arranged selling plan filed with regulators as Musk began embracing right-wing politics.",
      "Denholm filed that plan on July 25, the day Musk endorsed Trump for president.",
      "Denholm's profits were likely outsized, too. That is because many of the shares she sold had been acquired through so-called options granted to her by Tesla years earlier that, given recent stock prices, allowed her to buy at a deep discount, according to data from research provider FactSet. Nearly a million shares acquired through options were bought for $25, less than a tenth of the market price for much of the last nine months.",
      "The AP reached out to both Tesla and Denholm but did not receive an immediate reply.",
      "A Denholm statement to The New York Times, which earlier reported on the insider sales, said that the share value of holdings by Tesla directors has jumped because the stock itself has soared, creating \u201coutsized returns\u201d for all shareholders.",
      "It's not clear why Denholm decided to cash out so much of her stake.",
      "Pre-determined selling schedules are used by executives and directors as a way of telling investors that their selling isn't based on insider information, which is illegal, or necessarily a sign that they have turned pessimistic about a company.",
      "Denholm isn't the only Tesla insider who has been selling. The chief financial officer and other directors have unloaded $189 million in stock in the same nine-month period, according to FactSet data.",
      "Tesla stock soared after Trump was elected in November on hopes that the president-elect's close relations with Musk would translate to less regulatory scrutiny and bigger profits.",
      "But Musk's role as the government cost-cutting chief for Trump and his comments supporting extreme right-wing politicians in Europe have triggered a backlash among car buyers, and sales have sunk along with its stock.",
      "Tesla reported last month that profits in the first three months of the year plunged 71%.",
      "The stock soared again after Musk, the company's chief executive and biggest shareholder, said he would be stepping back from his Washington work to spend more time at the electric automaker.",
      "Tesla closed at $347 a share Wednesday, up 4% for the day and more than 50% since its April low.",

      "There were cheers when Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee signed off on the GOP tax breaks bill after a round-the-clock session that pushed President Donald Trump\u2019s package past overwhelming Democratic opposition",
      "WASHINGTON -- Cheers broke out early Wednesday as Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee signed off on the GOP tax breaks bill after a grueling round-the-clock session that pushed President Donald Trump's package past overwhelming Democratic opposition.",
      "But there's still more work to do.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., also worked past midnight trying to resolve issues with Trump's plan. Opposition is mounting from various corners of the GOP majority as he tries to muscle the party's signature package to passage without any votes from Democrats.",
      "On the one hand, the conservative leader of the Freedom Caucus derides the new Medicaid work requirements as a \u201cjoke\u201d that do not go far enough at cost-cutting. Meanwhile, a handful of GOP lawmakers from New York and other high-tax states are refusing to support the measure unless changes are made to give deeper state and local tax deductions, called SALT, for their constituents back home.",
      "\"To say we have a gulf is an understatement,\" said Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, a leader of the conservative wing.",
      "Roy said there is \u201ca significant number of us who could not bless this product\u201d in its current form.",
      "Nevertheless, momentum is building toward an end-of-the-week inflection point to stitch together the sprawling package Friday at the Budget Committee. That means combining hundreds of pages of bill text covering $5 trillion in tax breaks and at least $1.5 trillion in spending reductions on Medicaid, food stamps and green energy programs to deliver Trump's second-term legislative priority.",
      "Democrats decry the package as a give-away to the wealthy at the expense of safety net programs that millions of Americans rely on. But Johnson insists the Republican majority is on track to pass the package by Memorial Day, May 26, sending it to the Senate where Republicans are crafting their own version. With his slim majority, he can only afford a few defections from his ranks.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re still on target,\u201d Johnson said at the Capitol. \u201cThe American people are counting on us.\u201d",
      "Democrats also stayed up all night forcing marathon public hearings. One at the House Energy and Commerce Committee was still going more than 26 hours later before finishing Wednesday afternoon.",
      "Later Wednesday evening, the House Agriculture Committee handling the food aid cuts wrapped up its work too, but only after the Republican chairman abruptly shut down debate on dozens of remaining amendments from Democrats.",
      "All told, Democrats proposed hundreds of amendments trying to change the package, with dozens of votes that largely failed.",
      "\u201cIt is a cruel, mean, rotten bill,\u201d said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., as the Agriculture panel debated changes to the Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program, known as SNAP.",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said at least 7.6 million fewer people would have health insurance with reductions to Medicaid, and likely more with additional changes to the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The CBO also gave lawmakers a preliminary analysis showing that 3 million fewer people each month would participate in the SNAP food program under the changes proposed.",
      "More than 70 million Americans rely on Medicaid for health care, and about 40 million use SNAP.",
      "The Republicans are targeting Medicaid and SNAP for a combined $1 trillion in cuts as a way to offset the costs of the tax package, but also to achieve GOP goals of reining in the social safety net programs.",
      "Most of the cost-savings would come from imposing stiffer work requirements for those receiving the health care and food assistance, meaning fewer people would qualify for the aid. The legislation would raise from 54 to 64 the age of able-bodied adults without dependents who would have to work to qualify for SNAP. It also would also require some parents to work to qualify for the benefits once their children are older than 7, instead of 18. Under current law, those recipients must work or participate in a work program for 80 hours a month.",
      "The chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Rep. Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., insists the changes would \u201cstrengthen and sustain\u201d Medicaid for the future, and are the kind of \u201ccommon sense\u201d policies Trump promised voters.",
      "But Democrats told repeated stories of their constituents struggling to access health care. Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif., revealed his own diagnosis with Type 2 diabetes at the House Ways and Means Committee hearing and the sticker shock of health costs.",
      "One of the most difficult issues for Johnson has been the more localized debate over state and local taxes as he works to come up with a compromise for New York, California and New Jersey lawmakers. They have rejected an offer to triple the deduction cap, now at $10,000, to $30,000 for married couples.",
      "The speaker met with lawmakers Tuesday and talks continued into Wednesday.",
      "Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., said it was cordial, but there was no deal. \u201cMore sizzle than steak in that meeting,\u201d he said late Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThe reality is you need 218 votes to pass a bill and the way this bill is currently constructed, it will not have that because it does not adequately the issue of SALT,\u201d said Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y.",
      "The lawmakers believe they have leverage in the talks because without a deal, the $10,000 limit established under the 2017 tax bill expires at the end of the year and reverts to no cap at all.",
      "But as Johnson and the lawmakers edge closer to a SALT deal, the conservatives are balking that their priorities must also be met.",
      "Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., said he\u2019s a no for now, but would be working to improve the bill so that he could support it.",
      "The conservatives argue that the tax breaks without deeper spending cuts will pile onto the deficit, and they worry that the Medicaid reductions do not go far enough in rolling back federal funds to expand the Affordable Care Act. They also want the work requirements, which don't take effect until Jan. 1, 2029, after Trump has left office, to start sooner.",
      "\"Basically Republicans are enforcing Obamacare, which is a surreal situation to me,\u201d Burlison said.",
      "Republicans are racing to extend Trump's tax breaks, which are set to expire later this year, while adding the new ones he campaigned on in 2024, including no taxes on tips, Social Security benefits and others.",
      "A new analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation shows that most tax filers would see a lower tax rates under the proposal, except those at the lowest rates, who earn less than $15,000 a year. Their average tax rate would go up.",

      "More than 1,000 Starbucks baristas at 75 U.S. stores have gone on strike since Sunday, protesting the coffee giant\u2019s new dress code",
      "More than 1,000 Starbucks baristas at 75 U.S. stores have gone on strike since Sunday to protest a new company dress code, a union representing the coffee giant's workers said Wednesday.",
      "Starbucks put new limits starting Monday on what its baristas can wear under their green aprons. The dress code requires employees at company-operated and licensed stores in the U.S. and Canada to wear a solid black shirt and khaki, black or blue denim bottoms.",
      "Under the previous dress code, baristas could wear a broader range of dark colors and patterned shirts. Starbucks said the new rules would make its green aprons stand out and create a sense of familiarity for customers as it tries to establish a warmer, more welcoming feeling in its stores.",
      "But Starbucks Workers United, the union that represents workers at 570 of Starbucks\u2019 10,000 company-owned U.S. stores, said the dress code should be subject to collective bargaining.",
      "\u201cStarbucks has lost its way. Instead of listening to baristas who make the Starbucks experience what it is, they are focused on all the wrong things, like implementing a restrictive new dress code,\u201d said Paige Summers, a Starbucks shift supervisor from Hanover, Maryland. \u201cCustomers don\u2019t care what color our clothes are when they\u2019re waiting 30 minutes for a latte.\u201d",
      "Summers and others also criticized the company for selling styles of Starbucks-branded clothing that employees no longer are allowed to wear to work on an internal website. Starbucks said it would give two free black T-shirts to each employee when it announced the new dress code.",
      "Starbucks said Wednesday that the strike was having a limited impact on its 10,000 company-operated U.S. stores.",
      "\u201cThousands of Starbucks partners came to work this week ready to serve their customers and communities,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cIt would be more productive if the union would put the same effort into coming back to the table to finalize a reasonable contract.\u201d",
      "Starbucks Workers United has been unionizing U.S. stores since 2021. Starbucks and the union have yet to reach a contract agreement, despite agreeing to return to the bargaining table in February 2024.",
      "The union said this week that it filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board alleging Starbucks' failure to bargain over the new dress code.",

      "Maryland has lost its triple-A bond rating from Moody\u2019s",
      "ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- Maryland lost its triple-A bond rating from Moody's on Wednesday, a rating the state has cited for more than 50 years as a sign of strong fiscal stewardship.",
      "Moody\u2019s downgraded the state\u2019s credit rating to Aa1. Maryland had received a triple-A bond rating from Moody\u2019s since 1973. The state has benefitted from the higher rating by paying the lowest rates when it sells bonds to pay for infrastructure, likes roads and schools.",
      "\u201cThe downgrade was driven by economic and financial underperformance compared to Aaa-rated states, which is expected to continue given the state\u2019s heightened vulnerability to shifting federal policies and employment, and its elevated fixed costs,\u201d Moody\u2019s said.",
      "Gov. Wes Moore and other leading Maryland Democrats blamed President Donald Trump's mass layoffs of federal workers, which is having a big impact on the region. The District of Columbia also recently received a credit-rating downgrade.",
      "\u201cTo put it bluntly, this is a Trump downgrade,\" Moore said in statement made jointly by the presiding officers of the state's legislature, Comptroller Brooke Lierman and Treasurer Dereck Davis, who are all Democrats. \u201cOver the last one hundred days, the federal administration\u2019s decisions have wreaked havoc on the entire region, including Maryland.\u201d",
      "Maryland Republicans described the downgrade as \u201ca harsh indictment of the state\u2019s current direction under Governor Wes Moore.\u201d",
      "\u201cDonald Trump didn\u2019t downgrade Maryland\u2019s bond rating \u2014 Annapolis Democrats did. And now they\u2019re scrambling for someone else to blame,\" Republican Sen. Steve Hershey, the Senate minority leader, said in a statement. \"This is the result of reckless spending, bloated budgets, and an economy that\u2019s been hollowed out by overregulation and overreliance on the federal government.\u201d",
      "Moody's had noted earlier this year that federal cuts pose a greater threat to Maryland than any other state.",
      "Maryland lawmakers recently concluded a challenging legislative session to balance the state's budget. They closed a $3.3 billion budget deficit for the next fiscal year with a combination of tax increases, budget cuts and fund transfers.",
      "Maryland lawmakers also directed the governor's budget office to keep track of the impact of federal cuts, alert them if it reaches $1 billion and make recommendations on how to deal with the impact.",
      "The Democrats' statement noted that Moody's acknowledged that the state had closed its budget gap, even as it remains exposed to the economic consequences of federal funding cuts and layoffs.",
      "\u201cMaryland still holds one of the highest possible credit ratings in the nation,\" the joint statement said, \u201cand as we have for decades, we will always pay our debts.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Sen. Ted Cruz asked whether a hotline between military and civilian air traffic controllers in Washington, D",
      "A hotline between military and civilian air traffic controllers in Washington, D.C., that hasn't worked for more than three years may have contributed to another near miss shortly after the U.S. Army resumed flying helicopters in the area for the first time since January's deadly midair collision between a passenger jet and a Black Hawk helicopter, Sen. Ted Cruz said at a hearing Wednesday.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration official in charge of air traffic controllers, Frank McIntosh, confirmed the agency didn't even know the hotline hadn't been working since March 2022 until after the latest near miss. He said civilian controllers still have other means of communicating with their military counterparts through landlines. Still, the FAA insists the hotline be fixed before helicopter flights resume around Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.",
      "The Army said in a statement Wednesday that is it \u201cworking with the FAA to resolve the direct communications line between the Pentagon pad tower and the DCA tower and determine what repairs are required to restore services.\u201d DCA is the code for Reagan airport.",
      "It said the Army \u201ccontinues to restrict flights to the Pentagon pad to only mission essential operations until the line is repaired or improved communication procedures are implemented and accepted by the FAA.\u201d",
      "The FAA said in a statement that the dedicated direct access line between air traffic controllers at Reagan and the Pentagon's Army heliport hasn't worked since 2022 because of the construction of a new tower at the Pentagon. But the FAA said \u201cthe two facilities continue to communicate via telephone for coordination.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe developments at DCA in its airspace are extremely concerning,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThis committee remains laser-focused on monitoring a safe return to operations at DCA and making sure all users in the airspace are operating responsibly.\u201d",
      "The Army suspended all helicopter flights around Reagan airport after the latest near miss, but McIntosh said the FAA was close to ordering the Army to stop flying because of the safety concerns before it did so voluntarily.",
      "\u201cWe did have discussions if that was an option that we wanted to pursue,\u201d McIntosh told the Senate Commerce Committee at the hearing.",
      "Jeff Guzzetti, a former NTSB and FAA accident investigator, said \u201cthe fact that they were unaware that this connection was not working for three years is troublesome.\u201d But he is not entirely clear on the purpose of the hotline when controllers had other ways to communicate.",
      "But Guzzetti thinks the Army needs to be more forthcoming about what it is doing to ensure the airspace around Washington remains safe. Since the crash, the Army has at times refused to provide information that Congress has asked for, and officials didn't answer all the questions at a previous hearing.",
      "\u201cThe DCA airspace is under the white hot spotlight. So the Army\u2019s going to have to be more transparent and more assertive in their dealings with this problem,\u201d Guzzetti said.",
      "According to a U.S. official, one course of action under consideration now is to have the Army give 24 hours notice of any flights around National Airport. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because no decisions have been made and discussions are ongoing.",
      "January's crash between an American Airlines jet and an Army helicopter killed 67 people \u2014 making it the deadliest plane crash on U.S. soil since 2001. The National Transportation Safety Board has said there were an alarming 85 near misses around Reagan in the three years before the crash that should have prompted action.",
      "Since the crash, the FAA has tried to ensure that military helicopters never share the same airspace as planes, but controllers had to order two planes to abort their landings on May 1 because of an Army helicopter circling near the Pentagon.",
      "\u201cAfter the deadly crash near Reagan National Airport, FAA closed the helicopter route involved, but a lack of coordination between FAA and the Department of Defense has continued to put the flying public at risk,\u201d Sen. Tammy Duckworth said.",
      "McIntosh said the helicopter should never have entered the airspace around Reagan airport without permission from an air traffic controller.",
      "\u201cThat did not occur,\u201d he said. \u201cMy question \u2014 and I think the larger question is \u2014 is why did that not occur? Without compliance to our procedures and our policies, this is where safety drift starts to happen.\u201d",
      "The NTSB is investigating what happened.",
      "In addition to that incident, a commercial flight taking off from Reagan airport had to take evasive action after coming within a few hundred feet of four military jets heading to a flyover at Arlington National Cemetery. McIntosh blamed that incident on a miscommunication between FAA air traffic controllers at a regional facility and the tower at Reagan, which he said had been addressed.",

      "Ford is recalling nearly 274,000 of its Expedition and Lincoln-branded Navigator SUVs across the U.S. due to an issue that may cause a loss of brake function while driving, increasing crash risks",
      "NEW YORK -- Ford is recalling nearly 274,000 of its Expedition and Lincoln-branded Navigator SUVs across the U.S. due to an issue that may cause a loss of brake function while driving, increasing crash risks.",
      "According to documents published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the front brake lines in these now-recalled cars \u201cmay be in contact\u201d with their engine air cleaner outlet pipe due to a potential installation defect. That can result in a brake fluid leak and/or a loss of brake function.",
      "The recall covers 223,315 Expeditions and 50,474 Navigators between model years 2022 and 2024. Ford expects that just 1% of these vehicles have the defect, per a recall report dated Friday.",
      "Ford is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to this recall \u2014 but the Michigan-based auto giant had received 45 warranty reports of front brake line leaks as of April 17, NHSTA documents note.",
      "As a remedy, Ford and Lincoln dealers will inspect the front brake line of impacted vehicles and replace it or the air cleaner outlet pipe if necessary, free of charge. Dealer notifications were planned to begin Wednesday, the recall report notes, with owner letters set to be mailed out between May 26 and May 30.",
      "In the meantime, drivers can also confirm if their specific vehicle is included in this recall and find more information using the NHTSA site or Ford's recall lookup. The company's number for this recall is 25S47.",
      "Impacted drivers may experience an increase in pedal travel, NHSTA documents warn, meaning the pedal would need to be pressed harder to apply the brakes. And if there's a leaking brake line, the fluid level will decrease over time \u2014 potentially causing the red brake warning indicator to light up.",
      "A spokesperson for Ford had no additional comments when reached by The Associated Press on Wednesday.",

      "\u201cOrano deplores this intervention, for which no legal basis nor reason has been offered,\" Orano said in a statement late Tuesday, accusing authorities of arbitrary arrest, illegal detention and \u201cunjust confiscation of the property of Nigerien companies, subsidiaries of Orano and the State of Niger itself.\u201d",

      "Orano has been operating in Niger, the world\u2019s seventh biggest supplier of uranium, for over 50 years, and holds majority shares in three main uranium mines in Niger. Only one of the mines, near the town of Arlit, is currently operational.",
      "Last year military authorities withdrew the company\u2019s operating permit for the Imouraren uranium mine, with reserves estimated at 200,000 tons. The authorities also took operational control of Orano\u2019s subsidiary, Soma\u00efr, which operates the only active mine.",

      "Some 350,000 commuters who work in New Jersey and New York City could soon be scrambling for other ways to reach their destinations if New Jersey Transit engineers walk off the job early Friday.",
      "NJ Transit \u2014 the nation\u2019s third largest transit system \u2014 operates buses and rail in the state, providing nearly 1 million weekday trips, including into New York City. A walkout would halt all NJ Transit commuter trains, which provide heavily used public transit routes between New York City\u2019s Penn Station on one side of the Hudson River and communities in northern New Jersey on the other as well as the Newark airport, which has grappled with unrelated delays of its own recently.",
      "Wages and working conditions have been the main sticking points of the negotiations between the agency and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen. The union claims its members earn an average salary of $113,000 a year and says an agreement could be reached if agency CEO Kris Kolluri agrees to an average yearly salary of $170,000.",
      "NJ Transit leadership, though, disputes the union's data, saying the engineers have average total earnings of $135,000 annually, with the highest earners exceeding $200,000.",
      "\u201cI cannot keep giving money left and right to solve a problem,\" Kolluri recently said. \u201cIt all comes down to, who is going to pay for this? Money does not grow on trees.\u201d",
      "Tom Haas, the union's general chairman, has said NJ Transit has adopted a \u201ctake it or leave it\" approach to salaries during the negotiations.",
      "\u201cWe have sought nothing more than equal pay for equal work, only to be continuously rebuffed by New Jersey Transit,\u201d Haas said during a news conference Friday. \u201dNew Jersey Transit engineers want to keep the trains moving, but the simple fact is that trains do not run without engineers.\u201d",
      "If the walkout does happen, it would be the state\u2019s first transit strike in more than 40 years.",
      "If the engineers do walk off the job, the agency plans to increase bus service, saying it would add \u201cvery limited\u201d capacity to existing New York commuter bus routes in close proximity to rail stations and will contract with private carriers to operate bus service from key regional park-and-ride locations during weekday peak periods.",
      "However, the agency notes that the buses would not be able to handle close to the same number of passengers \u2014 only about 20% of current rail customers \u2014 so it is has urged people who can work from home to do so if there is a strike.",
      "The potential strike is already causing some disruptions. On Monday, NJ Transit said it will not operate train or bus service to MetLife Stadium for Shakira concerts scheduled for Thursday and Friday, and said it\u2019s not clear yet if it will be providing service for Beyonce fans planning to attend her shows scheduled at MetLife from May 22 to 29.",
      "If a walkout does occur, NJ Transit has said the chartered buses will run from four satellite lots across the state to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan or to PATH train stations in north Jersey, starting Monday. The PATH system is operated by a subsidiary of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and its services would not be affected by the potential strike.",
      "As many as 1,000 passengers are on a full train each day, and roughly 70,000 commuters take the trains each day. NJ Transit says each chartered bus could carry only about 100 passengers, and no buses would run on the first day of a potential strike.",
      "Officials expect some train customers will switch to existing NJ Transit bus routes or use the chartered carriers. Others may choose to drive into New York City, where they would have to pay congestion pricing fees.",
      "The potential walkout comes a month after union members overwhelmingly rejected a labor agreement with management. Both sides had earlier said the tentative agreement included a \u201creasonable wage increase\u201d for union members as well as the resolution of a long-standing grievance.",
      "Kolluri has said the offer would have raised the average annual pay of full-time engineers to $172,000 from $135,000, but union leaders say those figures were inflated.",
      "Since that proposal was rejected, the two sides have traded jabs over the labor dispute, which goes back to 2019, when the engineers\u2019 contract expired. Union leaders say train engineers have gone without a raise over the past five years and are just seeking pay parity with engineers who work for other rail agencies.",
      "The parties met Monday with a federal mediation board in Washington to discuss the dispute, but both sides and the board have declined to comment on whether any progress was made or if more talks have been scheduled.",
      "New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, says all options are on the table if a strike occurs, including declaring a state of emergency. The governor, though, remains optimistic an agreement can be reached.",

      "The Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday that it plans to weaken limits on some so-called forever chemicals in drinking water that were finalized last year, while maintaining standards for two common ones.",
      "The Biden administration set the first federal drinking water limits for PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, finding they increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and babies being born with low birth weight. Those limits were expected to reduce PFAS levels in drinking water for millions of people.",
      "PFAS are man-made chemicals that don\u2019t easily break down in nature. They\u2019re found in a wide range of products, including cookware, firefighting foam and stain-resistant clothing.",

      "The Biden administration\u2019s rule also set standards for the two common types of PFAS, referred to as PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion, effectively the lowest level at which they can be reliably detected. The EPA will keep those standards in place, but give utilities two extra years \u2014 until 2031 \u2014 to comply and treat for the chemicals.",

      "His decision highlights Newsom's struggle to protect his liberal policy priorities against budget challenges in his final years on the job and as he weighs his next political move, which could include a presidential run.",
      "Immigration has become a politically potent issue nationally. Nearly half of Americans approve of President Donald Trump\u2019s tougher immigration approach, according to an AP-NORC poll conducted in April.

      "California was among one of the first states to extend free health care benefits to all poor adults regardless of their immigration status last year, an ambitious plan touted by Newsom to help the nation\u2019s most populous state inch closer to a goal of universal health care. But the cost ran $2.7 billion more than the administration had anticipated.",
      "Newsom in March suggested he was not considering rolling back health benefits for immigrants as the state was grappling with a $6.2 billion Medicaid shortfall. He also repeatedly defended the expansion, saying it saves the state money in the long run. The program is state-funded and does not use federal dollars.",
      "Under Newsom's plan, low-income adults without legal status will no longer be eligible to apply for Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program, starting in 2026. Those who are already enrolled won't be kicked off their plans, and the changes won't impact children. Newsom didn't say how long the freeze would last.",
      "Starting in 2027, adults with \u201cunsatisfactory immigration status\u201d on Medi-Cal will also have to pay a $100 monthly premium. The governor's office said that is in line with the average cost paid by those who are on subsidized heath plans through California's own marketplace. There's no premium for most people currently on Medi-Cal.",
      "\u201cWe believe that people should have some skin in the game as it relates to contributions,\" Newsom said.",
      "Newsom's office estimated the changes will save the state $5.4 billion by 2028-2029.",
      "The Medi-Cal expansion, combined with other factors such as rising pharmacy costs and larger enrollment by older people, has forced California to borrow and authorize new funding to plug the multibillion hole earlier this year. California provides free health care to more than a third of its 39 million people.",
      "Newsom's proposals go against the commitment the state has made to the immigrant community, said Masih Fouladi, executive director of the California Immigrant Policy Center.",
      "\u201cQuestions about the practicality of the program aren't even something that we want to entertain with,\u201d he said. \u201cThe proposal just doesn't match with our values as a state.\u201d",
      "Newsom also proposed eliminating state health care coverage for certain weight loss drugs beginning in January 2026, which would save an estimated $85 million for the upcoming fiscal year and $680 million by fiscal year 2028-29.",
      "Newsom wants to reauthorize the state's cap-and-trade program through 2045. The program aims to reduce emissions from industrial sources over time through market-based mechanisms, and its set to expire in 2030.",
      "Money generated through auctions of credits needed to pollute goes into a fund that lawmakers tap for climate-related spending and the state's high-speed rail project.",
      "Newsom proposed tapping $1.5 billion from that fund for the state fire department. He said the shift would help ensure carbon emitters help fund the state\u2019s response to fires intensified by climate change.",
      "His proposal would also ensure $1 billion annually for the state\u2019s long-delayed high-speed rail project. The project now receives 25% of Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund money, which ends up being a little more or a little less than a billion annually depending on the year.",

    "story": [
      "Since the game\u2019s early days, baseball mythology has been constructed \u2014 often deliberately \u2014 to set itself apart",
      "PITTSBURGH -- The legends of pastoral fields. The detailed history and meticulous attention to continuity. The sight of kids playing ball. The hush that descends when you walk into the Hall of Fame. Each implicitly casts the universe of baseball as a magical land that touches, but maybe isn't precisely part of, the \u201creal\u201d world in which we live. \u201cThe whole history of baseball,\u201d the writer Bernard Malamud once said, \u201chas the quality of mythology.\u201d",
      "Since the game's early days, that mythology has been constructed \u2014 often deliberately \u2014 to set itself apart. But sometimes things happen that demonstrate otherwise, and reality pokes through.",
      "One of those things unfolded this week when Commissioner Rob Manfred decided that permanent bans from baseball expire upon the death of the banned player. In a single moment, he changed the possible posthumous career trajectory of two preposterously talented ballplayers \u2014 Pete Rose and \u201cShoeless Joe\u201d Jackson, one banned for decades for gambling on baseball, the other for more than a century for abetting gamblers. Each is now eligible for the Hall of Fame.",
      "Some welcomed it. \u201cA great day for baseball,\u201d said Rose's Philadelphia Phillies teammate, Hall of Famer Mike Schmidt. Others chose the online equivalent of spitting disgustedly on the ground. \"A very dark day for baseball,\" said Marcus Giamatti, son of the late baseball commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti, who banned Rose in 1989. On social media, many wondered whether Manfred had responded to President Donald Trump's stated desire that Rose be reinstated.",
      "The reality, though, is this: No matter what you think of Manfred's decision, baseball and the larger world around it collide far more often than the purists might wish \u2014 and have since the game's early decades.",
      "A national pastime can hardly avoid reflecting the values of the culture it serves. That means two things.",
      "\u2014 First, American society is built on stories. Where other civilizations have hundreds or thousands of years of common culture behind their nationhood, Americans willed their republic into existence on stories like the \u201cshining city upon a hill,\u201d \u201clife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,\u201d \u201call men are created equal.\u201d Then they built it out with tales of the frontier and erected industrial story factories like Hollywood and Madison Avenue. Isn't it natural, then, that the game many think helped define America would be built on some tall tales, too?",
      "\u2014 But second, this is a land of messy politics and jockeying for power and money and \u2014 let\u2019s face it \u2014 the silencing of less powerful groups. Who could expect a national pastime, however mythic its public-facing ambitions, not to interact with \u2014 and be affected by \u2014 the society in which it operates?",
      "That meant sharp-elbowed business machinations in the late 19th century that saw the rise and fall of an entirely new league in the course of a single season \u2014 and player-contract actions in its wake that led to criticism of the Pittsburgh Alleghenies as \u201cpiratical,\u201d inspiring a team nickname that has endured to this day.",
      "It meant the mob-backed, gambling-fueled \u201cthrowing\u201d of the 1919 World Series by several Chicago White Sox players \u2014 a group henceforth known as the \u201cBlack Sox\u201d \u2014 that led to the appointment of the first baseball commissioner, a man with the unlikely name of Kenesaw Mountain Landis. He almost immediately banned those accused of involvement from the game, including \u201cShoeless Joe,\" who was remythologized in the 1989 film \u201cField of Dreams.\u201d As of this week, Jackson has been reinstated \u2014 74 years after his death.",
      "It meant a game that reflected the racism of the nation around it, which kept Black men out until Jackie Robinson famously broke the color barrier in 1947. And it meant a policy on free agency that stacked the deck in favor of owners until a center fielder named Curt Flood, another Black man, took exception to it and took action, sending his name echoing across courtrooms and even Congress after saying: \"I do not feel I am a piece of property to be bought and sold.\"",
      "It meant no less than nine lockouts or strikes over the past six decades \u2014 underscoring that baseball, like many other American institutions, is not insulated from labor unrest. It meant cocaine scandals and PED scandals and sign-stealing scandals. Reckoning a century-plus of anxiety about the game's integrity with a suddenly betting-obsessed sports landscape foisted on baseball by a Supreme Court ruling. Arguments in zoning hearing boards, planning commissions, economic development conferences and city councils over new stadiums, bond issues, local referendums and attempts to figure out precisely where baseball teams fit into their communities.",
      "Politics even figured in attempts during the early 20th century to figure out where baseball came from.",
      "The Mills Commission, assembled in 1905 to suss out the game's origins, found itself confronted with two competing narratives: In one, put forth by baseball pioneer Henry Chadwick, the game evolved from something English. In the other \u2014 a convenient American narrative if there ever was one \u2014 a man named Abner Doubleday laid out a diamond in 1839 on a cow pasture in upstate New York, and baseball was born.",
      "The bucolic Doubleday narrative, endorsed by the commission and by baseball itself, flourished for decades. It was debunked long ago in favor of more diffuse origins, which is how history usually actually unfolds.",
      "But the legend's power pushed it into the national conversation to the point that the place where Doubleday purportedly invented the game became not only the home to the Hall of Fame but a metaphor for greatness, baseball and otherwise: Cooperstown.",
      "None of this should surprise us. Ultimately, baseball is a lively collage of American life \u2014 a game, a business, a political arena, a form of professional entertainment. It has been a repository of a rising nation's big dreams, of children's hero worship, of teenagers' ambitions and old men's laments.",
      "\u201cBaseball is play, not work \u2014 even when played by professionals, for whom it is indeed work \u2014 and so stands aside from the normal conduct of everyday life: business, economy, government,\u201d John Thorn, Major League Baseball\u2019s official historian, said Wednesday.",
      "It certainly tries. On Wednesday night, Cincinnati \u2014 the team with which Rose is most associated in a city where his mythology never flagged \u2014 honored him. People posed in front of a statue of him. The word \u201clegend\u201d was tossed around. In a twist worthy of a \u201cTwilight Zone\u201d episode, Rose's old team happened to be playing the Chicago White Sox \u2014 Jackson's old team.",
      "Many fans go to ballparks to escape the world. My late father, a Cleveland fan born in 1922 three years after the Black Sox scandal, used to say in his older years that the Indians\u2019 old stomping ground, League Park, where he used to go as a boy, was \u201ca refuge from the things I worried about.\u201d",
      "At every pro baseball game, all of the calibrated trappings make one thing easy to conclude: The game thinks of itself as pure and wants others to think that too. Sometimes, though, the magic is in the blemishes. Each time the real world intrudes on baseball, many argue that the game emerges stronger \u2014 even as it struggles to stay relevant in a 21st-century marketplace of sports and entertainment.",
      "And as it grows harder and harder for baseball \u2014 for anything, really \u2014 to be insulated from the reality of the world, myths have a tougher time taking hold. In that vein, we'll leave the final words to Pete Rose himself, from an interview in 2014 \u2014 a rejection of mythology from a ballplayer long enveloped in myth.",
      "\"When guys do books or stories,\" he said, \"all I like to see is the truth.\"",

Hopefully we love it in December too,\u201d said Schroeder, who is in his second year leading the league's scheduling team. \u201cWe have a lot of great matchups, and the flexibility of those new TV deals that every game could go into any widow, I think that's the key and to marry that with a team that is relentless in their effort, I think led to a fun and really great schedule.\u201d",
      "Even though the league announced the release date during the first round of the NFL Draft on April 24, the schedule wasn't totally finalized until Tuesday.",
      "Because some of the games started to be announced on Monday during network upfront presentations to advertisers, those matchups were locked in on Sunday night.",
      "The biggest final-minute decision with the early announced games came with the Fox Week 16 Saturday doubleheader on Dec. 20. The league knew it wanted Packers vs. Bears and Eagles vs. Commanders, but didn't finalize the home teams until Sunday night.",
      "If ever there was a year where the league could opt to move the Buffalo-Kansas City game from CBS to prime time, this was the one.",
      "However, the Week 9 matchup will again be on CBS and is the only 4:25 p.m. game on Nov. 2. Going into this season, Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen have faced each other nine times, including the playoffs. The first matchup in 2020 was on Fox with the rest being on CBS.",
      "\u201cTo be documenting the story of these franchises and star quarterbacks, we're thrilled to keep telling it,\u201d CBS Sports president and CEO David Berson said.",
      "CBS also got what could be the most-watched game during the regular season with Kansas City visiting Dallas on Thanksgiving Day. The most-watched Thanksgiving game was in 2022 when the New York Giants win over Dallas averaged 42.06 million on Fox.",
      "The Chiefs and Bills are both slated to have nine games on CBS.",
      "It is rare that a Super Bowl rematch airs on the network that carried the game, but Fox gets Kansas City visiting Philadelphia on Week 2 in the 4:25 p.m. EDT window.",
      "Getting the rematch satisfied a couple of requests that Fox made to the league. The network wants more variety in its late afternoon window, and is also getting more quality matchups when the top AFC teams play on their network.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to be so reliant on the Dallas Cowboys. I think we hear complaints sometimes that fans feel like it gets a little bit monotonous that our 4:25 window is dominated by one team,\u201d said Mike Mulvihill, Fox Sports president, insight and analytics. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly still going to have our share of Dallas games, but we\u2019re going to have some Philly in there too. We\u2019re also going to have Buffalo, Cincinnati, Kansas City, Detroit, Washington. I think it is pretty different than what you\u2019re used to seeing on Fox, and I think it\u2019s actually going to be a little bit better.\u201d",
      "NBC not only has the Kickoff game between Dallas and Philadelphia on Sept. 4, it has the matchup between the last two NFL MVPs when Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens visit Allen and Buffalo on Sept. 7 on \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d.",
      "ABC will have 13 \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d games \u2014 11 simulcasts with ESPN and two exclusive games. There will also be two MNF doubleheaders on Sept. 15 and Oct. 20. The Week 7 doubleheader will have the late game between Houston and Seattle streamed on ESPN+.",
      "\u201cThursday Night Football on Prime Video\u201d features all 14 playoff teams from last year as well as 10 divisional matchups. Prime Video concludes its regular-season slate with Denver at Kansas City on Christmas night. The Black Friday game between Chicago and Philadelphia will also include an NBA doubleheader afterward.",
      "Derek Carr's retirement did not have any impact on New Orleans' schedule. The Saints were already in a rebuilding mode under new coach Kellen Moore and join Cleveland and Tennessee as the only teams not slated to make a prime time appearance.",
      "Pittsburgh is already a national brand, so the waiting game on if Aaron Rodgers suits up in black and yellow or who will be Mike Tomlin's quarterback also didn't have much of a factor. The Steelers \u2014 along with AFC North rivals Baltimore and Cincinnati \u2014 have four prime time games.",
      "However, in case Rodgers decides to sign with Pittsburgh, his Week 1 opponent will be at the New York Jets and former Steelers quarterback Justin Fields.",

      "LAS VEGAS -- The Oilers are about a lot more than Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl, something the Golden Knights learned the hard way.",
      "For Edmonton to get through to the Western Conference final for the second year in a row, it took a goalie who was benched earlier in these NHL playoffs and a forward who wasn\u2019t in the lineup until Monday.",
      "Kasperi Kapanen scored on a scramble in front of the net at 7:14 of overtime, and the Oilers beat Vegas 1-0 in Game 5 on Wednesday night to advance out of the second round.",
      "\u201cObviously, we win games with Leon and Connor leading the way,\u201d Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch said. \u201cThat\u2019s an absolute given. We won some games where our goalie outperformed their goalie. Then there\u2019s games where our depth guys came through and scored big goals. Hopefully, we\u2019re only halfway through this, but we\u2019re going to need contributions from everybody.\u201d",
      "The Oilers, who last season made it all the way to the Stanley Cup Final before losing in seven games to Florida, will play Dallas or Winnipeg in the next round. The Stars, who lead 3-1, will go for the series win Thursday night.",
      "Kapanen\u2019s goal backed up another shutout performance from goalie Stuart Skinner, who made 24 saves and drew several chants of \u201cStu! Stu!\u201d from Oilers fans in the crowd. Skinner, who was benched two games into the playoffs, also blanked the Golden Knights in Game 4. This was his third start in a row in replacing the injured Calvin Pickard.",
      "And Kapanen was a spectator the first nine games of the playoffs before finally getting his chance in Game 4. Given the other players on the roster, Kapanen said he understood why he was initially left out.",
      "\u201cThe team was playing really well, so we weren't changing with the lineup, which is understandable,\" Kapanen said. \u201cThe most important thing is the team winning and now us advancing. I knew eventually I'd probably get a chance. Just being patient and being ready.\u201d",
      "Adin Hill made 29 saves for Vegas, which is out of the playoffs by the midway point for the second year in a row. The Golden Knights, who won the Stanley Cup two seasons ago, came into the playoffs as the Pacific Division champion and with the second-best record in the Western Conference.",
      "\u201cAny time you have a good team, you feel like you didn't finish what you set out to do,\u201d Golden Knights defenseman Alex Pietrangelo said. \u201cWe've got a hell of a team. It's disappointing. It's a hard league to win. We knew that going in.\u201d",
      "Both teams also were involved in the two most recent scoreless playoff games to reach overtime. The Oilers lost to Winnipeg on May 21, 2021, five days after the Golden Knights were defeated by Minnesota.",
      "Edmonton\u2019s only 1-0 overtime playoff victory occurred in 1997 over the Dallas. Vegas has yet to win a postseason game by that score in OT.",
      "The Golden Knights played without captain Mark Stone because of an upper-body injury that caused him to miss most of Game 3 on Saturday. He played in Game 4 on Monday, but was far from at full health.",
      "Neither team scored through the first two periods, and prime scoring chances were at a premium. There were only five high-danger chances, according to Natural Stat Trick, and the Golden Knights had four of them.",
      "But each team had a grade-A chance early in the third period. Vegas\u2019 Brett Howden whiffed on a tap-in after taking a fantastic pass from Jack Eichel, and shortly after Draistaitl failed to convert on a breakaway. McDavid had a chance on a 2-on-1 to end the game in regulation but was denied by Hill with 1:06 left.",

      "Golden State presented far more of a defensive challenge than the Los Angeles Lakers did for Minnesota during their five-game series in the first round, but the collection of every-level scorers the Wolves can throw at an opponent when they\u2019re moving the ball and pushing the pace simply wore down the Warriors over the course of the series.",
      "Rudy Gobert was a force around the rim with 17 points, Mike Conley had 16 points and eight assists, and Donte DiVincenzo snapped out of a slump with 13 points as the Wolves shot a staggering 77% on 2-pointers (36 for 47). They set franchise postseason records for assists (36) and field goal percentage (62.8%).",
      "Series close-out games can sometimes be the toughest to win, but the Wolves played with a ferocity paired with their shooting touch that all but portended victory. Randle kept up his superb postseason, providing a constant source of energy and production.",
      "The Wolves stretched their lead as high as 25 points in the third quarter, large enough to withstand a late Warriors push that pulled them to 99-90 with 7:11 left. But Edwards answered with a 3, and the crowd started mixing \u201cWolves in 5! Wolves in 5!\u201d chants in with the roars for each made basket that got them closer to advancing.",

      "Colorado has struggled out of the gate in many games. It has been outscored 44-15 in first innings. In their last two losses at Texas, Rockies pitching allowed three runs to the first three hitters Tuesday, and four through the first four Wednesday.",

      "The Dodgers haven\u2019t been sleeping on Rushing\u2019s talent. He was hitting .308 with five home runs and 17 RBI at Oklahoma City. He caught Clayton Kershaw during the three-time Cy Young Award winner\u2019s recent rehab assignment.",
      "\u201cObviously he\u2019s seen 17 more years of Major League Baseball than I have, so I got to learn plenty from those four or five innings,\u201d Rushing said.",
      "At the same time as Rushing's new beginning, the end came for Austin Barnes. The longest-tenured position player on the team was designated for assignment after 11 seasons and two World Series championships. Barnes, the backup catcher to Will Smith, was hitting .214 with three doubles and two RBI.",
      "\u201cAustin\u2019s been a mainstay for our club, so it\u2019s certainly not easy,\u201d manager Dave Roberts said, \u201cbut I think that the performance from Dalton kind of really sped this up.\u201d",

      "Roberts plans to have Rushing catch twice a week and pinch-hit while catching bullpen sessions.",

      "Rushing has been in the Dodgers' organization for four years and was their minor league player of the year in 2024, when he hit 26 home runs and drove in 85 runs between stints in Double-A and Triple-A. Like starting catcher Will Smith, he attended the University of Louisville.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my job to show up here and one, help the team win, but two, just make his job as easy as possible,\u201d Rushing said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to make my job easy, but also there\u2019s a helping hand that I can give to make his job easy as well.\u201d",
      "Barnes was with the Dodgers for 11 seasons, with 35 homers and 162 RBI in 612 games. Roberts said he took the news \u201clike a pro.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Responding to complaints from the tech industry and other countries, the U.S. Department of Commerce has rescinded a Biden-era rule due to take effect Thursday that placed limits on the number of artificial intelligence chips that could be exported to certain international markets without federal approval.",
      "\u201cThese new requirements would have stifled American innovation and saddled companies with burdensome new regulatory requirements,\u201d the Commerce Department stated in its guidance.",
      "President Joe Biden established the export framework shortly before he left office in an attempt to balance national security concerns about the technology with the economic interests of producers and other countries. While the United States had already restricted exports to adversaries such as China and Russia, some of those controls had loopholes and the rule would have set limits on a much broader group of countries, including Middle Eastern countries that President Donald Trump is visiting this week.",
      "The Biden rule's sorting more than 100 countries into different tiers of export restrictions drew strong opposition from those countries, as well as U.S. chipmakers like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. They argued the restrictions could actually push some countries to turn to China instead of the U.S. for their AI technology.",
      "What Biden's rule did \"was send a message to 120 nations that they couldn\u2019t necessarily count on us to provide the AI they want and need,\u201d said Brad Smith, Microsoft's president, at a U.S. Senate hearing last week.",
      "Commerce Undersecretary Jeffery Kessler said Tuesday that President Donald Trump's administration will work to replace the now-rescinded rule to pursue AI with \"trusted foreign countries around the world, while keeping the technology out of the hands of our adversaries.\" The administration said a replacement rule is coming in the future but hasn't said what the new rule will say.",
      "The European Commission welcomed the change, said spokesperson Thomas Regnier, arguing that the Biden rule, if it took effect, would \"undermine U.S. diplomatic relations with dozens of countries by downgrading them to second-tier status.\u201d",
      "European Union countries should be able to buy advanced AI chips from the U.S. without limitations, Regnier said.",
      "\u201cWe cooperate closely, in particular in the field of security, and represent an economic opportunity for the U.S., not a security risk,\u201d he said in a statement.",

      "A Brazilian scientist whose work shows farmers how to shift crop production toward more biologically based solutions instead of chemical fertilizers is being honored with this year\u2019s World Food Prize",
      "DES MOINES, Iowa -- A Brazilian scientist who pushed back against chemical fertilizers and researched biologically based approaches to more robust food production has been honored with this year\u2019s World Food Prize, the organization announced Tuesday.",
      "Microbiologist Mariangela Hungria's research helped her country become an agricultural powerhouse, an accomplishment that has now won her $500,000 from the Iowa-based World Food Prize Foundation. Hungria has been researching biological seed and soil treatments for 40 years, and has worked with Brazilian farmers to implement her findings.",
      "\u201cI still cannot believe it. Everybody said, my whole life, it's improbable, you are going the wrong way, just go to things like chemicals and so on. And then, I received the most important prize in the world of agriculture,\" Hungria said in an interview. \"Sometimes I still think I'll wake up and see that it's not true.\u201d",
      "Norman Borlaug, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for his work to dramatically increase crop yields and reduce the threat of starvation in many countries, founded the World Food Prize. Since the first prize was handed out in 1987, 55 people have been honored.",
      "Hungria said she grew up wanting to alleviate hunger. Early in her career, she decided to focus on a process called biological nitrogen fixation, in which soil bacteria could be used to promote plant growth. At that time, farmers in Brazil and around the world were reluctant to reduce their use of nitrogen fertilizers, which dramatically increase crop production but lead to greenhouse gas emissions and pollutes waterways.",
      "Hungria studied how bacteria can interact with plant roots to naturally produce nitrogen. She then demonstrated her work on test plots and began working directly with farmers to convince them that they wouldn't have to sacrifice high crop yields if they switched to a biological process.",
      "The work is credited for increasing yields of several crops, including wheat, corn and beans, but it has been especially affective on soybeans. Brazil has since become the world's largest soybean producer, surpassing the United States and Argentina.",
      "Although Hungria's research could be applied on farms in other countries, soybean production in the U.S. is different than it is in Brazil; American farmers typically rotate crops on their land between growing corn and soybeans. Enough nitrate fertilizer applied to corn still remains in the soil when soybeans are planted that little or no fertilizer needs to be applied, Hungria said.",
      "Brazilian agricultural companies have faced fierce criticism for clearing forested land to create farmland, largely to grow soybeans.",
      "Much of that criticism is justified, Hungria said, but she added that her biological approach builds up the soil and makes further encroachment into forested areas less necessary.",
      "\u201cIf you manage the crop well, the crop will enrich the soil with nitrogen. Soil health improves if you do the right things,\u201d she said.",
      "Hungria will be awarded her prize at an annual October gathering in Des Moines, Iowa, of agricultural researchers and officials from around the world.",
      "Gebisa Ejeta, chair of the World Food Prize Laureate Selection Committee, credited Hungria for her \u201cextraordinary scientific achievements\u201d that have transformed agriculture in South America.",
      "\"Her brilliant scientific work and her committed vision for advancing sustainable crop production to feed humanity with judicious use of chemical fertilizer inputs and biological amendments has gained her global recognition both at home and abroad,\u201d Ejeta said in a statement.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Major social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram and X have failed to protect LGBTQ+ users from hate and harassment, in part, because they intentionally rolled back previous safety practices, the advocacy group GLAAD said Tuesday in its annual Social Media Safety Index.",
      "The report said that recent \u201cunprecedented hate speech policy rollbacks\u201d from Instagram and Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Google's YouTube are \u201cactively undermining the safety of LGBTQ people\u201d both online and offline. Meta\u2019s rollback now allows users to call LGBTQ people \u201cmentally ill,\u201d among other policy changes.",
      "The scorecard assigns numeric ratings to each platform with regard to LGBTQ safety, privacy, and expression. Elon Musk's X received the lowest score at 30 out of 100, while TikTok came in highest at 56. Meta's Facebook, Instagram, Threads and Google's YouTube were in the 40s. The group's methodology has changed since last year, so the scores are not directly comparable to previous reports.",
      "\u201cAt a time when real-world violence and harassment against LGBTQ people is on the rise, social media companies are profiting from the flames of anti-LGBTQ hate instead of ensuring the basic safety of LGBTQ users,\" said Sarah Kate Ellis, GLAAD's president and CEO.",
      "While X has received the lowest scores since Musk's takeover of the platform in 2022 \u2014 when it was called Twitter \u2014 Meta's backslide can largely be attributed to its recent policy shift. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in January that Meta is removing restrictions on topics like immigration and gender \u201cthat are out of touch with mainstream discourse,\u201d citing \u201crecent elections\u201d as a catalyst. GLAAD calls the rollback \u201dparticularly extreme.\"",
      "Representatives for Meta, TikTok and X did not immediately respond to messages for comment on Monday afternoon.",
      "GLAAD said Google recently removed \u201cgender identity and expression\u201d from YouTube's list of protected characteristic groups, which suggests that the platform is \"no longer protecting transgender, nonbinary, and gender-nonconforming people from hate and discrimination.\"",
      "Google says this is not the case.",
      "\u201cWe confirmed earlier this year our hate speech policy hasn\u2019t changed. We have strict policies against content that promotes hatred or violence against members of the LGBTQ+ community and we continue to be vigilant in our efforts to quickly detect and remove this content,\u201d Google said in a statement.",
      "Although GLAAD acknowledges Google's statement, the organization stresses that gender identity has not been restored as a protected characteristic on YouTube's hate speech policy page.",
      "\u201cYouTube should reverse this dangerous policy change and update its \u2018Hate Speech\u2019 policy to expressly include gender identity and expression as a protected characteristic,\u201d the report says.",
      "GLAAD's report makes policy recommendations for protecting LGBTQ users, though it's unclear if the platforms will take these up, given that many have rolled back such protections. For instance, GLAAD says platforms should protect LGBTQ people from hate, harassment and violence, prohibit targeted misgendering and \u201cdeadnaming\u201d of transgender users and explain steps it takes to stop wrongfully removing or demonetizing legitimate accounts and content related to LGBTQ topics.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Players swiping their way through more than 18,700 levels of Candy Crush Saga might be surprised to learn they\u2019re solving puzzles designed with an assist from artificial intelligence.",
      "The app that helped make gamers out of anyone with a smartphone uses AI to help developers create levels to serve a captive audience constantly looking for more sweets to squash. King, the Swedish video game developer behind Candy Crush, also uses AI to update older levels to help ensure players don't feel bored, stuck or frustrated as they spend time with the game.",
      "Todd Green, general manager of the Candy Crush franchise, said using AI in that way helps free up developers' time to create new puzzle boards. It would be \"extremely difficult,\" he said, for designers to update and reconfigure more than 18,000 levels without AI taking a first pass.",
      "Within the video game industry, discussions around the use of AI in game development run the gamut. Some game makers see AI as a tool that can assist with menial tasks, allowing designers and artists to focus on bigger projects. AI, they say, can help build richer worlds by creating more interactive non-player characters, for example. But there are also those who strongly oppose the use of AI, or who see the tech as a threat to their livelihoods \u2014 be it as video game actors and performers, or as workers who help make games. Concerns over AI led game performers with the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists to go on strike in late July.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not putting chatbots into the game. We\u2019re not putting AI-powered design experiences into the game for players directly to play with,\u201d Green said, adding that the tech is not being used to replace game workers. \u201cInstead, we\u2019re trying to deploy AI on existing problems that we have in order to make the work of the teams faster or more accurate, and more accurate more quickly.\u201d",
      "In the United States, consumer spending on video game content increased to $51.3 billion in 2024, up from $49.8 billion in 2023, with mobile games accounting for about half of all video game content spending, according to data from the Entertainment Software Association trade group. Mobile is now the leading game platform among players aged 8 and older, the ESA says.",
      "Candy Crush \u2014 first launched on Facebook in 2012 \u2014 is constantly updating. King recently released its 300th client version of the game. Gaming giant Activision Blizzard acquired King in 2016 for $5.9 billion.",
      "The free-to-play game is in a unique position, said Joost Van Dreunen, author of \u201cOne Up: Creativity, Competition, and the Global Business of Video Games.\u201d Candy Crush is more than a decade old, boasts millions of users and caters to a \u201cravenous set of players,\" he said. Demand is so high for new content that it makes sense to use AI to offset the work it takes to create so many levels, Van Dreunen added.",
      "\u201cTo supply that at scale, you absolutely can rely on a sort of artificial intelligence or generative AI to create the next set of forms,\u201d he said. \u201cThe thing about Candy Crush is that every level is technically a single board that you have to solve or clear before you can advance. With AI and the existing library of human-made boards, it makes total sense to then accelerate and expand the efforts to just create more inventory. People play more levels.\u201d",
      "King uses AI to target two separate areas: developing new levels and going back to older levels, in some cases, puzzles that are several years old, and reworking them to ensure they're still worth playing. On new levels designed for people who have played the game for a long time, the company wants to ensure the puzzles are fun \u201con first contact.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s hard for us to do, because we don\u2019t get the benefit of having many players test or play through the levels and give us feedback. We have to sort of try and pitch it right at first,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a really important group for us in between people who maybe played before and perhaps took a break for a while, and then coming back because they saw or heard of or were curious about what might be new.\u201d",
      "Green said King uses AI as a behind-the-scenes assistant in the design \u201cloop\u201d of the game, rather than as a tool that immediately puts something new in front of players.",
      "\u201cDoing that for 1,000 levels all at once is very difficult by hand,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the most important thing to understand here is that we are using AI as like a custom design.\u201d",
      "For most players, Green said, the fun in solving the puzzles lies in the \u201cup and down.\u201d Levels aren't designed in order of difficulty. An easy level can follow a few difficult levels \u2014 or vice versa \u2014 to give the game a sense of variety. Leveraging AI means that instead of the team working on several hundred levels each week, they could potentially improve thousands of levels per week because they're able to automate the drafting of the improved levels, he added.",
      "\u201cWe talk to players all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also get the quantitative feedback. We can see how players respond to the levels... How easy are the levels? Do they get sort of stuck, or are they progressing in the way that we hope?\u201d",
      "To determine whether gamers and playing through the way the designers intended, King looks at several factors, including pass rate \u2014 how many times a player passes a level out of every 100 attempts \u2014 and how often a board is \u201creshuffled,\u201d or refreshed with all candies rearranged. Some metrics are also intangible, like whether a level is simply fun.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s also, to some extent, obviously subjective,\u201d Green said. \u201cIt\u2019s different for different people.\u201d",

    "summary": "Many autism experts say the Trump administration's plan to find autism's causes is unrealistic",
    "story": [
      "Many autism experts say the Trump administration's plan to find autism's causes is unrealistic",
      "WASHINGTON -- For many experts, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2019s promise for \u201cpulling back the curtain\u201d to find autism's causes in a few months is jarring \u2014 and unrealistic.",
      "That\u2019s because it appears to ignore decades of science linking about 200 genes that play a role \u2014 and the quest to understand differences inside the brain that can be present at birth.",
      "\u201cVirtually all the evidence in the field suggests whatever the causes of autism \u2014 and there\u2019s going to be multiple causes, it\u2019s not going to be a single cause \u2014 they all affect how the fetal brain develops,\u201d said longtime autism researcher David Amaral of the UC Davis MIND Institute.",
      "\u201cEven though we may not see the behaviors associated with autism until a child is 2 or 3 years old, the biological changes have already taken place,\u201d he said.",
      "Kennedy on Wednesday announced the National Institutes of Health would create a new database \u201cto uncover the root causes of autism and other chronic diseases\u201d by merging Medicaid and Medicare insurance claims with electronic medical records and other data. He has cited rising autism rates as evidence of an epidemic of a \u201cpreventable disease\u201d caused by some sort of environmental exposure and has promised \u201csome of the answers by September.\u201d",
      "Autism isn\u2019t considered a disease. It's a complex brain disorder better known as autism spectrum disorder, to reflect that it affects different people in different ways.",
      "Symptoms vary widely. For some people, profound autism means being nonverbal and having significant intellectual disabilities. Others have far milder effects, such as difficulty with social and emotional skills.",
      "Autism rates are rising \u2014 not among profound cases but milder ones, said autism expert Helen Tager-Flusberg of Boston University.",
      "That's because doctors gradually learned that milder symptoms were part of autism\u2019s spectrum, leading to changes in the late 1990s and early 2000s in diagnosis guidelines and qualifications for educational services, she said.",
      "The link between genes and autism dates back to studies of twins decades ago. Some are rare genetic variants passed from parent to child, even if the parent shows no signs of autism.",
      "But that's not the only kind. As the brain develops, rapidly dividing cells make mistakes that can lead to mutations in only one type of cell or one part of the brain, Amaral explained.",
      "Noninvasive testing can spot differences in brain activity patterns in babies who won't be diagnosed with autism until far later, when symptoms become apparent, he said.",
      "Those kinds of changes stem from alterations in brain structure or its neural circuitry \u2014 and understanding them requires studying brain tissue that\u2019s available only after death, said Amaral, who\u2019s the scientific director of a brain banking collaborative called Autism BrainNet. The bank, funded by the nonprofit Simons Foundation, has collected more than 400 donated brains, about half from people with autism and the rest for comparison.",
      "Researchers have identified other factors that can interact with genetic vulnerability to increase the risk of autism. They include the age of a child\u2019s father, whether the mother had certain health problems during pregnancy including diabetes, use of certain medications during pregnancy, and preterm birth.",
      "Any concern that measles vaccinations could be linked to autism has been long debunked, stressed Tager-Flusberg, who leads a new Coalition of Autism Scientists pushing back on administration misstatements about the condition.",
      "The U.S., with its fragmented health care system, will never have the kind of detailed medical tracking available in countries like Denmark and Norway \u2014 places with national health systems where research shows similar rises in autism diagnoses and no environmental smoking gun.",
      "Experts say Kennedy's planned database isn't appropriate to uncover autism's causes in part because there's no information about genetics.",
      "But researchers have long used insurance claims and similar data to study other important questions, such as access to autism services. And the NIH described the upcoming database as useful for studies focusing on access to care, treatment effectiveness and other trends.",

      "Paxton said the $1.4 billion is the largest amount won by any state in a settlement with Google over this type of data-privacy violations.",
      "Texas previously reached two other key settlements with Google within the last two years, including one in December 2023 in which the company agreed to pay $700 million and make several other concessions to settle allegations that it had been stifling competition against its Android app store.",

      "What appeared next stunned those in the Phoenix courtroom last week: An AI-generated video with a likeness of her brother, Christopher Pelkey, told the shooter he was forgiven.",
      "The judge said he loved and appreciated the video, then sentenced the shooter to 10.5 years in prison \u2014 the maximum sentence and more than what prosecutors sought. Within hours of the hearing on May 1, the defendant's lawyer filed a notice of appeal.",
      "Defense attorney Jason Lamm won't be handling the appeal, but said a higher court will likely be asked to weigh in on whether the judge improperly relied on the AI-generated video when sentencing his client.",
      "Courts across the country have been grappling with how to best handle the increasing presence of artificial intelligence in the courtroom. Even before Pelkey\u2019s family used AI to give him a voice for the victim impact portion \u2014 believed to be a first in U.S. courts \u2014 the Arizona Supreme Court created a committee that researches best AI practices.",

      "AI can be very persuasive, Harris said, and scholars are studying the intersection of the technology and manipulation tactics.",
      "Cynthia Godsoe, a law professor at Brooklyn Law School and a former public defender, said as this technology continues to push the boundaries of traditional legal practices, courts will have to confront questions they have never before had to weigh: Does this AI photograph really match the witness's testimony? Does this video exaggerate the suspect's height, weight, or skin color?",
      "\u201cIt's definitely a disturbing trend,\" she said, \u201cbecause it could veer even more into fake evidence that maybe people don't figure out is false.\u201d",
      "In the Arizona case, the victim's sister told The Associated Press that she did consider the \u201cethics and morals\u201d of writing a script and using her brother's likeness to give him a voice during the sentencing hearing.",
      "\u201cIt was important to us to approach this with ethics and morals and to not use it to say things that Chris wouldn\u2019t say or believe,\" Stacey Wales said.",
      "Victims can give their impact statements in any digital format in Arizona, said victims\u2019 rights attorney Jessica Gattuso, who represented the family.",
      "When the video played in the courtroom, Wales said only she and her husband knew about it.",
      "\u201cThe goal was to humanize Chris and to reach the judge,\u201d Wales said.",

      "\u201cIt also says something about the family,\" he said. \u201cBecause you told me how angry you were, and you demanded the maximum sentence, and even though that's what you wanted, you allowed Chris to speak from his heart as you saw it.\u201d",

      "Previous research has shown that chimps have their own signature drumming style. A new analysis of 371 bouts of chimpanzee drumming demonstrates that the chimps \u201cclearly play their instruments -- the tree trunks -- with regular rhythms,\u201d said University of Amsterdam music cognition researcher Henkjan Honing, who was not involved in the study.",
      "When bounding through the jungle, chimps will often grab hold of the tall buttress roots of rainforest trees. Sometimes they pound them several times to create low-frequency sounds that can be heard for a kilometer or more through the forest.",
      "Scientists believe that the drumming is a form of long-distance communication, perhaps to alert other chimps where one chimp is waiting or the direction it is traveling.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a way of socially checking in,\u201d said Hobaiter, adding that each chimp has its own \u201cindividual signature \u2014 a pattern of beats that allows you to recognize who\u2019s producing that drumming.\u201d",
      "The new work showed that chimps from different regions of Africa drum with distinctly different rhythms, with western chimps preferring a more even beat while eastern chimps used varied short and long intervals between beats.

While space debris trackers around the world converged in their forecasts, it was still too soon to know exactly when and where the spacecraft known as Kosmos 482 would come down.

      "Opening arguments got underway Monday in the highly anticipated trial of hip-hop mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, who has been accused of sex trafficking by force, transportation to engage in prostitution, and racketeering conspiracy as part of a blockbuster federal indictment originally filed in September 2024. He later faced two additional superseding indictments. Combs has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges.",
      "Combs is accused of being the ringleader of an alleged enterprise that \"abused, threatened and coerced women\" into prolonged, drug-fueled sexual orgies with male prostitutes, which he called \"freak offs,\" and then threatened them into silence. Combs has said that all of the sex was consensual and that while his relationships sometimes involved domestic violence, he wasn't engaged in trafficking. His lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, said Combs was simply part of the swinger lifestyle and that he \"vehemently denies the accusations made by the SDNY\" and \"looks forward to his day in court.\"",
      "Defense suggests Ventura wanted more from Combs relationship than just participating in his 'fantasies'",
      "After testifying for two days that Sean Combs forced her into sexual encounters with male prostitutes under threat of violence and reputational harm, Cassie Ventura was confronted on cross-examination by messages that appeared to show her reluctance was only because she wanted more from the relationship.",
      "\u201cWhen we used to freak off when were so in love. There were no questions asked, it felt right, like it literally made sense for the next step in our sex life together,\" Ventura wrote in a message to Combs from December 2009. \"I get nervous that I\u2019m just becoming the girlfriend that you get your fantasies off with and that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t get the other part.\"",
      "\u201cAt the time you were afraid that you were being treated as someone who he could just get his fantasies off with?\u201d defense attorney Anna Estevao asked.",
      "\u201cThat was a concern,\u201d Ventura answered.",
      "Estevao asked Ventura whether \"freak offs\" were a \u201cdefining feature\u201d of their relationship.",
      "\u201cIt became a very integral part of our relationship early on,\u201d Ventura responded.",
      "\u201cAnd you wanted your relationship to develop more?\u201d Estevao asked.",
      "\u201cRight,\u201d Ventura said.",
      "The defense showed the court additional explicit messages, meant to support their contention that Ventura was an eager sexual partner who shared Combs\u2019 desires.",
      "In one August 2009 message exchange, Ventura expressed, with explicit detail, excitement about a then-forthcoming sexual event.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t wait. That\u2019s what I want to see,\u201d Combs replied.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t wait either,\u201d Ventura wrote back.",
      "Ventura questioned about loving, explicit messages exchanged with Combs",
      "Ventura testified that she loved Combs and believed he loved her, and that the two exchanged \u201cloving\u201d messages.",
      "The jury was shown one such message from early in their relationship. \u201cIt makes me so happy that you would fly to ATL just to see me. I\u2019m a very lucky man,\u201d an email from Combs read.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a very lucky woman. I miss you so much. I\u2019d fly wherever you needed me, whenever,\u201d Ventura sent in reply.",
      "\u201cWhat about him made you fall in love with him?\u201d defense attorney Anna Estevao asked Ventura.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t thought about it in a while,\" Ventura responded. \"The beginning of the relationship, I spoke about it already, it was really fast, fast-paced, scary. But the more time I spent with him and got to know him his real personality, or at least what I thought was his real personality, came out,\u201d",
      "Ventura further testified that Combs in the early stages of their relationship was \u201cvery sweet, attentive.\u201d",
      "The jury was shown an August 2009 message from Combs to Ventura, telling her to look at his latest tweet. Ventura responded \u201cOMG!!! Pop pop \u2026 Can I respond or write something about my man,\" using a nickname for Combs that she testified on Tuesday Combs had requested.",
      "Ventura testified that at the time she was looking forward to going public about their relationship.",
      "In another message, from April 4, 2010, two-and-a-half years into their relationship, Ventura sent a message to Combs that read \u201cI love you so much it consumes my life.\u201d",
      "The defense has argued that Ventura was not sex trafficked, as the prosecution claims, but rather was a willing partner in what the defense has described as Combs\u2019 \u201cswingers lifestyle.\u201d Ventura pushed back against a defense attorney\u2019s suggestion that she willingly partook in so-called \"freak off\" sex sessions.",
      "\u201cTo make him happy you told him that you wanted to do 'freak offs',\u201d defense attorney Anna Estevao said.",
      "\u201cNo,\u201d Ventura replied. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more to that.\u201d",
      "Estevao then confronted Ventura with a message from August 5, 2009, in which Ventura told Combs, \u201cI\u2019m always ready to 'freak off.'\u201d",
      "Two days later, the defense said Ventura sent Combs an explicit message expressing excitement about participating in a sexual event.",
      "Combs responded, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to watch you. I want you to get real hot.\u201d",
      "Ventura replied, \u201cMe too. I just want it to be uncontrollable.\u201d",
      "After the defense introduced an additional, explicit, message, Ventura asked the judge for a break.",
      "Defense begins cross-examination of Cassie Ventura",
      "Defense lawyer Anna Estevao said she expected the cross-examination of Cassie Ventura to last all of Thursday and into Friday. Federal prosecutors told the judge that Ventura must finish her testimony by the end of the day Friday because she \u201cis very, very pregnant\u201d and could go into labor soon.",
      "\u201cWe are afraid she could have the baby over the weekend,\u201d Assistant United States Attorney Maurene Comey said.",
      "Ventura took the witness stand in a long black tuxedo-like jacket covering a light-colored blouse.",
      "Combs, clad in light-colored pants, shirt and sweater, watched her enter. His family is seated in the gallery",
      "\u201cYou and Sean Combs were in love for 11 years, right?\u201d Estevao's questioning began.",
      "\u201cYeah,\u201d Ventura responded.",
      "Cassie Ventura takes the stand ahead of cross-examination",
      "Cassie Ventura has taken the witness stand for the third consecutive day, with defense cross-examination scheduled to begin this morning following two days of her testimony against Sean 'Diddy' Combs.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court heard arguments over President Donald Trump\u2019s effort to roll back nationwide injunctions blocking his executive order on birthright citizenship.",
    "story": [
      "The justices on Thursday considered the legality of nationwide injunctions.",
      "The Supreme Court on Thursday heard oral arguments over President Donald Trump's emergency request to roll back nationwide injunctions blocking his executive order to end birthright citizenship.",
      "The rare May sitting of the court sets the stage for a decision by this summer on whether Trump can move forward with plans to limit U.S. citizenship only to children born on American soil to lawful permanent residents.",
      "The case is also expected to address the legality of individual district court judges single-handedly blocking a presidential policy nationwide. Trump is seeking to dissolve judicial orders preventing mass federal layoffs, funding freezes, and expedited deportation protocols.",
      "For more than a century, courts and the government have interpreted the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause to apply to anyone born in the U.S., regardless of the citizenship status of a child's parents.",
      "The Amendment, ratified after the Civil War, states that all \"persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.\"",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer kicked off the first Supreme Court oral argument over Trump's second-term policies by arguing that the ability of one district judge to issue a nationwide order creates a fundamentally unfair legal playing field for the government.",
      "\"Our primary contention is that the citizenship clause related to the children of former slaves, not to illegal aliens who weren't even present as a discrete class at that time,\" he told the justices.",
      "Sauer said that national injunctions force district judges to rush their \"high stakes, low information decisions,\" encourage forum shopping, and prevent the \"percolation of novel and difficult legal questions.\"",
      "\"They operate asymmetrically, forcing the government to win everywhere, while the plaintiffs can win anywhere,\" said Sauer, who last year argued on behalf of Trump in a personal capacity to push for presidential immunity.",
      "His claim was immediately met with skepticism from Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who suggested that such a theory would not only limit the ability of the district court but also the Supreme Court from issuing nationwide relief.",
      "\"That makes no sense whatsoever,\" she said before making an analogy to when the balance of power shifts in Washington.",
      "\"When a new president orders that because there's so much gun violence going on in the country, and he comes in and he says, 'I have the right to take away the guns from everyone,' and he sends out the military to seize everyone's guns. We and the courts have to sit back and wait until every name plaintiff gets or every plaintiff whose gun is taken comes into court?\" she asked.",
      "On the issue of the legality of Trump's executive order to limit U.S. citizenship only to children born on American soil to lawful permanent residents, Sotomayor was clear on where she stood. The order, she said, was unlawful.",
      "\"As far as I see it, this order violates four Supreme Court precedents, and you are claiming that\u2026both the Supreme Court and no lower court can stop an executive from universally violating those holdings by this court,\" Sotomayor said.",
      "Both Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett pressed Sauer in a series of exchanges over whether eliminating nationwide injunctions could create a situation where unlawful executive orders are in place for too long a time before the Supreme Court can weigh in to rule on their legality.",
      "\"General Sauer, are you really going to answer Justice Kagan by saying there're no way to [stop the EO nationwide] expeditiously?\" Barrett asked.",
      "Sauer answered stating that using the normal process of the courts and applying clear cut Supreme Court precedent could ultimately settle such issues quickly.",
      "The exchange came as Justice Kagan questioned whether the impact of abolishing nationwide injunctions would effectively inject more chaos in the court system by requiring individual plaintiffs -- like those subject to having their citizenship revoked by Trump's birthright executive order -- to file piecemeal lawsuits in courts across the country.",
      "Sotomayor also pushed back against Sauer's arguments that the Supreme Court would benefit from the \"percolation\" of lower courts issuing opinions that would help the high court decide weighty issues over actions taken by the administration.",
      "\"We have most \u2026 courts who've percolated this issue and said, 'You're violating precedent, not only precedent, but the plain meaning of the 14th [Amendment] of the Constitution,\" she said.",
      "\"Respectfully, I think what we have are lower courts making snap judgments on the merits that ignore the fundamental principle of the 14th amendment -- that it was about giving citizenship to the children of slaves, not to the children of illegal immigrants,\" Sauer answered.",
      "But some of the justices suggested that the impact of limiting nationwide injunctions might be bearable. Chief Justice John Roberts noted that the Supreme Court has gotten better at hearing cases \"much more expeditiously,\" referencing how a legal challenge related to TikTok made its way through the court in a matter of months.",
      "\"We survived until the 1960s without universal injunctions,\" Justice Clarence Thomas added.",
      "Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson raised concerns that preventing federal judges from issuing nationwide orders would essentially create a \"Catch Me If You Can\" system of justice in which individual citizens can only protect their rights if they have the resources to file lawsuits.",

      "\u201cI think the 'Catch Me If You Can' problem operates in the opposite direction, where we have the government racing from jurisdiction to jurisdiction having to sort of clear the table in order to implement a new policy,\u201d he said.",
      "The justice system, he argued, should work more slowly and allow the \u201cpercolation\u201d of novel legal issues rather than rush to judgement, but Jackson pushed back, saying that delays could enable the enforcement of unlawful policies.",
      "\"If the government is saying no lower court can completely enjoin it, it actually means that the government just keeps on doing the purportedly unlawful thing, and it delays the ability for this court to reach the underlying issue ,\u201d she said",
      "On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order unilaterally declaring that only newborns whose parents have permanent legal status are \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the U.S. and therefore eligible to be citizens.",
      "\"This administration believes that birthright citizenship is unconstitutional,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt explained during a February briefing.",
      "Three different sets of plaintiffs sued to block the order, including a group of 22 states, immigrant advocacy groups, and pregnant women whose soon-to-be-born children would be affected.",
      "\"Birthright citizenship is at the core of our Nation's foundational precept that all people born on our soil are created equal, regardless of their parentage,\" attorneys for the immigrant advocates wrote in legal briefs.",
      "An estimated 150,000 children are born each year in the U.S. to parents who are not legal permanent residents, according to government data.",
      "\"Instead of the right to full participation and belonging in their home country -- the United States -- these children will be forced to live in the shadow,\" the states warned in court filings, \"under the constant risk of deportation while the appeals run their course.\"",
      "Federal judges in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington state -- and three federal appeals court panels -- have issued nationwide injunctions keeping the Trump policy on hold during litigation, concluding that it very likely violates the Constitution and high court precedent.",
      "\"I have been on the bench for over four decades. I can't remember another case where the case presented is as clear as it is here,\" said Judge John Coughenour of the Western District of Washington during a January hearing in the case. \"This is a blatantly unconstitutional order.\"",
      "In 1898, the Supreme Court directly addressed the question of citizenship for children born to non-citizens on U.S. soil, ruling in the landmark case U.S. v Wong Kim Ark that they are Americans under the law.",
      "\"The [14th] Amendment, in clear words and in manifest intent, includes the children born, within the territory of the United States, of all other persons, of whatever race or color, domiciled within the United States,\" wrote Justice Horace Gray for the 6-2 majority. \"Every citizen or subject of another country, while domiciled here, is within the allegiance and the protection, and consequently subject to the jurisdiction, of the United States.\"",
      "The issue arrives back at the high court in an unusual posture.",
      "Neither side has briefed the justices on the constitutionality of the executive order. Instead, the primary dispute is over the scope of injunctions issued by individual district court judges.",
      "\"It focuses only on whether it is appropriate for courts to issue nationwide injunctions against the President's egregiously unconstitutional executive order, as opposed to remedies limited to people directly involved in the litigation or those living in states that have sued the government,\" said Ilya Somin, a constitutional scholar at the Cato Institute.",
      "The Trump administration has complained that judges should only be allowed to block a contested policy insofar as it impacts the actual plaintiffs who brought the case -- not block it universally.",
      "\"Only this Court's intervention can prevent universal injunctions from becoming universally acceptable,\" acting solicitor general Sarah Harris wrote in the government's application to the court.",
      "Many of the administration's high-profile attempts to reshape the federal government, sharply curtail federal spending, transform immigration policy, and limit protections for LGBTQ people have been blocked by nationwide injunctions issued by district courts.",
      "Justice Department attorneys from administrations of both political parties have long complained about the overuse of nationwide injunctions and alleged incursion on executive branch power. The court may use this case to articulate parameters for when such sweeping injunctions are warranted and when they are not.",
      "\"This Court should declare that enough is enough before district courts' burgeoning reliance on universal injunctions becomes further entrenched,\" Harris said, calling on the justices to narrow the injunctions applied to the birthright citizenship order.",
      "Immigrant advocates, civil rights organizations, and Democratic state attorneys general have warned that blocking Trump's birthright citizenship in some places but not others -- or, exempting a small group of plaintiffs but not others -- would create chaos.",
      "\"A situation where Trump's order is in force for some people, but not others (or, alternatively, in some states but not others), creates obvious confusion and anomalies,\" he said, \"especially when it comes to a policy (citizenship rules) that is supposed to be uniform throughout the nation.\"",
      "Some legal scholars say it may be impossible for the court to address the question of nationwide injunctions without also resolving the underlying dispute over Trump's attempt to redefine birthright citizenship.",
      "\"They're going to have to address the whole thing,\" said Josh Blackman, a constitutional law scholar and professor at South Texas College of Law. \"The only way to avoid the scope of the injunction question is to rule on the merits. I believe they're going to rule against Trump. He gets maybe one or two votes but not much more than that.\"",

      "\"These reports indicate that Mr. Musk may be using his official role and his proximity to the President as leverage for his own personal financial benefit --- even if it comes at the expense of American consumers and the nation's foreign policy interests,\" the senators wrote. \"These actions raise questions about whether Mr. Musk or other administration officials may be violating ethics or other laws.\"",
      "The group of Senate Democrats, which includes a number of additional Democratic co-signers, said the Department of Justice and the White House designated agency ethics official should investigate \"whether Musk or other administration officials may have violated federal ethics law by abusing their official roles for the benefit of Starlink.\"",
      "The letter comes as Musk appeared alongside Trump during his first foreign trip of his second term. Musk was seated prominently as the president delivered remarks at the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday.",
      "During separate remarks at the same forum, Musk announced that Saudi Arabia had approved Starlink for aviation and maritime use in the region, raising concern from the senators.",
      "\"Musk announced that Saudi Arabia approved Starlink, just as the White House and U.S. tech companies announced defense and trade agreements with Saudi Arabia and a Saudi company,\" they wrote. \"Starlink stands to earn billions of dollars from unlocking access to these new markets.\"",
      "But the contract with Saudi Arabia is not the only example the senators cite. Starlink, the senators alleged, has seen a \"rush of new countries permitting the company to enter their markets\" since Trump took office. This, they said, comes after the company previously struggled to gain permits to operate in certain foreign markets.",
      "The letter cited Starlink's recent expansion into Bangladesh, which approved Starlink's access to its market shortly after a Bangladeshi government official met with Musk at the White House. The lawmakers argued there should be an inquiry into whether Musk's meeting with Bangladeshi officials violated ethics laws due to Musk's status as a special government employee.",
      "They also noted reports that India seems to have \"sped through\" approvals of Starlink while engaging in negotiations with the White House over tariffs.",
      "\"Suggesting that a foreign government adopt Starlink in exchange for relief on tariffs appears to be a textbook case of corruption,\" they wrote in the letter. \"The DOJ's Public Integrity Section is responsible for investigating potentially criminal conflicts of interest like this. The White House's Designated Agency Ethics Official can similarly investigate potential ethics violations by White House officials. We ask that the DOJ and the White House investigate whether any officials have pursued a quid-pro-quo exchange of Starlink access for tariff favors in violation of federal ethics law.\"",
      "\"It is completely false to claim that Elon Musk had or has anything to do with deals involving Starlink. This is just more fake news from media outlets determined to invent conflicts of interest that don't exist. For the umpteenth time, President Trump will not tolerate any conflicts of interest, and every administration official is following ethical guidelines set by their respective agencies,\" White House principal deputy press secretary Harrison Fields told ABC News.",
      "Trump earlier said he would make sure there was no conflict of interest involving Musk.",
      "\"If there's a conflict then we won't let him get near it. He would know not to do it, so we haven't had that yet. But if there was a conflict, we wouldn't let him work in that area,\" he said in February.",
      "ABC News has also reached out to Starlink for comment.",
      "Senate Democrats have been focused on Musk's role as a special government employee for some time, raising repeated concerns about conflicts of interest between the wealthiest man in the world's businesses and his governmental advisory role.",
      "This is the latest in a series of letters geared toward Musk in recent weeks, including a separate legislative push from Warren that would bar special government employees like Musk from communicating with government agencies that interface with their companies and would require these federal employees to meet new ethics requirements.",

    "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/gop-cut-medicaid-harder-2017/story?id=121802782",
    "published": "Wed, 14 May 2025 13:50:44 -0400",
    "summary": "Donald Trump is back in the White House, the GOP controls Congress, and Republicans have dusted off their 2017 plans to reshape Medicaid.",
    "story": [
      "Republicans again have their eyes on Medicaid, the government health program.",
      "This is a KFF Health News story.",
      "It has been nearly eight years since Sen. John McCain's middle-of-the-night thumbs-down vote torpedoed Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and make drastic cuts to Medicaid.",
      "With Donald Trump back in the White House and the GOP back in control of Congress, Republicans again have their eyes on Medicaid, the government health program for those with low incomes or disabilities. A GOP proposal unveiled this week would require many enrollees to prove they are working, volunteering or studying, and to shoulder more of the costs of their care. It would also curtail taxes levied on providers that help states draw down billions in additional federal money.",
      "Changes are needed, conservative lawmakers say, because the program is broken and costs too much. Medicaid's annual price tag has soared from about $590 billion in 2017 to nearly $900 billion today.",
      "If this script sounds familiar, it's because Republicans made the same proposals and arguments in 2017, when they last had narrow control of Congress and Trump in the White House.",
      "But while the 2025 Medicaid debate on Capitol Hill feels like a 2017 replay, the GOP's latest effort toward a massive transformation could be more of a long shot, several health policy experts say. In the past eight years, Medicaid enrollment has surged to a record high, with the COVID-19 pandemic driving numbers up and nine more states expanding the program to cover more low-income Americans, including six controlled by Republicans.",
      "More enrollees, particularly in red states, means more constituents who rely on Medicaid to cover their health costs -- making it harder for lawmakers to approve cuts.",
      "\"More red states have more skin in the game,\" said Christine Eibner, a senior economist at Rand Corp., a nonprofit research organization.",
      "More than three-quarters of the public opposes major cuts to Medicaid, including 55% of Republicans, according to a recent poll from KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "With the expansion of coverage to more Americans, Medicaid has grown more popular and important, said Krista Drobac, a health policy consultant who formerly worked for the National Governors Association. \"Cutting it is not as politically palatable, even though Congress has moved further to the right.\"",
      "After months of saying little beyond citing a need to cut \"waste, fraud and abuse,\" Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee released legislation May 11 outlining their plans.",
      "The bill does not include some of the most controversial proposals the GOP considered, such as eliminating the extra federal funding that allowed states to dramatically expand the program. Nonetheless, the changes it does propose amount to hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicaid spending cuts and could cause at least 8.6 million Americans to lose their health coverage, according to a preliminary estimate by the Congressional Budget Office released by the committee's Democrats.",
      "Some of the proposals are more targeted, such as a new financial penalty on states such as California that use their own money to cover people living in the country without legal permission.",
      "Others would have widespread implications. In addition to requiring low-income people to prove their eligibility every six months, the GOP proposal would mandate that nondisabled enrollees younger than 65, with some exceptions, show that they work, volunteer, or attend school at least 80 hours per month.",
      "A work requirement is an easier sell politically because it is not seen as cutting benefits, Billy Wynne, a Colorado-based health consultant, said in an interview before the legislation was unveiled.",
      "But unlike in 2017, when the GOP also proposed implementing work requirements, such a policy is no longer just a theory: Arkansas' program, which was suspended by a federal judge in 2019 after less than a year, left 18,000 people without coverage -- with no indication the policy led to more people working. And Georgia's program has been plagued by administrative burdens and cost overruns.",
      "In fact, most Medicaid enrollees are already employed -- just 8% of those who would be required to work are not already doing so, according to KFF.",
      "Awareness about Medicaid and its beneficiaries has improved since 2017, Wynne said. \"These are working families, and they vote.\"",
      "During a marathon House committee debate on the legislation that started Tuesday afternoon and continued through Wednesday morning, Rep. Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts, a Democrat, voiced concern that burdensome new paperwork requirements would lead to many low-income people dropping or losing their coverage.",
      "\"These aren't work requirements,\" he said. \"They're paperwork requirements.\"",
      "Another complication for the GOP's current effort is that the focus is not fixing the health system, as it was with the past push to repeal Obamacare. This time, Republicans' main goal is offsetting the cost of extending $4 trillion in tax cuts passed under Trump in 2017 -- separately from the repeal effort -- that will otherwise expire at the end of this year.",
      "Enrollment in Medicaid and its related Children's Health Insurance Program swelled to over 93 million during the pandemic, a record high. Enrollment had fallen below 79 million as of December, but that was still about 5 million more people than were covered during the repeal debate in the summer of 2017.",
      "Medicaid and CHIP cover more than one in five Americans, as well as 40% of children, 41% of births, and long-term care for 62% of nursing home residents.",
      "Congressional Republicans for decades have sought to rein in Medicaid costs by capping federal spending but have faced resistance from Democrats, states, and the health industry.",
      "The 2010 Affordable Care Act provided billions in federal Medicaid funding that enabled 40 states and the District of Columbia to expand the program to over 21 million nondisabled adults. But the law passed with no Republican votes, leaving Medicaid expansion open to partisan squabbling.",
      "The new GOP proposal would require Medicaid enrollees making poverty-level wages or higher to pay copayments of as much as $35 per health care service.",
      "Medicaid usually doesn't require copays, and advocates for low-income people say any out-of-pocket charge at the doctor's office could discourage them from seeking care.",
      "Republican members of Congress face more pressure to avoid coverage cuts for their constituents, with many now representing expansion states, including key Senate leaders from South Dakota (Majority Leader John Thune) and Idaho (Finance Committee Chairman Michael Crapo).",
      "There's also pressure coming from an unusual source: Trump voters.",
      "Last fall, Trump attracted more low-income voters than usual for a GOP presidential candidate.",
      "Those voters are more likely to depend on Medicaid for health coverage. Matt Salo, a Washington, D.C.-based health consultant who was formerly executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, said Trump voters have been telling Republicans at town hall meetings that they did not vote for benefit cuts.",
      "\"MAGA voters and people on Medicaid and their family members overlap in ways that have never been true before,\" Salo said, referring to Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" movement.",
      "Republicans also face unfavorable odds of curtailing a long-standing practice by nearly every state -- known as provider taxes -- through which states pay some of their share of Medicaid costs by taxing hospitals, nursing homes and other providers. Those funds then help states collect more matching dollars from the federal government.",
      "For decades, Republicans have sought to limit Medicaid provider taxes, and their latest proposal would effectively freeze the taxes at current rates, squeezing state programs as costs continue to rise. Since 2017, such taxes have become more commonplace, and some states now rely on the funding for nearly a third of their Medicaid budgets.",
      "Conservative groups and some GOP lawmakers have begun referring to these taxes as \"money-laundering\" schemes, even though they are legal and the taxes are approved by the federal government before states implement them.",
      "One thing that hasn't changed since 2017 is the strong defense of Medicaid from Democrats, hospital executives, and consumer groups, who argue the GOP's plan will leave more people uninsured or unable to pay their bills, and force hospitals to close, worsening access to care.",
      "Yet the Trump White House is better staffed to work with Congress than it was in 2017, and more members of the party, whether out of fear or loyalty, are likely to side with the president. So far this year, the Republican caucus has had just enough votes to confirm Trump's Cabinet and pass a budget framework to tee up legislation to extend his tax cuts.",
      "While the House GOP's plan would amount to major changes for Medicaid, its legislation left out some of the more ground-shifting ideas like capping federal funding per enrollee or nixing extra expansion funding altogether -- and it still needs to earn the approval of Senate Republicans.",
      "Medicaid's chief backers could end up breathing a sigh of relief, just as they did in summer 2017.",

    "story": [
      "Kennedy said his \"opinions about vaccines are irrelevant.\"",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., one of the nation's most publicly recognized vaccine skeptics, took a softened approach on vaccines when he answered questions before a House committee Wednesday morning, saying, \"I don't think people should be taking medical advice from me.\"",
      "Kennedy, who also testified before a Senate committee the same day, defended the massive cuts to the department's workforce and laid out his priorities for the Trump administration's proposed budget.",
      "Kennedy's congressional committee appearances marked the first time he testified before Congress since his confirmation hearings in late January, and forced Kennedy to confront statements he made that critics said were evidence of promises broken.",
      "Kennedy says his 'opinions about vaccines are irrelevant'",
      "During the House hearing, Kennedy avoided sharing his own thoughts about vaccines -- which have previously invited skepticism -- instead deferring to the doctors running the National Institutes of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Asked by Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan if he would today vaccinate his own children for measles and chickenpox, Kennedy said \"probably\" for measles, but that \"what I would say is my opinions about vaccines are irrelevant.\"",
      "\"I don't want to seem like I'm being evasive, but I don't think people should be taking advice, medical advice from me,\" Kennedy said.",
      "He said he has directed NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya to try to \"lay out the pros and cons, the risks and benefits, accurately as we understand them, with replicable studies,\" for people to \"make that decision.\"",
      "His comments mark a departure from his strong opinions about vaccines before taking office as HHS secretary.",
      "During his confirmation hearing in January, Kennedy said that he supports vaccines, although he refused to unequivocally say that vaccines don't cause autism, despite numerous existing studies already showing there is no link. However, in March, the HHS confirmed that the CDC will study whether vaccines cause autism.",
      "Shortly after Kennedy said people should not take his medical advice, some public health experts criticized the comments -- with one saying that giving people guidance \"is [Kennedy's] job.\"",
      "\"The problem is that is his job -- the top line of his job description -- is the nation's chief health strategist. That is the top line of every health official, federal, state, local leader. That is his job, is to give people the best advice that he can. I believe that he's giving up on, in my view, his chief responsibility,\" Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, told reporters on a call in which he and other health leaders responded to Kennedy's testimony in front of the House Appropriations Committee.",
      "Benjamin pointed out that Kennedy has, in fact, seemed to advise people on how to treat measles, leading them toward unproven remedies.",
      "Democrats push Kennedy on cuts: 'You can't fire 90% of the people and assume the work gets done'",
      "Democrats on both the House and Senate committees questioned Kennedy about cuts to HHS -- with several testy exchanges.",
      "In April, HHS began laying off about 10,000 workers and consolidating 28 institutes and centers into 15 new divisions.",
      "Including the roughly 10,000 people who have left over the last few months through early retirement or deferred resignation programs, the overall staff at HHS is expected to fall from 82,000 to around 62,000 -- or about a quarter of its workforce.",
      "Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, quoting ABC News' reporting last week, asked Kennedy about cuts to the CDC's lead poisoning prevention program.",
      "Though the program has been completely gutted and the expert staff has been laid off, Kennedy said he believes lead poisoning to be an \"extremely significant concern\" and said he does not intend to eliminate the program.",
      "Kennedy suggested that HHS would still spend the money appropriated to the program -- but didn't offer any details on how the work would continue without any expert staff.",
      "In another heated exchange, Democratic Sen. Patty Murray asked Kennedy about cuts to National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, including the reinstatements that are mostly in Ohio and West Virginia. She said no one has been reinstated in the Western states, including at the Spokane, Washington, office that does research into miner safety.",
      "\"The work in NIOSH will not be interrupted,\" Kennedy said. \"We understand it's critically important function, and I did not want to see it end.\"",
      "Murray quipped back, \"I would just say you can't fire 90% of the people and assume the work gets done.\"",
      "During the earlier House hearing, Kennedy continued to maintain that widespread cuts at HHS have not impacted key health programs, saying he has not withheld any funding for lifesaving research at NIH and continues to prioritize pillars such as Head Start, Medicare and Medicaid.",
      "But in a tense back-and-forth with Democratic Rep. Rosa DeLauro, ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee, she demanded Kennedy's assurance that he would not cut programs that have been approved and funded by Congress, which has \"the power of the purse\" ascribed to it in the Constitution.",
      "Kennedy said he would spend appropriated money -- which drew repeated exasperation from DeLauro, who pointed to $20 billion in cuts to NIH.",
      "Kennedy asserted that his goal at HHS is to focus on the chronic disease epidemic and deliver effective services for those who rely on Medicare, Medicaid and other services by cutting costs to taxpayers.",
      "\"We intend to do more, a lot more with less. The budget I'm presenting today supports these goals and reflects two enduring American values, compassion and responsibility,\" Kennedy said.",
      "DeLauro slammed Kennedy and the Trump's administration for the cuts to HHS, including the elimination of entire divisions.",
      "\"Mr. Secretary, you are gutting the life-saving work of the Department of Health and Human Services and its key agencies while the Republicans in this Congress say and do nothing,\" DeLauro said. \"Because of these cuts, people will die.\"",
      "DeLauro also finished the hearing with an impassioned plea for Kennedy to stop cutting programs, telling him he does not have the authority to go against what Congress allocated in the budget.",
      "\"You do not have the authority to do what you are doing,\" she said.",
      "Kennedy defends measles outbreak response, measles vaccine stance",
      "Kennedy rebuked criticism of his agency's response to the measles outbreak, which has surpassed 1,000 cases for the first time in five years, according to the CDC.",
      "A total of 92 patients have been hospitalized over the course of the outbreak and two school-aged children died in Texas. Both were unvaccinated and had no known underlying conditions, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.",
      "\"We are doing a better job at CDC today than any nation in the world controlling this measles outbreak,\" Kennedy said.",
      "DeLauro hit back, saying that Kennedy's comparison of the U.S. response to measles to the response of other countries was unfair.",
      "\"Mr. Secretary, you keep comparing the U.S. to other countries, compare us to Europe, but the Europe you are referring to is the WHO European region, [which] has 53 countries in Europe and in Asia, including those with low ... vaccination rates like Romania and that has never eliminated measles,\" she said. \"If you compare us to western Europe countries that we often compare ourselves to, like Great Britain, they have seen no measles death.\"",
      "Kennedy argued that the U.S. is doing better than other countries in the Americas with smaller populations, including Canada and Mexico.",
      "DeLauro scolded Kennedy for promoting vaccine skepticism in the wake of a measles outbreak spreading across the U.S.",
      "Kennedy has shared contradicting views about vaccines. In a post on X on April 6, Kennedy said that the \"most effective way to prevent the spread of measles\" is to receive the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine. However, in a post later that evening, he said more than 300 children have been treated with an antibiotic and a steroid, neither of which are recognized treatments or cures for measles.",
      "A particularly heated moment occurred when Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy told Kennedy that the secretary has equivocated when discussing the measles vaccine. Murphy noted instances in which Kennedy has touted the effectiveness of the vaccine before listing its potential harms.",
      "Kennedy, angry at the line of questioning, interrupted Murphy, claiming his prior comments were true.",
      "When Murphy pressed for Kennedy to say directly whether he recommended the measles vaccine for people, Kennedy, who told CBS News in an April interview that he did recommend the shot, said, \"I am not going to just tell people everything is safe and effective if I know that there's issues. I need to respect people's intelligence.\"",
      "Vaccine specialists say the measles vaccine is durable and two doses in your youth is sufficient for lifelong protection without the need for a booster. The CDC notes on its website that the agency \"considers people who received two doses of measles vaccine as children according to the U.S. vaccination schedule protected for life, and they do not ever need a booster dose.\"",
      "Numerous studies over decades across multiple countries have confirmed the safety and efficacy of the MMR vaccine, the American Academy of Pediatrics notes. Additionally, monitoring for the safety of a vaccine does not end after the shot has been licensed for use. There are federal health databases in which anyone can report side effects or reactions following a vaccine -- officials are then able to review these reports and identify any potential safety issues.",

      "The company claims Fox News \"orchestrated the destruction of text messages.\"",
      "The multibillion dollar defamation lawsuit brought by voting machine company Smartmatic against Fox News lurched forward this week with new allegations filed by Smartmatic that Fox executives destroyed text messages -- and a new ruling Fox News won that will allow them access to new documents that could help their defense.",
      "Smartmatic, in a court filing Wednesday, alleged that Fox News and Fox Corp \"orchestrated the destruction of text messages across all levels of their corporate hierarchy\" -- a filing that comes as Fox continues to fight the defamation lawsuit brought by the voting machine company over the network's 2020 election claims.",
      "Smartmatic claims those who \"deleted their texts\" include founder Rupert Mudoch and chairman Lachlan Murdoch.",
      "\"The destruction was not isolated or accidental,\" the filing, which was largely redacted, claims. \"It was extensive and willful.\"",
      "The claims were revealed in an introduction to the motion that was publicly filed with the court, though the rest of the motion remained redacted due to a 2022 \"confidentially stipulation\" between the parties.",
      "Smartmatic sued Fox and other defendants in 2021, claiming they \"knowingly and intentionally\" lied about Smartmatic in the wake of the 2020 election regarding claims of voting machine fraud, causing Smartmatic to lose business.",
      "Fox has said they were covering newsworthy allegations made by President Donald Trump and others, and has accused Smartmatic of looking to profit off a lawsuit.",
      "In its filing, Smartmatic alleges that \"Fox custodians\" deleted their text messages from November and December 2020, creating \"an evidentiary void.\"",
      "\"Fox has eliminated contemporaneous texts that would have revealed further evidence of what Fox executives knew about the falsity of their broadcasts and why Fox continued airing them anyway,\" the filing states. \"While it championed election fraud on air, behind the scenes Fox ensured that many of its executives' incriminating communications would never see daylight.\"",
      "As such, Smartmatic is asking that the jury in the case \"be charged with an adverse inference instruction\" -- a legal instruction given by a judge to a jury allowing them to assume that the unavailable evidence was unfavorable to the party that was unable to produce it.",
      "The filing from Smartmatic comes one day after a New York appeals judge ruled that Fox News can gain access to documents related to an ongoing Department of Justice investigation into three Smartmatic executives.",

But Fox News has argued there were other factors for Smartmatic's alleged lost profits, such as the criminal indictment.",
      "In a statement responding to the ruling, Smartmatic attorneys claimed they had \"already agreed\" to the discovery.",
      "\"Fox trying to blame anyone other than itself for Smartmatic's injuries is just more lies from Fox,\" said Smartmatic's legal counsel Erik Connolly. \"The writing is on the wall. Lies have consequences.\"",
      "Fox representatives praised the ruling, saying in a statement they were \"pleased\" with the ruling and that the \"factual evidence shows that Smartmatic's business and reputation were badly suffering long before any claims by President Trump's lawyers on FOX News and that Smartmatic grossly inflated its damage claims to generate headlines and chill free speech.\"",
      "Materials that Smartmatic must disclose include \"all internal documents concerning discussions or analysis of the impact of the indictment on the company\" as well as \"all communications received from any actual or potential customer about the indictment.\"",
      "In a statement at the time, Smartmatic said, \"No voter fraud has been alleged and Smartmatic is not indicted. Voters worldwide must be assured that the elections they participate in are conducted with the utmost integrity and transparency. These are the values that Smartmatic lives by.\"",

    "summary": "Democratic Rep. Shri Thanedar decided against forcing a vote to impeach President Donald Trump after he was criticized by leaders from both parties.",
    "story": [
      "Democratic leaders called Rep. Shri Thanedar's effort \"a distraction.\"",
      "Minutes before the House was scheduled for floor votes, Democratic Rep. Shri Thanedar announced he would not force a vote to impeach President Donald Trump as he had planned.",
      "Thanedar's effort had angered not only Republicans, but also Democratic leaders, who said they would work with Republicans to kill his bill.",
      "Thanedar said he was holding off on his bill, claiming he wanted to add to his impeachment articles to include Trump's plans to accept a Boeing 747 from Qatar as a gift.",
      "\"In the fifteen days since I filed seven articles of impeachment against President Trump, he has committed more impeachable offenses...After talking with many colleagues, I have decided not to force a vote on impeachment today,\" Rep. Thanedar wrote on X. \"Instead, I will add to my articles of impeachment and continue to rally the support of both Democrats and Republicans to defend the Constitution with me.\"",
      "House GOP leaders planned to introduce a motion to table the legislation and kill it before Thanedar's announcement, and House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar said leaders from his party would join them.",
      "\"Our focus is on health care being stripped away from the American people. That is the most urgent and dire thing that we could be talking about this week. Everything else is a distraction,\" Aguilar said at his weekly news conference.",
      "Taking a jab at Thanedar, Aguilar added that while his conference has its differences, \"this is one that is a pretty easy call.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson called the effort \"another embarrassing political stunt.\"",
      "\"While Democrats are throwing fits, impeding law enforcement, playing political games, and demonstrating how far out of touch they are -- Republicans are working to deliver lower taxes for families, restore American energy dominance, strengthen border security, restore peace through strength, and make government work more efficiently and effectively. The contrast has never been more clear,\" Johnson said in a statement.",
      "At a rally last month celebrating his first 100 days, Trump, who was impeached twice during his first term, said, \"Here we go again.\" He said the fact that Democrats have \"no control\" over \"a dumb guy like this\" shows \"they have no confidence anymore as a party.\"",
      "Thanedar introduced seven articles of impeachment against Trump last month, arguing the president is abusing the power of his office for his own self-interest and repeatedly defied the Constitution, among other broad charges.",
      "Without the backing of the top Democrats in the House nor a majority of his caucus, Thanedar's effort went nowhere until earlier this week when he introduced his impeachment resolution as \"privileged,\" forcing the chamber to consider the legislation within two legislative days.",
      "Thanedar promised to fight on.",
      "\"Will I succeed this week? Maybe not, but we'll continue to do this until we have a victory,\" he said at his news conference. \"We'll continue to fight until we have a victory, until we remove this president from office for his unconstitutional, illegal, impeachable misconduct. We are going to continue.\"",
      "\"[House Democratic leaders] want to focus on other issues, which is fine. I just tell them that, hey, we can do that, and we can do this as well.\"",
      "However, his move would force Democrats to go on the record on this issue. Thanedar dismissed concerns that his efforts could hurt vulnerable Democratic colleagues, arguing that Republicans would have to vote on it as well.",
      "\"We take hard votes every day, every day there is a hard vote to take. That's my job ... They just need to look into not what plays well in politically, not what the polls are saying. We got to do the right thing,\" Thanedar argued.",
      "Thanedar, who was elected to the then-open seat in 2022, faces a tough reelection battle. His fellow Michigan Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a prominent progressive, endorsed Thanedar's primary challenger, state Rep. Donavan McKinney, earlier this week.",
      "\"I'm done with absent members who don't call their residents back,\" Tlaib said in a post on X, referring to Thanedar.",

    "summary": "A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged migrant gang members is lawful, in contrast to two other judges.",
    "story": [
      "The ruling stands in contrast to the rulings of two other judges.",
      "A federal judge in Pennsylvania ruled Tuesday that President Donald Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged migrant gang members is lawful, but determined that the administration has provided insufficient notice before deporting migrants under the proclamation.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Stephanie Haines' ruling stands in contrast to two other federal judges who have ruled that Trump's use of the AEA for deportations is unlawful.",
      "The Trump administration has invoked the Alien Enemies Act -- an 18th century wartime authority used to remove noncitizens with little-to-no due process -- to carry out deportations by proclaiming that migrant gang members constitute a \"hybrid criminal state\" that is invading the United States.",
      "Haines, a Trump appointee, said she found that the proclamation \"complies with AEA,\" but said that the Trump administration \"must provide greater notice to those subject to removal under the AEA than they are currently providing.\"",
      "In her ruling, Judge Haines said that the declarations submitted by the Trump administration to the court \"indicate that there is factual basis for President Trump's conclusions in the Proclamation\" and pointed to the designation made by Secretary of State Marco Rubio of the Venezuelan criminal gang Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "As a result, Judge Haines said she found that the proclamation meets the definition of a \"predatory incursion\" under the AEA.",
      "Haines also said she will afford \"substantial deference to the conclusion\" by Trump that TdA is \"acting at the direction, clandestine or otherwise, of the Maduro regime in Venezuela.\"",
      "\"It would be intolerable that courts, without the relevant information, should review and perhaps nullify actions of the Executive taken on information properly held in secret,\" Judge Haines said.",
      "However, the judge ruled that the Trump administration cannot remove the petitioner, a Venezuelan man in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody identified as A.S.R., unless he is given 21 days notice and \"an opportunity to be heard.\" Haines added the notice to A.S.R. needs to be in English and Spanish and must clearly \"articulate the fact that he is subject to removal\" under the AEA.",
      "A.S.R., according to the government, was moved to a detention center in Texas last month.",
      "Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement to ABC News that the ACLU disagrees with the judge's ruling on the use of the AEA.",
      "\"The court properly rejected the government's argument that they can remove people with only 12 hours' notice,\" said Gelernt. \"But we disagree with the court's ruling that the Alien Enemies Act can be used during peacetime.\"",
      "In her ruling, Judge Haines said the case \"implicates significant issues.\"",
      "\"In resolving those issues, this Court's unflagging obligation is to apply the law as written,\" Haines wrote in her conclusion. \"The court now leaves it to the Political Branches of the government, and ultimately to the people who elect those individuals to decide whether the laws and those executive them continue to reflect their will.\"",
      "Earlier this month, a Trump-appointed federal judge blocked the Trump administration from deporting migrants under the AEA in Southern District of Texas, ruling that its invocation of the AEA \"exceeds the scope\" of the law.",
      "A week later, a federal judge in New York ruled that the AEA was \"not validly invoked\" by the Trump administration when it sought to deport two alleged Tren de Aragua members from that state.",

      "The markup in the House Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over taxes, is also expected to slide into the night amid an internal GOP battle over caps to the State and Local Tax deduction.

      "The committee was tasked with finding at least $230 billion in cuts.

The measure restricts eligibility for SNAP benefits to U.S. citizens or green card holders.",

      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Alabama lawmakers on Wednesday approved enhanced legal protections for police officers, changes that Republicans said show support for law enforcement but Democrats called \u201ca green light to kill Black folks.\u201d",
      "The Alabama Legislature gave final approval to the legislation that sets legal standards for the use of force and provides for an immunity hearing. The bill states that an officer \u201cshall be justified\u201d in the use of physical force as long as it is not constitutionally excessive force or \u201crecklessly\u201d outside of the officer\u2019s discretionary authority.",
      "Republicans, who called the legislation the \u201cBack The Blue\u201d bill said it is needed to provide a clear legal framework and show support for law enforcement officers faced with making split-second decisions.",
      "\u201cWe ask them to take care of us, keep us safe in our homes as we sleep at night. This bill will give them the assurances that we back them and back the blue,\u201d Sen. Lance Bell, a former deputy sheriff, said. Bell said officers who act improperly can still be prosecuted.",
      "The approval came after an emotional debate in which Black lawmakers read the names of Black people who have been killed by police and described their own encounters with law enforcement.",
      "\u201cHB 202 is a license to kill Black people. That\u2019s what it is,\u201d Sen. Rodger Smitherman, a Black Democrat from Birmingham, said.",

      "Sen. Merika Coleman, a Black Democrat from Pleasant Grove, said she fears the bill will protect \u201cbad apples\u201d in police departments. She described her worries that someone might see her honors student son as a threat someday because of his tall frame and twisted locs.",
      "\u201cIf this bill passes and there are young Black males, females, brown and other folks killed, you will have blood on your hands because of this piece of legislation,\u201d Coleman said.",
      "Bell urged opponents to \u201cwalk a mile in a law enforcement officer\u2019s shoes and find out what they have to deal with.\u201d Smitherman responded, \u201cWalk a mile in the person\u2019s shoes when the person is dead.\u201d",
      "The Alabama Senate approved the bill on a 25-6 late-night vote in the final hour of the legislative session. The House of Representatives accepted Senate changes. The bill now goes to Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey who said she will sign it into law.",
      "\u201cThere is NO question Alabama backs the blue!\u201d Ivey stated on social media after the bill\u2019s passage.",
      "Under existing state law, police and civilians alike are currently entitled to a \u201cstand your ground\u201d hearing in criminal cases where a judge can determine whether the defendant acted in self defense. The legislation will allow an immunity hearing where a judge will decide if a case can proceed based on whether the officer acted recklessly outside the scope of law enforcement duties. It would add similar protections in state civil lawsuits. It would also require law enforcement departments to collect data that tracks use of force complaints.",
      "The executive director of the Alabama Sheriff\u2019s Association, Hoss Mack, testified in favor of the bill in April.",
      "\u201cThis is of equal benefit to law enforcement and the public. Let me reiterate what this bill does not do. It does not give blanket immunity to law enforcement,\u201d said Mack, who added that he had personally arrested officers that worked for him for misconduct throughout his 39-year career in law enforcement.",
      "Leroy Maxwell, a civil rights attorney based in Birmingham, said he is afraid the bill would embolden misconduct.",
      "\u201cLegislation like this paves the way toward a police state, where law enforcement operates above the law and without fear of consequence,\u201d Maxwell said.",
      "Civil rights attorney Harry Daniels opposed the law but doubted the overall impact on civil rights cases which could still be filed in federal court and will not be affected by the legislation.",

      "New Jersey Transit urged riders to reach their destinations before the end of the day Thursday or risk being stranded as talks continued in a bid to avert a rail strike by train engineers that would affect some 350,000 commuters who work in New Jersey and New York City.",
      "The advisory provided riders with details on contingency plans that would take effect if engineers walk off the job at 12:01 a.m. EDT Friday. The agency plans to increase bus service, saying it would add \u201cvery limited\u201d capacity to existing New York commuter bus routes in close proximity to rail stations and will contract with private carriers to operate bus service from key regional park-and-ride locations during weekday peak periods.",
      "However, the agency noted that the buses would not be able to handle close to the same number of passengers \u2014 only about 20% of current rail customers \u2014 so it is has urged people who can work from home to do so if there is a strike.",
      "NJ Transit \u2014 the nation\u2019s third largest transit system \u2014 operates buses and rail in the state, providing nearly 1 million weekday trips, including into New York City. A walkout would halt all NJ Transit commuter trains, which provide heavily used public transit routes between New York City\u2019s Penn Station on one side of the Hudson River and communities in northern New Jersey on the other as well as the Newark airport, which has grappled with unrelated delays of its own recently.",
      "Wages have been the main sticking point of the negotiations between the agency and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen. The union says its members earn an average salary of $113,000 a year and says an agreement could be reached if agency CEO Kris Kolluri agrees to an average yearly salary of $170,000.",
      "NJ Transit leadership, though, disputes the union\u2019s data, saying the engineers have average total earnings of $135,000 annually, with the highest earners exceeding $200,000.",
      "If the walkout happens, it would be the state\u2019s first transit strike in more than 40 years. It comes a month after union members overwhelmingly rejected a labor agreement with management.",
      "The parties met Monday with a federal mediation board in Washington to discuss the dispute, but both sides and the board have declined to comment on whether any progress has been made in subsequent talks this week.",

    "story": [
      "The Supreme Court is hearing its first set of Trump-related arguments in the second Trump presidency",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court is hearing its first set of Trump-related arguments in the second Trump presidency. The case stems from the executive order President Donald Trump issued on his first day in office that would deny citizenship to children born on U.S. soil to parents who are in the country illegally or temporarily. The executive order marks a major change to the provision of the 14th Amendment that grants citizenship to people born in the United States, with just a couple of exceptions.",
      "Immigrants, rights groups and states sued almost immediately to challenge the executive order. Federal judges have uniformly cast doubt on Trump\u2019s reading of the Citizenship Clause. Three judges have blocked the order from taking effect anywhere in the U.S., including U.S. District Judge John Coughenour. \u201cI\u2019ve been on the bench for over four decades. I can\u2019t remember another case where the question presented was as clear as this one is. This is a blatantly unconstitutional order,\u201d Coughenour said at a hearing in his Seattle courtroom.",
      "The Supreme Court is taking up emergency appeals filed by the Trump administration asking to be able to enforce the executive order in most of the country, at least while lawsuits over the order proceed. The constitutionality of the order is not before the court just yet. Instead, the justices are looking at potentially limiting the authority of individual judges to issue rulings that apply throughout the United States. These are known as nationwide, or universal, injunctions.",
      "President Donald Trump is weighing in ahead of arguments in the birthright citizenship case today.",
      "Trump says in an online post that granting citizenship to people born here, long seen as a constitutional promise, makes the country look \u201cSTUPID\u201d and like \u201cSUCKERS.\u201d He incorrectly asserted the U.S. is the only country in the world with birthright citizenship. While not every country grants it, about 30 other countries do, including Canada.",
      "His executive order at the heart of today\u2019s case aims to end birthright citizenship for children born to people in the U.S. illegally, something many legal scholars say would require amending the Constitution.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer is representing the Trump administration in urging the court to allow Trump\u2019s restrictions on birthright citizenship to take effect in at least 27 states. New Jersey Solicitor General Jeremy Feigenbaum is arguing on behalf of the states that say they\u2019ll lose millions of dollars in health and other benefits available to U.S. children and also have to overhaul identification systems since birth certificates will no longer serve as proof of citizenship. Kelsi Corkran is representing pregnant women and immigrant rights groups that say chaos will result if Trump\u2019s order takes effect anywhere.",
      "The justices will take the bench at 10 o\u2019clock Eastern time, but the livestream won\u2019t begin immediately. The court will issue at least one opinion before hearing arguments, so it could be 10 minutes before the Chief Justice John Roberts invites Solicitor General D. John Sauer to begin.",
      "The livestream will be available on the court\u2019s website, www.supremecourt.gov, or C-SPAN. C-SPAN asked Roberts to allow cameras to carry the case live, but he did not respond to the request, C-SPAN said. The Supreme Court has never allowed cameras in the courtroom.",
      "A decision should come relatively soon. The Supreme Court typically rules in all its argued cases by the end of June and this one shouldn\u2019t be any different. If anything, an order from the court might come quickly because the legal issue before the justices is not whether Trump\u2019s birthright citizenship restrictions are constitutional, but whether to grant the administration\u2019s emergency appeals to narrow lower court orders against it while lawsuits proceed.",

      "Before \u2018America First\u2019 became the Trump administration\u2019s mandate for foreign policy and trade, one sector was already working to bring business back to the United States: the semiconductor industry",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Before \u201cAmerica First\u201d became the Trump administration\u2019s mandate for foreign policy and trade, one sector was already working to bring business back to the United States: the semiconductor industry.",
      "Aided by government incentives, American and foreign tech companies alike have invested hundreds of billions of dollars to bolstering semiconductor operations \u2014 research and development, manufacturing and facility modernization \u2014 across the country in recent years.",
      "In few places is the growth of the U.S. semiconductor industry clearer than in the Greater Sacramento region, where tech leaders and lawmakers have, for years, sought to grow California\u2019s role in producing the chips that power everyday necessities like cars, refrigerators and smartphones. Semiconductor giants clustered in cities just outside Silicon Valley \u2014 Intel, AMD, Bosch, Samsung and Micron \u2014 are building on a tech foothold Intel first established when it opened its Sacramento-County campus in 1984.",
      "But President Donald Trump\u2019s economic policies have complicated that growth as the administration takes its next steps toward imposing more tariffs on key imports and launching investigations into imports of computer chips and chip-making equipment \u2014 all at a time when deeper semiconductor investments were just starting to have a positive impact on changing supply chains. New tariffs, paired with the administration\u2019s threats against the CHIPS and Science Act, could dramatically slow its goal of ensuring the U.S. maintains a competitive edge in artificial intelligence development.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re starting to see some of it now. Samsung announced a delay in the fabs in Texas,\u201d said Mario Morales, an analyst with the International Data Corp. \u201cThat facility was supposed to come online in 2024 now it\u2019s being delayed to 2028. I think some of these companies are delaying it because they now know that they\u2019re not going to likely get funding, or because of the uncertainty around the acts that we\u2019re seeing around the new trade policy.\u201d",
      "Although the U.S. is a major producer of certain types of semiconductor chips, the nation's share of global chip production \u2014 measured by volume and not dollar value \u2014 fell from 37% in 1990 to just 10% in 2022, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. As a result, the country relies heavily on imports from Taiwan and South Korea for advanced chips.",
      "Major manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. are investing to build up U.S. facilities, partly due to incentives put in place during former President Joe Biden\u2019s time in office. The CHIPS Act, a law passed in 2022 with bipartisan support, was designed to revive U.S. semiconductor manufacturing while sharpening the U.S. edge in military technology and minimizing future supply chain disruptions.",
      "Because of the CHIPS Act, the U.S. is projected to more than triple its semiconductor manufacturing capacity \u2014 the highest rate of growth in the world during that period, according to a May 2024 report from the Semiconductor Industry Association and the Boston Consulting Group.",
      "Barry Broome, president of the Greater Sacramento Economic Council, said weaknesses in the semiconductor supply chain became evident during the pandemic, when the U.S. experienced a shortage in supply. It was \u201cabundantly clear that having these chip products offshore in Vietnam, Taiwan, China for cost savings had serious implications.\u201d",
      "Those pandemic-era challenges, paired with looming tensions between China and Taiwan, have helped drive the industry to the Sacramento area, he said. Northern California's wealth of tech knowledge and established roots in the semiconductor industry are also attractive traits that have brought investment to the Sacramento region as federal subsidies begin to bolster domestic growth.",
      "German tech company Bosch, for example, announced a $1.9 billion investment in the Greater Sacramento area in 2023 to manufacture chips for electric vehicles, converting its facility in Roseville into a silicon carbide semiconductor production site.",
      "That investment, Bosch said, would create as many as 1,700 jobs in construction, manufacturing, engineering, and research and development. The project marks the largest semiconductor investment in California in three decades, according to Broome.",
      "Tech workers who started out at companies like Intel have spun out companies of their own, including Sacramento-area AI startup Blaize and data storage manufacturer Solidigm.",
      "Dinakar Munagala, cofounder of Blaize, said the company\u2019s AI chips are among the few built domestically. Their chips are made in a Samsung foundry in Texas, he said. The company\u2019s products, Munagala added, help to power systems that analyze traffic patterns and detect suspicious behavior in airports.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re built here,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re actually getting quite a bit of interest from defense, border security, these classes of use cases.\u201d",
      "Lane Bess, board chair of Blaize, pointed to Munagala \u2014 who worked at Intel \u2014 as an example of the talent the Sacramento region can provide to tech companies. The area is primed to be a main corridor for the semiconductor industry because a lot of skilled workers are looking to develop their own companies, Bess said.",
      "The Trump administration has viewed chip production as a national security issue because it would reduce U.S. reliance on importing chips that are also used by the military. It also intends to study the risks of having computer chip production concentrated in other places and the impact on U.S. competitiveness from foreign government subsidies, \u201cforeign unfair trade practices and state-sponsored overcapacity.\u201d",
      "Alvin Nguyen, senior analyst at Forrester, said the fluidity of the state of administration's tariffs will cause confusion about the impact on the supply chain \u201cdue to the complexity of tracking where materials and manufactured goods are produced and assembled.\u201d",
      "Video game companies, for example, have started to raise prices amid a backdrop of ongoing tariff uncertainty.",
      "\u201cFor semiconductors, we may see certain goods no longer making sense to produce due to the cost \u2014 see Nintendo Switch 2 \u2014 and the value seen from IT purchases diminishing,\u201d he said in an email.",
      "Preorders for Nintendo\u2019s highly anticipated Switch 2 were delayed in April as retailers assessed the potential impact of tariffs. Nintendo later confirmed that some Switch 2 accessories would see price adjustments, but maintained that its baseline price for the console \u2014 $449.99 \u2014 would remain the same.",
      "Nguyen said that in the medium term, the growth of foundries around the world will be beneficial to easing dependence on Taiwan for chip production. Down the road, \u201cwe should see a healthier global ecosystem for semiconductor manufacturing and more supply chain options in where chips are produced and can be procured,\u201d he said.",
      "Broome, of the economic council, said he believes the Trump administration's tariffs are aimed at restructuring global relationships. He said he hopes that \u201cconcludes quickly\u201d because uncertainty over trade policy doesn\u2019t favor the markets.",
      "\u201cIf the tariffs are used for leverage to get better agreements in the next two or three months, then we\u2019ll come back quickly, and will benefit from it,\u201d Broome said. \u201cIf they\u2019re considered long-term policy, I think it\u2019ll really ice the capital markets from putting real money on the table.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- The R&B singer Cassie is being cross-examined after two days of testimony recounting tumultuous details of life with her ex-boyfriend, Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs.",
      "Prosecutors allege Combs used his fame and fortune to orchestrate an empire of exploitation, coercing women into abusive sex parties. His lawyers argue that all the sexual acts were consensual, and although he could be violent, he never veered into sex trafficking and racketeering. Combs has pleaded not guilty to racketeering conspiracy; sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion; and transportation to engage in prostitution.",
      "Combs\u2019 seven attorneys are led by New York lawyer Marc Agnifilo and also includes Teny Geragos, who has expertise in sexual misconduct cases, and attorney Brian Steel, who represented Young Thug in a lengthy trial before the rapper pleaded guilty to gang, drug and gun charges. Celebrity lawyer Mark Geragos, Teny's father, has advised the team. Defense Attorney Anna Estevao began the cross-examination on Thursday.",
      "Here's the Latest:",
      "Estevao is confronting Cassie with loving emails and text messages she and the hip-hop mogul exchanged early on, often using Blackberry devices in the era before iPhones.",
      "In one 2008 email, Cassie told Combs she was a lucky woman. \u201cI love you sooo much,\u201d she wrote after Combs thanked her for flying to Atlanta to be with him.",
      "In August 2009, in a message sent when Combs went by the moniker \u201cPuffy,\u201d the rap star told her: \u201cI love you sooooo much it makes me cry.\u201d",
      "Cassie replied: \u201cU hungry pop pop?\u201d She testified that Pop Pop was a nickname she used for Combs, while he sometimes called her Baby Girl. He said no, to which Cassie told him to let her know if he changed his mind.",
      "In April 2010, Cassie told Combs: \u201cGoing to sleep now so it can be tomorrow faster and you can be home. Love you!!!\u201d Combs replied: \u201cLove my baby.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors are objecting frequently, and the judge is rejecting many of the objections, appearing to be giving the defense some breathing room in the early stages of its examination.",
      "Estevao has begun by questioning Cassie in a gentle tone of voice. It\u2019s notable because so many cross-examinations can begin with efforts to unsettle and agitate a witness. This approach was the opposite as Estevao began by asking about their relationship. Cassie responded yes to a series of questions.",
      "\u2014 \u201cYou and Sean Combs were in love for 11 years. You loved him and believed that he loved you as well.\u201d",
      "\u2014 \u201cYes.\u201d",

      "\u2014 \u201cWhen he cheated on you,\u201d Estevao continued.",
      "\u2014 \u201cYes, Cassie said.",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian began Thursday by talking to lawyers about evidence as final ground rules are set before the cross examination by defense attorney Anna Estevao begins.",
      "He denied a request by defense lawyers to introduce text communications between Combs and Cassie that would include references to specific sexual acts.",
      "Letters were filed with the judge overnight from both sides. The judge said he wanted to eliminate \u201cunfair prejudice or victimization\u201d of witnesses.",
      "Prosecutors also complained that overnight Wednesday, defense lawyers dumped 400 \u201cenormous, duplicitous\u201d documents as potential exhibits on prosecutors. A defense lawyer responded that many of the documents will never be offered as exhibits during the cross examination.",
      "There usually aren\u2019t many last minute ground rules to go over for questioning a witness, but lawyers can argue for an hour and stay up until 3 a.m. filing letters over minor facets of law that court observers untrained in legal precedents wouldn\u2019t know or care about. Thursday's discussion went on for nearly an hour. The judge said that with one of his rulings, \u201c99.9 percent of evidence is not being impaired.\u201d",
      "Yes. Combs, 55, has been held at a federal jail in Brooklyn since his September arrest. His formerly jet-black hair is now almost completely gray because dye isn\u2019t allowed at the detention center.",
      "Combs, who had his own fashion line, wore yellow jail uniforms in pretrial hearings. But for the trial, the judge said he can have up to five button-down shirts, five pairs of pants, five sweaters, five pairs of socks and two pairs of shoes without laces.",
      "He interacted with his lawyers but remained largely stoic as Cassie testified on Tuesday. During a break, he made a heart shape with his hands and mouthed \u201cthank you\u201d to one of his twin daughters. He also blew a kiss to his mother.",
      "Under federal court rules, no photos or video of the trial will be allowed. Courtroom sketches are permitted.",
      "She cried several times but for the most part remained composed and matter-of-fact as she talked about some of the most sensitive subjects anyone could imagine expressing, in a courtroom packed with family and friends of Combs, journalists and one row of spectator seats occupied by Cassie\u2019s supporters.",
      "Cassie is in the third trimester of pregnancy with her third child with personal trainer Alex Fine. They married in 2019 and she sued Combs in 2023.",
      "Defense lawyers have indicated that the cross examination of Cassie that will begin this morning will likely be finished by the end of Friday\u2019s court session.",
      "\u25b6 Read more about the life and career of Cassie",
      "The trial is in the courtroom of U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian. He\u2019s a Columbia Law School graduate who once clerked for Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and was appointed a federal judge by President Joe Biden in 2022.",
      "The prosecution team consists of eight assistant U.S. attorneys, seven of them women. They include Maurene Ryan Comey, daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. She was among the prosecutors in the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of luring teenage girls to be sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein.",

      "Defense lawyers say they\u2019ll be scrutinizing how infidelity fueled the combustible nearly 11-year relationship between the R&B singer and the music mogul who controlled her career.",
      "Defense attorney Teny Geragos suggested yesterday during a discussion between lawyers and the judge that the gameplan for today was changing on the fly out of necessity.",
      "She didn\u2019t get into particulars but she told Judge Arun Subramanian that the questioning of Cassie by prosecutors over two days \u201chas gone much differently than I expected.\u201d She added: \u201cSo we are kind of changing our strategy.\u201d",
      "Agnifilo later told the judge that questioning Cassie about infidelities is important. \u201cEverybody knows that we are going to bring up infidelities, that we\u2019re going to want to bring up text messages of infidelities, and these text messages are often in colorful language,\u201d he said.",
      "After the jury was sent home for the day, lawyers squabbled over ground rules for the cross-examination of Cassie, which is set to begin at 9:30 a.m. EDT Thursday.",
      "Agnifilo said infidelity would be the featured subject of the questioning that is expected to stretch until day\u2019s end Friday.",

      "A singer, actor, dancer and model, Cassie\u2019s professional ambitions began in adolescence, when she signed to the top-tier talent and modeling agency Wilhelmina. Her music career launched shortly thereafter, when she left her home state of Connecticut for New York, where she signed with manager Tony Mottola and first met Combs.",

      "Rogers was named as a suspect but never convicted in several other slayings around the country, once telling police he had killed about 70 people. He later recanted that statement, but had been the subject of documentaries including one from 2012 called \u201cMy Brother the Serial Killer\u201d that featured his brother Clay and a criminal profiler who had corresponded extensively with Rogers.",
      "The documentary raised questions about whether Rogers could have been responsible for the 1994 stabbing deaths of Simpson's ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman.",
      "During a 1995 murder trial that drew intense media attention, the former football star and celebrity Simpson was acquitted of all charges. Los Angeles police and prosecutors subsequently said after the documentary's release that they didn't think Rogers had any involvement in the Simpson and Goldman killings.",
      "\u201cWe know who killed Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. We have no reason to believe that Mr. Rogers was involved,\" the Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement at the time.",
      "Simpson had always professed innocence but was later found liable for the deaths in a separate civil case, and then served nine years in prison on unrelated charges. The 76-year-old Simpson died in April 2024 after battling cancer.",
      "Rogers, originally from Hamilton, Ohio, has also been labeled the \u201cCasanova Killer\u201d or \u201cCross Country Killer\" in various media reports. Some of his alleged and proven female victims had similar characteristics: ages in their 30s, a petite frame and red hair.",
      "Rogers' lawyers have filed several appeals with state and federal courts, none successful. One argument was that newly enacted state legislation authorizing the death penalty for trafficking in young children makes clear the abuse he suffered as a child is now taken seriously and should result in a life prison sentence for Rogers. That argument was rejected.",
      "Florida uses a three-drug cocktail for its lethal injection: a sedative, a paralytic and a drug that stops the heart, according to the Corrections Department.",
      "Anthony Wainwright is the next Florida inmate scheduled for execution \u2014 on June 10 \u2014 under a death warrant signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. Wainwright, 54, was convicted of kidnapping a woman from a supermarket parking lot in Lake City in 1994 and raping and killing her.",

    "story": [
      "The Supreme Court is hearing arguments in its first case stemming from the flurry of actions marking the start of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court is hearing arguments Thursday in its first case stemming from the blitz of actions that have marked the start of President Donald Trump's second term.",
      "Before the court are the Trump administration's emergency appeals of lower court orders putting nationwide holds on the Republican president's push to deny citizenship to children born to people who are in the United States illegally.",
      "Birthright citizenship is among several issues, many related to immigration, that the administration has asked the court to address on an emergency basis, after lower courts acted to slow the president's agenda.",
      "The justices are also considering the administration's pleas to end humanitarian parole for more than 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela and to strip other temporary legal protections from another 350,000 Venezuelans. The administration remains locked in legal battles over its efforts to swiftly deport people accused of being gang members to a prison in El Salvador under an 18th century wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "In Thursday's arguments, the justices will be weighing whether judges have the authority to issue what are called nationwide, or universal, injunctions. The Trump administration, like the Biden administration before it, has complained that judges are overreaching by issuing orders that apply to everyone instead of just the parties before the court.",
      "Yet in discussing the limits of a judge's power, the court almost certainly will have to take up the change to citizenship that Trump wants to make, which would upset the settled understanding of birthright citizenship that has existed for more than 125 years.",
      "The first sentence of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution reads: \u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\u201d",
      "The Citizenship Clause, ratified in 1868 after the Civil War, was included to ensure that formerly enslaved people would be citizens. It effectively overturned the notorious Dred Scott decision, in which the Supreme Court held that Black people, no matter their status, were not citizens.",
      "Since at least 1898 and the Supreme Court case of Wong Kim Ark, the provision has been widely interpreted to make citizens of everyone born on U.S. soil except for the children of diplomats, who have allegiance to another government; enemies present in the U.S. during hostile occupation; and, until a federal law changed things in 1924, sovereign Native American tribes.",
      "Trump's executive order would deny citizenship to children if neither parent is a citizen or lawful permanent resident. Those categories include people who are in the country illegally or temporarily because, the administration contends, they are not \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d of the United States.",
      "Almost immediately, states, immigrants and rights groups sued to block the executive order, accusing the Republican administration of trying to unsettle the understanding of birthright citizenship. Every court to consider the issue has sided with the challengers.",
      "The administration is asking for the court orders to be reined in, not overturned entirely, and spends little time defending the executive order. The Justice Department argues that there has been an \u201cexplosion\u201d in the number of nationwide injunctions issued since Trump retook the White House. The far-reaching court orders violate the law as well as long-standing views on a judge's authority, Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote on behalf of the administration.",
      "Courts typically deal only with the parties before them. Even class actions reach only the people who are part of a class certified by a judge, though those can affect millions of people, Sauer wrote.",
      "Nationwide injunctions, by contrast, have no limits and can even include parties who oppose what the court orders are designed to protect, he wrote. As an example, Sauer pointed to Republican-led states that favor the administration's position but are subject to the nationwide injunctions.",
      "But the justices may well ask about Trump's executive order and perhaps even tip their hand.",
      "Lawyers for the states and immigrants argue that this is an odd issue for the court to use to limit judges' authority because courts have uniformly found that Trump's order likely violates the Constitution. Limiting the number of people who are protected by the rulings would create a confusing patchwork of rules in which new restrictions on citizenship could temporarily take effect in 27 states. That means a child born in a state that is challenging Trump's order would be a citizen, but a child born at the same time elsewhere would not, the lawyers said.",
      "The Supreme Court almost always takes up the underlying substance of a dispute, not an emergency appeal of court orders issued early in a legal case.",
      "The main argument against the court deciding too much on the emergency, or shadow, docket is that the justices are intervening too early in the process, sometimes before lower courts have had much to say or the legal arguments are fully developed.",
      "Last year, the justices heard arguments in emergency appeals, then blocked the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s air pollution-fighting \u201cgood neighbor\u201d plan, which aimed to restrict smokestack emissions from power plants and other industrial sources that burden downwind areas with smog-causing pollution.",
      "Two years earlier, the court delivered a split decision that allowed rules requiring COVID-19 vaccines for health care workers but not for employees of large companies.",

      "\u201cI am ready to get to work here and make America safer, stronger, and more prosperous,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Perdue, 75, had a long career as an executive in firms from clothing to retail. He was based in Hong Kong as head of the Asia operations for Sara Lee Corp. and later was president of the Reebok athletic brand and chairman and CEO of Dollar General stores.",
      "A Republican, he was a senator from Georgia from 2015 to 2021 and ran for governor of the state as a Trump-backed candidate in 2022 but lost in the Republican primary.",

      "The U.S. reached a weekend deal with China to reduce sky-high tariffs on each other's goods, an agreement U.S. President Donald Trump has referred to as a victory.",
      "The U.S. agreed to cut the 145% tax Trump imposed last month to 30%. China agreed to lower its tariff on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%. The lower tariff rates came into effect on Wednesday.",
      "Worldwide, markets have responded to the agreement with gusto, rebounding to the levels before Trump\u2019s tariffs, but many business owners remain wary.",
      "Along with tariffs and China's massive trade surplus with the U.S., the two have tangled over security in the South China Sea, which China claims virtually in its entirety.",
      "The U.S. has also been a harsh critic of China's crackdown on human rights in ethnic areas such as Tibet and Xinjiang and in Hong Kong, and is a strong supporter of Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy that China says is its own territory and threatens to invade.",
      "With the 90-day tariff suspension being a notable exception, relations have hit lows not seen in decades. A reminder of that was Perdue's predecessor Nicholas Burns' order this year banning American government personnel in China, as well as family members and contractors with security clearances, from any romantic or sexual relationships with Chinese citizens, a throwback to the Cold War.",
      "Perdue was confirmed by the Senate on April 29. While in the Senate, he served on the Armed Services, Foreign Relations, Banking, Budget, and Agriculture committees. He also chaired the Subcommittees on Sea Power and State Department Oversight and \u201ctraveled extensively to strengthen U.S. partnerships across Asia, the Middle East, and Europe,\u201d according to his official biography.",
      "He was born in Warner Robins, Georgia, and grew up on his family\u2019s farm. He and his wife have two sons and three grandsons.",

      "The Alabama Legislature gave final approval to the legislation that sets legal standards for the use of force and provides for an immunity hearing. The bill states that an officer \u201cshall be justified\u201d in the use of physical force as long as it is not constitutionally excessive force or \u201crecklessly\u201d outside of the officer\u2019s discretionary authority.",
      "Republicans, who called the legislation the \u201cBack The Blue\u201d bill said it is needed to provide a clear legal framework and show support for law enforcement officers faced with making split-second decisions.",
      "\u201cWe ask them to take care of us, keep us safe in our homes as we sleep at night. This bill will give them the assurances that we back them and back the blue,\u201d Sen. Lance Bell, a former deputy sheriff, said. Bell said officers who act improperly can still be prosecuted.",
      "The approval came after an emotional debate in which Black lawmakers read the names of Black people who have been killed by police and described their own encounters with law enforcement.",
      "\u201cHB 202 is a license to kill Black people. That\u2019s what it is,\u201d Sen. Rodger Smitherman, a Black Democrat from Birmingham, said.",

      "The Alabama Senate approved the bill on a 25-6 late-night vote in the final hour of the legislative session. The House of Representatives accepted Senate changes. The bill now goes to Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey who said she will sign it into law.",

      "Harvard University for decades assumed it had a cheap copy of the Magna Carta in its collection, a stained and faded document it had purchased for less than $30",
      "BOSTON -- Harvard University for decades assumed it had a cheap copy of the Magna Carta in its collection, a stained and faded document it had purchased for less than $30.",
      "But two researchers have concluded it has something much more valuable \u2014 a rare version from 1300 issued by Britain's King Edward I.",
      "The original Magna Carta established in 1215 the principle that the king is subject to law, and it has formed the basis of constitutions globally. There are four copies of the original and, until now, there were believed to be only six copies of the 1300 version.",
      "\u201cMy reaction was one of amazement and, in a way, awe that I should have managed to find a previously unknown Magna Carta,\u201d said David Carpenter, a professor of medieval history at King\u2019s College London. He was searching the Harvard Law School Library website in December 2023 when he found the digitized document.",
      "\u201cFirst, I\u2019d found one of the most rare documents and most significant documents in world constitutional history,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cBut secondly, of course, it was astonishment that Harvard had been sitting on it for all these years without realizing what it was.\u201d",
      "Carpenter teamed up with Nicholas Vincent, a professor of medieval history at Britain's University of East Anglia, to confirm the authenticity of Harvard's document.",
      "Comparing it to the other six copies from 1300, Carpenter found the dimensions matched up. He and Vincent then turned to images Harvard librarians created using ultraviolet light and spectral imaging. The technology helps scholars see details on faded documents that are not visible to the human eye.",
      "That allowed them to compare the texts word-for-word, as well as the handwriting, which include a large capital \u2018E\u2019 at the start in \u2018Edwardus\u2019 and elongated letters in the first line.",
      "After the 1215 original printed by King John, five other editions were written in the following decades \u2014 until 1300, the last time the full document was set out and authorized by the king\u2019s seal.",
      "The 1300 version of Magna Carta is \"different from the previous versions in a whole series of small ways and the changes are found in every single one,\u201d Carpenter said.",
      "Harvard had to meet a high bar to prove authenticity, Carpenter said, and it did so \u201cwith flying colors.\u201d",
      "Its tattered and faded copy of the Magna Carta is worth millions of dollars, Carpenter estimated \u2014 though Harvard has no plans to sell it. A 1297 version of the Magna Carta sold at auction in 2007 for $21.3 million.",
      "The other mystery behind the document was the journey it took to Harvard.",
      "That task was left to Vincent, who was able to trace it all the way back to the former parliamentary borough of Appleby in Westmorland, England.",
      "The Harvard Law School library purchased its copy in 1946 from a London book dealer for $27.50. At the time, it was wrongly dated as being made in 1327.",
      "Vincent determined the document was sent to a British auction house in 1945 by a World War I flying ace who also played a role defending Malta in World War II. The war hero, Forster Maynard, inherited the archives from Thomas and John Clarkson, who were leading campaigners against the slave trade. One of them, Thomas Clarkson, became friends with William Lowther, hereditary lord of the manor of Appleby, and he possibly gave it to Clarkson.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a chain of connection there, as it were, a smoking gun, but there isn\u2019t any clear proof as yet that this is the Appleby Magna Carta. But it seems to me very likely that it is,\u201d Vincent said. He said he would like to find a letter or other documentation showing the Magna Carta was given to Thomas Clarkson.",
      "Vincent and Carpenter plan to visit Harvard in June to see its Magna Carta firsthand \u2014 and they say the document is as relevant as ever at a time when Harvard is clashing with the Trump administration over how much authority the federal government should have over its leadership, admissions and activism on campus.",

      "Newark Mayor Ras Baraka is set to appear in federal court for a status conference on the Trump administration\u2019s charge he trespassed at an immigration detention center in the city last week",
      "Newark Mayor Ras Baraka is set to appear in federal court Thursday for a status conference on the Trump administration's charge he trespassed at an immigration detention center in the city last week.",
      "Baraka, a Democrat running for governor in the June 10 primary, will be at the procedural hearing, his office said. U.S. Magistrate Judge Andr\u00e9 Espinosa set the conference after he agreed to a motion from interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, who requested to cancel a preliminary hearing in light of court rules that don't require such hearings for \u201cpetty offenses.\u201d",
      "The trespassing charge against Baraka has a statutory maximum sentence of 30 days in prison. The mayor has denied the charge.",
      "Witnesses said the arrest last week came after Baraka attempted to join three members of New Jersey\u2019s congressional delegation, Reps. Robert Menendez, LaMonica McIver, and Bonnie Watson Coleman, in attempting to enter the facility.",
      "Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday decried the \u201cspectacle\u201d at the detention facility, calling it a \u201cnew low for congressional Democrats.\u201d He said Republicans are having conversations about possible disciplinary action, including censuring the three Democrats or removing them from House committees.",
      "Messages seeking comment Wednesday were left with the members of Congress who were there.",
      "Baraka, an outspoken opponent of President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown and a vocal opponent of the facility\u2019s opening, returned to the center Tuesday, but left without incident.",
      "It was not immediately clear how Baraka\u2019s appearance at the gates Tuesday differed from Friday when he was arrested.",
      "He has denied being on the detention facility\u2019s property, which is run by private prison operator Geo Group.",
      "In video of the Friday altercation shared with The Associated Press, a federal official in a jacket with the Homeland Security Investigations logo can be heard telling Baraka he could not enter the facility because \u201cyou are not a Congress member.\u201d",
      "Baraka then left the secure area, rejoining protesters on the public side of the gate. Video showed him speaking through the gate to a man in a suit, who said: \u201cThey\u2019re talking about coming back to arrest you.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not on their property. They can\u2019t come out on the street and arrest me,\u201d Baraka replied.",
      "Minutes later, several Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, some wearing face coverings, surrounded him and others on the public side. Baraka was dragged back through the gate in handcuffs.",
      "Delaney Hall is a two-story building next to a county prison and formerly operated as a halfway house. In February, ICE awarded a 15-year contract to The Geo Group Inc. to run the detention center. Geo valued the contract at $1 billion in an unusually long and large agreement for ICE.",

      "A Wisconsin judge accused of helping a man evade U.S. immigration authorities is set to enter a plea in federal court",
      "MILWAUKEE -- A Wisconsin judge accused of helping a man evade U.S. immigration authorities was set to appear in federal court Thursday and enter a preliminary plea.",
      "Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan is charged with concealing an individual to prevent arrest and obstruction. Prosecutors say she escorted Eduardo Flores-Ruiz and his lawyer out of her courtroom through a back jury door on April 18 after learning that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were in the courthouse seeking his arrest for being in the country illegally. She could face up to six years in prison if convicted on both counts",
      "Dugan was scheduled to appear in federal court Thursday morning for an arraignment, an early step in the criminal justice process. Defendants routinely plead not guilty at this point to give their attorneys time to investigate and to preserve their right to a trial.",
      "The FBI arrested Dugan on April 25 at the courthouse where she works and she was later released from custody. Her arrest escalated a clash between the Trump administration and Democrats over President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. Her case is similar to one brought during the Trump's first term against a Massachusetts judge, who was accused of helping a man sneak out a courthouse back door to evade a waiting immigration enforcement agent.",
      "Dugan\u2019s attorneys filed a motion Wednesday to dismiss the case, saying she was acting in her official capacity as a judge and therefore is immune to prosecution. They also maintain the federal government violated Wisconsin\u2019s state sovereignty by disrupting a state courtroom and prosecuting a state judge.",
      "According to court documents, Flores-Ruiz illegally reentered the U.S. after being deported in 2013. Online state court records show he was charged with three counts of misdemeanor domestic abuse in Milwaukee County in March. He was in Dugan's courtroom on April 18 for a hearing.",
      "Court documents say Dugan was alerted to the agents' presence by her clerk, who was informed by an attorney that the agents appeared to be in the hallway. An affidavit says Dugan was visibly angry and called the situation \u201cabsurd\u201d before leaving the bench and retreating to her chambers. She and another judge later approached members of the arrest team in the courthouse with what witnesses described as a \u201cconfrontational, angry demeanor.\u201d",
      "After a back-and-forth with the agents over the warrant for Flores-Ruiz, Dugan demanded they speak with the chief judge and led them from the courtroom, according to the affidavit.",
      "After she returned to the courtroom, witnesses heard her say something to the effect of \u201cwait, come with me\u201d before ushering Flores-Ruiz and his attorney out through a door typically used only by deputies, jurors, court staff and in-custody defendants, according to the affidavit. Flores-Ruiz was free on a signature bond in the abuse case, according to online state court records. Federal agents ultimately captured him outside the courthouse after a foot chase.",
      "The state Supreme Court suspended Dugan last week, saying the move was necessary to preserve public confidence in the judiciary.",
      "A former federal prosecutor in Wisconsin, John Vaudreuil, said the Trump administration wants to make an example out of Dugan. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi or Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche are likely making the decisions on how to proceed rather than the local U.S. attorney in Milwaukee, making it less likely prosecutors will reduce the charges against Dugan in a deal, he said.",
      "Her attorneys will likely try to push the case to a jury trial, Vaudreuil said, because they know that \u201cpeople feel very strongly about the way the president and administration is conducting immigration policy.\"",

    "story": [
      "As the Trump administration resumes collections on defaulted student loans, hundreds of thousands of older Americans with decades-old debts are now at risk of having their Social Security checks garnished",
      "NEW YORK -- Christine Farro has cut back on the presents she sends her grandchildren on their birthdays, and she\u2019s put off taking two cats and a dog for their shots. All her clothes come from thrift stores and most of her vegetables come from her garden. At 73, she has cut her costs as much as she can to live on a tight budget.",
      "But it\u2019s about to get far tighter.",
      "As the Trump administration resumes collections on defaulted student loans, a surprising population has been caught in the crosshairs: Hundreds of thousands of older Americans whose decades-old debts now put them at risk of having their Social Security checks garnished.",
      "\u201cI worked ridiculous hours. I worked weekends and nights. But I could never pay it off,\u201d says Farro, a retired child welfare worker in Santa Ynez, California.",
      "Like millions of debtors with federal student loans, Farro had her payments and interest paused by the government five years ago when the pandemic thrust many into financial hardship. That grace period ended in 2023 and, earlier this month, the Department of Education said it would restart \u201cinvoluntary collections\u201d by garnishing paychecks, tax refunds and Social Security retirement and disability benefits. Farro previously had her Social Security garnished and expects it to restart.",
      "Farro\u2019s loans date back 40 years. She was a single mother when she got a bachelor\u2019s degree in developmental psychology and when she discovered she couldn\u2019t earn enough to pay off her loans, she went back to school and got a master\u2019s degree. Her salary never caught up. Things only got worse.",
      "Around 2008, when she consolidated her loans, she was paying $1,000 a month, but years of missed payments and piled-on interest meant she was barely putting a dent in a bill that had ballooned to $250,000. When she sought help to resolve her debt, she says the loan company had just one suggestion.",
      "\u201cThey said, \u2018Move to a cheaper state,\u2019\u201d says Farro, who rents a 400-square-foot casita from a friend. \u201cI realized I was living in a different reality than they were.\u201d",
      "Student loan debt among older people has grown at a staggering rate, in part due to rising tuitions that have forced more people to borrow greater sums. People 60 and older hold an estimated $125 billion in student loans, according to the National Consumer Law Center, a six-fold increase from 20 years ago. That has led Social Security beneficiaries who have had their payments garnished to balloon by 3,000% over the same period, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "An estimated 452,000 people aged 62 and older had student loans in default, according to a January report from CFPB.",
      "Debbie McIntyre, a 62-year-old adult education teacher in Georgetown, Kentucky, is among them. She dreams of retiring and writing more historical fiction, and of boarding a plane for the first time since high school. But her husband has been out of work on disability for two decades and they\u2019ve used credit cards to get by on his meager benefits and her paycheck. Their rent will be hiked $300 when their lease renews. McIntyre doesn\u2019t know what to do if her paycheck is garnished.",
      "She floats the idea of bankruptcy, but that won\u2019t automatically clear her loans, which are held to a different standard than other debt. She figures if she picks up extra jobs babysitting or tutoring, she could put $50 toward her loans here and there. But she sees no real solution.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what more I can do,\u201d says McIntyre, who is too afraid to check what her loan balance is. \u201cI\u2019ll never get out of this hole.\u201d",
      "Braxton Brewington of the Debt Collective debtors union says it\u2019s striking how many older people dial into the organization\u2019s calls and attend its protests. Many of them, he says, should have had their debts cancelled but fell victim to a system \u201criddled with flaws and illegalities and flukes.\u201d Many whose educations have left them in late-life debt have, in fact, paid back the principal on their loans, sometimes several times over, but still owe more due to interest and fees.",
      "For those who are subject to garnishment, Brewington says, the results can be devastating.",
      "\u201cWe hear from people who skip meals. We know people who dilute their medication or cut their pills in half. People take drastic measures like pulling all their savings out or dissolving their 401ks,\u201d he says. \u201cWe know folks that have been driven into homelessness.\u201d",
      "Collections on defaulted loans may have restarted no matter who was president, though the Biden administration had sought to limit the amount of income that could be garnished. Federal law protects just $750 of Social Security benefits from garnishment, an amount that would put a debtor far below the poverty line.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re basically providing people with federal benefits with one hand and taking them away with another,\u201d says Sarah Sattelmeyer of the New America think tank.",
      "Linda Hilton, a 76-year-old retired office worker from Apache Junction, Arizona, went through garnishment before COVID and says she will survive it again. But flights to see her children, occasional meals at a restaurant and other pleasures of retired life may disappear.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to mean restrictions,\u201d says Hilton. \u201cThere won\u2019t be any travel. There won\u2019t be any frills.\u201d",
      "Some debtors have already received notice about collections. Many more are living in fear. President Donald Trump has signed an executive order calling for the Department of Education\u2019s dismantling and, for those seeking answers about their loans, mass layoffs have complicated getting calls answered.",
      "While Education Secretary Linda McMahon says restarting collections is a necessary step for debtors \u201cboth for the sake of their own financial health and our nation\u2019s economic outlook,\u201d even some of Trump\u2019s most fervent supporters are questioning a move that will make their lives harder.",
      "Randall Countryman, 55, of Bonita, California, says a Biden administration proposal to forgive some student debt didn\u2019t strike him as fair, but he\u2019s not sure Trump\u2019s approach is either. He supported Trump but wishes the government made case-by-case decisions on debtors. Countryman thinks Americans don\u2019t realize how many older people are affected by policies on student loans, often thought to be the turf of the young, and how difficult it can be for them to repay.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s a young person\u2019s problem today,\u201d he says, \u201cis an old person\u2019s problem tomorrow.\u201d",
      "Countryman started working on a degree while in prison, then continued it at the University of Phoenix when he was released. He started growing nervous as he racked up loan debt and never finished his degree. He\u2019s worked a host of different jobs, but finding work has often been complicated by his criminal record.",
      "He lives off his wife\u2019s Social Security check and the kindness of his mother-in-law. He doesn\u2019t know how they\u2019d get by if the government demands repayment.",
      "\u201cI kind of wish I never went to school in the first place,\u201d he says.",

      "\u201cI know it's strange to people that we get so attached to an alligator, to all of our animals. ... He had a happy time here, and he died of old age,\" he said.",
      "Morris, who was found in the backyard of a Los Angeles home as an illegal pet, started his Hollywood career in 1975 and retired in 2006, when he was sent to the Colorado Gator Farm in the tiny town of Mosca. He appeared in several films, including \u201cInterview with the Vampire,\u201d \u201cDr. Dolittle 2\" and \u201cBlues Brothers 2000.\" He also appeared on \u201cCoach,\u201d \u201cNight Court\u201d and \u201cThe Tonight Show with Jay Leno\u201d featuring the late wildlife expert Steve Irwin.",

      "President Donald Trump's administration has transferred oversight of a strip of land along the U.S.-Mexico border to the military while authorizing U.S. troops to temporarily detain immigrants in the country illegally \u2014 though there's no record of troops exercising that authority as U.S. Customs and Border Protection conducts arrests. The designated national defense areas are overseen by U.S. Army commands out of Fort Bliss in the El Paso area in Texas and Fort Huachuca in Arizona.",

      "Anthony Saccavino, 61, pleaded guilty in January to running the scheme while heading the department\u2019s Bureau of Fire Prevention, which regulates the installation of fire safety and suppression systems in New York City.",
      "With the help of another chief, Brian Cordasco, Saccavino solicited and received $190,000 in bribe payments between 2021 and 2023, prosecutors said.",
      "\u201cChief Saccavino led a pay-to-play bribery scheme that would offend the sensibilities of every hard-working New Yorker,\u201d Manhattan U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton said in a statement.",
      "A retired firefighter who ran an unsanctioned \u201cexpediting\u201d business acted as the intermediary for the more than 30 projects that benefited from the accelerated reviews.",
      "Saccavino was arrested in September alongside Cordasco, who also pleaded guilty and was sentenced in March to 20 months in prison.",
      "Their arrests came days before the criminal indictment of Mayor Eric Adams on bribery charges that included allegations he sped up fire safety inspections at the Turkish consulate in exchange for illegal contributions. Adams has denied wrongdoing.",
      "The case against the mayor, which was later ordered dropped by the Trump administration, was unrelated to the fire chiefs\u2019 bribery scandal.",
      "On top of his prison term, Saccavino was ordered to pay a $150,000 fine and to return $57,000 that he personally pocketed in bribes, prosecutors said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The head of the Environmental Protection Agency came under bipartisan criticism Wednesday over his agency's actions to cancel billions of dollars in congressionally approved spending to address chronic pollution in minority communities and jump-start clean energy programs across the country.",
      "Nearly 800 grants were awarded by former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration under the 2022 climate law, which directed the EPA to spend $3 billion on grants to help low-income and minority communities improve their air and water and protect against climate change. The law allocated another $20 billion under a so-called green bank program to finance clean energy and climate-friendly projects nationwide.",
      "Funding for both programs was abruptly terminated by the Trump administration in actions that Democrats have denounced as illegal and unconstitutional.",
      "Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, a Democrat, said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has illegally withheld, or impounded, climate-law funding despite a decades-old law that explicitly prohibits such actions by the executive branch. Repeated court rulings, including by the Supreme Court, support the power of Congress to set federal spending levels.",
      "Zeldin's budget maneuvers \u201cendanger communities by making it harder to address pollution and climate chaos,\u201d Merkley said at a hearing Wednesday.",
      "Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, chair of a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on the environment, also criticized Zeldin, saying funding freezes approved by his agency \u2014 including to grants intended for rural communities in Alaska \u2014 were \u201csomewhat indiscriminate.\u2033",
      "Murkowski questioned whether severe budget cuts proposed by President Donald Trump were \u201cserious.\u201d Many of the proposals, such as an 88% cut to a state revolving fund for clean water, are likely to be reversed by Congress, she said.",
      "The EPA's approach under Zeldin is \u201cproblematic,\u201d Murkowski added. \u201cEPA has not adhered to our guidelines and has been largely unresponsive to questions,\" she said.",
      "Zeldin told Murkowski she has a special phone number for his office and can call him any time.",
      "His exchanges with Democrats were less friendly.",
      "\u201cSo you understand that when you impound funds, you\u2019re violating the law?\" Merkley asked Zeldin, a former New York congressman who took over at EPA in January.",
      "\u201cNo, Senator, we are going to follow all statutory obligations,'' Zeldin replied. \u201cWe absolutely disagree with you very strongly.''",
      "Asked under what authority the money was being withheld, Zeldin cited \u201cpolicy priorities\u201d under Trump that differ from Biden-era views.",
      "\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t the Biden administration that passed this law. It was Congress,'' Merkley shot back. \u201dAnd so, this is in the law as written, and it\u2019s signed by the president, and yet you\u2019re defying it.''",
      "Zeldin said he rejected Merkley's premise, adding, \"We couldn\u2019t possibly disagree more strongly with what you\u2019re saying.''",
      "If he can't follow his oath of office, Zeldin should resign, Merkley said, a suggestion Zeldin immediately rejected.",
      "Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state said Zeldin and Trump shared an approach when it comes to EPA: \"Burn it down.''",
      "Money being withheld by EPA would pay for things like heat pumps to reduce energy costs and pollution, wildfire preparedness and infrastructure upgrades to protect drinking water from floods and earthquakes, Murray said. \"Blocking this funding is hurting communities everywhere,'' she said.",
      "Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff asked Zeldin why he had canceled a $19.8 million grant to Thomasville, Georgia, to replace a wastewater collection system and build a community health clinic.",
      "\u201cIs a new health clinic for Thomasville woke?\u201d Ossoff asked, noting that the grant was approved under an environmental justice program the EPA has terminated.",
      "Zeldin again cited policy priorities before Ossoff, a Democrat, cut him off. \"You hurt my constituents,'' he said.",
      "Zeldin later said grants to Thomasville and towns in Alaska and Washington state may be restored if language about environmental justice and diversity is removed, in accordance with an executive order by Trump.",
      "Zeldin declined to provide specific goals for EPA staffing under his tenure, but appeared to acknowledge claims by Merkley and Murray that staff totals could return to a level last seen under former President Ronald Reagan. The EPA had fewer than 11,000 employees in 1983, compared to more than 15,100 in 2024.",
      "The agency has laid off hundreds of employees and offered voluntary retirement or deferred resignations to thousands more as part of a broader effort by Trump and adviser Elon Musk to downsize the federal workforce.",

      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order this week setting a 30-day deadline for drugmakers to electively lower prices in the U.S. or face new limits on what the government will pay",
      "President Donald Trump incorrectly placed the blame for high prescription drug prices in the U.S. on foreign nations, making the comments Monday when signing an executive order intended to lower their cost.",
      "The order sets a 30-day deadline for drugmakers to electively lower prices in the U.S. or face new limits in the future over what the government will pay. If favorable deals are not reached, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will be tasked with developing a new rule that ties prices the U.S. pays for medications to lower prices paid by other countries.",
      "Here's a closer look at the facts.",
      "CLAIM: \u201cWe were subsidizing others\u2019 healthcare, the countries where they pay a small fraction of what \u2014 for the same drug that what we pay, many, many times more for, and will no longer tolerate profiteering and price gouging from Big Pharma. But again, it was really the countries that forced Big Pharma to do things that frankly, I'm not sure they really felt comfortable doing. But they've gotten away with it, these countries. European Union has been brutal, brutal.\u201d",
      "THE FACTS: This is misleading. Prices for most prescription drugs \u2014 unbranded generics are the exception \u2014 are higher in the U.S. than they are in other high-income countries. But, experts say, it is in large part the way drug prices are negotiated in the U.S. that drives up costs.",
      "\u201cThere are structural differences in the way that we price drugs in the United States and in the way that other developed, industrialized countries price drugs,\u201d said Mariana Socal, an associate professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins University who studies the U.S. pharmaceutical market. \u201cAnd those differences really are the ones that account for these differences in price that we see at the end of the day.\u201d",
      "A 2024 report published by the RAND research organization found, using 2022 data, that prices in the U.S. were 2.78 times higher than those in 33 comparable countries across all drugs. Brand-name drugs represented the largest gap. The U.S. made up 62% of sales out of $989 billion of total drug spending among the countries studied, according to the report, but only 24% of volume.",
      "According to experts, drug companies in the U.S. are generally able to price medications higher in the U.S. because the country's drug market operates as a fragmented system where companies negotiate with individual insurers or pharmacy benefit managers, commonly known as PBMs. Many countries with lower costs have one regulatory agency that negotiates prices on behalf of the entire population, a significant bargaining chip given that drug companies can't divide and conquer as they can in the U.S. If a regulator walks away, the company loses out on profits entirely \u2014 in other words, something is better than nothing.",
      "\u201cAnything you can do to kind of bring more bargaining power to the table against the drug companies by making a decision for more beneficiaries, or more patients, that's going to put more downward pressure on drug prices,\u201d said Courtney Yarbrough, an assistant professor of health policy and management at Emory University.",
      "As it stands, drug costs in the U.S. and other countries are not directly linked, though they can affect each other. Trump\u2019s executive order establishes a \u201cmost favored nation\u201d pricing model should drugmakers not voluntarily lower costs. This means that the U.S. would peg the cost of prescription drugs to the lowest prices in comparably developed countries. It\u2019s unclear what \u2014 if any \u2014 impact the order will have on millions of Americans who have private health insurance. The federal government has the most power to shape the price it pays for drugs covered by Medicare and Medicaid.",
      "But the U.S. paying less for prescription drugs doesn\u2019t mean other countries will automatically pay more. For example, Yarbrough explained that instead of agreeing to higher prices, other countries could simply enter into secret arrangements for increased discounts and then hide what they actually pay.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not in a static global pharmaceutical market,\u201d she said.",
      "Manufacturers, wholesalers, PBMs and other members of the supply chain also have a motivation to maximize profits, not lower costs for consumers. In this spirit, manufacturers often use patents to make it impossible for cheaper versions of drugs to come to market. Although he repeatedly defended pharmaceutical companies at Monday's news conference, Trump simultaneously threatened the companies with federal investigations into their practices.",
      "\u201cThere are no saints in this industry, these are all for-profit companies,\u201d said Geoffrey Joyce, director of health policy at the University of Southern California\u2019s Schaeffer Center. \u201cTheir incentives are all wrong. Everybody makes more money off of higher list prices, so they just push list prices up.\u201d",

      "Denka also attributed much of its financial woes to what it has described as \u201cunfair and targeted\u201d pollution control measures.",
      "Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency sought to rein in dangerous chemical emissions from hundreds of facilities including Denka's. The Biden administration's environmental justice campaign spotlighted Denka's plant, located about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northwest of New Orleans in St. John the Baptist Parish.",
      "Under the Trump administration, the EPA withdrew a federal lawsuit against Denka alleging it exposed a predominantly Black population to unacceptable cancer risk \u2014 the highest nationwide \u2014 from the facility's emissions of chloroprene. Last year, officials shut down a nearby elementary school due to concerns about emissions exposure.",
      "\u201cI am elated that we are waking up every day now with no chloroprene in our air,\u201d said Tish Taylor, a local environmental activist.

The company also cited \u201ca shortage of qualified staff necessary to operate new pollution control equipment and implement other emission reduction measures.\u201d",
      "In court filings last year, Denka said it had spent more than $35 million on equipment to reduce emissions by 85% since 2017. But harmful emissions consistently remained higher than federal guidelines.",

      "The company's statement noted \u201crising energy costs,\u201d \u201cweakening global economic environment for chloroprene\u201d and \u201csupply chain disruptions\" as other factors.",
      "The Denka facility needed large amounts of chlorine to produce chloroprene, said George Eisenhauer, an analyst with commodities consulting company Argus Media. It costs more than twice as much to purchase and import chlorine into the U.S. as it does in other leading chloroprene production sites like Europe, Japan and China, he said.",
      "The costs rose over the past few years after a major U.S. chlorine producer shut down, Eisenhauer added.",
      "Trump's tariff policies have not significantly affected the price because chlorine is typically imported into the U.S. through Mexico or Canada.",
      "Denka's facility is in the 85-mile (137-kilometer) stretch of the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge officially called the Mississippi River Chemical Corridor and commonly referred to by environmental groups as \u201cCancer Alley.\u201d",
      "Robert Taylor, 84, and other environmental activists warily celebrated Denka's announcement. Taylor, who lives near the facility, pushed for stronger environmental regulations, only to watch the Trump administration roll them back.",

U.S. Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said he's seen no details to explain the dismissals.",
      "\u201cAbsent evidence to justify the firings, the workforce can only conclude that their jobs are contingent on producing analysis that is aligned with the President\u2019s political agenda, rather than truthful and apolitical,\u201d Himes said in a statement.",
      "Though it\u2019s not widely known to the public, the National Intelligence Council plays a key role in the nation\u2019s spy services, helping combine intelligence gathered from different agencies into comprehensive assessments used by the White House and senior national security officials.",
      "Collins was considered one of the intelligence service's top authorities on East Asia. Langan-Riekhof has served as a senior analyst and director of the CIA's Strategic Insight Department and is an expert on the Middle East.",
      "Attempts to reach both were unsuccessful Wednesday. The CIA declined to comment publicly, citing personnel matters.",
      "Gabbard also is consolidating some of the intelligence community's key operations, moving some offices now located at the CIA to ODNI buildings, her office said. They include the National Intelligence Council as well as the staff who prepare the President's Daily Brief, the report to the president that contains the most important intelligence and national security information.",
      "The move will give Gabbard more direct control over the brief. While the brief is already ODNI's responsibility, the CIA has long played a significant role in its preparation, providing physical infrastructure and staffing that will have to be moved to ODNI or re-created.",
      "Gabbard oversees and coordinates the work of 18 federal intelligence agencies. She has worked to reshape the intelligence community \u2014 eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs under Trump's orders and creating a task force to examine ways to cut costs and consider whether to declassify material relating to COVID-19 and other topics.",
      "Gabbard also has vowed to investigate intelligence leaks and end what she said was the misuse of intelligence for political aims.",

      "It is costing tens of millions of US dollars, partially funded by grants and investments from several governments, including the US, UK, Japan and New Zealand. Additional funding has come from various non-governmental organizations from around the world, and loans from the World Bank and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB).",
      "The Dominican government has also ploughed significant resources into the project, which required high upfront costs and a complex exploration process including drilling deep underground to test temperatures.",
      "\"Finding the resource is the first challenge. Then you need someone like us to build the facility,\" says Ormat's chief executive Doron Blachar. \"Ormat is doing the entire project, from making the plant's elements, shipping them to Dominica, mainly from Israel, and then constructing the power plant.\"",

      "\"Geothermal is a great, zero-emission electricity that doesn't depend on wind or sun, and operates 24/7,\" Mr Blachar explains. \"It brings jobs to a country, both during construction and, more importantly, during the plant's operations, along with new technology and expertise.\"",
      "Yet despite geothermal's green credentials, Dominica's new plant has raised concerns among some local residents, including environmentalist Atherton Martin who fears for the effects on the ecologically valuable Roseau Valley.",
      "\"There is no other area like it in the Caribbean,\" he says, adding that the removal of vegetation during the exploration process \"decimated wildlife\" including endemic frogs.",
      "Other residents told the BBC of some controversy over the amount of money the project was costing. It has certainly been several years in the making with the Dominican government alone said to have invested around $15m (\u00a311.3m).",
      "Dr Henderson admits that the project is \"not easy\" for a country that \"faced a big challenge\" when it had to substantially repair its electricity network after 2017's Hurricane Maria. But he insists \"it will be worth it in the end\".",
      "Another common fear about geothermal plants is the potential for triggering earthquakes.",
      "Ormat says it has never had a such an incident in its many years of operations.",
      "Mr Blachar believes the Caribbean could become \"a hub\" for geothermal technology.",
      "Ormat acquired Guadeloupe's plant from the French government in 2017 and is currently expanding it to boost its capacity to 25 megawatts.",
      "With support from the CDB and driven by the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) Commission, work is also under way to explore and develop geothermal potential in fellow volcanic island nations Grenada, St Lucia, St Kitts and Nevis, and St Vincent and the Grenadines.",
      "Ormat will operate the Dominica plant for 20 years before handing it over to state electricity provider Domlec. Mr Blachar estimates it will employ around 30 local people when it comes on stream later this year.",
      "It should initially generate enough power to meet half of Dominica's peak electricity demand, says Fred John, managing director of the government-owned Dominica Geothermal Development Company, which is also involved in the scheme.",
      "Authorities are confident the plant will then soon support the entire country, and have enough spare electricity for some to be exported to neighbouring islands.",
      "Mr John says that the facility will \"serve as a test case for an attractive alternative\" to fossil fuels. \"The rest of the OECS will benefit from the lessons learned here \u2013 both what worked and what didn't,\" he adds.",
      "The OECS recently set a target to reach 30% renewable energy within 10 years, with some countries, including Dominica and St Kitts, aiming for 100% by then.",
      "OECS Director General Dr Didacus Jules describes Dominica's geothermal project as a \"bold and visionary step\".",
      "\"As a region heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels, the transition to green energy is not optional - it is existential,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"This development also breathes new life into the long-held vision of a regional energy grid - one that connects our islands through clean, reliable, and affordable energy.\""

      "They all involved breaches of environmental permit licence due to samples not being taken in a timely way, or being incomplete or being submitted late or not at all.",

      "The owner and crew of a luxury superyacht that sank off the coast of Sicily, killing tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch and six others, were unaware wind speeds of over 73mph could tip it over, according to an interim report.",
      "Modelling commissioned after the disaster indicates gusts of that speed hitting the side of the Bayesian, when it had its sails down and centreboard up, would \"likely result\" in its capsize.",
      "The UK's Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB), leading the international investigation, said winds of over 80mph \"violently\" hit the vessel, causing it to flood within seconds.",
      "It sank near the town Porticello on 19 August last year during freak weather, with reports of water spouts.",
      "Seven of the 22 people onboard were killed, including Mr Lynch, 59, and his 18-year-old daughter Hannah.",

      "The yacht had its sails down and centreboard up when it sank.",
      "The MAIB commissioned modelling from the University of Southampton to examine the stability of the yacht in these conditions.",
      "It indicated that - if the wind was blowing directly across the beam, or side, of the boat - wind speeds in excess of 73mph were sufficient to tip the boat over and \"it is possible\" the yacht was similarly vulnerable to lower wind speeds, the MAIB said.",
      "But this information was not included in the onboard stability information book and \"consequently, these vulnerabilities were also unknown to either the owner or the crew of Bayesian\", the report found.",

      "The report lays out more detail as to how the sinking unfolded.",
      "Investigators say the yacht sailed to the site where it sank on the previous day, in order to \"shelter\" from forecast thunderstorms. The sails were furled at the time.",
      "Wind speed was \"no more than eight knots (9mph)\" at 03:00 - about an hour before the incident. Some 55 minutes later it had increased to 30 knots (34.5mph), and it had accelerated to 70 knots (80.6mph) by 04:06 when the yacht capsized.",
      "As the storm intensified, several crew members were working in response to the conditions. The deck hand went onto the deck to close the yacht's windows.",
      "Five people were injured \"either by falling or from things falling on them\" and the deck hand was \"thrown into the sea\", the report says.",

      "Dr Simon Boxall, Oceanographer at the University of Southampton, said the Bayesian was in \"the wrong place at the wrong time\".",
      "\"The priorities for the crew would have been to shut the hatches and the doors, which they did,\" he told the BBC.",
      "This means speculation about water flooding in because everything was open is \"obviously not the case\".",
      "\"The next priority\u00a0would have been to start the engines - so they would have some manoeuvrability to position themselves within a storm - and to then lift anchor, which the crew did, but this takes time,\" he added.",

    "story": [
      "There's a vast empty space in the middle of the factory floor in Foshan in southern China where workers should be welding high-end air fryers for the US market.",
      "Derek Wang says his American customers were wowed by his air fryer models - which are controlled via smartphones and can also bake, roast and grill.",
      "But then on 2 April, Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs hit all Chinese goods entering the US, eventually reaching 145%  - and his clients asked him to pause production.",
      "\"I tried to keep smiling through my anxiety for the sake of my 40 workers,\" he told the BBC.",
      "On Wednesday, as a deal to ease the trade war came into effect, Mr Wang said his US buyers were back on the phone.",
      "Both countries still face some tariffs. There is at least a 30% tax on all Chinese goods entering the US and Beijing has kept a 10% levy on American goods coming into the country, down from 125%.",
      "But this surprise agreement after a weekend of negotiations in Switzerland has given factories and businesses some breathing room.",
      "\"At this time, our US client is willing to pay for the tariffs. Of course, we had to bargain with them as they asked us to lower some of our costs,\" he said.",
      "Mr Wang, who studied engineering in Delaware in the US, spent three years helping develop the air fryer model. It cost him $500,000 to set up his company and he said the tariffs came as a shock.",
      "\"It felt like my parents were getting a divorce. China and US are the most important economic and cultural powers in the world. Their sudden separation would lead to a world that we cannot imagine. Tariffs as high as 145% would mean we have to say goodbye to one another.",
      "But he adds, \"there's a saying in Chinese: good fortune comes out of bad\".",
      "Mr Wang believes his \"good fortune\" is that this trade war has accelerated his plan to diversify away from doing business with America.",
      "This is one of the reasons why Beijing believes it has the upper hand in its negotiations with Washington. China has choices and officials have been actively encouraging the country's firms to do more business in places like Africa, South America and South East Asia.",
      "Many other Chinese businesses have also told the BBC that they are looking to diversify away from the US to reduce their reliance on the market - suggesting in the long-term there could be more of a separation between the US and China, rather than a divorce.",
      "Donald Trump has suggested that he may speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping by the end of this week. The world's two largest economies will now enter talks after agreeing to a ceasefire in their economic war for 90 days.",
      "Beijing has framed this deal as a win - not just for China but for all countries facing US tariffs.",
      "But it has come at a cost.",
      "A short walk through Shunde district - known as the \"capital of home appliances\" - presents a sobering assessment of a struggling manufacturing sector.",
      "Factory workers use the cooler evenings in Foshan to let off a little steam. They spill out into every corner of the local park.",
      "During the day they pack, mould and assemble nearly everything that you would find in your kitchen - from gas stoves and washing machines to kettles and fridges.",
      "At night, after leaving work, one group line dances in one corner of the small park, while a heated basketball match takes place in another part.",
      "Posters lining the walls of the streets tout \"stable work and easy\" jobs involving packing and screwing products for 30 days in a home appliance factory for 16 yuan an hour, to assembling air conditioning units for 20 yuan an hour.",
      "But agents told us that several factories had stopped hiring, especially those linked to the US - some had even shut down parts of their production line.",
      "The BBC was told that several of these workers will sleep in the park to save money. Many of them travel to Foshan from their home towns, which can be hundreds of kilometres away.",
      "Several nearby hostels offer rooms for 20 yuan a night, which can be at least an hour's pay. Many will want to pocket whatever they earn to send it back to their families.",
      "This is the picture of China that President Trump's team have tried to present \u2013 one of sluggish growth, rising unemployment and a chronic housing crisis.",
      "\"We're not looking to hurt China,\" Mr Trump said after the trade agreement was announced, while adding that China was \"being hurt very badly\".",
      "\"They were closing up factories. They were having a lot of unrest, and they were very happy to be able to do something with us.\"",
      "This may be overstating Beijing's economic woes. This country is still leading the world when it comes to the production of electric vehicles and solar panels, and it is making significant headway in artificial intelligence technology.",
      "Officials in China have also continued to stress this country can take the pain of an economic war. But it is being keenly felt by some on the frontline and that may be part of why Beijing has started talking to the US.",
      "This latest \"ceasefire\" has prompted a rush of orders between the two countries as businesses wonder if it can last.",
      "He Ke, or HK to his American clients, has called his workers back from their home towns to restart his sofa business, Gongyuan Furniture.",
      "It ground to a halt even before Mr Trump's tariffs hit 145%.",
      "\"We had a day off straightaway,\" said Mr He. \"Once the tariffs hit 50%, we had already come to a standstill. When they hit 145%, we certainly could not do business. It was just not possible.\"",
      "His production line with around 200 workers once took up all four floors of the building.",
      "Since the Covid pandemic, he has only needed one floor and around 40 staff. But he still has the odd high-profile client \u2013 he claims Elon Musk sits on one of his sofas.",

In the past, when we went out to spend money, we spent a lot of money. We did not think about whether the price was high or cheap. We will buy it as long as we like it. Now, when we want to buy a relatively expensive things, we have to think twice, because the money is not easy to earn.\"",
      "Like Mr Wang and his air fryers, Mr He also says he is looking at diversifying his sales away from the US, but he has hope that the world's two biggest economies can come to an agreement in the next 90 days.",
      "\"I am just a small businessman. But I do understand that the game between these two countries is temporary. I think if they want to survive with each other for a long time, they will definitely sit down and talk things over.\"",
      "China has come to the table - but this fight is far from over",
      "The West says China makes too much. Its workers disagree"

      "Thames has faced heavy criticism over its performance in recent years following a series of sewage discharges and leaks.",
      "Since the dire state of the company's finances first emerged about 18 months ago, the government has been on standby to put Thames into special administration.",
      "The firm is in discussions with Ofwat to put in place a \"turnaround regime\" designed to let it escape a loop where fines lead to further fines because it has not got the money to improve.",

      "Questions were asked about why the water company had whittled down potential bidders from five to just one, and why Thames had pressed ahead with an additional, high-interest loan earlier this year of \u00a33bn when cheaper options seemed available.",
      "Sir Adrian insisted that in both cases, those were the most credible options when the company faced completely running out of cash and being forced into a government-sponsored administration.",
      "Thames originally appealed a decision by Ofwat to limit bill rises to 35% above inflation over the next five years, insisting it needed 53% to deliver the investments needed to improve services.",
      "However, it paused its appeal to the Competition and Markets Authority partly because the process could take several months and also because it hoped to reach an agreement with Ofwat to water down fines, which would make further bill increases unnecessary.",
      "Some have bristled at the idea of Thames being given special treatment after getting into financial distress of its own making.",
      "\"Customers will have little sympathy for a company with such a poor track record on service delivery and complaints,\" said Mike Keil, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water (CCW).",

      "M&S isn't giving many updates",
      "While the retailer was quick to inform customers of the breach, subsequent updates have been infrequent.",
      "Its revelation on 13 May that some customer data had been stolen by hackers marked only its fourth public statement on the hack in three weeks.",

      "Many of its official communications have featured apologies from the company's boss Stuart Machin but no mention of when normal business will resume.",
      "M&S has not commented on the nature of the cyber attack, which is not unusual in cases like this, but experts say the uncertainty risks damaging consumer trust in the brand.",
      "Ms Naghten believes M&S has \"another week\" before it would have to provide information on when normal service will resume."

    "story": [
      "Earlier this year, Deborah Grushkin, an enthusiastic online shopper from New Jersey, \"freaked out\".",
      "US President Donald Trump had signed an order to stop allowing packages from China worth less than $800 (\u00a3601) to enter the country free of import taxes and customs procedures.",
      "It was a move, backed by traditional retailers, that had been discussed in Washington for years amid an explosion of packages slipping into the US under the limit.",
      "Many countries, including the UK, are considering similar measures, spurred in part by the rapid ascent of Shein and Temu.",
      "But in the US, Trump's decision to end the carve-out while ordering a blitz of new trade tariffs, including import taxes of at least 145% on goods from China, has delivered a one-two punch that has left businesses and shoppers reeling.",
      "US-based e-commerce brands, which were set up around the system, are warning the changes could spark failures of smaller firms, while shoppers like Deborah brace for price hikes and shortages.",
      "With the 2 May deadline bearing down, the 36-year-old last month rushed in some $400 worth of items from Shein - including stickers, T-shirts, sweatshirts, Mother's Days gifts and 20 tubes of liquid eyeliner.",
      "\"I felt like maybe it was my last sort of hurrah,\" she says.",
      "Use of rules known as \"de minimis\", which allow low-value packages to avoid tariffs, customs inspections and other regulatory requirements, has surged over the last decade.",
      "Take-up accelerated during Trump's first term in office, when he raised tariffs on many Chinese goods.",
      "By 2023, such shipments represented more than 7% of consumer imports, up from less than 0.01% a decade earlier. Last year, nearly 1.4 billion packages entered the country using the exemption - more than 3.7 million a day.",
      "Advocates of the carve-out, which include shipping firms, say the system has streamlined trade, leading to lower prices and more options for customers.",
      "Those in favour of change, a group that includes lawmakers from both parties, say businesses are abusing rules intended to ease gifts between family and friends, and the rise has made it easier to slip products that are illegal, counterfeit or violate safety standards and other rules into the country.",
      "Trump recently called de minimis a \"scam\", brushing off concerns about higher costs. \"Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,\" he said.",
      "However, polls suggest concerns about his economic policies are rising as the changes start to hit home.",
      "Krystal DuFrene, a retired 57-year-old from Mississippi who relies on disability payments for her income, says she has nervously been checking prices on Temu for weeks, recently cancelling an order for curtains after seeing the price more than triple.",
      "Though she eventually found the same item for the original price in the platform's US warehouse network, she says the cost of her husband's fishing nets had more than doubled.",
      "\"I don't know who pays the tariff except the customer,\" she says. \"Everywhere is selling cheap stuff from China so I actually prefer being able to order directly.\"",
      "When the rules around de minimis changed last week, Temu said it would stop selling goods imported from China in the US directly to customers from its platform, and that all sales would now be handled by \"locally based sellers\", with orders fulfilled from within the US.",
      "'End of an era'",
      "Even without the latest tariffs, economists Pablo Fajgelbaum and Amit Khandelwal had estimated that ending de minimis would lead to at least $10.9bn in new costs, which they found would be disproportionately borne by lower income and minority households.",
      "\"It does kind of feel like the end of an era,\" says Gee Davis, a 40-year-old author from Missouri, who used Temu during a recent house move to buy small items such as an electric can opener and kitchen cabinet organisers.",
      "She says it was a relief to be able to easily afford the extras and the new rules felt like a \"money grab\" by the government to benefit big, entrenched American retailers like Amazon and Walmart that sell similar products - but at a bigger mark-up.",
      "\"I don't think it's right or fair that little treats should be [restricted] to people who are richer.",
      "\"It just would be a real bummer if everyone who was under a certain household income threshold was just no longer able to afford anything for themselves.\"",
      "As with other Trump policy changes, questions remain about the significance of the shift.",
      "The president was already forced to suspend the policy once before, as packages began piling up at the border.",
      "Lori Wallach, director at Rethink Trade, which supports ending de minimis for consumer safety reasons, says the end of the exemption is significant \"on paper\", but she fears the administration is taking steps that will weaken its implementation.",
      "She points to a recent customs notice, which said products affected by many of the new tariffs could enter the country through the informal process, a move that eases some regulatory requirements.",
      "\"Practically, because all of this stuff can come though informal entry, it's going to be extremely hard to collect tariffs or to be able to inspect really very much more than before the change happened,\" she says.",
      "'An insurmountable shift'",
      "Customs and Border Protection deny the move will undermine enforcement, noting that firms are still required to supply more information than before.",
      "Businesses have indicated they are taking the changes seriously.",
      "Both Shein and Temu last month warned customers that prices would rise, while Temu says it is rapidly expanding its network of US-based sellers and warehouses to protect its low prices.",
      "Other business groups say many smaller, less high-profile American brands that manufacture abroad for US customers are struggling - and may not survive.",
      "\"If the tariffs weren't in place, it would be like taking a little bit of bitter medicine,\" says Alex Beller, board member of the Ecommerce Innovation Alliance, a business lobby group and a co-founder of Postscript, which works with thousands of smaller businesses on text messaging marketing.",
      "\"But paired with the other tariffs, especially for brands that manufacture in China, it just becomes an insurmountable shift.\"",

      "Yet with two high-speed rail (HSR) projects now under construction, and others planned, is the US finally on track to start catching up with the fast trains seen in China, Japan and Europe?",
      "Rick Harnish, of US campaign group High Speed Rail Alliance, says it is at least good to see the first two schemes being built.",
      "\"The first is the San Francisco to Los Angeles route,\" he explains. \"That's an incredibly challenging route to build because of the mountains in California.",
      "\"Then there's Las Vegas to Los Angeles, a relatively easy project to build, as it is flat land.\"",
      "In addition, there are plans for a HSR line from Portland in Oregon to Seattle in Washington State, and onto Vancouver in Canada. And another between Dallas and Houston.",
      "Yet Mr Harnish warns that planning efforts for the former are \"moving slowly\", while the Texas line is now more doubtful after President Trump's government cancelled a $63.9m (\u00a348m) grant.",
      "By marked contrast, the total length of China's HSR network will reportedly exceed 50,000 km (31,000 miles) this year.",
      "Meanwhile, the European Union has 8,556 km of HSR lines, led by Spain's 3,190 km.",
      "In the UK, the only current HSR line is High Speed 1, the 68 miles link between the Channel Tunnel and London St Pancras. But High Speed 2 continues to be constructed from London Euston to Birmingham, despite well-publicised funding issues.",
      "While there is no universally agreed definition on what constitutes HSR, global railways trade group International Union of Railways says that trains generally need to be moving at more than 250 km/h (155 mph).",
      "So why does US lag behind Europe and especially China?",
      "\"We're a very car-addicted nation,\" says American rail industry journalist and author Will Doig. \"There's lots of people who just don't think we need it, or don't really want it coming through their area.",
      "\"And the US government has really shown a willingness to shut down investment in a lot of projects, especially rail.\"",
      "Further complicating the situation in the US is that the boss of the government-owned passenger train service Amtrak, Stephen Gardner, resigned last month. It was widely reported that he stood down after pressure from the White House.",
      "Amtrak currently does not operate any HSR trains. Later this year it is due to enter 28 new 160mph NextGen Acela trains into service on its Northeast Corridor route between Boston and Washington DC. However, only around 50 miles of the 457-mile line can presently allow trains to travel at more than 150mph.",
      "Amtrak is not involved in the high-speed lines being built in California and Nevada. The LA to San Francisco project, called California High-Speed Rail, is being led by the state of California, and due to be completed by 2033.",
      "The line from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, Brightline West, is a privately-run project. It is expected to open in 2028.",
      "Globally, there are 23 nations with HSR, according to Mr Harnish. His non-profit organisation has the sole mission of bringing it to the US.",
      "Allowing HSR trains to run safely is far from straightforward, he adds. \"You can't have any crossings with highways, it needs to be very straight and a sealed corridor.\"",
      "In China the country is still building more and more HSR lines, with the total distance expected to reach around 60,000km by 2030.",
      "Chinese cities that get HSR links see their economies increase by 14.2%, according to data from Denmark-based think tank 21st Europe.",
      "Chinese firms are also helping to build HSR systems in other Asian countries, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "Will Doig, who wrote a book called High-Speed Empire, Chinese Expansion, and the Future of Southeast Asia, says that China is not just interested in helping its neighbours improve their rail networks.",
      "\"It is a way of China spreading its influence across a region that it felt was geopolitically strategic,\" he says.",
      "\"In some of these cases, countries have taken out loans from China so that China can then build the railways.\" He warns that this may put them \"in a position where they're beholden to China\".",
      "Europe's growing HSR network is testament to the continent's history of investing in its public infrastructure, says Kaave Pour from 21st Europe.",
      "His think tank is now calling for further expansion of HSR, so that it connects most capitals and main cities in the EU, and those in the UK.",
      "Mr Pour says that if the US wants to develop HSR it needs to start with a cultural shift, a move towards more public transport, and asking itself \"what type of future does it want?\".",
      "Mr Harnish from the High Speed Rail Alliance says that in order for HSR to work in the US, \"the federal government is an essential component\".",
      "Yet as already flagged, the White House has pulled the plug on giving the planned high-speed line between Houston and Dallas a federal grant. US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy described the project as a \"waste of taxpayers' money\".",
      "Scott Sherin is an executive at French train manufacturer Alstom. His firm is suppling Amtrak's new high-speed trains, but he questions whether the US has the political will \"to spend the public purse on rail versus other modes of transportation\".",
      "He also notes that any future HSR lines would struggle to get into city centres such as Dallas and Houston, because there are too many buildings. \"The issue is that the cities are so densely built [in their centres]\".",
      "Will Doig says that going forward he would love to see China helping to build more HSR in the US, but that he is not holding his breath.",
      "\"It's politically very difficult,\" he says. \"Which is too bad because without the animosity between the US and China, you could see how a partnership between them could really create great things for America, that America is not so good at building itself.\""

    "story": [
      "Going back to the Moon after half a century, and then to Mars, literally means reinventing the wheel.",
      "After all, Mars is a long way to come back if you get a flat.",
      "\"One thing you cannot have is a puncture,\" says Florent Menegaux, chief executive of the French tyre-maker Michelin.",
      "The tough conditions on Mars have been underlined by the experience of the unmanned Curiosity rover.",
      "Just a year after landing in 2012, its six rigid aluminium tyres were visibly ripped through with punctures and tears.",
      "As for the Moon, the US Artemis missions aim to return astronauts there, perhaps by 2027.",
      "Later Artemis missions plan to use a lunar rover to explore the Moon's south pole starting with Artemis V, currently scheduled for 2030.",
      "The Artemis astronauts will be driving much further than their Apollo forebears, who in six landings between 1969 and 1972 never ventured more than 25 miles (40km) across the Moon's surface.",
      "\"The target is to cover 10,000 kilometres in 10 years,\" says Sylvain Barthet, who runs Michelin's lunar airless wheel programme in the central French town of Clermont Ferrand.",
      "\"We're not talking about short, week-long durations, we're talking about decades of utilisation,\" says Dr Santo Padula, who has a PhD in materials science, and works for Nasa as an engineer at the John Glenn Research Centre in Cleveland, Ohio.",
      "One big challenge for anyone developing technology for the Moon are the huge temperature ranges.",
      "At the lunar poles temperatures can plunge lower than -230C, that's not far off absolute zero, where atoms stop moving.",
      "And that's a problem for tyres.",
      "\"Without atom motion you have a hard time having the material be able to deform and return,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The tyres need to be able to deform as they go over rocks and then ping back to their original shape.",
      "\"If we permanently deform a tyre, it doesn't roll efficiently, and we have issues with power loss,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The new wheels will also carry much bigger loads than the lightweight rovers Apollo astronauts cruised around in.",
      "The next space missions will need to drive round \"bigger science platforms and mobile habitats that get larger and larger\", he says.",
      "And that will be an even heftier problem on Mars, where gravity is double that on the Moon.",
      "Apollo's lunar rovers used tyres made from zinc-coated piano wire in a woven mesh, with a range of around 21 miles.",
      "Since extreme temperatures and cosmic rays break down rubber or turn it to a brittle glass, metal alloys and high-performance plastic are chief contenders for airless space tyres.",
      "\"In general, metallic or carbon fibre-based materials are used for these wheels,\" says Pietro Baglion, team leader of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Rosalind Franklin Mission, which aims to send its own rover to Mars by 2028.",
      "One promising material is nitinol, an alloy of nickel and titanium.",
      "\"Fuse these and it makes a rubber-acting metal that can bend all these different ways, and it will always stretch back to its original shape, says Earl Patrick Cole, chief executive of The Smart Tire Company.",
      "He calls nitinol's flexible properties \"one of the craziest things you will ever see\".",
      "Nitinol is a potentially \"revolutionary\" material says Dr Padula, because the alloy also absorbs and releases energy as it changes states. It may even have solutions to heating and refrigeration, he says.",
      "However, Mr Barthet at Michelin thinks that a material closer to a high-performance plastic will be more suitable for tyres that need to cover long distances on the Moon.",
      "Bridgestone has meanwhile taken a bio-mimicry approach, by making a model of the footpads of camels.",
      "Camels have soft, fatty footpads that disperse their weight on to a wider surface area, keeping their feet from sinking into loose sandy soil.",
      "Inspired by that, Bridgestone is using a felt-like material for its tread, while the wheel comprises thin metal spokes that can flex.",
      "The flexing divides the lunar module's weight into a larger contact area, so it can drive without getting stuck in the fragments of rock and dust on the Moon's surface.",
      "Michelin and Bridgestone are each part of different consortiums that, along with California's Venturi Astrolab, are presenting their proposed tyre tech to Nasa at the John Glenn Centre this month (May).",
      "Nasa is expected to make a decision later this year - it might choose one proposal or adopt elements of several of them.",
      "Meanwhile, Michelin is testing its tyres by driving a sample rover around on a volcano near Clermont, whose powdery terrain resembles the Moon's surface.",
      "Bridgestone is doing the same on western Japan's Tottori Sand Dunes.",
      "ESA is also exploring the possibility of whether Europe might make a rover on its own for other missions, says Mr Barthet.",
      "The work might have some useful applications here on Earth.",
      "While working on his doctorate at the University of Southern California, Dr Cole joined a Nasa entrepreneurial programme to work on commercialising some of the technology from the Mars super-elastic rover tyre.",
      "An early product this year will be nickel-titanium bicycle tyres.",
      "Priced around $150 (\u00a3120) each, the tyres are much more expensive than regular ones, but would be extremely durable.",
      "He also plans to work this year on durable tyres for motorbikes, aimed at areas with rough roads.",
      "For all this, his \"dream\" remains to play a part in humanity's return to the Moon.",

    "summary": "As the president goes to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE he wants them to buy more from the States.",
    "story": [
      "With US President Donald Trump due to visit Gulf states this week, a key focus will be securing significant new investment for the US economy.",
      "\"President Trump wants the announcement [of more Gulf money for the US],\" says economist Karen Young, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute think tank.",
      "\"He wants to have a big poster in a meeting that describes where these investments might go. And some estimation of what they will do to the American economy in terms of job creation or his big push, of course, on domestic manufacturing.\"",
      "Trump is due to arrive in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on Tuesday 13 May, to meet the country's de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.",
      "Trump is then expected to attend a summit of Gulf leaders in the city on 14 May, before travelling to Qatar that same day, and then ending his three-day trip in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on 15 May.",
      "The economic importance of the region to Trump is highlighted by the fact that the visit to Saudi Arabia was due to be the first overseas trip of his second term in the White House. That was before the death of Pope Francis necessitated Trump attending his funeral in Rome towards the end of April.",
      "Saudi Arabia was also the first country that Trump visited during his first term of office, going against the modern practise of US presidents to start with the UK, Canada or Mexico.",
      "Securing new investments in the US from Gulf states, and particularly from their state-backed sovereign wealth funds, will help Trump to signal back home that his \"America First\" agenda is delivering results.",
      "The presidential visit is drawing top Wall Street and Silicon Valley leaders to Saudi Arabia. A Saudi-US investment forum on 13 May in Riyadh will feature CEOs from BlackRock, Palantir, Citigroup, IBM, Qualcomm, Alphabet, and Franklin Templeton.",
      "The push comes amid economic headwinds, as President Trump's new import tariffs have significantly disrupted global trade, confidence, and the US economy itself. US economic output fell in the first three months of this year, its first fall in three years.",
      "Back in January, Prince Mohammed said that Saudi Arabia would invest $600bn (\u00a3450bn) in the US over the next four years. However, Trump has already said that he'd like that to rise to $1tn, including purchases of more US military equipment.",
      "According to Ali Shihabi \u2013 a Saudi commentator and author, with close ties to the Saudi government \u2013 a number of economic agreements will be signed during the trip.",
      "\"These deals will further integrate the Saudi and US economies together, joint ventures in the kingdom, in the United States, procurements of American weapons and goods,\" says Mr Shihabi.",
      "Huge Saudi construction projects 'might get scaled down'",
      "US economy shrinks as firms import more ahead of tariffs",
      "Optimism and uncertainty at summit as Middle East awaits Trump\u2019s return",
      "Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment fund (PIF), which controls assets worth $925bn, already has numerous investments in the US. These include Uber, gaming firm Electronic Arts, and electric car firm Lucid.",
      "Meanwhile, the UAE has already committed to investing $1.4tn in the US over the next 10 years, in sectors such as AI, semiconductors, energy and manufacturing. This was announced by the White House in March after the UAE's national security advisor, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, met President Trump in Washington.",
      "Yet Ms Young from the Middle East Institute says that the scale of these investments is not realistic in the short term. She instead says that they are long-term strategic moves, and that the figures should be taken \"with a little bit of a grain of salt\".",
      "Regarding specific deals that could be announced during Trump's visit, it is widely reported that Saudi Arabia will agree to buy more than $100bn of US arms and other military items.",
      "These are said to include missiles, radar systems and transport aircraft.",
      "The US has been a longstanding arms supplier to Saudi Arabia, but in 2021 the then Biden administration stopped selling Riyadh offensive weapons, citing concerns about the country's role in the war in neighbouring Yemen.",
      "The 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was also widely reported to be a factor. A US report said that Prince Mohammed had approved the murder.",
      "The Biden White House resumed the sale of these weapons last year. While it cited that the Saudis had stopped bombing Yemen, some commentators said that the US was seeking Saudi assistance to help end the conflict in Gaza and aid its future reconstruction.",
      "Mr Shihabi says Saudi Arabia will be seeking assurances from the White House that the US will implement a \"more efficient procurement system\", enabling the Gulf state to access ammunition and military equipment far more quickly and easily.",
      "\"The Trump administration is initiating procedures to facilitate those deals. So, it's expected that this process will improve immediately,\" he adds.",
      "Artificial intelligence is the other topic that will dominate the agenda during Mr Trump's visit. Talks are expected to centre on attracting greater Gulf investment into US tech firms, and boosting the region's access to cutting-edge American semiconductors.",
      "The UAE and Saudi Arabia have been investing billions of dollars into tech and AI sectors as they try to diversify their economies away from oil.",
      "The Emiratis, in particular, are keen to establish themselves as a global AI hub.",
      "Last week, the Trump administration scrapped the Biden-era chip regulations that placed restrictions on exports of advanced US chips to more than 120 countries including the Gulf states.",
      "The White House is expected to draft new rules that would potentially involve direct negotiations with countries like the UAE.",
      "\"For the UAE, this is absolutely essential,\" says Ms Young. \"They are aggressively building out their AI capacity. So, for them getting access to US technology is imperative to be the best.\"",
      "While much attention will be on Trump courting Gulf capital for the US, Saudi Arabia is equally focused on drawing American investment into its ambitious Vision 2030 program.",
      "Led by giant construction projects, such as the building of a linear city called The Line, Vision 2030 is central to the Saudi government's continuing efforts to diversify the country's economy away from oil.",
      "It also involves pouring resources into entertainment, tourism, mining and sports.",
      "However, foreign direct investment into Saudi Arabia declined for a third straight year in 2024, reflecting persistent challenges in attracting overseas capital.",
      "The fall in global oil prices since the start of the year has further strained Riyadh's finances, increasing pressure to either raise debt or cut spending to sustain its development goals.",
      "Oil prices tumbled to a four-year low amid growing concerns that a trade war could dampen global economic growth.",
      "The decline was further fuelled by the group of oil producing nations, Opec+, announcing plans to increase output.",
      "Saudi Arabia is part of that group, and some commentators said that the rise was in part a desire to please Trump, who has called for lower oil prices.",
      "Other analysts said the reason was more that Opec+ remains confident that the global economy is growing.",
      "The US-Saudi Business Council, is an organisation that aims to boost trade ties between the two countries.",
      "It is hoping that Trump's visit will push American businesses to explore more opportunities in Saudi Arabia, especially in sectors like AI, healthcare and education.",
      "\"The Saudi government is looking heavily to invest in these sectors. There is a very big appetite for Saudi companies to collaborate with American companies,\" Hutham Al Jalal, who heads the Riyadh office for the organisation, tells the BBC.",
      "Saudi officials are said to be confident that some deals in these sectors will be secured during Trump's visit.",
      "For Saudi Arabia, Trump's visit is about strengthening ties with their longest-standing Western ally - a relationship that grew strained during the Biden years. For President Trump, it is about landing investment deals that can be framed as a win for his economic agenda.",

    "summary": "The Independent School Council says private school fees increased by 22.6% in January compared to a year ago.",
    "story": [
      "Private school fees were 22.6% higher on average in January compared with a year ago, according to the body that represents most independent schools in the UK.",
      "The Independent Schools Council (ISC) says it expects a reduction in pupils applying to private school as a result of changes to VAT - but says it is too soon to know the full effects of the policy, which was introduced mid-year.",
      "The average termly fee for a day school in January was \u00a37,382, which includes 20% VAT, according to the ISC. In January last year the average was \u00a36,021.",
      "A Treasury spokesperson says the increase in fees are not only down to VAT and fees have been rising in private schools over the last 25 years.",
      "VAT on private school fees was introduced on 1 January across the UK.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the money raised would help \"provide the highest quality of support and teaching\" in the state sector.",
      "At the time, the government predicted fees would increase by about 10% as a result of the changes, saying some schools would be able to absorb part of the cost.",
      "The ISC said that many schools were able to reduce their fees, excluding VAT, in January to \"cushion the impact\" on parents.",
      "But the ISC chief executive Julie Robinson said the sector had been hit by a \"triple whammy\" of national insurance changes, an end to charitable business rates relief and \"the blow of 20% VAT on fees\".",
      "\"It seems clear to us that the government has underestimated the effect,\" she said.",
      "\"We know parents have already left the sector because of the threat of VAT coming in so we do expect the reality of this to lead to further decreases but the full effects will only become apparent over the next few years,\" Ms Robinson added.",
      "The 22.6% increase in average fees compares with an 8.4% rise in 2024 and a 6.4% rise in 2023.",
      "The figures were provided to the BBC by the ISC, which represents about 1,400 private schools across the UK. Its annual census, which looks at fees and pupil numbers, is conducted in January and is due to be released next week.",
      "Kath decided to remove her 12-year-old son from his private school in October after she was made aware the fees would be increasing in January.",
      "\"We worked it out and it was unaffordable. Within two terms the cost was going up by 26% to almost \u00a38,000 a term, \" she said.",
      "Her son has special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) and she originally chose the private sector due to the small class sizes and support offered.",
      "\"We are a typical middle class family, we are not rolling in it, we have one second hand car and few holidays, we watch our money. At the very least I believe they should have brought it in at the start of the academic year.\"",
      "\"Moving him mid-year was a traumatic experience but we only had 15 days to take a place once we were offered one\", she explained.",
      "Kath has now started the process of applying for an education, health and care plan to help her son get the support he needs in his new school.",
      "\"The state system is stretched and underfunded. He is a happy and resilient boy and now we have to fight for his needs to be met.\"",
      "David Morton, headmaster of The King's School in Gloucester, which charges pupils between \u00a33,725 and \u00a39,050 a term, said the policy is \"misjudged\".",
      "\"The government is trying to tax the more affluent areas of society in order to support the least affluent, but the wealthiest people have been affected the least.\"",
      "\"It's low to middle income families and those children on bursaries where the impact of VAT is being felt most,\" Mr Morton added.",
      "Given overall student numbers are set to fall by 700,000 in England by 2030, the government is confident that schools in the state sector will be able to accommodate any additional pupils moving from private schools.",
      "It estimates about 35,000 will move to the state sector in the long term and the impact will be \"very small\".",
      "Research by think tank the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) said it would be possible for the state sector to easily accommodate extra pupils as the number leaving is bigger than the total number of children attending private schools.",
      "The ISC said some of its members reported a 4.6% fall in Year 7 pupils in September 2024, but experts say the declining birth rate and cost of living could be having an impact.",
      "A judicial review of the policy has been brought by three separate groups, including parents of children with SEND and low-paying faith schools. A decision is expected  soon.",
      "The court heard how the government decided to bring the policy in mid-year to maximise the amount of money it raised.",
      "It estimates that the policy will raise an extra \u00a3460m this year, rising to \u00a31.8bn by 2029/30.",
      "As part of their election campaign, Labour promised this would be used to recruit 6,500 specialist teachers in England over their parliamentary term.",
      "The state sector is struggling with recruitment and retention and unfilled vacancies are at a record high.",
      "\"This data misrepresents reality \u2013 the increases in fees are not only down to VAT. Average fees have risen by 75% in real terms in the past 25 years and pupil numbers have remained steady\", a Treasury spokesperson said.",
      "\"Ending tax breaks for private schools will raise \u00a31.8 billion a year by 2029-30 to help deliver 6,500 new teachers and raise school standards, supporting the 94% of children in state schools to achieve and thrive\", they added.",

      "It blamed the \"triple whammy\" of higher national insurance contributions, an end to charitable business rates relief and the introduction of VAT.",

      "However, the government now predicts that around 35,000 students will move to the state sector over a longer time period, and that class sizes will not increase.",
      "It points to research by the IFS which said that state system could \"easily accommodate extra pupils\" because overall student numbers are set to fall by 700,000 by 2030.",
      "That drop is larger than the total number of children currently attending private schools.",

      "It believes the government has underestimated the level of pupil displacement that will be caused.",
      "Why was the VAT policy challenged in court?",
      "The legal challenge was brought by the ISC, a smaller group of Christian faith schools, and parent-led group Education not Discrimination.",
      "They argue that the policy goes against the legal right to an education, and claim it is discriminatory because it affects families attending low-paying faith schools.",
      "The group also cites the effect on children with Send. Those who attend private school because their needs \"cannot be adequately met in the state sector\" but who do not have an EHCP have to pay VAT.",
      "The court was told that the government had considered introducing the policy in September 2025, rather than in January.",
      "But it rejected this idea because the main objective of the VAT change was to raise additional tax revenue to support the 94% of children who attend state schools, and any delay would have undermined that.",
      "Government lawyers argued that families who wished to opt out of \"the system of universally accessible, state-funded education\" were free to send their children to private school or to educate them at home.",
      "If the legal challenge is successful, the government could consider amending the policy, but would be under no obligation to do so."

    "story": [
      "The line-up for UK's celebrity edition of The Traitors has finally been revealed - with enough star power to rival Graham Norton's chat show sofa.",
      "The 19-strong roundtable of stars joining Claudia Winkleman at Ardross Castle in Scotland boasts household names across sport and the arts.",
      "Among them are comedians Stephen Fry and Alan Carr, chat show host Jonathan Ross and Olympic diver Tom Daley - all vying to win the game of deception.",
      "Singers Paloma Faith, Cat Burns and Charlotte Church will also be there, alongside others including historian David Olusoga, broadcaster Clare Balding, actress Celia Imrie and Ted Lasso star Nick Mohammed.",
      "The third series of The Traitors, which aired in January, attracted more than 10 million viewers.",
      "The show's format is deceptively simple. A handful of contestants, known as traitors, pick off their castmates, the faithful, with nightly \"murders\" - while the faithful try to work out their identity. If any traitors remain at the end, they nab the cash prize (though this time the money goes to a charity of the winner's choosing).",
      "The celebrity season, which airs this autumn, will bring a unique mix of fame, ego and public image to the popular format. BBC News speaks to psychologists to uncover likely faithfuls, traitors and frontrunners.",
      "The comedians",
      "Alan Carr, Jonathan Ross, Stephen Fry, Joe Wilkinson and Lucy Beaumont",
      "Comedians are likely to be \"the obvious frontrunners to go the distance\", says Susie Masterson, a psychotherapist registered with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP).",
      "Humour can be a highly adapted defence mechanism, she says, which can make comedians more opaque than other contestants.",
      "Comics are also quick on their feet, used to presenting a persona and masking in public - this makes them well-equipped traitors, notes Masterson.",
      "\"I think Alan Carr could well be a frontrunner,\" she says. \"There is an affability about him, but he's also not afraid of stirring the pot. He's very authentic and has a big personality without necessarily dominating the space.\"",
      "But fame could disadvantage the high-profile names in the group, like Jonathan Ross. Status, explains consultant counselling psychologist Dr Ritika Suk Birah, can create a power imbalance.",
      "\"It can make others feel threatened or suspicious of their motives, even when there's no evidence,\" she says.",
      "This may be a particular challenge for those understood as both intelligent and articulate, like Stephen Fry.",
      "This perception can lead others to assume strategic manipulation, potentially forcing early elimination out of fear rather than logic, adds Dr Birah.",
      "Unfortunately, Masterson also believes Fry could fit into the category of contestants who \"struggle with criticism or scrutiny\".",
      "\"He might struggle with banishing people as well as any potential heat he might receive,\" she says.",
      "The singers",
      "Paloma Faith, Cat Burns and Charlotte Church",
      "Stage performers like Cat Burns are used to high-pressure situations, interacting with a variety of people in a live environment. \"This could help at the round table,\" says Masterson.",
      "She adds that Paloma Faith and Charlotte Church are both \"big personalities and have direct communication styles\". While this may make them good motivators, Masterson is unsure whether they can appear contained or measured enough to endure as traitors.",
      "The sports stars",
      "Tom Daley, Joe Marler and Clare Balding",
      "Sports people will likely make good faithfuls, says Masterson, as strong physical types tend to do better in most of the challenges and can also both lead and motivate the rest of the group. They are also usually goal-driven and able to handle pressure.",
      "\"They are quite different personalities in this group, and I'm interested to see how it might play out,\" says Masterson.",
      "\"Clare Balding is very practical and pragmatic, but we have also seen her emotional side on TV recently\".",
      "She feels Tom Daley, and to a lesser extent Balding, could well be \"golden retriever types\" - loyal and supportive - whereas rugby star Joe Marler may be less likely to want to talk things through.",
      "As for the in-built competitive edge, she says success depends on whether they can \"play as a team rather than against each other.\"",
      "The actors",
      "Nick Mohammad, Mark Bonnar, Tameka Empson, Ruth Codd, Celia Imrie",
      "Actors, like comics, may also face distrust depending on how much their castmates expect them to be naturally deceptive.",
      "However, among the group of actors, there is a good mix of ages, types of acting and levels of fame - from soap star Tameka Empson to established film names like Mark Bonnar and Celia Imrie. This could \"balance out this superficial disadvantage\" by muddying the threat level, says Masterson.",
      "She says cast members with lesser-known personalities, like Ruth Codd and Nick Mohammed, might be harder to read.",
      "The media personalities",
      "David Olusoga, Niko Omilana and Kate Garraway",
      "Presenters like Kate Garraway will be used to live interactions, giving them a potential advantage at the roundtable, notes Masterson.",
      "Historian David Olusoga, as a heavyweight intellect, will likely face the same preconception struggle as Fry, she says.",
      "Masterson also adds that quiet people can struggle to go the distance on the show, as they can either be perceived as threatening or unsupportive by the group.",
      "But the show's history has shown this isn't always the case. Last year's contestant Francesca was hardly visible in the first few episodes, even prompting memes about her supposed irrelevancy, before growing into the show and making it to the final.",
      "One dark horse is YouTube prankster Niko Omilana, says author Eloise Skinner, who holds a diploma in psychotherapy.",
      "His career in social media and online content might offer an edge in the game, as someone fluent in an online world that is hyper-aware of perception."

    "summary": "The singer sends a good luck message to Switzerland, as 10 countries qualify for Saturday's final.",
    "story": [
      "C\u00e9line Dion made a rare appearance during the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest with a brief, pre-recorded message.",
      "The star won the contest for Switzerland in 1988, and it had been rumoured she would take the stage as the ceremony returns to the country this year.",
      "\"I'd love nothing more than to be with you,\" she said in a video, apparently ruling out that possibility. \"Switzerland will forever hold a special place in my heart. It's the country that believed in me and gave me the chance to be part of something so extraordinary.\"",
      "The semi-final saw 10 acts qualify for Saturday's grand finale, including Swedish entrants KAJ, whose song Bara Bada Bastu is the runaway favourite.",
      "Their song, an accordion-led comedy number whose title translates to \"let's take a sauna\", has a 40% chance of winning, according to bookmakers.",
      "If the prediction comes true, it would be Sweden's eighth Eurovision title - making them the most victorious country in the contest's history (they are currently tied with Ireland, on seven wins each).",
      "Fifteen acts performed at Tuesday's semi-final in Basel's St Jakobshalle. These are the ones who made the cut.",
      "Norway: Kyle Alessandro \u2013 LighterAlbania: Shkodra Elektronike \u2013 ZjermSweden: KAJ \u2013 Bara Bada BastuIceland: V\u00c6B \u2013 R\u00d3ANetherlands: Claude \u2013 C'est La ViePoland: Justyna Steczkowska \u2013 GAJASan Marino: Gabry Ponte \u2013 Tutta L'ItaliaEstonia: Tommy Cash \u2013 Espresso MacchiatoPortugal: NAPA \u2013 DeslocadoUkraine: Ziferblat \u2013 Bird of Pray",

      "Portugal: NAPA \u2013 Deslocado",
      "Ukraine: Ziferblat \u2013 Bird of Pray",
      "That means that the Eurovision dreams of Azerbaijan, Belgium, Cyprus, Croatia and Slovenia have all ended for 2025.",
      "Of those, the biggest surprise was Belgium's Red Sebastian, whose rave anthem Strobe Lights had been predicted to finish among the top five.",
      "His disqualification came on the day of his 26th birthday.",
      "Ten more acts will progress to the main competition after Thursday's second semi-final.",
      "The \"Big Five\" countries, who contribute the most financially to the competition (France, Germany, Spain, the UK and Italy) qualify automatically, as do last year's winners, Switzerland.",
      "Dion's video message came during the ceremony's interval, as votes were being cast.",
      "Although she was unable to be there in person, it was a coup for organisers. The singer has stepped away from the limelight in recent years due to health issues related to stiff-person syndrome (SPS), a neurological condition that causes muscle spasms and makes it difficult for her to walk.",
      "After a four-year break, she made an emotional comeback at last summer's Paris Olympics, singing Edith Piaf's classic Hymne \u00e0 l'Amour from the Eiffel Tower.",
      "Speculation over a potential Eurovision appearance has been mounting since Swiss singer Nemo won the 2024 contest.",
      "In her video, Dion said it was \"beautiful and emotional\" to see the young singer lift the trophy, and recalled that her victory in 1988 \"was a life-changing moment for me\".",
      "\"To the people of Switzerland, thank you for your love,\" she continued. \"This night is yours and I hope you feel as proud as I do.\"",
      "After repeating her message in French, several former Eurovision contestants appeared on stage to cover Dion's winning song from 1988, Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi (Don't Leave Without Me).",
      "However, organisers said they had not given up hope of the star appearing at the final this weekend.",
      "\"We are still in close contact with her,\" they said in a statement.",
      "Tuesday's semi-final opened with Icelandic group V\u00c6B, two brothers with the unregulated energy of former Irish entrants Jedward.",
      "They were followed by Polish star Justyna Steczkowska, who hung precariously above the stage on two ropes, as she sang her witchy hymn to mother earth, Gaja.",
      "The acrobatics continued with Slovenian musician Klemen, who was suspended upside down during his ballad How Much Time Do We Have Left?",
      "The song was a tribute to his wife, who has recently recovered from cancer, but the emotional performance wasn't enough to clinch him a position in the final.",
      "Taking a lighter note was Estonia's Tommy Cash, whose quirky anthem Espresso Macchiato was interrupted by a \"stage invader\" - actually a dancer who replicated his noodle-limbed dance moves.",
      "The arena was awash with Ukranian flags for Ziferblat, whose prog-pop anthem Bird Of Pray is a message of hope and resilience to families separated by the country's ongoing war with Russia.",
      "Italy's Lucio Corsi brought 70s glam rock vibes with his track Volevo Esse Un Duro, which even featured a visual call-back to David Bowie and Mick Ronson's iconic 1972  performance of Starman on Top Of The Pops.",
      "Croatia's singer Marko Bo\u0161njak was all black eyeliner and sinister energy for his kill-your-enemies anthem Poison Cake, while Dutch singer Claude took the opposite approach, brimming with positivity throughout his upbeat performance of C'est La Vie.",
      "And Swiss singer Zo\u00eb M\u00eb was bathed in a sea of mobile phone lights as she performed Voyage , an understated and rather beautiful plea for kindness and understanding.",
      "However, KAJ were the artists to beat - with the entire audience stomping along to their goofy sauna anthem (\"Damn it, turn up the heat!\")",
      "The song, performed in the V\u00f6r\u00e5 dialect, is a radical departure from Sweden's tried and tested formula of slick pop anthems.",
      "It was the surprise winner at the Melodifestivalen, the hotly-contested show that selects the country's Eurovision entry, and has gone on to top the Swedish pop charts for 11 weeks.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, the band - who are actually from the Swedish-speaking part of Finland - said it was strange to enter the contest as the presumed favourite.",
      "\"We are feeling the pressure a bit,\" they admitted, \"but we're gonna go out there, have fun, bring the steam, bring the sauna culture, and we'll see how far it goes.\""

      "When asked by the judge David de Pas if she thought she was going to die she replied in a small voice: \"I absolutely did think I was gonna die.\"",
      "Kardashian said she looked in the eyes of the man who tied her up to try to remember details - and that he told her if she remained quiet, she would be ok.",
      "After the robbers took the jewellery, they dashed out of the suite, leaving Kardashian in the bathroom. She said she then managed to free her hands from the cable ties and hopped down the staircase to the first floor of the suite, where her stylist and friend Simone Harouche helped release the other ties.",
      "The two then ran out onto the balcony where they called for help while hiding in the bushes. Kardashian said she was worried the men would return, and that when Parisian police turned up, she couldn't trust them because the robbers had also been wearing police uniforms.",
      "During the testimony in the packed courtroom, Kardashian also answered several questions from the judge about why her security were not present at the time.",
      "Her usual team had been sent to accompany her sister Kourtney to the club, while Kim had stayed in.",
      "She told the court she did not have a bodyguard with her because up until the robbery, she and her family had not believed they needed that level of security. She said she had previously always felt safe to go out on the streets of Paris on her own, and they had been comfortable with their security team staying at a different hotel.",
      "\"Everything changed\" after Paris, she said, noting that she employs up to six people to guard her house at night now, and that she started to get a \"phobia of going out\" because she thought people would \"see me out and know my home was empty\".",
      "\"I can't even sleep at night if I know there's not multiple security\" guards, she said, noting her concern about copycat attacks, and that her Los Angeles house was robbed even before the family returned from the Paris trip.",
      "Seeking closure",
      "Kardashian's testimony on Tuesday was interrupted at several points by offers of apology from two of the defendants in the court room, who have pleaded guilty to the charge. While she accepted Khedache's apology, she did not acknowledge the presence of the other defendants who are contesting the charges.",
      "She ignored her former driver Gary Madar who is accused of having tipped off the burglary ring about her whereabouts. He has denied the charges.",
      "She also expressed anger over one of the defendants who has pleaded guilty, Yunice Abbas, who published a memoir in 2021 prior to the trial titled '\"I Held Up Kim Kardashian\".",
      "Kardashian told the court on Tuesday she was \"really shocked when I saw there was a book\".",
      "\"Not only did he do this, but now [he's] making money off that - my jewellery, my memories, the watch my dad who passed away gave me when I graduated high school. I can't get that back.\"",
      "She also told the court she wanted closure from the trial's proceedings.",
      "\"I wanted to be a part of today because I am a victim in this case and it's the first time I'm able to really hear from everyone and follow along,\" she said.",
      "\"This is what I do. I want to become a lawyer and I do believe everyone has the opportunity to speak their truth, and this is my closure and my opportunity to put this to rest after everything I've been through.\"",
      "Kardashian added that her job is \"to tell my truth and hope this doesn't happen to anyone else\".",
      "\"It was terrifying and life-changing and I don't wish that kind of terror on anyone - to think you could be killed or raped - I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.\""

    "story": [
      "Yuval Raphael never dreamt she'd be at Eurovision.",
      "The last major music event she attended was the Nova festival, in Israel, where she was nearly killed. On 7 October 2023, the singer fled the festival when Hamas gunmen started shooting.",
      "Now she's preparing to go on stage at the world's largest music event.",
      "\"It's something I deal with every day,\" she told the BBC. \"It feels like a personal win, just to be having this experience and representing my country and doing it with such pride.\"",
      "On that day - one and a half years ago - Ms Raphael was attending her first outdoor rave. As rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel, and Hamas gunmen started shooting at revellers, she attempted to flee the carnage.",
      "She and her friends took refuge in a concrete bomb shelter at the side of a road. Around 50 people were crammed in, lying on top of each other.",
      "But there was no escape as the gunmen shot repeatedly into the mass of bodies in the shelter and then threw in hand grenades.",
      "Ms Raphael managed to call her father in tears, as heard in a recording played in an Israeli documentary. \"Dad, lots of people are dead. Send the police here. Please dad, send the police, it's urgent.. they're crushing me,\" she said.",
      "\"Be quiet,\" he replied. \"Yuvali my daughter. Yuvali, breathe deep. Hide. Play dead.\"",
      "\"Bye,\" she said, thinking that was the end.",
      "Ms Raphael was one of only 11 people in the shelter to survive. She hid under a pile of dead bodies for eight hours until they were rescued.",
      "That day, around 1,200 people were killed by gunmen led by Hamas, and 251 were taken hostage.",
      "Ms Raphael's professional singing career started after the attack. \"I wished for myself to be happy and to really understand the gift that I had been given, and that's to live,\" she says. \"To have more experiences, to be happy and to live fully.\"",
      "On Thursday, the 24-year-old will sing her song, New Day Will Rise, at the Eurovision semi-final with shrapnel still in her leg.",
      "The rules of the European Broadcasting Union \u2013 which is in charge of Eurovision \u2013 means no political statements can be made. The singer won't describe what happened to her at Nova during the run-up to the competition. She previously gave testimony about her experience to the United Nations.",
      "The Israeli entrant has had to contend with protests about her country's participation in the song contest.",
      "Irish national broadcaster RT\u00c9 asked the EBU for a discussion on Israel's inclusion. Its director general, Kevin Bakhurst, said he was \"appalled by the ongoing events in the Middle East and by the horrific impact on civilians in Gaza, and the fate of Israeli hostages\". Spain and Slovenia's broadcasters also asked for a discussion.",
      "Last week, more than 70 former Eurovision contestants signed a letter calling on the organisers to ban Israel from the competition.",
      "More than 52,800 people have been killed in Gaza since the 7 October attacks, including 2,700 since the Israeli offensive resumed, according to the territory's health ministry.",
      "In previous years, other countries have been banned from the contest. Belarus was suspended in 2021 after submitting an overtly political entry and a year later Russia was barred over the war in Ukraine.",
      "Ms Raphael said she was trying not to deal with those who say her country shouldn't be competing. \"Everybody has opinions,\" she said. \"I'm really putting everything aside and just concentrating on the most important thing. The slogan this year is 'united by music' and that's what we are here for.\"",
      "Eurovision said it understood the concerns and views about the current situation in the Middle East, but insisted members should ensure Eurovision remained a \"universal event that promotes connections, diversity and inclusion through music\".",
      "Nevertheless, Israeli fans have been warned by their country's National Security Council not to wear Jewish or Israeli symbols while attending Eurovision.",
      "On Sunday, during the Eurovision opening parade in the Swiss host city of Basel, the Israeli broadcasting delegation made a complaint to the police and the EBU after accusing a pro-Palestinian demonstrator of making a throat-slitting gesture and spitting at the delegation.",

      "She said they had done a few rehearsals with sounds in the background so she could practise with distractions. Asked if that was upsetting, she told the BBC she had a lot of emotions she was putting aside to stay focused.",

      "\"It's definitely in the single digits,\" says singer Holly-Anne Hull, trying to calculate how many nights she has spent at home. \"We don't have time for that.\"",

      "They formed at school over a decade ago, and determinedly stayed together during long periods where, in their words, \"no-one was listening\".",
      "Even after a successful turn on The Voice in 2019, Charlotte had to return to her job as a deputy head teacher, while Lauren and Holly-Anne appeared in West End shows like Phantom of the Opera and Six: The Musical.",
      "Eurovision offers chance to change that. They head to Basel, Switzerland this week, hoping to erase the memories of Olly Alexander and Mae Muller, who both finished at the bottom end of the table.",
      "It helps that Remember Monday's song is a certified banger - full of glittery glam-pop flourishes and sizzling harmonies that (crucially) they can pull off live.",
      "Just before they set off for Euroland, we sat down with the trio to discuss quitting their jobs, overcoming phobias, and the dreaded \"nul points\".",
      "It's eight weeks since you were announced as the UK's Eurovision entry\u2026",
      "Charlotte: No, it can't be. It feels like six years!",
      "How many air miles have you racked up in that time?",
      "Lauren: Honestly, I feel bad about our carbon footprint.",
      "Charlotte: The thing is, I'm a nervous flyer. I always put an eye mask on, put my headphones in and avoid looking out the window. Then we had to catch a propellor plane from Reykjavik in Iceland, and as it was taking off, the whole thing was shaking from side to side.",
      "Lauren: It was really treacherous\u2026 but then, the next Easyjet flight we had to catch, Charlotte was like, 'What a breeze'.",
      "Charlotte: I was smiling, talking. It's like I was cured!",
      "When I first heard What The Hell Just Happened, I thought it sounded like something from Six: The Musical\u2026 Then I discovered you'd actually been in it.",
      "Lauren: That was me! I was Jane Seymour. She's the one that died, instead of being beheaded.",
      "Was it always the plan to put a musical theatre vibe in the song?",
      "Lauren: We wrote a brief for the song and there were so many references: Bohemian Rhapsody, Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter.",
      "But we also said 'let's not be afraid to write the pop version of Defying Gravity'. We wanted it to have all that epicness and drama and the West End tricks you don't get in pop music.",

      "Charlotte: It's so true, and funnily enough, What The Hell Just Happened was the last song we wrote, a day before the deadline. We'd got to the point where we were like 'let's just go 100% on every idea and see where it lands'.",
      "Holly-Anne: We thought we had the Eurovision Song, I would say, four or five times. Then this one came up and we were like 'OK, it's beaten all of them'.",

      "Holly-Anne: We come from theatre background, so it's definitely going to be theatrical. We want to give that a girl-band, concert feeling, like you're stepping into the world of Remember Monday.",
      "There's a line in the song about ripping your dress. Is that a sneaky Bucks Fizz reference?",
      "Lauren: Oh my God! Let's say yes. We didn't write it specifically with that in mind... but if the shoe fits!",
      "Charlotte: There's loads of little Easter eggs in the lyrics about our friendship. We've had a lot of nights out that ended in a tattoo parlour or losing a shoe somehow.",

      "Lauren: Then, maybe 18 months ago, we quit our jobs to do this full-time.",
      "Charlotte: We thought, if we don't throw everything in now, we'll always regret it.",
      "Were your resignation letters like, 'I'm off to be a star!'?",
      "Lauren: Well, Holly and I were in the theatre, so we just didn't renew our contracts, whereas Charlotte was actually a deputy head teacher.",
      "Charlotte: The head was one of my closest friends and a lot of the kids had already seen us at gigs \u2013 so everyone knew it was gonna happen. It was just a matter of time.",
      "Are you prepared for how overwhelming Eurovision week is?",
      "Lauren: Yeah, but we're quite good at immersing ourselves in what we're doing.",
      "Charlotte: Even if there wasn't a bubble around us, the three of us make a bubble. Eurovision is all we talk about, even if we're not together.",
      "Lauren: And then I'm sure from the 18th of May onwards, we'll have a fair amount of downtime.",
      "Holly-Anne: The comedown is going to be rough.",
      "What are your hopes for the result?",
      "Holly-Anne: We do have a preference. And I think the closer we get to it, the more hungry we are for a good result. A placement in the single digits would be nice.",
      "You have loads of festival performances booked for the summer \u2013 so life won't   grind to a halt afterwards.",
      "Lauren: That's so true. And actually, every experience that we're having in the lead-up to May 17, that's Eurovision as well.",
      "Charlotte: All the places we've been to and the people we've met \u2013 it literally feels like a girls' holiday.",
      "Holly-Anne: Even if we get zero points, we'll still be singing together, even if it's in my living room.",
      "What's the one memory you'll take away from this?",
      "Lauren: I will always, always remember the feeling of finding out we'd represent the UK. We've been around for a long time, and we've had a lot of 'noes' as a band, so when we auditioned, we assumed this would be another one. 'Thank you so much, but we're going in another direction'.",

      "The 2025 Eurovision Song Contest pops its cork on Sunday, with a \"turquoise carpet\" parade featuring competitors from all 37 nations.",
      "But the competition really begins on Tuesday, when the first semi-final will see five countries unceremoniously kicked out.",
      "Another six will lose their place at the second semi-final on Thursday, before the Grand Final takes place in Basel, Switzerland, on Saturday, 17 May.",
      "This year's entrants include two returning contestants, one professional opera singer, a thinly veiled allusion to sexual emissions and a dance anthem about a dead space dog.",
      "It's a lot to take in.",
      "To help you prepare, here's a guide to all 37 songs in the contest, which I've sorted into rough musical categories, mainly for my own sanity (it didn't work).",
      "Left-field pop bangers",
      "Win or lose, UK contestants Remember Monday have given headline writers a gift with the title of their entry: What The Hell Just Happened?",
      "A souped-up, full throttle pop anthem, it cherry-picks the best bits of Queen, Andrew Lloyd Webber and the Beatles, presumably to remind voters of Britain's rich musical heritage.",
      "With eight tempo changes, it could prove tricky for voters to grasp, but the band's stellar harmonies and sparkling personalities should carry them through.",
      "Crucially, the song avoids the Eurovision cliches of jackhammer dance anthems and windswept balladry \u2013 something Remember Monday have in common with this year's favourites.",
      "Sweating it out at the top are Swedish representatives KAJ, whose song Bara Bada Bastu is an ode to the restorative powers of the sauna, complete with dancers in skimpy towels.",
      "Unreasonably catchy, it's won the approval of Abba's Bjorn Ulvaeus, whose been   singing the track in his own private sauna. As you do.",
      "Stiff competition comes from Austrian singer JJ, and his operatic ballad Wasted Love.",
      "A timeworn story of unrequited love, it leans on his training as a counter-tenor, before exploding into an unexpected techno breakdown.",
      "A favourite with the bookies, the song's only Achilles heel is its similarity to last year's winner, Nemo.",
      "Distinctive in a different way is Ireland's entry, Laika Party \u2013 a 90s trance-pop anthem about a dog who was sent to space by Russia and left to die there.",
      "Singer Emmy aims for a hopeful spin on a tragic story but, despite a peppy performance, it's a bit of a downer.",
      "More palatable is Luxembourg's Laura Thorn, whose La Poup\u00e9e Monte Le Son is a callback to France Gall's 1965 winning entry, Poup\u00e9e De Cire, Poup\u00e9e De Son.",
      "Where the original was about a \"fashion doll\" operated by songwriter Serge Gainsbourg, Thorn's response is all about taking control.",
      "\"If you think a man like you can manipulate me, go back to your mum,\" she scolds. Yeouch.",
      "Other countries sucking up to Italy",
      "Rome must be blushing. This year features not one, but two, songs about the vibrant culture of Il Bel Paese.",
      "The first comes, not surprisingly, from San Marino \u2013 the independent microstate that nestles inside north-central Italy.",
      "Titled Tutta L'Italia, it celebrates everything from the county's football team and its vineyards, to the Mona Lisa (under her Italian name Gioconda).",
      "Written by Gabry Ponte \u2013 one of the brains behind Eiffel 65's Blue (Da Ba Dee) \u2013 it's a slight, but fun, mixture of dance beats, traditional accordion playing and the folk dances of Calabria.",
      "The staging could be its downfall, though, with Gabry marooned behind his DJ decks while the singers, who for some reason wish to remain anonymous, obscure their faces with masks.",
      "More memorable, but definitely more unhinged, is Estonia's Espresso Macchiato.",
      "Performed by Tommy Cash (the only Eurovision contestant to have appeared on a Charli XCX record) it's an affectionate-ish caricature of Italian stereotypes, featuring the indelible lyric: \"Life is like spaghetti, it's hard until you make it\".",
      "Smut!",
      "I'm trying to give up sexual innuendo, but Eurovision is making it har... difficult.",
      "A trio of artists are trying to sneak smut past the censors, led by Malta's Miriana Conte, with a throbbing club track called Serving.",
      "In its original form, the song's chorus revolved around the phrase \"serving kant\" \u2013 the word kant being Maltese for \"singing\" and a homophone for an English term that definitely doesn't mean singing.",
      "It's a reference to a well-known phrase in the drag / ballroom world; but several countries complained it broke broadcasting guidelines, prompting a hasty re-write.",
      "If the stunt was meant to generate headlines it worked, but now that Miriana has our attention, she's not letting go.",
      "Her performance, featuring a giant disco ball pursed between two red lips, is gloriously OTT, and she has an enviable set of pipes. Too bad the song is riddled with Europop cliche.",
      "Another contestant doubling his entendres is Australia's Go-Jo, who wants us to \"take a sip\" of milkshake from his \"special cup\". Interpret that how you want but I'd be wary of hitching a lift in his ice cream van, if I were you.",
      "With a smattering of Electric Six's saucy disco funk, Milkshake Man is tasty enough to get Australia back in the finals after only achieving a semi last year.",
      "Finally, we have Finland's Erika Vikman, whose song Ich Komme is billed as a \"joyous message of pleasure, ecstasy and a state of trance\".",
      "Structured to mimic the pneumatic realities of lovemaking, it recalls iconic gay anthems such as Kylie's Your Disco Needs You and Donna Summer's Hot Stuff \u2013 and ends with Erika shooting into the sky astride a massive gold microphone that's definitely not a stand-in for a phallus.",
      "Three songs inspired by cancer",
      "Little in life is more devastating than the phrase \"I'm afraid it's cancer\".",
      "The disease will affect one in two of us and, although survival rates have dramatically improved, the impact can be devastating.",
      "This year, three separate Eurovision contestants have been touched by cancer, inspiring songs of unmatched heartbreak and reflection.",
      "French singer Louane captures it best. Her song Maman, is an intimate conversation with her mother, who died when she was just 17 years old.",
      "Over three verses, Louane describes the \"emptiness\" she was felt; and how she filled the void with bad behaviour and meaningless love affairs. But, as the song progresses, she tells her mum she's settled down and found purpose... by becoming a mother herself.",
      "She sings it beautifully, with a mixture of regret and strength. And when her daughter's voice appears in the final moments of the song, it would take a steely heart not to shed a tear.",
      "Over in Norway, 19-year-old Kyle Alessandro shared a similar story, when his mother was diagnosed with cancer in autumn 2023. Thankfully, she's now in remission, but something she said during her treatment inspired his Eurovision entry: \"Never lose your light.\"",
      "Kyle took that phrase and turned it into a thumping pop song about surviving adversity. \"Nothing can burn me now,\" he sings. \"I'm my own Lighter.\"",
      "Klemen Slakonja, meanwhile, is a comedian best known in Slovenia for his impressions of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin -  but his ballad, How Much Time Do We Have Left was written after his wife, actress Mojca Fatur, was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer.",
      "As he sings, Klemen's dancers raise him into the air and hold him upside down, to represent the disorientation the family felt.",
      "\"When she read her diagnosis, our world turned upside down and I felt that rush of blood in my head, the same one I feel whenever I am upside down in the performance,\" he told Eurovision World.",
      "Defying the odds, Mojca survived, and joins him on stage at Eurovision. It's a deeply intimate and moving moment.",
      "The bops",
      "Listening to this year's line-up, it's like the contestants all heard Cascada's Evacuate the Dancefloor and went, \"Nah, we're good, thanks\".",
      "There are club bangers everywhere, with Belgium's Red Sebastian (named after the crab in The Little Mermaid, bless him) submitting an entire song about the loved-up liberation of an all-night rave.",
      "\"Where no words are needed to feel the connection / Where clocks never tick and where love is the ending.\"",
      "A favourite with fans, the 90s rave elements of Strobe Lights feel a little dated to me, but his meticulously-choreographed performance is a treat.",
      "Denmark's Sissal takes a similar sound, with a throwback Euro-bop called Hallucination that effortlessly evokes two-time Eurovision winner Loreen.",
      "Sissal said her biggest goal was for the audience to feel they couldn't sit down during the song. Mission accomplished.",
      "Germany, meanwhile, are pitching for a home run with Baller, a super-catchy trance anthem that wouldn't sound out of place at Berlin superclub Berghain.",
      "Performed by Austrian siblings Abor & Tynna, it's languishing in the middle of the field, after Tynna developed laryngitis, robbing the duo of the chance to impress fans at Eurovision's various pre-parties. But now that she's recovered, the song could rise up the rankings.",
      "That's less likely for V\u00e6b, aka the Icelandic Jedward. Their energetic dance-rap song, R\u00f3a, is all about rowing from Iceland to the Faroe Islands, \"because no matter what happens in life you just keep on rowing through the waves\".",
      "Sadly, it's not as deep as it sounds.",
      "Spanish star Melody fares better with Esa Diva, a pumping house track with a sprinkling of flamenco guitar, that documents her journey to fame.",
      "And Azerbaijan's Mamagama go all Maroon 5 on Run With U, a smooth pop song elevated by a twinkling riff on the saz \u2013 a long-necked plucked instrument similar to the lute.",
      "Post-immigrant pop",
      "OK, so I've stolen that description from Shkodra Elektronike.",
      "They're an Albanian duo living in Italy, who fuse the ethnic music of their hometown, Shkod\u00ebr, to a progressive electronic sound.",
      "Their song Zjerm (Fire) imagines a time when cross-cultural understanding would lead to peace and harmony \u2013 a world without a need for soldiers and ambulances, and where \"oil would smell like lilac\" (no, me neither).",
      "Greece's entry, Asterom\u00e1ta, is also rooted in history and memory, as Klavdia describes the unbreakable bond that refugees share with their homeland.",
      "\"Even if they cross the seas / They shall never forget the sacred earth they called home,\" she sings, in a haunting ballad that blends traditional Greek and Pontic elements with soaring strings.",
      "Taking a more upbeat approach is Dutch singer Claude. A refugee from the bloody civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, he moved to the Netherlands at the age of nine and fell in love with Eurovision while waiting in the refugee centre.",
      "His song, C'est La Vie, is a tribute to his mum, who taught him to see the positive in their situation.",
      "Fizzing with freedom and joy, it combines elements of chanson and French-Caribbean zouk, and looks set for a top 10 placing.",
      "Witchcraft, sorcery and moody goth boys",
      "The success of \"goth gremlin witch\" Bambie Thug at last year's Eurovision has conjured a veritable coven of imitators in 2025.",
      "Polish singer Justyna Steczkowska, representing her country for the second time, even includes a Slavic magic spell in her song, Gaja \u2013 summoning the spirit of the mother Earth to \"cleanse\" her of a toxic relationship.",
      "It's a suitably intense performance, with Justyna singing long sustained notes and playing a furious violin solo, before being hoiked into the rafters on a pair ropes.",
      "What a time to be alive.",
      "Marko Bo\u0161njak, meanwhile, is cooking up a Poison Cake to feed to his tormentors - chiefly the people who bombarded him with homophobic hate messages after he was selected to represent Croatia.",
      "The criticism was so intense that he lost his voice and couldn't leave the house for five days.",
      "His song is suitably melodramatic, replete with guttural synths and creepy playground chants. It's a little overbaked, but should still sail through to the finals.",
      "Taking a more ethereal approach are Latvian group Tautumeitas, whose song Bur Man Laimi translates as \"a chant for happiness\".",
      "Reminiscent of Bjork and Enya, its overlapping folk harmonies are based on traditional Latvian wedding songs, making it one of this year's most captivating entries. I fear it may be too subtle to score well, though.",
      "Further mystery is provided by, Theo Evan, Cyprus's answer to Nick Jonas. The lyrics to his song, Shh, are a riddle, written by former tennis player Elke Tiel, whose \"hidden truth will only be revealed on the Eurovision stage in May\".",
      "He opens his performance perched between two pieces of scaffolding in a recreation of Leonardo da Vinci's famous Vitruvian Man sketch \u2013 so there's a clue.",
      "Shh is one of a number of gothic pop songs, sung by brooding young men with interesting hair.",
      "Among the best is Kiss Kiss Goodbye, by Czechia's Adonxs, who divebombs from an angelic falsetto to an unsettling baritone as he confronts his absent father.",
      "Lithuanian band Katarsis are an interesting experiment, with a deliberately downbeat rock song that declares \"the foundations of everything have begun to rot\".",
      "Titled Tavo Akys (your eyes), it builds to a compelling climax, but it's hard to see it being a vote-winner, unless Eurovision suddenly attracts an audience of depressed emo teens.",
      "Rounding out the field are Armenian singer Parg, with the Imagine Dragons-inspired Survivor and Serbia's Princ, whose overwrought ballad is called Mila.",
      "Both performers give it their all, but the songs don't feel strong enough to survive the semi-finals.",
      "70s rock throwbacks",
      "Four years after M\u00e5neskin's victory, Eurovision's rock revival continues apace.",
      "Italy are back at it again, thanks to Lucio Corsi \u2013 think David Bowie as Pierrot \u2013 and his glam rock ballad Volevo Essere Un Duro (I wanted to be tough).",
      "A delicate anthem for people who feel they don't fit in, it recalls how Lucio was bullied as a kid, and how he's  grown to embrace his fragility. At one point, he sings: \"Instead of a star, [I'm] just a sneeze.\"",
      "It's a timeless bit of songwriting that pulls off that crucial Eurovision trick of sounding new and familiar all at once.",
      "Portuguese indie band Napa also have a 70s vibe, channelling Paul McCartney's Wings on the soft rock tear-jerker Deslocado (out of place).",
      "It's another song about migration, written after the band were forced to relocate from Madeira to the Portuguese mainland due to the economic crisis.",
      "\"Even though we've been here for a few years we always have that desire to go back, and that anguish of saying goodbye to family,\" said singer Guilherme Gomes.",
      "Last but not least are Ukraine's Ziferblat, who continue the country's astonishing run of high-quality entries in the midst of a war with Russia.",
      "Their song, Bird Of Pray, is an unexpected mix of 70s new wave band Cars, birdsong and the guitar riff from Rachel Stevens' Sweet Dreams My LA Ex \u2013 while the lyrics are full of hope for a peaceful reunion with their loved ones.",
      "It's better than that makes it sound.",
      "The ballads",
      "Where would Eurovision be without a raven-haired woman bellowing into a wind machine set to \"hurricane\"?",
      "Israel has strong form in this category, and sets the bar again with New Day Will Rise, a melancholy piano ballad sung in a mixture of English, French and Hebrew.",
      "The song's performed by Yuval Raphael, a 24-year-old who narrowly escaped with her life at the 2023 Nova music festival, where an attack by Hamas claimed the lives of 378 people and triggered Israel's ongoing offensive in Gaza.",
      "It's hard not to interpret her lyrics as a response to those events \u2013 \"everyone cries, don't cry alone\". As a result, her participation hasn't received the same level of criticism as Eden Golan, who represented Israel last year.",
      "That can't be said for Georgia's contestant, Mariam Shengelia, who has been booed during pre-Eurovision appearances for her alleged support of the country's authoritarian, pro-Russian, anti-LGBT ruling party, Georgian Dream.",
      "Shengelia has denied the accusations, pointing out that her song \u2013 a stirring, quasi-militaristic ballad called Freedom \u2013 is about \"freedom of choice, freedom to love, freedom to live as you want to live\".",
      "\"No amount of manufactured hate will change that,\" she told the Eurovision fan site Wiwibloggs.",
      "Montenegro's Nina \u017di\u017ei\u0107 tackles domestic abuse in Dobrodo\u0161li, a brooding and refined orchestral ballad.",
      "The singer, who previously entered Eurovision in 2013 with the cyborg pop oddity Igranka, delivers her lyrics with passion and sincerity, but somehow the song never quite takes off.",
      "Last but not least, we have defending champions Switzerland, represented by 24-year-old Zo\u00eb M\u00eb, who describes herself as a \"little fairy\".",
      "Appropriately enough, her self-penned song, Voyage is delicate as a fairy's wings,   fluttering with a soft-spoken plea to treat each other with kindness.",
      "Automatically qualifying for the final, it's a welcome oasis of calm amidst the steamy sauna sessions, moody goth haircuts and thrusting innuendo.",

    "story": [
      "The Eurovision Song Contest was watched by around 163 million people last year \u2013 meaning there are potentially 163 million different opinions on what makes a perfect entrant.",
      "Do you go for a soulful ballad, guaranteed to leave Europe misty-eyed and full of love and peace?",
      "Or do you opt for a cheesy extravaganza, complete with saucy takes on regional costumes and eye-popping staging that will have the entire continent (and Australia) raving in their living rooms?",
      "The perfect song",
      "Forensic musicologist at Boston's Berklee College of Music Joe Bennett has analysed hundreds of Eurovision finalists, identifying two dominant musical styles.",
      "One is the \"Euro-banger\" - high-energy, 120+ BPM songs with kick drums and synth-heavy production, like Sweden's winning entries Euphoria (Loreen, 2012) and Heroes (M\u00e5ns Zelmerl\u00f6w, 2015).",
      "The other is the slow-burning ballad - typically around 70 BPM, such as Portugal's Amar Pelos Dois (Salvador Sobral, 2017) and the Netherlands' Arcade (Duncan Laurence, 2019).",
      "There is a clich\u00e9 that Eurovision songs are only about love and peace \u2013 reinforced by a song performed during the 2016 contest's interval about writing a perfect Eurovision song, called Love Love Peace Peace.",
      "According to Bennett, there is some validity to this, with every Eurovision song falling under six broad lyrical themes: \"love, unity, self-assertion, partying, history and songs about making music\".",
      "He adds that \"songs of self-assertion or lyrical self-empowerment do very well\" - as seen with Austria's 2014 winner Rise Like a Phoenix (Conchita Wurst).",
      "Keep staging simple and effective",
      "Acts might be tempted to go over the top on staging, but this may not be the way to secure victory, according to our experts.",
      "Songwriter Thomas Stengaard co-wrote Denmark's 2013 winner Only Teardrops (as well as this year's UK entry What the Hell Just Happened by Remember Monday). He puts his success down, in part, to its simple staging, which he says made it easy to remember.",
      "\"If you asked a kid to draw that staging, they could. It was a girl with no shoes on, two guys playing the drums and a flute guy. Very simple, but it worked.\"",
      "Vocal coach Carrie Grant, who led the UK's jury in 2014 and came sixth in the contest as part of Sweet Dreams in 1983, agrees.",
      "\"There is nothing worse than having an artist whose stage has lots of money but their performance doesn't warrant it,\" she says. \"It makes that performance seem worse.\"",
      "The 2014 winner (and Carrie's personal favourite) was Conchita Wurst \u2013 the first act to win the contest without backing singers or dancers on stage since 1970.",
      "What made Conchita stand out was that she was a bearded drag queen. Carrie believes Eurovision fans love things that are quirky and that \"embrace the LGBT community\".",
      "But she adds that Conchita wasn't a gimmick but instead \"a brilliant singer who could deliver what we call in vocal coaching 'money moments'\".",
      "The key is key",
      "Minor-key songs increasingly dominate Eurovision.",
      "Bennett debunks the idea that \"major equals happy, minor equals sad\", adding that \"minor keys are more a shorthand for emotional depth\".",
      "In 2023, 85% of finalists performed in minor keys, according to the Press Association. In the last 20 years, only two major-key songs have won - 2011's Running Scared (for Azerbaijan) and 2017's Amar Pelos Dois.",
      "Professor Elizabeth Hellmuth Margulis, a researcher in music cognition at Princeton, highlights source sensitivity \u2013 our instinct to associate a song's sound with its intended context. A few bars of a techno song, for example, and we have a mental image of a dark nightclub, and of the sort of DJ who might perform there.",
      "This means certain minor keys now immediately signal \"Eurovision-ness\" to audiences.",
      "Remember Monday's What the Hell Just Happened was written at a songwriting camp, with multiple songwriters working together at a countryside retreat to write the perfect song for this year's UK act.",
      "The song was intentionally written in a major key to stand out in a sea of minor-key songs - similar to the UK's 2022 second-place entry, Spaceman by Sam Ryder (B Major).",
      "Witchcraft, innuendo and moody goth boys: Your guide to all 37 of this year\u2019s Eurovision songs",
      "Witchcraft, innuendo and moody goth boys: Your guide to all 37 of this year\u2019s Eurovision songs",
      "Have a surprise up your sleeve",
      "Repetition is important to make a song stick in the mind, says Margulis. But songs should avoid being too repetitive. Margulis says that what particularly makes a song catchy is \"not only when they are heard repeatedly, but also when they throw in some kind of surprise twist\".",
      "Bucks Fizz's 1981 winner for the UK, Making Your Mind Up, is a classic example. First, the song changes key, quickly followed by a memorable costume change in which the female singers' skirts were ripped off to reveal shorter skirts \u2013 a joint visual and musical twist.",
      "Earlier Eurovision winners were often mocked for their nonsense lyrics, like Sweden's 1984 winner Diggi-Loo Diggi-Ley, but Bennett argues this highlights Eurovision's strong focus on melody.",
      "\"Eurovision really needs big melodic hooks. You want people across Europe to be singing that melody. The need for a very accessible, catchy chorus is essential.\"",
      "Key changes have long been a way to introduce novelty into Eurovision songs. The 2000s saw multiple winners follow this formula, including Olsen Brothers' Fly on the Wings of Love for Norway (2000), and Serbia's Molitva in 2007.",
      "But as Bennett points out, though they are still present in around a fifth of finalists, no song with a final chorus key change has won since Molitva almost 20 years ago.",
      "Stengaard's song for this year's UK act Remember Monday is certainly full of surprises. BBC music correspondent Mark Savage said the song featured \"a dizzying array of key changes and tempo shifts\".",
      "The song is the songwriter's answer to the question he asks himself whenever he writes for Eurovision: \"How do you stand out in a contest where everyone wants to stand out?\"",

    "summary": "The city at the crossroads of France, Germany and Switzerland gears up amid global tensions over diversity and inclusion.",
    "story": [
      "The Swiss city of Basel is going into party mode this weekend, as it prepares to welcome the Eurovision Song Contest.",
      "It's been 36 years since Switzerland last hosted the contest, after Celine Dion won in 1988, so the wait to roll out Eurovision's famous turquoise carpet has been long.",
      "Switzerland hosted the first ever Eurovision at Lugano in 1956, but its record since Dion's victory in Dublin has been mixed.",
      "Between 2007 and 2010, and again between 2015 and 2018, its entries failed to even qualify for the final. Swiss singer Nemo finally won last year with The Code.",
      "Perhaps because of that, Basel is determined to make this contest memorable for all the right reasons. At 1.3km (0.8 miles), its turquoise carpet will be Eurovision's longest ever, stretching from Basel town hall, across the river Rhine all the way to the Eurovision village.",
      "The head of Basel's government, Conradin Cramer, believes his city of just 175,000 residents is the natural home for Eurovision's estimated half a million visitors.",
      "Because of its borders with both France and Germany, Basel is \"the heart of Europe\", he says. What's more, he points out, the city has a long humanist tradition; when other cities in medieval Europe were cracking down on free thinkers, Basel welcomed them.",
      "So Basel, with its geographic location and its history of tolerance, and Eurovision with its tradition of inclusivity and diversity are, he says \"the perfect match\".",
      "How to win Eurovision, according to the experts",
      "Witchcraft, innuendo and moody goth boys: Your guide to all 37 Eurovision songs",
      "Ireland asks Eurovision organisers for discussion over Israel",
      "Last year's contest in Malmo attracted thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators and further protests against the war in Gaza are expected in Basel too.",
      "Police have not yet released their plans to manage this, but have said that everyone should have the right to express their opinion, as long they stay within the law, and do not risk the safety of others.",
      "Throughout the contest they say 1,300 officers will be on duty. Basel has also unveiled a security operation to ensure visitors can enjoy the song contest safely. They are promising \"mobile awareness teams\", safe retreats for victims of violence or hostility and a 24-hour hotline. The concept, which Basel officials describe as unique, aims to prevent violence, sexual assault or harassment, and racist aggression and insults.",
      "The awareness teams, recognisable by their pink jackets, will be available 24 hours a day across the city. Basel's security director Stephanie Eymann said the teams were a \"low-threshold\" measure to give visitors a chance to report harassment or assaults, and seek protection, even if some might not want to approach the police.",
      "The entire town appears to have embraced the event, with turquoise welcome flags now waving from every lamp post. Tickets for the contest itself sold out in minutes, but Basel is promising that there will be \"something for everyone\", ticket or no ticket, and most of it will be free.",
      "\"There will be concerts all over the city, there will be art projects,\" says tourism director Letizia Elia. Basel has 40 museums and galleries in a space of just 37 square kilometres, a record for a European city, and they are all getting involved.",
      "An exhibition featuring works by Andy Warhol, Mark Rothko, Wassily Kandinsky, and Pablo Picasso has opened at the Beyeler Foundation, where Swiss artist Ugo Rondinone's We are Poems rainbow sculpture sits on the roof. There's also a Glitz and Glam exhibition at Basel's museum of natural history.",
      "The celebrations have spread across Switzerland, with competitions across the country for the best school band \u2013 the top four will get a spot on stage in Basel.",
      "But hosting an event like Eurovision is never hitch-free, and this one is no exception. The final choice of Basel as a venue was only made at the end of August last year, allowing just over seven months to organise everything.",
      "Then came objections from evangelical Christian groups, who claimed Eurovision undermined traditional family values and that performers regularly sang about satanism and the occult. They gathered enough signatures to force a referendum aimed at banning public money for the event.",
      "But on 24 November voters gave a huge yes to the song contest; with 66.6% approving Basel's budget of almost $40m. Conradin Cramer had expected a referendum, because \"that's how Switzerland works, it's perfectly fine.\" But he was still delighted at the size of the vote in favour: \"It shows this is a city where people really want to do this.\"",
      "He is very conscious that the global debate around diversity and inclusion has changed in the year since Swiss singer Nemo became the first non-binary person to win Eurovision.",
      "The overriding message of Basel, Mr Cramer says, is \"everyone is welcome\".",
      "On-stage and in the dressing rooms though, things are stricter. EBU, which runs the contest itself, has stuck to its rules saying performers can only bring their own national flags onstage or into the green rooms. This means that they will not be able to fly the Pride flag or that of any other gender identity or sexuality.",
      "Fans, however, will be able to bring whatever flags they like into the arena.",
      "Last year Swiss winner Nemo did wave a non-binary flag during the performance, but said they had to 'smuggle' the flag in. This year LGBTQ+ groups say they are disappointed the EBU has not relaxed the rules.",
      "\"Banning our symbols is a slap in the face for the LGBTIQ community', said Swiss group Pink Cross. \"It sends the wrong message at a time when queer communities across Europe are facing increasing hostility.\"",
      "EBU has said that the guidelines were designed to create clarity and balance explaining: \"Eurovision needs no flag to demonstrate its alliance and celebration of the LGBTQ+ community.\"",
      "Across the Atlantic, Donald Trump's administration is actively removing government support for diversity and inclusion measures, and he is asking partnered European institutions (including some Swiss universities) to do the same.",
      "That's why Basel, says Mr Cramer, should take a stand, even if the EBU will not.",
      "\"These are our European values. People and nations are coming together in a friendly championship. Whoever you are, if you are young, if you are not that young, if you are straight, if you are gay, if you are female, male, or if you are non-binary, this is all perfectly fine. And I think this is not just what Basel stands for, this is what Europe should stand for.\"",
      "So if everyone is welcome, how do they get there? The host country being Switzerland, punctual transport is catered for. Swiss railways is laying on hundreds of extra trains. In Basel, the trams will run 24 hours a day.",
      "And, for those who are really in Eurovision mode, there is even a karaoke tram, where passengers can take a free 90-minute journey right across town, all the while singing their hearts out."

    "summary": "Senior figures in the UK TV industry are contemplating how best to secure its future",
    "story": [
      "Just before Christmas, in a private dining room in the upmarket Charlotte Street Hotel in the heart of London's Fitzrovia area, the BBC's director general gathered some of the UK's leading TV creatives and executives for lunch. As they ate, surrounded by kaleidoscopic-patterned wallpaper and giant artworks, they were also chewing over the future survival of their own industry.",
      "As solutions were thrown around to what many see as an acute funding crisis in the age of global streaming, one of the invitees suggested, in passing, that BBC Studios (the corporation's commercial content-producing arm) could merge with Channel 4 to create a bigger, more powerful force to compete with the likes of Disney Plus, Netflix and Amazon.",
      "As another diner knocked down the idea, I'm told that Tim Davie, the BBC's DG, asked why it was so ridiculous.",
      "I relate that not because it has come to fruition. It hasn't. Nor even to suggest that the Director General supports the idea.",
      "Instead the story illustrates the belief, among some within the broadcasting industry, that nothing should be off the table when it comes to contemplating how to ensure the survival of British-originated and British-focused TV as we know it.",
      "Many of the people I spoke to for this piece didn't want to be quoted. But Sir Peter Bazalgette, the former Chairman of ITV, told me that what he termed the current \"generous spread\" of British broadcasters (BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5) will need some consolidation or, at the very least, more cooperation in future.",
      "\"We're in danger of having no public service broadcasting within a decade, certainly within 20 years,\" he says. \"We don't have a strategy for their survival. It's that serious. The regulators need to start thinking about it.",
      "\"Mergers may well be part of the answer. There should be fewer companies in the future.\"",
      "Lord Vaizey, who was Culture Minister under David Cameron, put it baldly. \"ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 should merge.",
      "\"The UK only has room for two domestic broadcasters.\"",
      "Others, however, argue that distinctiveness is good for viewers. Channel 5 President Sarah Rose told me she \"couldn't disagree with Ed Vaizey more\" \u2013 calling it a \"Doomsday prophecy\".",
      "Channel 5 is profitable, she tells me; it invests in smaller production companies and offers plurality for British audiences. By having just one commercial channel, \"You're taking the funnel from three to one types of content for British audiences.\"",
      "Channel 4 also rejects the suggestion of any merger. Its outgoing CEO Alex Mahon argues that, \"The unique structure of competition between our publicly funded and commercially funded broadcasters\" is what makes UK public service TV \"so excellent\".",
      "And yet the days of turning on your TV and finding an electronic programme guide listing channels \u2013 with BBC1 and BBC2 at the top, then ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 \u2013 are disappearing. The proposed date for the dawn of a new era is 2035; the end of traditional terrestrial TV as we know it.",
      "When the increasingly expensive contracts to provide broadcast channels and digital terrestrial services like Freeview come to an end, the UK's broadcasters are likely to pivot to offering digital-only video on demand. (However this won't happen without a campaign to ensure older people are protected, as well as rural and low-income households who may not have high quality internet access.)",
      "But if the aerials are turned off in 2035, is this the moment TV as we know it changes forever? If it becomes a battle between online-only British streamers and their better-funded US rivals, can the Brits survive? And, crucially, what will audiences be watching?",
      "How TV could look by 2035",
      "Flash forward to switching on the television in 2035 and there will of course have been certain technological transformations \u2013 perhaps more immersive viewing experiences or some shows viewed through augmented reality glasses. What's highly likely, though, is that the communal big screen will still be a staple, (albeit probably voice-activated by then).",
      "It's a shift that has already begun with YouTube viewers changing their viewing habits and moving to the bigger screen. In 2024, for the first time, TV sets were the most-used device for watching content on the video sharing site at home, according to recent data from Barb Audiences. In all, 41% of YouTube viewing was done on TV sets, ahead of 31% on smartphones.",
      "With YouTube an apparently unstoppable force, in ten years' time it could well become the go-to viewing for the majority.",
      "\"We are likely to continue to see a shift in the share of viewing time and advertising revenue towards globally-scaled players and user-generated content platforms like YouTube and TikTok,\" all within the next five years, according to Kate Scott-Dawkins, Global President for Business Intelligence at media investment company Group M.",
      "There'll also likely be Netflix, Disney, Apple, Amazon. In other words, the global players, based in the US, many of which also have other revenue streams (whether parks, computer hardware or a vast shopping platform).",
      "Kate Scott-Dawkins tells me the UK broadcasters are facing what could be an \"existential\" battle against US-based media companies with \"wildly different business models\".",
      "The shift to streaming TV has, she says, \"enabled large globally-scaled players to get even bigger and pour money into content that they can put in front of worldwide audiences\".",
      "The \"big players with big pockets\" already pay for a bespoke button on certain remote controls, or their own content tile front and centre on the homepage on smart TVs.",
      "Ms Scott-Dawkins believes that in the future it will be \"a position of strength\" to own the operating systems themselves, as well as the media that people are watching on them. Examples include Apple showing its films and television series on Apple TVs and iPhones, or Amazon showing its own productions via its Fire devices, or Google through its own computers and phones.",
      "Questions of revenue",
      "Part of the problem is that the UK terrestrial channels can't compete financially with the streamers. Netflix, for example, is valued at $472bn (\u00a3356bn).",
      "The BBC has lost 30% of its income \u2013 or \u00a31bn a year \u2013 in real terms since 2010, as the licence fee has become worth less. ITV's share price hasn't yet recovered since the advertising downturn in 2022, despite its vast production arm, ITV Studios, boosting its earnings before tax to \u00a3299m.",
      "Meanwhile, Channel 4's recorded a deficit of \u00a352m for 2023. Alex Mahon told Parliament last month, \"We will pretty much break even in the year\".",
      "Some TV insiders think the solution will be one gateway or app for all public service content: one place to find all shows from BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and 5.",
      "Alex Mahon recently told a newspaper that there needs to be \"more collaboration\" between the UK broadcasters \u2013 a way of \"making sure we're not duplicating the same technology\".",
      "ITV has spent hundreds of millions to create ITVX, its streaming platform for the Netflix-age. Channel 4 took a pioneering approach to its own digital transformation, launching 4oD back in 2006; the first broadcaster in the world to offer television content on-demand.",
      "But while its current \u00a31bn a year revenue enables it to compete as a significant content creator, this may not be enough to sustain a modern distribution platform with all the associated investment costs into the long term, according to some insiders.",
      "Lord Hall, the former BBC Director General, is among those arguing that it's not sustainable for individual broadcasters to continue going it alone. \"The notion that everyone has their own portals when you are competing against the huge streamers is not going to survive into the future,\" he says.",
      "'One big streamer under iPlayer'?",
      "Could the solution be for BBC iPlayer, which has been built with public money, to become the portal for the other British public service media content, too? It would be a single place where viewers could find ITV's The Chase, Channel 4's The Great British Bake Off and Channel 5 News, alongside BBC's The Traitors. This was one idea suggested to me by multiple TV insiders. \"One big streamer under iPlayer\", as one TV executive described it to me, \"a modern public service streaming service\".",
      "Part of their argument is that it's the fastest growing streaming service in the UK \u2013 and the only existing platform of plausible scale to compete.",
      "With political support and the right deal, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 could potentially get behind sharing tech (after all, the streaming service Freely, which launched last year, already hosts their content with the BBC's and others).",
      "But the idea of branding this all under the BBC iPlayer is \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 not something that commercial broadcasters would likely entertain, according to conversations I've had.",
      "Lord Hall believes, \"It could be branded differently... It would be a very good step.\"",
      "He says: \"The public would have to get used to the fact that BBC material would be free of advertising, and other parts of the platform would have adverts.\"",
      "If the idea of a shared streaming service sounds familiar, that's because it was proposed years ago. Project Kangaroo was a plan by BBC Worldwide, ITV and Channel 4 for a UK video-on-demand joint venture. Think an early rival to Netflix.",
      "But the UK's Competition Commission blocked the project in 2009 because of concerns it could harm competition in the emerging VoD market.",
      "Other regulators across Europe have also blocked mergers: In France, the TFI and M6 channels were prevented from merging. Two of the largest TV and radio broadcasters in the Netherlands, which would have combined eight national TV channels and four national radio stations, were also stopped for competition reasons.",
      "Any form of merger between different public service broadcasters would be subject to the same scrutiny. It's perhaps why Sir Peter Bazalgette is calling on UK politicians and regulators to focus on creating a strategy \u2013 or risk the end of British TV as we know it.",
      "Should the audiences care?",
      "The BBC remains the most watched of the traditional broadcasters. Today, people in the UK spend more time watching traditional broadcasters than they do streaming services. Figures show 87% of people age four and above watch the traditional broadcasters each month and they spend an average of 137 minutes a day doing so. By comparison, 78% of people watch a streaming service and they spend only 40 minutes a day doing so.",
      "If this does shift and the pattern reverses, TV producers and executives may be worried. But does it really matter to audiences?",
      "Netflix is already making the types of shows that may have previously been made by the likes of the BBC (Adolescence, Toxic Town and Baby Reindeer are all very British stories made by the streamer). So what is the problem? (Aside from the obvious point that you need a subscription to watch Netflix.)",
      "Ms Rose argues that the picture is \"much more complex\". Creatives involved in those shows often cut their teeth in public service TV, she says \u2013 one of benefits of the traditional broadcasters is, she believes, that it is a pipeline of talent.",
      "Sir Peter Bazalgette argues that they're needed more than ever in our AI age to serve as \"a gold standard of trusted news for our democracy, amid the online Tower of Babel.\"",
      "He also argues for programmes that reflect \"our shared values and national conversation\". Would a US-based streamer have chosen to make Mr Bates v the Post Office (ITV), for example, or 'Wolf Hall' (BBC) or 'It's A Sin' (Channel 4) \u2013 stories that are uniquely British and reflect who we are?",
      "Backing producers to take risks is, says Lord Hall, \"exactly what the BBC should be doing \u2013 but of course [it] has been doing less because the licence fee has been consistently cut\".",
      "Start of the 'martini streaming age'",
      "Ultimately, the American streamers are here to stay; they're spending billions and their UK operations are often led by British executives who are supportive of Britain's public service broadcasting scene.",
      "I have also picked up a sense from those inside Netflix that the company is often used as a battering ram to persuade the government that the UK's traditional broadcasters need more protections.",
      "Some have also been critical of the BBC for, as they see it, wanting everything on its own terms: \"'We want you to give us your money for co-productions, but the BBC will make all the creative decisions',\" is how one insider put it to me, unfairly or not.",
      "In 2018, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos was invited to the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London. Invitees recall that he talked warmly about how influential the BBC's iPlayer had been to the success of Netflix, describing how impressed he had been by a piece of kit that had got British viewers used to getting their video on demand.",
      "With more than 17 million Brits now subscribed to Netflix, there is a certain irony to that.",
      "Today, as the BBC's Director General Tim Davie starts to position the BBC ahead of the renewal of the corporation's charter after 2027, the TV landscape is changing fast. And the challenges are clear.",
      "Lord Hall tells me: \"Our lives will be enriched by having not only what the streamers can offer, but also what the public service broadcasters can bring. It's unthinkable not to build on what the BBC and others can deliver\".",
      "Sir Peter Bazalgette predicts that, \"Small doesn't cut it,\" adding that, \"The winners will have to be big enough to [both] afford high end dramas for winning subscribers and maintain large back catalogues to keep subscribers happy.\"",
      "He says we now live in \"the 'martini' streaming age - any time, any place, anywhere\".",
      "The question is whether the leaders of the public service broadcasters can forge the right plan to safeguard their industry in that age.",
      "The real problem facing Britain's shrinking military",
      "Gold is booming - but investors lured in by the hype could lose out, warn experts",

      "When the BBC Breakfast team won the news coverage award later in the evening, it was for a Post Office special.

      "Bafta Fellowship honouree Kirsty Wark, who left BBC Two's Newsnight programme in 2024 after 30 years, joked that she probably got her award \"for being 70, who knows?\"",
      "The long-running show was shortened by 15 minutes a year ago and its investigative films were cut. But Wark thinks it will survive.",
      "\"If Newsnight wasn't there, they'd have to reinvent it. I'd bet \u00a3500 that Newsnight is safe. You still need that programme at the end of the day to see what just happened.\"",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qz32wzeego",
    "published": "Tue, 13 May 2025 13:31:45 GMT",
    "summary": "The jury in the federal sex trafficking trial will be sworn in on Monday before opening statements are delivered.",
    "story": [
      "The trial of American music mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, who is accused of running a sprawling sex trafficking operation, has heard opening statements.",
      "The 55-year-old was arrested last September and faces charges including racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. He could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted.",
      "Mr Combs has pleaded not guilty and denied all allegations against him.",
      "Dozens of prospective jurors were screened before being whittled down to 12 - and six alternates.",
      "The first week of testimony will include two witnesses who are expected to speak briefly, prosecutors said, followed by a third witness who will see more time on the stand.",
      "Mr Combs also faces dozens of civil lawsuits from individuals who accuse him of using his power to drug, assault, rape, intimidate and silence people. He has said the individual lawsuits are attempts \"for a quick payday\".",
      "How can I follow the trial?",
      "The court is expected to be open to the public, but proceedings will not be televised or streamed online.",
      "Cameras, phones and electronic devices are normally not allowed in US federal courtrooms.",
      "The trial proceedings began in early May with jury selection at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan courthouse in lower Manhattan.",
      "US District Judge Arun Subramanian told jurors the trial could last around eight weeks.",
      "How were jurors selected?",
      "Dozens of potential jurors were vetted by the court.",
      "The process included potential jurors looking through a long list of places and people that could be mentioned during trial, with names like Kanye West and Kid Cudi.",
      "The \"People and Places\" list was so long that Judge Subramanian said he \"felt like I was reading an appendix for Lord of the Rings\".",
      "Potential jurors also had to fill out questionnaires that asked whether they had \"views about hip hop artists\" or \"feelings concerning violence, sexual assault\".",
      "The judge reminded the court several times of the importance of choosing a fair and impartial jury.",
      "Nearly all the potential jurors had read news reports of the allegations in the case and many had seen footage of Mr Combs kicking his former girlfriend Cassie Ventura in a hotel hallway.",
      "What are the charges and allegations against Diddy?",
      "In the federal criminal case being heard in New York, Mr Combs is charged with racketeering conspiracy, two charges of sex trafficking and two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution.",
      "Many of the most severe allegations relate to the racketeering conspiracy charge.",
      "This includes accusations of kidnapping, drugging, and coercing women into sexual activities, sometimes using firearms or threats of violence.",
      "In a raid on his Los Angeles mansion, police found supplies that they said were intended for use in orgies known as \u201cfreak offs\u201d, including drugs and more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil.",
      "Separately, Mr Combs faces a number of lawsuits accusing him of rape and assault.",
      "Tony Buzbee, a Texas lawyer handling some of these cases, said that more than 100 women and men from across the US had either filed lawsuits against the rap mogul or intended to do so.",
      "In December 2023, a woman known in court papers as Jane Doe alleged that she was \"gang raped\" by Mr Combs and others in 2003, when she was 17. She said she was given \"copious amounts of drugs and alcohol\" before the attack.",
      "Mr Combs' legal team dismissed the flurry of lawsuits as \"clear attempts to garner publicity.\"",
      "Mr Combs' current legal issues began in late 2023 when he was sued by Ms Ventura, also known as Cassie, for violent abuse and rape.",
      "That lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount a day after it was filed, with Mr Combs maintaining his innocence.",
      "Since then, dozens of other people have filed lawsuits accusing Mr Combs of sexual assault, with accusations dating back to 1991. He denies all the claims.",
      "His controversial history with Ms Ventura resurfaced in 2024, when CNN leaked CCTV footage from 2016 showing Mr Combs kicking his ex-girlfriend as she lay on a hotel hallway floor.",
      "He apologised for his behaviour, saying: \"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now.\"",
      "'He thought of himself as a king': The parties that led to Diddy's downfall'Studio sex' and 'hitman threats': Insiders speak out about Diddy's 90s music Diddy's violence left me broken, says Cassie",
      "'He thought of himself as a king': The parties that led to Diddy's downfall",
      "'Studio sex' and 'hitman threats': Insiders speak out about Diddy's 90s music",
      "Diddy's violence left me broken, says Cassie",
      "What has Diddy said about the charges against him?",
      "In a statement to the BBC about the federal criminal charges, Mr Combs' lawyer said: \"In court, the truth will prevail: that Mr Combs never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone - man or woman, adult or minor.\"",
      "Diddy's lawyers later filed a motion to dismiss one part of the federal indictment in which he is accused of transportation to engage in prostitution. His team argued he was being unfairly targeted due to his race.",
      "In a hearing in New York a week before the trial officially began, his attorneys told the court that the rapper led the \"lifestyle\" of a \"swinger\" and was not a criminal.",
      "They said he thought it was \"appropriate\" to have multiple sex partners, including sex workers.",
      "At the same hearing, prosecutors revealed that Mr Combs had rejected a plea deal.",
      "Mr Combs' lawyers have consistently denied the allegations made against him in the civil lawsuits, describing them as \"sickening\" and suggesting they were made by \"individuals looking for a quick payday\".",
      "How long could Diddy spend in jail if he is found guilty?",
      "If convicted on the racketeering charge, Mr Combs faces up to life in prison.",
      "He faces another statutory minimum sentence of 15 years if he is found guilty of sex trafficking.",
      "Transportation for purposes of prostitution carries a maximum sentence of 10 years.",
      "Mr Combs has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, since his arrest on 16 September 2024.",
      "Critics describe the prison as overcrowded and understaffed, with a culture of violence.",
      "His lawyers argued for his release, citing the jail\u2019s \u201chorrific\u201d conditions, but a New York federal judge denied the bail request, describing Mr Combs as a \u201cserious flight risk\u201d.",
      "Prosecutors previously alleged that Mr Combs had broken prison rules by contacting potential witnesses.",
      "They accused him of \"relentless efforts\" to \"corruptly influence witness testimony\".",
      "A judge granted Mr Combs permission to wear non-prison clothing during his trial rather than the jumpsuits he wears in jail.",
      "When he appeared in court for jury selection, the rapper wore a blue sweater and white shirt with glasses on his head.",
      "How did 'Sean 'Diddy' Combs become successful?",
      "Mr Combs - who has also gone by the names Puffy, Puff Daddy, P Diddy, Love, and Brother Love - emerged in the hip-hop scene in the 1990s.",
      "His early music career success included helping launch the careers of Mary J Blige and Christopher Wallace - aka Biggie Smalls, or The Notorious B.I.G.",
      "His music label Bad Boy Records became one of the most important labels in rap and expanded to include Faith Evans, Ma$e, 112, Mariah Carey and Jennifer Lopez.",
      "Mr Combs also had a prolific business career outside of music, including a deal with British drinks company Diageo to promote the French vodka brand C\u00eeroc.",
      "In 2023, he released his fifth record The Love Album: Off The Grid and earned his first solo nomination at the Grammy awards. He also was named a Global Icon at the MTV Awards.",

    "story": [
      "MPs are calling for a change in the law to prevent benefit claimants from suffering harm at the hands of the government department that is meant to help them.",
      "Several people have died in recent years after failures by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).",
      "A cross-party committee of MPs says new legislation and \"deep-rooted cultural change\" at the DWP are needed to protect vulnerable clients.",
      "A DWP spokesperson said the government was \"currently consulting on a new safeguarding approach\" which \"genuinely supports vulnerable people\".",
      "In recent years, the deaths of Errol Graham, Philippa Day and Kevin Gale have seen the DWP widely criticized for its handling of vulnerable clients.",
      "Mr Graham, who suffered from severe mental health problems, weighed just four-and-a-half stone when he died in 2018 after his benefits were wrongly stoppedIn 2019, a coroner found that Ms Day took her own life after her benefits were cut in error Kevin Gale died by suicide in 2022, having been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety, exacerbated by his universal credit application",
      "Mr Graham, who suffered from severe mental health problems, weighed just four-and-a-half stone when he died in 2018 after his benefits were wrongly stopped",
      "In 2019, a coroner found that Ms Day took her own life after her benefits were cut in error",
      "Kevin Gale died by suicide in 2022, having been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety, exacerbated by his universal credit application",
      "In Mr Gale's case, the coroner highlighted \"that current DWP procedures may not be practical for those with mental health illness and can exacerbate symptoms\".",
      "The inquest heard of the number and length of DWP forms that claimants were required to complete, the length of telephone queues for DWP advisers, and the requirement to travel long distances for appointments for people affected by mental health illness.",
      "Thursday's report, from the Work and Pensions Select Committee, reveals the deaths of at least 274 people have been investigated internally by the DWP in since April 2015.",
      "Such inquiries - Internal Process Reviews - are launched when there is an allegation that a case has been mishandled by the DWP which has potentially contributed to serious harm or a safeguarding concern.",
      "During the same period, 58 reviews were opened into cases where customers suffered harm - but the MPs said the scale of the failings was likely to be greater.",
      "\"That people continue to face harm after dealing with the DWP is a self-evident failure of safeguarding in the system,\" said committee chair Debbie Abrahams MP.",
      "\"Until recently, getting people back into work to cut costs had been prioritised over providing support and care for vulnerable people,\" Ms Abrahams added.",
      "\"We heard evidence that the process of engaging with the DWP... too often led to mental distress.",
      "\"Deep-rooted cultural change of the DWP is desperately needed to rebuild trust and put safeguarding at the heart of policy development.",
      "\"Introducing a statutory duty to safeguard vulnerable claimants for the department is a fundamental part of this.\"",
      "A new law, holding the secretary of state accountable for safeguarding clients, would ensure that everyone saw it as their responsibility to protect claimants, says the committee.",
      "'Nasty and traumatic'",
      "Carl, 44, a former roofer from Croydon, south London, said his first interaction with the DWP \"felt quite a nasty and traumatic experience\".",
      "He had struggled for 18 months with a degenerative back condition that had left him with mobility issues and constant pain, requiring strong painkillers.",
      "In 2018, after trying a variety of less manual roles, such as plastering and carpet fitting, he realised he could no longer hold down a job.",
      "He applied for universal credit, his first ever benefit application, which led to an appointment at his local job centre.",
      "Carl says the work coach was \"very dismissive and patronising\".",
      "\"He said: 'If you want money from us, you're going to have to jump through these hoops.'",
      "\"It almost felt like he was trying to imply that I was being dishonest and I was putting it on.",
      "\"It was a very uncaring response. I wanted support to get a non-manual job.\"",
      "'Absolutely life-changing'",
      "Shannon Johnstone, 28, who found herself sleeping rough about seven years ago before turning to the DWP for help, said the recommendations \"are going to be absolutely life-changing for people... if they're done right\".",
      "At the start of her claim, she remembers the DWP told her: \"We can't help with your homelessness,\" which she says was understandable but off-putting.",
      "She does not know if they referred her case to homeless organisations as she was never told. Now she welcomes the recommendation to include the views of people with lived experience in the design, planning and implementation of DWP policy.",
      "\"People who have gone through the system understand what it feels like to be interviewed by a [DWP] inspector,\" says Shannon who now works for the charity, Expert Link.",
      "\"They understand what it's like to gather lots of paperwork, so by including them in the design of the system, it's going to work so much better.\"",
      "In a statement, the DWP said the government was committed to protecting the people who use its services \"and fixing the broken welfare system we inherited so it works for those who need it\".",
      "\"That's why we are currently consulting on a new safeguarding approach and our reforms will improve people's lives and rebuild trust, by establishing an approach that genuinely supports vulnerable people.\"",
      "The spokesperson added that the government was encouraging people to have their voices heard in the consultation and help build a system \"that works better for all\"."

      "Family doctors in England are deeply divided on the issue of assisted dying, BBC research on plans to legalise the practice suggests.",
      "The findings give a unique insight into how strongly many GPs feel about the proposed new law - and highlight how personal beliefs and experiences are shaping doctors' views on the issue.",
      "BBC News sent more than 5,000 GPs a questionnaire asking whether they agreed with changing the law to allow assisted dying for certain terminally ill people in England and Wales.",
      "More than 1,000 GPs replied, with about 500 telling us they were against an assisted dying law and about 400 saying they were in favour.",
      "Some of the 500 GPs who told us they were against the law change called the bill \"appalling\", \"highly dangerous\", and \"cruel\". \"We are doctors, not murderers,\" one said.",
      "Of the 400 who said they supported assisted dying, some described the bill as \"long overdue\" and \"a basic human right\".",
      "\"We are keeping human bodies alive in the most inhumane manner,\" one said. They asked: \"How do we ethically justify forcing these bodies to continue to exist in decrepitude?\"",
      "We cannot know whether the GPs who responded to the BBC are representative of all family doctors.",
      "How could assisted dying laws change across the UK?",
      "What next for Scotland's assisted dying bill?",
      "California man invites BBC to witness his death as MPs debate assisted dying",
      "'I could live 30 years but plan to die': How assisted dying law is dividing Canadians",
      "It comes as MPs will this week again debate proposed changes to the controversial bill, with a vote in parliament expected on whether to pass or block it next month.",
      "If assisted dying does become legal in England and Wales, it would be a historic change for society.",
      "Current laws prevent medics from helping any patient to carry out their wish to die. The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill would allow any doctor to be involved in assisted dying, but GPs are often a large part of the practice in other countries. On Tuesday, a separate bill to legalise assisted dying in Scotland passed an initial vote.",
      "The BBC's research, carried out over a few weeks in March and April, is the first in-depth look at how GPs in England feel about the proposed new law.",
      "Read more on the three GPs' views",
      "Read more on the three GPs' views",
      "Nine out of 10 GPs who said they were against legalising assisted dying worried terminally ill patients would consider it because they felt guilty about being a burden on their loved ones or the health service.",
      "\"The right to die becomes a duty to die for those who feel a burden on family,\" said one GP.",
      "Another common concern was patients might be coerced. Some told us they had treated elderly people with family members they suspected of being more focussed on their inheritance than their relatives.",
      "More than half of the group who opposed a law change said it would be against their religious beliefs.",
      "They spoke about life being \"sacred\" and called assisted dying \"sinful\". Some referred to the commandment \"thou shalt not kill\".",
      "Another argument from those who said they were against assisted dying was the health system should instead focus on improving end-of-life care.",
      "One GP said creating an assisted dying law was \"scandalous\" when hospices were largely funded by charities rather than by the state.",
      "Separately, on Tuesday the Royal College of Psychiatrists said that while the group \"remains neutral\" on the principle of assisted dying, it \"just cannot support this bill\".",
      "In an interview with BBC's Newsnight, the college's president Dr Lade Smith cited a lack of requirements concerning the \"unmet needs\" of patients, and a shortage of psychiatrists to process requests.",
      "\"We're concerned that there isn't a requirement to think about any unmet needs a person might have. A person with a terminal illness... they may be in pain, they have difficulty with their housing, their finances because they haven't been able to work, they might feel lonely, isolated,\" Dr Smith said.",
      "Dr Gordon Macdonald, CEO of Care Not Killing said there was a \"black hole\" in the hospice budget and \"we need better care not killing\".",
      "Dying with dignity",
      "More than 400 GPs told us they supported a law change, with some describing feeling \"traumatised\" and \"haunted\" by watching people die in \"severe pain or distress\".",
      "Of those who said they were in favour, more than nine in 10 respondents believed it could allow patients to have a dignified death.",
      "Some shared personal experiences: telling us about watching their parents losing dignity or begging to die. One said their sick wife prayed every evening to not wake up in the morning.",
      "Those who backed assisted dying often spoke about patient choice, arguing it was patronising not to let people decide how they wanted to die.",
      "Wanting the option of an assisted death for themselves or their loved ones was another common reason for supporting the law.",
      "\"Personally, I would find this a comfort and I resent those who take this choice away from me,\" one told us.",
      "'Unpredictable' timeframe",
      "If assisted dying does become law in England and Wales, it would apply to certain terminally ill patients who were reasonably expected to die within six months.",
      "But more than a quarter of all the GPs who responded told us they would rarely, or never be confident assessing if a patient was expected to die in that time frame.",
      "\"It's unpredictable even in the severely frail,\" one said.",
      "No doctor would be obliged to work in assisted dying. Of the 1,000 GP respondents, more than 500 told us they would be willing to discuss assisted dying with a patient.",
      "Nearly 300 would assess if a patient was eligible and 161 said they would prepare a substance for a patient to take to end their own life.",
      "Legal risks",
      "Prof Kamila Hawthorne, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said the BBC's research showed GPs had \"real concerns about the practical and legal implications of a change in the law on assisted dying\".",
      "\"These must be acknowledged and addressed, so that any legislation is watertight,\" she said.",
      "Sarah Wootton, chief executive of Dignity in Dying, said GPs and other medics will \"rightly be considering how they will navigate\" the proposed law.",
      "She said evidence from assisted dying laws in Australia and the US showed it could be carried out \"safely and effectively, with far reaching benefits for end-of-life care and robust protections for both patients and doctors\".",

      "If you ask these three doctors about being GPs, their answers are remarkably similar.",
      "\"It can be the best job in the world,\" one tells me. It's \"a privilege\" another says. They all talk about how they love getting to know their patients and their families.",
      "But all three have different views on assisted dying.",
      "Right now, the law here is clear: medics cannot help patients to take their own lives. But that could change.",
      "The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill is being debated in Parliament. And if it goes through, it will give some terminally ill patients in England and Wales the option of an assisted death.",
      "Here, three doctors - Abdul Farooq, Susi Caesar and Gurpreet Khaira, who all have a different view on assisted dying - tell us how they feel about the proposals. The three were among more than 1,000 GPs to respond to a BBC questionnaire on assisted dying.",
      "'A red line I would never cross'",
      "Dr Abdul Farooq is 28 and relatively new to his career as a GP.",
      "We meet at his home in east London. He gives his baby daughter a bottle of milk before heading around the corner to pray in his local mosque.",
      "His religion is absolutely key to his views on assisted dying.",
      "\"I believe in the sanctity of life. As a Muslim, I believe that life is a gift from God, and that no one has the right to take that away,\" he says.",
      "Dr Farooq feels taking your own life is wrong, and so, he says, it would be \"sinful\" for him to be involved in that process - even indirectly.",
      "If this law passed - and a patient came to him asking for help to die - he would refer them to another doctor.",
      "He says anything beyond that would be \"a red line I would never cross\".",
      "Dr Farooq's objections are also informed by his professional experience, particularly his time working in a hospital.",
      "He describes seeing \"undignified deaths\" - people passing away on busy wards - and says the health system is not getting the basics right in end-of-life care.",
      "\"There is so much we can do to make patients comfortable, if we have the right resources available,\" he tells me.",
      "\"We have a whole field of medicine called palliative medicine that is there to help people towards the end of their life. So why are we not throwing all our resources and money into that and actually making the process of death less scary?\"",
      "He's also concerned about specific parts of the proposed law. Doctors would have to assess if terminally ill patients are expected to die within six months before they are approved for an assisted death.",
      "Dr Farooq sees this as problematic. The final day or so is easy to predict, he says, but adds that some patients he's expected to die within six months can still be alive a year later.",
      "Is there anything that could change his mind on assisted dying?",
      "\"No,\" Dr Farooq says without hesitation. \"I'm strongly against it. Personally and professionally, I think it's the wrong thing to do for patients.\"",

      "California man invites BBC to witness his death as MPs debate assisted dying",
      "'I could live 30 years but plan to die': How assisted dying law is dividing Canadians",
      "'I'll be at the front of the queue to help'",
      "Dr Susi Caesar has been a GP for 30 years and thinks she probably wouldn't have previously been so vocal in her support of assisted dying.",
      "Now, she says she is ready to \"stick her head above the parapet\".",
      "Recently she lost her beloved dad, Henning. We meet at a lake near Cirencester because being near water reminds her of him.",
      "\"My father was the most amazing person and this is so evocative of everything he loved,\" she says. \"The outdoors, walks, sailing, boats, kayaking, swimming.\"",
      "She thinks Henning would be proud of her for talking to us about her views because he was a long-term believer in assisted dying.",
      "When he was diagnosed with a terminal illness, Dr Caesar says he became \"terribly scared about the manner of his dying\".",
      "\"My father was a very proud man, and the thing that was unbearable to him was the idea that he would lose control at the end of his life - of his bodily functions, of his mind, of his ability to be the person that he was.\"",
      "By the end, Dr Caesar says her father's \"medication never quite kept up with his symptoms.\" For her, the argument over assisted dying comes down to patient choice.",
      "\"Everybody is going to die. Every individual deserves the comfort of choice about how they die. I would want it for myself,\" she tells me.",
      "She acknowledges that many of her colleagues have \"very, very reasonable concerns\" about assisted dying. But she says \"we have the wisdom to set up systems that will work and get over some of these hurdles.\"",
      "I ask if Dr Caesar's support for assisted dying would translate into her working in this area.",
      "\"I will be at the front of the queue to help people to have the death that they wanted,\" she says. \"I think that's the core joy of my job - being with people to the very end of their health journey.\"",

      "Dr Khaira is a GP in Birmingham but also has first-hand experience as a patient.",
      "In 2017, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She found chemotherapy gruelling and says if the cancer ever came back, she wouldn't want to go through it again.",
      "\"I remember feeling very passionate that I should have the choice of whether I go through this kind of treatment, or to say 'that's enough now',\" she says.",
      "She says it felt very important for her to have a choice about the end of her life.",
      "Now, she's a picture of health, striding along a hillside with ease.",
      "As a GP with decades of experience, she worries that vulnerable patients might opt for assisted dying rather than be a burden to their loved ones. Or that some families might coerce vulnerable patients into it.",
      "\"That is one of my biggest areas of personal conflict. I know that there are lots of plans to put safeguards in.",
      "\"You can be the best doctor or advocate in the world, but you may not pick up where someone is being controlled or manipulated.\"",
      "For her, there's a fundamental conflict between her personal and professional experiences.",
      "But, she adds: \"As a doctor, I'd be very reluctant to be handing over a syringe for a patient to make that choice.\"",
      "Balancing up these two sides leaves her \"in a very guilty place\", she says, but adds that it's not a weakness to be open minded. For her, making this decision is an \"evolving process\".",
      "Personal experience shaping opinions",
      "It's striking when talking to Dr Farooq, Dr Caesar and Dr Khaira, how much their views on assisted dying reflect their core belief systems.",
      "In that respect, GPs are possibly much like the rest of us.",

      "Ministers announced in March that the body responsible for overseeing the health service in England would go, with its functions brought into the Department of Health and Social Care.",
      "But the Public Accounts Committee said it was concerned about the uncertainty being caused and urged the government to set out a clear plan within the next three months.",
      "The government said the move would eliminate \"wasteful duplication\" and that detailed planning had started.",
      "Alongside the changes at a national level, the 42 local health boards responsible for planning services are also having to shed around half of their 25,000 staff.",
      "The MPs also raised concerns about the \"jaw-dropping\" amount of money lawyers are making from clinical negligence claims. Of the \u00a32.8bn paid out in 2023-24, nearly a fifth went on legal costs.",
      "It said this was unacceptable and more must be done to improve safety.",

      "The trial, named Partner, took place at 23 sites in England, Scotland and Wales. Before surgery, 39 women with early stage breast cancer were given olaparib, also known as Lynparza, together with chemotherapy.",

      "Prof Abraham said: \"From a cost perspective, it would save the NHS a considerable amount of money because it's a fraction of the time and dose of the drug.\"",
      "Michelle Mitchell, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said: \"While this research is still in its infancy, it is an exciting discovery that adding olaparib at a carefully-timed stage of treatment can potentially give patients with this specific type of breast cancer more time with their loved ones.\"",

      "More holistic approach",

      "They are learning about how to eat in moderation, how to exercise safely and how to feel good about themselves.",

    "story": [
      "\"High-protein\" versions of snacks and food staples are all over our supermarket shelves - from pancakes and pasta, to rice pudding and oven pizza.",
      "Celebrities are getting in on the act too. Khloe Kardashian unveiled Khloud Protein Popcorn a fortnight ago, which she described as \"the perfect combination of a tasty snack and a boost of protein to fuel your day\", while Zac Efron promoted a protein-rich porridge in January.",
      "But is this increased advertising of protein just a marketing gimmick or are these products actually useful if you're trying to build muscle or live a healthy life? And is it worth the extra cost?",
      "Sales of them are rising; figures shared with BBC News by the research agency Mintel show that, excluding sports nutrition items, 8.3% of food product launches made claims about being a source of protein, or having high levels of it, in the first three months of 2025.",
      "That was up from 6.1% in 2024 and 4.6% the year before.",
      "Kiti Soininen, a research director at Mintel, says protein claims are being added to food with naturally high levels of the nutrient, like chicken breasts and pulses, but also on products you wouldn't expect.",
      "\"Mousses, desserts, granola, pancakes, even the odd pizza, are coming through with a high-protein claim,\" she says. \"Protein is enjoying a bit of a 'health halo' at the moment.\"",
      "Ethan Smith, a personal trainer in Liverpool, says high-protein diets are necessary for building muscle but that it ought to be done without the high protein snacks and drinks you see in shops.",
      "\"I'm a huge believer that there is nothing better than whole foods,\" he says. \"You can get the protein that you need from vegetables and lean meats.\"",
      "He believes the convenience of high-protein snacks, combined with the positive perception of the nutrient among customers, has led to manufacturers using protein as a marketing tool.",
      "For manufacturers to claim their product is a source of protein, they must show regulators at least 12% of its energy value is provided by protein. To make a claim that a product is high in protein, the figure is 20%.",
      "To help reach these scores they can add protein-rich ingredients to their products, like nuts and pulses, or make them more dense by removing water.",
      "\"When someone in a rush is getting a meal deal for lunch, you can see why they would reach for a protein bar or drink instead of two boiled eggs,\" he says. \"In my 12 years as a personal trainer, I've never seen as much hype around the benefits of protein as I am now.\"",
      "The benefits of protein range from muscle building and sports performance to helping with weight loss by suppressing appetite and helping women during pregnancy.",
      "If you're trying to build muscle you need to consume around 1.6g of protein per kilogram of your body weight each day, says Dr Paul Morgan, a university lecturer in human nutrition.",
      "He says for the average person trying to ensure their general health, this figure should be around 1.2g.",
      "He thinks many of the supermarket products advertising their protein content are \"gimmicky\" and warns they might not be as good for you as advertised.",
      "\"I think they do have a benefit but we are wary that a lot of them are ultra processed foods and that's a really topical area [in our field] that we don't know enough about,\" he says.",

      "Another issue is calories because putting on weight is the most common problem people have when they are trying to consume more protein, Dr Morgan explains, as any excess is stored in the body as fat.",
      "Some protein advertised snacks and drinks can have as many calories as regular products using similar ingredients.",
      "Nature Valley's protein peanut and chocolate bars have 489kcal per 100g, while Cadbury's peanut brunch bars, which also contain chocolate, have 485kcal at the same weight.",
      "Dr Morgan dismisses theories that eating too much protein can damage your bones or harm your kidneys, though there are exceptions if you have a pre-existing health condition.",
      "Despite his concerns over ultra-processed protein products, Dr Morgan sees the benefit of increased protein in staple foods.",
      "These might be particularly useful to elderly people who need more protein than the average person to maintain strength in their muscles and bones.",
      "Tesco's high-protein penne pasta contains 8.8g of protein per 100g, while their normal penne contains 5.8g of protein for the same weight. However, customers pay more for this as the high protein-penne costs \u00a34.80 per kg. The normal penne costs \u00a31.29 per kg.",
      "So is it worth buying these protein advertised products?",
      "It might be if you're someone who needs more protein to maintain your health or if you're trying to build muscle and need just a little bit extra to meet your daily protein goal, says Ethan.",
      "\"If the majority of your diet is whole foods and you need that extra 20g of protein to hit your goal and want something sweet - then go for that pudding or snack,\" he tells us. \"Having balance is important - but you shouldn't be relying on them.\"",

    "story": [
      "The UK is in talks with other countries to set up overseas \"return hubs\" for failed asylum seekers, Sir Keir Starmer has said on his first official visit to Albania.",
      "The prime minister said the government had begun discussions about sending asylum seekers abroad for processing after their claims had been rejected in the UK.",
      "He would not comment on which countries were involved, or where failed asylum seekers could be sent, but Albania said it was not part of the talks.",
      "Sir Keir has travelled to Albania to announce separate measures to crack down on organised crime and illegal immigration.",
      "The number of people crossing the Channel has passed 12,000 since January, putting 2025 on course to be a record year.",
      "\"We are in talks with a number of countries about return hubs,\" Sir Keir said at a news conference in Albania, alongside the country's Prime Minister Edi Rama.",
      "\"I see them as a really important innovation.\"",
      "The BBC has previously reported that the proposals are focused on countries in the western Balkans \u2013 a region which includes Albania, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.",
      "The proposals would apply only to asylum seekers whose claims had been rejected and who had no further routes of appeal in the UK.",
      "It differs from the previous Conservative government's Rwanda scheme, which was scrapped by Sir Keir and involved sending migrants to have their asylum claims processed in the African country.",
      "Italy has a similar scheme, which involves sending failed asylum seekers to Albania while they await deportation, but that plan has been held up by legal action.",
      "Speaking at the news conference, Rama said the scheme was \"a one-off with Italy because of our very special relationship\".",
      "Rama said the Albanian government had been asked by several countries if it was open to establishing similar schemes.",
      "\"We said no because we are loyal to our marriage with Italy,\" Rama said.",
      "Sir Keir said the return hubs \"were consistent with the work\" the UK had done with Albania on reducing the number of migrants crossing the English Channel.",
      "Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said Rama's apparent rejection of talks about return hubs had turned the PM's trip into \"an embarrassment\".",
      "Philp said: \"Starmer jetted off and now the Albanian prime minister has made clear that there will be no UK return hubs in Albania.",
      "\"So, what was the point of this entire visit?\"",
      "The government said there has been a 95% reduction in Albanian small boat arrivals in the past three years, and that the number of Albanians returned has doubled in the past two years.",
      "Immigration has been a strong focus of the government this week.",
      "On Monday, the government set out plans to reduce the level of legal migration in a White Paper.",
      "Sir Keir argued the proposals would bring the immigration system \"back into control\" and denied it was a response to the success of Reform UK in recent local elections.",
      "The party led by Nigel Farage is promising to freeze non-essential immigration an take small boats in the Channel back to France.",
      "In Albania, the prime minister announced further co-operation with Albania on tackling illegal migration and organised crime.",
      "Sir Keir said: \"The last government lost control of the borders. I am determined that we will retake control of the borders.",
      "\"That means that we have got to have a concerted effort to smash the gangs that are running this vile trade.\"",
      "He said greater co-operation with Albania had \"driven down those numbers\" and that he wanted to \"see more of that\".",
      "The prime minister announced the expansion of the Joint Migration Task Force -  which shares intelligence and carries out operations against people smugglers in the Western Balkans - to include North Macedonia.",
      "The enhanced co-operation with Albania will include measures to tackle a \"revolving door effect\", of migrants returning home, evading law enforcement and leaving the country again, the government said.",

      "The plans will see offenders serving one to four year sentences held for a fixed 28-day period if they are returned to prison for breaching their licence.",
      "Ministers argue the move is required to stop jails running out of cells within months,  after they inherited a capacity \"crisis\" from the last Tory government.",
      "But shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said it would \"put the public in danger and victims in jeopardy\".",

      "More inmates released early to stop prisons running out of space",
      "Ministers to consider scrapping short jail terms",
      "The proposals have also been criticised by Tory peer Baroness Newlove of Warrington, the victims' commissioner for England and Wales, who said they would leave victims feeling \"unnerved and bewildered\".",
      "\"I find it difficult to understand why this specific group of offenders has been targeted for early release,\" she added in a statement on Thursday.",
      "The government estimates that the plans, which will apply in England and Wales, will free up around 1,400 prison places and buy ministers time ahead of a wider review of sentencing due shortly.",
      "The review, led by former Conservative minister David Gauke, is expected to recommend more community-based sentencing to reduce the long-term reliance on imprisonment.",
      "But speaking during the Commons debate,  justice minister Sir Nic Dakin said its recommendations would take until spring next year to have an impact, whilst prisons were \"perilously close\" to filling up now.",
      "'Managed breakdown'",
      "He argued the changes to recall were necessary to avoid a \"managed breakdown of the criminal justice system,\" blaming the previous government for not building enough prisons during its 14 years in power.",
      "The 28-day detention limit would apply to offenders with sentences between one and four years, who have been released after serving their minimum period but then recalled for breaching their licence, such as by not sticking to their curfew.",
      "Those subject to a standard recall would otherwise have to wait for the Parole Board to decide when they can be re-released, a process the government says is taking months amid backlogs in the system.",
      "Ministers say the fixed limit will not apply to the highest-risk violent and sexual offenders, or those who are recalled for committing serious further offences.",
      "It will require new legislation to take effect, which ministers are expected to table in the coming weeks.",
      "The number of recalled prisoners has increased in recent years and they now make up around 15% of the 88,087 prison population, from a useable operational capacity of 89,442.",
      "Last year the Labour government implemented an early release scheme drawn up under the previous government, shortly after taking office.",
      "That scheme, under which qualifying prisoners were let out after serving 40% rather than 50% of their total sentence, saw more than 16,000 offenders released early during the final three months of last year.",
      "The government says that as well as changes to sentencing, a long-term plan to ease overcrowding will also require more prisons to be built.",
      "It has confirmed it wants to start work on three new prisons before the end of this year, and \u00a34.7bn will be allocated for prison-building between 2026 and 2031 at the government spending review, due next month."

      "Cooper did not rule out a national inquiry but said it will depend on the findings of the Casey report.",
      "Speaking to the Spectator, Mahmood said there is still an \"outstanding question of why so many people maybe looked the other way\".",

      "\"On one level you could say, well, accountability is occurring because these criminals are facing the full force of the law,\" she said.",
      "\"But the way that this scandal has played out asks a bigger question, which is that you might be getting accountability and justice through the criminal justice system, [but] it doesn't feel like proper accountability and justice for all of the victims.",
      "\"And that's because there is still [an] outstanding question of why so many people maybe looked the other way, or why this wasn't picked up and given the prominence that was needed, and so that's why justice might technically have been delivered --  But there's still a moment of reckoning to come.\"",
      "Prof Jay's seven-year investigation found tens of thousands of victims had been failed by institutions across the country, including in children's services and the police.",
      "Mahmood said these institutional failures had caused \"such visceral pain and a total shattering of trust in people who should have done a better job locally\".",
      "\"Whether local authorities, children's services, police officers, all sorts of people you would feel you can trust, and that trust has been fundamentally shaken, if not totally broken, in some of these places,\" she said.",
      "\"There is that need for reckoning. I hope I'm not overstating it as truth and reconciliation, but in my mind, that's what it feels like is needed.\"",
      "The national audit by Baroness Casey will look at the scale, nature and profile of grooming gangs, including offender characteristics, after Prof Jay found \"widespread failure\" to record the ethnicity of perpetrators, many of whom are of Pakistani-heritage, due to concerns around racism.",
      "The government has also announced specific support for five local inquiries in areas like Oldham, but it has resisted pressure from political opponents and some victims to commission another full national inquiry, saying its focus is on implementing recommendations made by Prof Jay's 2022 report.",

      "The change would not apply to those who commit a serious further offence \u2013 or are deemed to pose a high risk, she said.",
      "In usual circumstances, these offenders would go in front of a parole board before being confirmed for release, but the government has decided to skip that part of the process, arguing they would have already been released if it was not for a backlog in parole assessments.",
      "The changes are expected to be introduced in the coming weeks.",

      "Family doctors in England are deeply divided on the issue of assisted dying, BBC research on plans to legalise the practice suggests.",
      "The findings give a unique insight into how strongly many GPs feel about the proposed new law - and highlight how personal beliefs and experiences are shaping doctors' views on the issue.",
      "BBC News sent more than 5,000 GPs a questionnaire asking whether they agreed with changing the law to allow assisted dying for certain terminally ill people in England and Wales.",
      "More than 1,000 GPs replied, with about 500 telling us they were against an assisted dying law and about 400 saying they were in favour.",
      "Some of the 500 GPs who told us they were against the law change called the bill \"appalling\", \"highly dangerous\", and \"cruel\". \"We are doctors, not murderers,\" one said.",
      "Of the 400 who said they supported assisted dying, some described the bill as \"long overdue\" and \"a basic human right\".",
      "\"We are keeping human bodies alive in the most inhumane manner,\" one said. They asked: \"How do we ethically justify forcing these bodies to continue to exist in decrepitude?\"",
      "We cannot know whether the GPs who responded to the BBC are representative of all family doctors.",

      "It comes as MPs will this week again debate proposed changes to the controversial bill, with a vote in parliament expected on whether to pass or block it next month.",
      "If assisted dying does become legal in England and Wales, it would be a historic change for society.",
      "Current laws prevent medics from helping any patient to carry out their wish to die. The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill would allow any doctor to be involved in assisted dying, but GPs are often a large part of the practice in other countries. On Tuesday, a separate bill to legalise assisted dying in Scotland passed an initial vote.",

      "Read more on the three GPs' views",
      "Read more on the three GPs' views",
      "Nine out of 10 GPs who said they were against legalising assisted dying worried terminally ill patients would consider it because they felt guilty about being a burden on their loved ones or the health service.",
      "\"The right to die becomes a duty to die for those who feel a burden on family,\" said one GP.",
      "Another common concern was patients might be coerced. Some told us they had treated elderly people with family members they suspected of being more focussed on their inheritance than their relatives.",
      "More than half of the group who opposed a law change said it would be against their religious beliefs.",
      "They spoke about life being \"sacred\" and called assisted dying \"sinful\". Some referred to the commandment \"thou shalt not kill\".",
      "Another argument from those who said they were against assisted dying was the health system should instead focus on improving end-of-life care.",
      "One GP said creating an assisted dying law was \"scandalous\" when hospices were largely funded by charities rather than by the state.",
      "Separately, on Tuesday the Royal College of Psychiatrists said that while the group \"remains neutral\" on the principle of assisted dying, it \"just cannot support this bill\".",
      "In an interview with BBC's Newsnight, the college's president Dr Lade Smith cited a lack of requirements concerning the \"unmet needs\" of patients, and a shortage of psychiatrists to process requests.",
      "\"We're concerned that there isn't a requirement to think about any unmet needs a person might have. A person with a terminal illness... they may be in pain, they have difficulty with their housing, their finances because they haven't been able to work, they might feel lonely, isolated,\" Dr Smith said.",
      "Dr Gordon Macdonald, CEO of Care Not Killing said there was a \"black hole\" in the hospice budget and \"we need better care not killing\".",
      "Dying with dignity",
      "More than 400 GPs told us they supported a law change, with some describing feeling \"traumatised\" and \"haunted\" by watching people die in \"severe pain or distress\".",
      "Of those who said they were in favour, more than nine in 10 respondents believed it could allow patients to have a dignified death.",
      "Some shared personal experiences: telling us about watching their parents losing dignity or begging to die. One said their sick wife prayed every evening to not wake up in the morning.",
      "Those who backed assisted dying often spoke about patient choice, arguing it was patronising not to let people decide how they wanted to die.",
      "Wanting the option of an assisted death for themselves or their loved ones was another common reason for supporting the law.",
      "\"Personally, I would find this a comfort and I resent those who take this choice away from me,\" one told us.",
      "'Unpredictable' timeframe",
      "If assisted dying does become law in England and Wales, it would apply to certain terminally ill patients who were reasonably expected to die within six months.",
      "But more than a quarter of all the GPs who responded told us they would rarely, or never be confident assessing if a patient was expected to die in that time frame.",
      "\"It's unpredictable even in the severely frail,\" one said.",
      "No doctor would be obliged to work in assisted dying. Of the 1,000 GP respondents, more than 500 told us they would be willing to discuss assisted dying with a patient.",
      "Nearly 300 would assess if a patient was eligible and 161 said they would prepare a substance for a patient to take to end their own life.",
      "Legal risks",
      "Prof Kamila Hawthorne, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said the BBC's research showed GPs had \"real concerns about the practical and legal implications of a change in the law on assisted dying\".",
      "\"These must be acknowledged and addressed, so that any legislation is watertight,\" she said.",
      "Sarah Wootton, chief executive of Dignity in Dying, said GPs and other medics will \"rightly be considering how they will navigate\" the proposed law.",
      "She said evidence from assisted dying laws in Australia and the US showed it could be carried out \"safely and effectively, with far reaching benefits for end-of-life care and robust protections for both patients and doctors\".",

      "Responding to concerns about disabled people, he said: \"Denying dying Scots more choice will not enhance the lives of those with a disability.",

      "In the assisted dying bill making its way through Westminster, a terminally ill person is defined as someone who has less than six months to live.",

    "summary": "The PM knows cutting immigration is crucial to his credibility, political editor Chris Mason writes.",
    "story": [
      "It is perhaps little wonder immigration is as politically charged an issue as it is, when you consider two things.",
      "Firstly, as I wrote here, the numbers point to it being the stand-out UK social and demographic change of the 21st century.",
      "And secondly, it is also one of the biggest and most transparent political failings, when you compare rhetoric to reality.",
      "There were the projections made by Sir Tony Blair's government two decades ago that allowing unlimited migration from central and eastern Europe would tempt modest numbers of people to move here \u2013 and huge numbers turned up.",
      "In the 2010s, the Conservatives repeatedly promised to cut net migration to the tens of thousands a year, and repeatedly failed.",
      "The numbers then rocketed after Brexit, the very act that meant UK governments were entirely responsible for immigration policy for the first time in a generation.",
      "Most people miss most political debates most of the time, but some are sufficiently totemic they are not just noticed but make the political weather.",
      "The arguments over immigration are one of them \u2013 and what I have just set out tells you why.",
      "This is the generational context within which this prime minister's promises perch.",
      "It is a longevity of failure that senior politicians of various political persuasions privately accept \u2013 perhaps more so than any other single issue \u2013 has seeded a cynicism and a disillusion with how we are governed.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer's language felt like an acknowledgement of that central point: here was a Labour prime minister, a former human rights lawyer, claiming \"we risk becoming an island of strangers.\"",
      "It is a phrase some, particularly on the left, regard as repulsive.",
      "Others counter that it is a widely held perception which it is high time those in high office shared.",

      "The Reform UK factor",
      "Labour wrestle with the many practical and political trade-offs around immigration policy, just as other parties in government have as well.",
      "In practical terms, staffing care homes, building new houses \u2013 can these things be done without an influx of folk from abroad?",
      "Interestingly, Sir Keir took issue with the long-standing view of many that immigration helps drive or at least prop up economic growth.",
      "The other context here is the insurgency of Reform UK.",
      "Nigel Farage argues, as he has for years and years, that politicians have been far too slow to get how much immigration matters to so many people.",
      "Labour are acutely aware of Farage's capacity to communicate in a way that resonates with those who feel successive governments have not just ignored them on this issue, but belittled and demeaned their views too.",
      "That is why the prime minister is using the language he is now.",
      "And there is another thing going on here too.",
      "This is a week of muscular language and intent, firstly primarily on legal migration now, and in a few days on illegal migration too.",
      "By next week the focus will switch to an anticipated new deal between the UK and the European Union, and within it, the likelihood of a youth mobility plan \u2013 meaning young people from the UK can travel more freely around Europe, and those from the EU can come here.",
      "Ministers will insist this doesn't amount to freedom of movement, nor immigration \u2013 because visits in both directions will be strictly age and time limited.",
      "But you can be certain there will be a row about it.",
      "These then are the short, medium and long-term reasons why the prime minister and his team know that their plan for delivering a sustained downward trend to the net migration numbers is absolutely crucial to their credibility.",

      "The prime minister said measures in the white paper, a blueprint for future laws, would make the system \"controlled, selective and fair\".",
      "Here is a summary of the key measures.",
      "Work visas tightened - for some",
      "Overseas workers will now generally need a degree-level qualification to apply for the main skilled worker visa, instead of the equivalent of A-level, reversing a change made under Boris Johnson's government.",
      "This higher threshold will not apply to those already in the UK renewing their visa - but ministers say it will prevent new visa applications for around 180 jobs, reducing immigration by around 39,000 a year by 2029.",
      "Lower qualification requirements will remain on a \"time limited basis\" for sectors deemed to be facing long-term recruitment issues.",
      "What this means in practice is not yet clear, with the government's migration advisory body tasked with recommending roles for inclusion.",
      "Lower-qualification visas will be capped and restricted to employers with a workforce training plan in place, whilst those applying will also face extra restrictions on bringing their dependants to the UK.",
      "But loosened for others",
      "At the same time, the government wants to expand eligibility for its dedicated work visa for graduates of elite universities outside the UK.",
      "It says a \"targeted and capped\" expansion of the scheme could see the number of qualifying institutions double, from around 40 currently.",
      "The visa for international students who plan to set up a business in the UK will also be reviewed, and ministers say they want to make it easier for \"top scientific and design talent\" to apply for the global talent visa.",
      "Longer residency waits",
      "Immigrants will typically have to live in the UK for 10 years before applying for the right to stay indefinitely \u2013 double the current five-year period.",
      "Under the plans, this period could be reduced through a new \"earned settlement\" system, under which people would be awarded points to reflect their contribution to the UK \"economy and society\".",
      "It is not yet clear when this longer qualifying period will kick in - details of the new system, along with a similar scheme that will apply to applications for citizenship, will be consulted on later this year.",
      "Home Office urged to record migrant exits from UK",
      "How many people come to work and study in the UK?",
      "Care visa scrapped",
      "A dedicated visa for social care workers introduced during the Covid pandemic will close to new applicants next month.",
      "Ministers say the visa, which was tightened last year, was a key driver of increased immigration in the years after Brexit, and better pay in the sector can solve longstanding recruitment problems.",
      "Visa extensions will be permitted until 2028, and those who already have working rights will be able to switch sponsor during the term of their visa.",
      "Stricter student rules",
      "Overseas graduates will only be able to stay in the UK for 18 months after their studies, instead of two years currently.",
      "Ministers are also thinking of charging English universities a new 6% tax on tuition fee income from international students, which they are promising to reinvest into the higher education and skills system.",
      "The government says it expects this to be passed on to international students in the form of higher fees, reducing applications by 7,000 per year.",
      "Refugee pilot extended",
      "A \"limited pool\" of people who lack refugee status in the UK but have been recognised as refugees by the United Nations will be allowed to use existing sponsored worker routes to come to the UK to work.",
      "Ministers say this will build on a three-year EU-sponsored pilot project that saw around 100 skilled refugees and their families allowed to work in specified sectors such as IT, construction and engineering.",
      "Tougher English tests",
      "Language requirements for all work visas will increase, whilst adult dependents of visa-holders will be required to demonstrate a basic understanding of English to come on a spousal and partner route.",
      "The government says those extending visas will be required to demonstrate a higher level of English when applying to settle in the UK.",
      "Skills and training",
      "The government says firms in sectors deemed to rely too much on overseas workers will be \"expected to comply\" with strategies to boost workplace skills.",
      "These will also be determined by official migration advisers, but government sources say IT, construction and healthcare are likely to feature.",
      "Labour has previously indicated it wants to link skills training to the visa system - but details of what this means in practice have not yet been set out.",
      "Family rights reviewed",
      "The government says it will table legislation to \"clarify\" how the right to a family life in European human rights law should apply to immigration cases.",
      "It also says Parliament will be able to adopt a \"framework\" aiming to limit the extent to which family rights can be used to delay the removal of people without the right to stay in the UK.",
      "No overall cap",
      "The prime minister said the government wants to \"significantly\" reduce net migration - the number of people coming to the UK minus those leaving - from the record levels it has reached in recent years.",

    "story": [
      "When it comes to reducing UK immigration, there have been plenty of promises and targets from successive governments over the last 15 years, but the numbers remain high.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer is now pledging to \"take back control of our borders\", promising tighter rules to bring down the numbers \"significantly\".",
      "BBC Verify examines the measures set out by the government and the challenges ahead.",
      "What's happened to the numbers?",
      "Migration levels have hit \"unprecedented levels\" in recent years, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).",
      "Net migration to the UK - total permanent arrivals minus total permanent departures - reached a record 906,000 in the year ending in June 2023 and then fell to 728,000 in the year ending in June 2024.",
      "The continued high levels persist, despite previous government efforts to bring the numbers down. For example, in 2010 the Conservatives pledged to reduce net migration to the \"tens of thousands\".",
      "Annual net migration is expected to come down to about 315,000 by the end of the Parliament.",
      "That's according to the central forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - the independent body that scrutinises the public finances.",
      "That estimate, however, would still be higher than most years in the past decade.",
      "What's been driving immigration?",
      "The vast majority of migrants come to the UK for study or work.",
      "And many of the work visas have been for people coming to do jobs in health and social care.",
      "However, applications for health and social care visas have come down sharply in the past two years after the rules were tightened by the last Conservative government and this decline will ultimately feed into the official net migration statistics in the coming years.",
      "Does immigration help economic growth?",
      "There's been much discussion about the link between immigration and economic growth.",
      "The White Paper - which sets out the government's plan - says the UK economy needs to wean itself off a reliance on cheap overseas labour.",
      "While taking questions from journalists, the prime minister claimed the idea immigration leads to higher economic growth \"doesn't hold\".",
      "Economists do not agree about the exact impact that simply adding more people to an economy has on growth and prosperity.",
      "New arrivals might increase the country's overall level of economic activity - measured by GDP. But on a per-person basis, GDP could be stagnant or falling. Also a larger population puts more pressure on demand for public services and housing.",
      "However, if immigrants are filling important gaps in the labour market which would otherwise not be filled - especially jobs that require specific skills - then economists generally think that immigrants can boost GDP per head and general prosperity.",
      "The OBR says that increased migration generally increases economic growth but \"the size of this impact and the effect on per person living standards is highly uncertain\".",
      "The OBR's point about growth per person is important because the government has made growth of this measure a key priority.",
      "Growth per person fell in 2023 and was flat in 2024.",
      "What about social care?",
      "There are gaps in our labour market which have been substantially filled by migrants in recent years, most notably social care.",
      "And there were still estimated to be 131,000 vacant posts in adult social care in England in 2023.",
      "Care providers argue stopping them recruiting from overseas will likely make that gap bigger.",
      "Non-immigrants could theoretically fill many of these posts and working-age people who are economically inactive could potentially be deployed in this sector if they could be encouraged and helped into work.",
      "Yet the main barrier to recruitment in social care has been the level of pay, which is currently too low to attract sufficient numbers of British workers.",
      "Labour's immigration plans at a glance",
      "Starmer promises to cut migration as Farage and Badenoch criticise PM's plan",

      "Amy Clark, commercial director of a Cornwall care home chain, told the BBC that the measures could cause challenges because \"recruiting locally is very, very difficult\".",
      "The government could increase the levels of pay in social care, but that would leave them under pressure to increase grants to local authorities and potentially raise taxes to fund it.",
      "Problems with social care recruitment were also highlighted by Madeleine Sumption, deputy chair of the Migration Advisory Committee.",
      "\"We've seen widespread reports of exploitation, people coming in who are quite vulnerable earning very low wages.",
      "\"So I am not surprised the government has chosen to close overseas recruitment because it's caused them so much difficulty,\" she said.",
      "What about universities?",
      "Overseas students have been a major contributor to levels of net migration in recent years.",
      "But they are also a significant source of funding for UK universities.",
      "A large reduction in overseas students numbers would undermine the finances of many universities and a number are already in severe financial difficulties.",
      "The government wants to monitor more closely how universities recruit international students.",
      "It is also proposing a limit on the time international students can remain in the UK after graduating. Foreign students would only have 18 months to look for a job, down from 2-3 years previously.",
      "Universities UK - which represents 141 universities - has urged the government \"to think carefully\" about the impact of its measures.",
      "If overseas student numbers did fall, the government could make up the shortfall in universities' revenue by increasing central government grants but, again, that could require an increase in taxes.",
      "Alternatively, it could further increase domestic students' tuition fees, although that would also be contentious.",
      "What about skilled migrants?",
      "The government says it still wants to attract high-skilled individuals \"who play by the rules and contribute to the economy\".",
      "However, the PM also stressed that some parts of the economy are \"addicted\" to importing cheap labour, rather than investing in training UK workers.",
      "As an example, Sir Keir said the number of engineering apprenticeships had fallen in recent years, while visas for overseas workers in this area had gone up.",
      "Figures in the government's new immigration plan show that the number of UK work visas issued for engineering professionals rose from 3,427 in 2021 to 5,495 in 2024.",
      "Meanwhile, the number of new apprenticeships in engineering in England fell from 26,970 in 2021-22 to 18,520 in 2024-25.",
      "But if the government wants many more home-trained engineers that will likely come with a cost in terms of a higher training budget.",
      "While that investment could come partly from firms, it could also mean more public spending and possibly tax rises.",
      "According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, total public spending on adult education and skills has fallen by 24% in real terms since 2010.",
      "Reacting to the government's proposals, Make UK - which represents manufacturers - said firms are being forced to recruit overseas staff because domestic skills training is \"fundamentally flawed\".",

    "summary": "Researchers in Japan and US have unlocked the 60-year mystery of what gives cats their orange colour.",
    "story": [
      "Garfield, Puss in Boots,  Aristocats' Toulouse \u2013 cultural icons maybe, ginger most certainly.",
      "And now scientists across two continents have uncovered the DNA mystery that has given our furry friends, particularly males, their notable colour.",
      "They discovered that ginger cats are missing a section of their genetic code, which means the cells responsible for their skin, eye and fur tone produce lighter colours.",
      "The breakthrough has brought delight to the scientists but also the thousands of cat lovers that originally crowdfunded the research.",
      "The scientists hope solving the puzzle could also help shed light on whether orange coloured cats are at increased risk of certain health conditions.",
      "It has been known for decades that it is genetics that gives orange tabby cats their distinctive colouring, but exactly where in the genetic code has evaded scientists till now.",
      "Two teams of scientists at Kyushu University in Japan and Stanford University in the US have now revealed the mystery in simultaneous papers published on Thursday.",
      "What the teams found was that in the cells responsible for giving a cat its skin, hair follicles and eyes their colour - melanocytes - one gene, ARHGAP36, was much more active.",
      "Genes are made up of pieces of DNA which give instructions to a cat's cells, like other living creatures, on how to function.",
      "By comparing the DNA from dozens of cats with and without orange fur they found that those with ginger colouring had a section of DNA code missing within this ARHGAP36 gene.",
      "Without this DNA the activity of the ARHGAP36 is not suppressed i.e. it is more active. The scientists believe that the gene instructs those melanocytes to produce lighter pigment.",
      "Ginger cats mostly male",
      "For decades scientists have observed that cats with completely ginger colouring are far more likely to be male. This tallies with the fact that the gene is carried on the X chromosome.",
      "Chromosomes are larger sections of DNA, and male cats like other mammals have an X and a Y chromosome, which carry different amounts of genes.",
      "As it a gene only on the X chromosome in this case controlling the pigment production then one missing piece of DNA is enough to turn a cat fully ginger.",
      "In comparison female cats have two X chromosomes so the DNA needs to be missing in both chromosomes to increase lighter pigment production to the same extent - it means a mixed colouring is more likely.",
      "\"These ginger and black patches form because, early in development, one X chromosome in each cell is randomly switched off,\" explains Prof Hiroyuki Sasaki, geneticist at Kyushu University.",
      "\"As cells divide, this creates areas with different active coat colour genes, resulting in distinct patches.\"",
      "Although couched in science, the study originally started off as a passion project for Professor Sasaki.",
      "He had retired from his university post, but as a cat lover said he wanted to continue working to uncover the orange cat gene in the hope it could \"contribute to the overcoming of cat diseases\".",
      "He and his team raised 10.6m yen (\u00a355,109) via crowdfunding for the research from thousands of fellow cat lovers across Japan and the world.",
      "One contributor wrote: \"We are siblings in the first and third grades of elementary school. We donated with our pocket money. Use it for research on calico cats.\"",
      "The ARHGAP36 gene is also active in many other areas of the body including the brain and hormonal glands, and is considered important for development.",
      "The researchers think it is possible that the DNA mutation in the gene could cause other changes in these parts of the body linked to health conditions or temperament.",
      "The ARHGAP36 gene is found in humans and has been linked to skin cancer and hair loss.",
      "\"Many cat owners swear by the idea that different coat colours and patterns are linked with different personalities,\" said Prof Sasaki.",

      "But dry weather earlier in the year has risks. It does \"potentially pose a greater risk to water resources later on in the year, particularly if the dry weather continues,\" says Stephen Turner, hydrologist at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.",
      "Last week, Richard Thompson, chair of the National Drought Group, warned that water companies may need to bring in water restrictions to protect supplies if the dry weather continues.",
      "At the moment the key questions are when will it next rain and when it does, how much will there be.",
      "There are some signs that some rain is on the horizon, with unsettled weather from the west at the end of next week.",
      "Drinking water comes from different places depending on the geography and geology of regions.",
      "Roughly speaking, the south of England takes a long time to get into drought but a long time to leave. That's because a lot of rainfall is stored in rocks underground and takes a long time to reach rivers and water supplies.",
      "By contrast, the north of England quickly enters drought and quickly gets out because reservoirs are more heavily used for water supplies.",
      "Water Companies introduce hosepipe bans when water supplies reach a certain low in their areas.",
      "If drought conditions become severe, the government can restrict irrigation of farms, reduce boats' movement on waterways, and limit water available to non-essential businesses like car washes.",
      "In an extreme scenario, it could ration the amount of water available to homes and businesses but that has not happened since 1976.",
      "Water industry bosses and the National Farmers' Union (NFU) are calling on the government to do more to ensure the driest parts of the UK have secure water supplies in the face of any future drought.",
      "Water UK, which represents the water industry, is calling for a new national water grid of pipes, canals and reservoirs to be set up in England to move water from the wettest regions to where it is most needed.",
      "And farmers say they need more government funding and less planning red tape to build their own reservoirs to supply their farms.",
      "Mr Deane came together with five other farmers, including fruit growers, to build their own reservoir. It took four years and cost more than \u00a31m.",
      "It has proved vital, they say, with 15% of the stored water already used this year in the dry conditions.",
      "But the group said obtaining planning permission was costly and difficult.",

      "Urine needs to be kept separate because it's purified and treated to be re-used as drinking water, she explains.",
      "Back in the pool, divers are constantly adjusting Rosemary's buoyancy in the water to make the experience as close as possible to microgravity.",
      "She moves around painstakingly, making sure she's always attached to the submerged structure using two hooks.",
      "Every hand-hold is carefully chosen along the bars on the outside of each module. They're in exactly the same positions as the ones on the real thing, vital muscle memory if she gets to carry out a spacewalk 200 miles (322km) above the Earth.",
      "It's slow and difficult work, requiring plenty of upper body strength and physical effort in the hot, bulky spacesuit.",
      "\"You do a lot of mental preparation \u2013 you really think through every single movement,\" Rosemary explains. \"You have to be really efficient with your energy. You don't want to do something and realise it wasn't quite right and have to do it again.\"",
      "Rosemary is working alongside another astronaut to complete a list of space station repairs and maintenance for the test. Her every move is monitored by a team in a control room overlooking the pool. They're in constant communication with her as she works through her tasks.",
      "Former space station commander Aki Hoshide, from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, is on hand for advice. He has completed four spacewalks and says it's a steep learning curve for new astronauts.",
      "\"When we first start out, there's so much information thrown at you, so many skills that you have to learn and show and demonstrate,\" he says. \"It is baby steps, but they are moving forward \u2013 and I can see their excitement every time they come here and jump in the pool.\"",
      "Rosemary takes us to see a Saturn V \u2013 the rocket that took the Apollo astronauts to the Moon in 1969. More than 50 years on, Nasa is planning an imminent return to the lunar surface with its Artemis programme. European astronauts will join later missions. With an expected 35-year space career ahead, Rosemary may one day get the chance to become the first Briton to walk on the Moon.",
      "\"It's incredibly exciting that we, as humanity, are going back to the Moon, and of course, any way that I could be a part of that, I would be absolutely delighted. I think it's absolutely thrilling,\" she says.",
      "After six gruelling hours underwater, Rosemary is nearing the end of her spacewalk test \u2013 but then she's thrown a curve ball.",
      "In the control room, we hear her call out for a comms check with her astronaut partner who's working on another part of the space station. But she's met with silence.",
      "On a video screen, we can see he's motionless. Rosemary doesn't know it, but he's been asked to pretend to lose consciousness. Rosemary's job is to reach him, check his condition \u2013 and tow him back to the airlock.",
      "After so long under water, we can see how exhausted she is \u2013 but working slowly and steadily, she gets him safely to the airlock.",
      "\"Rosemary has the endurance of a champion. She crushed it today,\" says Jenna Hanson, one of Nasa's spacewalk instructors who's been assessing Rosemary. \"We're really happy with where she's at \u2013 she's doing awesome.\"",
      "The spacewalk is finally over. Rosemary's platform is hoisted out of the pool and the support team help her out of her suit. As her helmet is removed, we can see she's clearly very tired, but still smiling.",
      "\"It was a challenging one, it really was, and a challenging rescue,\" she tells us, \"But yeah, it was a really enjoyable day.\"",
      "Rosemary's hard work is bringing her ever closer to her dream of getting to space.",
      "\"It's amazing,\" Rosemary says, \"If I could do that for the real space station - where you can look out and see the stars and see the Earth at the same time - that would just be the cherry on top.\"",

      "I grew up in Nepal's capital watching the Himalayas. Ever since I left, I've missed sweeping, panoramic views of some of the highest mountain peaks on Earth.",
      "Each time I visit Kathmandu, I hope to catch a glimpse of the dramatic mountain range. But these days, there's usually no luck.",
      "The main culprit is severe air pollution that hangs as haze above the region.",
      "And it's happening even during the spring and autumn months, which once offered clear skies.",
      "Just last April, the international flight I was in had to circle in the sky nearly 20 times before landing in Kathmandu, because of the hazy weather impacting visibility at the airport.",
      "The hotel I checked in at was at a reasonable height from which mountains are visible on a clear day \u2013 but there was no such day during my two-week stay.",
      "Even from the major vantage point of Nagarkot, just outside Kathmandu, all that could be seen was haze, as if the mountains did not exist.",
      "\"I no longer brand the place for views of 'sunrise, sunset and Himalayas' as I did in the past,\" said Yogendra Shakya, who has been operating a hotel at Nagarkot since 1996.",
      "\"Since you can't have those things mostly now because of the haze, I have rebranded it with history and culture as there are those tourism products as well here.\"",
      "During an earlier trip a year ago, I was hopeful I would be able to see the mighty Himalayan peaks on a trek in the mesmerising Annapurna region \u2013 but had hardly any luck there either.",
      "Scientists say hazy conditions in the region are becoming increasingly intense and lasting longer, reducing visibility significantly.",
      "Haze is formed by a combination of pollutants like dust and smoke particles from fires, reducing visibility to less than 5,000m (16,400ft). It remains stagnant in the sky during the dry season - which now lasts longer due to climate change.",
      "June to September is the region's rainy season, when Monsoon clouds rather than haze keep the mountains covered and visibility low.",
      "Traditionally, March to May and October to November were the best times for business because that was when skies remained clear and visibility was best.",
      "But with rising temperatures and a lack of rain, and worsening air pollution, the spring months are now seeing thick haze with low visibility. Those conditions are beginning as early as December.",
      "'No sighting means no business'",
      "Lucky Chhetri, a pioneering female trekking guide in Nepal, said hazy conditions had led to a 40% decrease in business.",
      "\"In one case last year, we had to compensate a group of trekkers as our guides could not show them the Himalayas due to the hazy conditions,\" she added",
      "An Australian tourist who has visited Nepal more than a dozen times since 1986 described not seeing the mountains as a \"major let-down\".",
      "\"It wasn't like this 10 years ago but now the haze seems to have taken over and it is extraordinarily disappointing for visitors like me,\" said John Carrol.",
      "Krishna Acharya, the provincial chair of the Trekking Agents Association of Nepal in the western Gandaki province, says the trekking industry is in deep trouble.",
      "\"Our member trekking operators are getting depressed because no sighting of the Himalayas means no business. Many of them are even considering changing professions,\" he told the BBC.",
      "On the Indian side, near the central Himalayas, hoteliers and tour operators say haze is now denser and returns quicker than before.",
      "\"We have long dry spells and then a heavy downpour, unlike in the past. So with infrequent rain the haze persists for much longer,\" said Malika Virdi, who heads a community-run tourism business in the state of Uttarakhand.",
      "However, Ms Virdi says tourists are persistent - with many who didn't catch the mountain range returning to try their luck again.",
      "The western Himalayas in Pakistan have been relatively less affected by the haze because the mountains are relatively far from cities.",
      "But locals say that even the ranges that were once easily visible from places like Peshawar and Gilgit are often no longer seen.",
      "\"The sheet of haze remains hanging for a longer period and we don't see the mountains that we could in the past,\" said Asif Shuja, the former head of Pakistan's environmental protection agency.",
      "Hazes and dust storms increasing",
      "South Asian cities regularly top lists of places with highest levels of air pollution in the world.",
      "Public health across the region has been badly impacted by the toxic air, which frequently causes travel disruption and school closures.",
      "Vehicular and industrial emissions, dust from infrastructure construction and dry gravel roads as well as the open burning of waste are major sources of air pollution year-round.",
      "This is compounded by soot from massive forest fires - which are increasing due to a longer dry season - and the burning of crop residues after the harvest by farmers in northern India, Pakistan and Nepal.",
      "Weather conditions keeping warmer air above cooler air trap these pollutants and limit vertical air movement - preventing pollution from dispersing.",
      "\"Hazes and dust storms are increasing in South Asia, and this trend is projected to continue due to climate change and other factors,\" Dr Someshwor Das from the South Asia Meteorological Association told the BBC.",
      "In 2024, the number of hazy days recorded at the airport in Pokhara, a major tourism hub in western Nepal, was 168 - up from 23 in 2020 and 84 in 2021, according to Nepal's department of hydrology and meteorology.",
      "Experts believe the Himalayas are probably the worst affected mountain range in the world given their location in a populous and polluted region.",
      "This could mean the scintillating view of the Himalayas could now largely be limited to photographs, paintings and postcards.",

    "story": [
      "Rosemary Coogan is surrounded by a team of people pushing, pulling, squishing and squeezing her into a spacesuit.",
      "It takes about 45 minutes to get all her gear on before a helmet is carefully lowered over her head.",
      "The British astronaut is about to undergo her toughest challenge yet \u2013 assessing whether she is ready for a spacewalk. The test will take place in one of the largest pools in the world: Nasa's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.",
      "The pool \u2013 which is 12m deep (40ft) \u2013 contains a life-sized replica of the International Space Station (ISS), and a \"spacewalk\" here is as close as it gets to mimicking weightlessness on Earth.",
      "\"It's a big day,\" Rosemary says before the dive, which is going to last more than six hours. \"It's very physically intense \u2013 and it's very psychologically intense.\"",
      "But Rosemary doesn't seem too fazed. She smiles and waves as the platform she's standing on is slowly lowered into the water.",
      "Being an astronaut was Dr Rosemary Coogan's dream from a young age, she says. But it was a dream that seemed out of reach.",
      "\"At the careers day at school, you don't tend to meet astronauts,\" Rosemary says. \"You don't get to meet people who've done it, you don't really get to hear their stories.\"",
      "So she decided to study the stars instead, opting for a career in astrophysics. But when the European Space Agency (ESA) announced it was looking for new recruits to go to space, Rosemary applied and was chosen from more than 22,000 people.",
      "ESA aims to get Rosemary to the International Space Station (ISS) by 2030. She'll be following in the footsteps of Britons Helen Sharman, who visited the Soviet's Mir Space Station in 1991, and Tim Peake who launched to the ISS in 2015.",
      "Rosemary has spent the last six months training at the Johnson Space Center. As well as exploring the outside of the submerged ISS, she can head inside the orbiting lab in another life-sized mock-up located in a huge hangar.",
      "She takes us on a tour of the lab's interconnected modules. It feels very cramped, especially considering astronauts usually spend many months on board. But Rosemary reminds us about the spectacular views.",
      "\"It is an isolated environment, but I think this helps to give that kind of connection to being outside \u2013 to alleviate that sense of claustrophobia.\"",
      "Rosemary's training here covers every aspect of going to space - including learning how to use the onboard toilet.",
      "\"The lower part is where you put your solid waste,\" she says, pointing to a loo in a small cubicle that looks like something you might find at a very old campsite. \"And this funnel here is actually attached to an air suction system, and that is where you put your liquid waste.\"",
      "Female astronauts have the option of suppressing their periods using drugs, Rosemary says, but can also opt not to.",
      "\"There's essentially a filter that you put on top of the cone in which you urinate and it's to stop any particles, any blood, from going into the urine system.\"",
      "Urine needs to be kept separate because it's purified and treated to be re-used as drinking water, she explains.",
      "Back in the pool, divers are constantly adjusting Rosemary's buoyancy in the water to make the experience as close as possible to microgravity.",
      "She moves around painstakingly, making sure she's always attached to the submerged structure using two hooks.",
      "Every hand-hold is carefully chosen along the bars on the outside of each module. They're in exactly the same positions as the ones on the real thing, vital muscle memory if she gets to carry out a spacewalk 200 miles (322km) above the Earth.",
      "It's slow and difficult work, requiring plenty of upper body strength and physical effort in the hot, bulky spacesuit.",
      "\"You do a lot of mental preparation \u2013 you really think through every single movement,\" Rosemary explains. \"You have to be really efficient with your energy. You don't want to do something and realise it wasn't quite right and have to do it again.\"",
      "Rosemary is working alongside another astronaut to complete a list of space station repairs and maintenance for the test. Her every move is monitored by a team in a control room overlooking the pool. They're in constant communication with her as she works through her tasks.",
      "Former space station commander Aki Hoshide, from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, is on hand for advice. He has completed four spacewalks and says it's a steep learning curve for new astronauts.",
      "\"When we first start out, there's so much information thrown at you, so many skills that you have to learn and show and demonstrate,\" he says. \"It is baby steps, but they are moving forward \u2013 and I can see their excitement every time they come here and jump in the pool.\"",
      "Rosemary takes us to see a Saturn V \u2013 the rocket that took the Apollo astronauts to the Moon in 1969. More than 50 years on, Nasa is planning an imminent return to the lunar surface with its Artemis programme. European astronauts will join later missions. With an expected 35-year space career ahead, Rosemary may one day get the chance to become the first Briton to walk on the Moon.",
      "\"It's incredibly exciting that we, as humanity, are going back to the Moon, and of course, any way that I could be a part of that, I would be absolutely delighted. I think it's absolutely thrilling,\" she says.",
      "After six gruelling hours underwater, Rosemary is nearing the end of her spacewalk test \u2013 but then she's thrown a curve ball.",
      "In the control room, we hear her call out for a comms check with her astronaut partner who's working on another part of the space station. But she's met with silence.",
      "On a video screen, we can see he's motionless. Rosemary doesn't know it, but he's been asked to pretend to lose consciousness. Rosemary's job is to reach him, check his condition \u2013 and tow him back to the airlock.",
      "After so long under water, we can see how exhausted she is \u2013 but working slowly and steadily, she gets him safely to the airlock.",
      "\"Rosemary has the endurance of a champion. She crushed it today,\" says Jenna Hanson, one of Nasa's spacewalk instructors who's been assessing Rosemary. \"We're really happy with where she's at \u2013 she's doing awesome.\"",
      "The spacewalk is finally over. Rosemary's platform is hoisted out of the pool and the support team help her out of her suit. As her helmet is removed, we can see she's clearly very tired, but still smiling.",
      "\"It was a challenging one, it really was, and a challenging rescue,\" she tells us, \"But yeah, it was a really enjoyable day.\"",
      "Rosemary's hard work is bringing her ever closer to her dream of getting to space.",
      "\"It's amazing,\" Rosemary says, \"If I could do that for the real space station - where you can look out and see the stars and see the Earth at the same time - that would just be the cherry on top.\"",

      "Just a year after landing in 2012, its six rigid aluminium tyres were visibly ripped through with punctures and tears.",

      "Later Artemis missions plan to use a lunar rover to explore the Moon's south pole starting with Artemis V, currently scheduled for 2030.",
      "The Artemis astronauts will be driving much further than their Apollo forebears, who in six landings between 1969 and 1972 never ventured more than 25 miles (40km) across the Moon's surface.",
      "\"The target is to cover 10,000 kilometres in 10 years,\" says Sylvain Barthet, who runs Michelin's lunar airless wheel programme in the central French town of Clermont Ferrand.",
      "\"We're not talking about short, week-long durations, we're talking about decades of utilisation,\" says Dr Santo Padula, who has a PhD in materials science, and works for Nasa as an engineer at the John Glenn Research Centre in Cleveland, Ohio.",
      "One big challenge for anyone developing technology for the Moon are the huge temperature ranges.",
      "At the lunar poles temperatures can plunge lower than -230C, that's not far off absolute zero, where atoms stop moving.",
      "And that's a problem for tyres.",
      "\"Without atom motion you have a hard time having the material be able to deform and return,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The tyres need to be able to deform as they go over rocks and then ping back to their original shape.",
      "\"If we permanently deform a tyre, it doesn't roll efficiently, and we have issues with power loss,\" says Dr Padula.",
      "The new wheels will also carry much bigger loads than the lightweight rovers Apollo astronauts cruised around in.",
      "The next space missions will need to drive round \"bigger science platforms and mobile habitats that get larger and larger\", he says.",
      "And that will be an even heftier problem on Mars, where gravity is double that on the Moon.",
      "Apollo's lunar rovers used tyres made from zinc-coated piano wire in a woven mesh, with a range of around 21 miles.",
      "Since extreme temperatures and cosmic rays break down rubber or turn it to a brittle glass, metal alloys and high-performance plastic are chief contenders for airless space tyres.",
      "\"In general, metallic or carbon fibre-based materials are used for these wheels,\" says Pietro Baglion, team leader of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Rosalind Franklin Mission, which aims to send its own rover to Mars by 2028.",
      "One promising material is nitinol, an alloy of nickel and titanium.",
      "\"Fuse these and it makes a rubber-acting metal that can bend all these different ways, and it will always stretch back to its original shape, says Earl Patrick Cole, chief executive of The Smart Tire Company.",
      "He calls nitinol's flexible properties \"one of the craziest things you will ever see\".",
      "Nitinol is a potentially \"revolutionary\" material says Dr Padula, because the alloy also absorbs and releases energy as it changes states. It may even have solutions to heating and refrigeration, he says.",
      "However, Mr Barthet at Michelin thinks that a material closer to a high-performance plastic will be more suitable for tyres that need to cover long distances on the Moon.",
      "Bridgestone has meanwhile taken a bio-mimicry approach, by making a model of the footpads of camels.",
      "Camels have soft, fatty footpads that disperse their weight on to a wider surface area, keeping their feet from sinking into loose sandy soil.",
      "Inspired by that, Bridgestone is using a felt-like material for its tread, while the wheel comprises thin metal spokes that can flex.",
      "The flexing divides the lunar module's weight into a larger contact area, so it can drive without getting stuck in the fragments of rock and dust on the Moon's surface.",
      "Michelin and Bridgestone are each part of different consortiums that, along with California's Venturi Astrolab, are presenting their proposed tyre tech to Nasa at the John Glenn Centre this month (May).",

    "summary": "Investigators say 80mph winds \"violently\" knocked over the vessel, causing it to flood within seconds.",
    "story": [
      "The owner and crew of a luxury superyacht that sank off the coast of Sicily, killing tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch and six others, were unaware wind speeds of over 73mph could tip it over, according to an interim report.",
      "Modelling commissioned after the disaster indicates gusts of that speed hitting the side of the Bayesian, when it had its sails down and centreboard up, would \"likely result\" in its capsize.",
      "The UK's Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB), leading the international investigation, said winds of over 80mph \"violently\" hit the vessel, causing it to flood within seconds.",
      "It sank near the town Porticello on 19 August last year during freak weather, with reports of water spouts.",
      "Seven of the 22 people onboard were killed, including Mr Lynch, 59, and his 18-year-old daughter Hannah.",
      "Investigators say the yacht was knocked to a 90-degree angle within 15 seconds at 04:06 am local time, causing people, furniture and loose items to fall across the deck.",
      "\"There was no indication of flooding inside Bayesian until water came in over the starboard rails and, within seconds, entered the internal spaces down the stairwells,\" the report says.",
      "The MAIB's chief inspector of marine accidents Andrew Moll said the situation was \"irrecoverable\" once the yacht tilted beyond 70 degrees.",
      "The yacht had its sails down and centreboard up when it sank.",
      "The MAIB commissioned modelling from the University of Southampton to examine the stability of the yacht in these conditions.",
      "It indicated that - if the wind was blowing directly across the beam, or side, of the boat - wind speeds in excess of 73mph were sufficient to tip the boat over and \"it is possible\" the yacht was similarly vulnerable to lower wind speeds, the MAIB said.",
      "But this information was not included in the onboard stability information book and \"consequently, these vulnerabilities were also unknown to either the owner or the crew of Bayesian\", the report found.",
      "The MAIB is investigating the incident as the Bayesian was registered in the UK. No date has been set for when its final report will be published.",
      "It said its report was based on \"a limited amount of verified evidence\" as a criminal investigation by Italian authorities has restricted access to the wreck.",
      "An operation to raise the 56-metre vessel from the seabed was paused over the weekend after a diver died while working on the wreck. Work was set to resume on Thursday.",
      "The report lays out more detail as to how the sinking unfolded.",
      "Investigators say the yacht sailed to the site where it sank on the previous day, in order to \"shelter\" from forecast thunderstorms. The sails were furled at the time.",
      "Wind speed was \"no more than eight knots (9mph)\" at 03:00 - about an hour before the incident. Some 55 minutes later it had increased to 30 knots (34.5mph), and it had accelerated to 70 knots (80.6mph) by 04:06 when the yacht capsized.",
      "As the storm intensified, several crew members were working in response to the conditions. The deck hand went onto the deck to close the yacht's windows.",
      "Five people were injured \"either by falling or from things falling on them\" and the deck hand was \"thrown into the sea\", the report says.",
      "Two of the yacht's guests used furniture drawers \"as an improvised ladder\" to escape their cabin, it adds.",
      "Dr Simon Boxall, Oceanographer at the University of Southampton, said the Bayesian was in \"the wrong place at the wrong time\".",
      "\"The priorities for the crew would have been to shut the hatches and the doors, which they did,\" he told the BBC.",
      "This means speculation about water flooding in because everything was open is \"obviously not the case\".",
      "\"The next priority\u00a0would have been to start the engines - so they would have some manoeuvrability to position themselves within a storm - and to then lift anchor, which the crew did, but this takes time,\" he added.",
      "\"It's not like a car where you jump in and turn the key. It would take 5 or 10 minutes before you can start the engines with a vessel of this size.\"",
      "Survivors escaped on the Bayesian's life raft and were rescued by a small boat dispatched from another nearby yacht, the report says.",
      "Mike Lynch was a prominent figure in the UK tech industry, where his backing of successful companies led to him being dubbed the British equivalent of Microsoft founder Bill Gates.",
      "But the latter years of his life were consumed by a long-running legal dispute which resulted in him being controversially extradited to the US.",

    "story": [
      "Paramilitary fighters appear to have opened a new phase in Sudan's civil war after being driven from the capital, in a move which some experts have described as a \"shock and awe campaign\".",
      "Just weeks after the army celebrated the recapture of Khartoum, its foe the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) launched a series of unprecedented drone strikes on Port Sudan in the east of the country.",
      "The attacks have led to worsening power blackouts, as well as city residents facing water shortages.",
      "\"It's a level of power projection within this region that we haven't seen yet,\" says Alan Boswell, the Horn of Africa expert for the International Crisis Group.",
      "\"I think it raises the stakes quite a bit,\" he added.",
      "The barrage of attacks on the war-time capital and humanitarian hub signals that the RSF is determined and able to carry on the fight despite significant territorial losses.",
      "And it has showcased the growth of advanced drone warfare in Africa.",
      "Drones have played an increasing role in the conflict, which has entered its third year.",
      "The war began as a power struggle between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the RSF and has drawn in other Sudanese armed groups and foreign backers, plunging the country into what the UN calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis.",
      "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) helped the army advance earlier this year. And the RSF escalated its own use of drones as it was pushed out of central Sudan, especially Khartoum, back towards its traditional stronghold in the west of the country.",
      "In recent months the paramilitaries had stepped up drone strikes on critical civilian infrastructure in army-controlled areas. That continued on Wednesday night with attacks on three power stations in the city of Omdurman, which lies across the Nile River from Khartoum. The damage has caused widespread electricity outages in the capital region.",
      "But it was the RSF's sustained strikes on Port Sudan, until now seen as a safe haven home to government officials, diplomats and humanitarian organisations, that underlined a shift in strategy to a greater emphasis on remote warfare, and aimed to demonstrate strength.",
      "\"The RSF is trying to show that they don't need to reach Port Sudan by land in order to be able to have an impact there,\" says Sudanese political analyst Kholood Khair.",
      "The group is trying to achieve a \"narrative shift\" away from \"the triumphant SAF that took over Khartoum,\" she says.",
      "\"It is saying to the Sudanese Armed Forces: 'You can take Khartoum back, but you'll never be able to govern it. You can have Port Sudan, but you won't be able to govern it, because we will cause a security crisis for you so large that it will be ungovernable'... They want to unequivocally show that the war is not over until they say so.\"",
      "The paramilitary group has not directly addressed the Port Sudan drone attacks. Rather, it has repeated its assertion that the SAF is supported by Iran and accused the armed forces of targeting civilian infrastructure and state institutions, calling the military strikes on Khartoum and RSF-held areas in the west and south of the country war crimes.",
      "Both sides stand accused of war crimes which they have denied, but the RSF has been singled out over allegations of mass rape and genocide.",
      "The change in its tactics may have been triggered by battlefield necessity, but is possible because of technological advancement.",
      "The RSF had previously used what are known as suicide or loitering drones, small UAVs with explosive payloads that are designed to crash into targets and can carry out coordinated attacks.",
      "It seems to have deployed this method in Port Sudan, with the commander of the Red Sea Military Zone Mahjoub Bushra describing a swarm of 11 Kamikaze drones in the first strike on a military airbase.",
      "He said the army shot them down, but they turned out to be a tactical distraction to divert attention from a single strategic drone that successfully struck the base.",
      "The make of this drone is not clear. But satellite images reported by Yale researchers and the Reuters news agency have shown advanced UAVs at an airport in South Darfur since the beginning of the year.",
      "The defence intelligence company Janes has determined them to most likely be sophisticated Chinese manufactured CH-95s, capable of long-range strikes.",
      "Jeremy Binnie, an Africa and Middle East analyst at Jane's, told the BBC that photos of what appear to be the remnants of the smaller kamikaze drones suggest they are probably a different version than the RSF had used before, and might be better at penetrating air defences because of their shape.",
      "One regional observer suggested the RSF had been able to breach the SAF's anti-drone technology with signal jammers attached to the drones, but cautioned this was still unproven.",
      "The South Darfur airport in Nyala, the presumptive capital and military base of the Rapid Support Forces, has been repeatedly bombed by the SAF, which destroyed an aircraft there earlier this month.",

      "\"This is a war of technology,\" says Justin Lynch, managing director at Conflict Insights Group, a data analytics and research organisation.",
      "\"That's why the foreign supporters are so important, because it's not like the RSF is making the weapons themselves. They're being given this stuff.\"",
      "The army has accused the United Arab Emirates (UAE) of supplying the paramilitary fighters with the drones, and cut diplomatic ties with Abu Dhabi because of the attacks.",
      "The UAE has strongly rejected the charges. It has long denied reports from UN experts, US politicians and international organisations that it is providing weaponry to the RSF.",
      "But Mr Lynch says the evidence is overwhelming.",

      "He told the BBC it would be surprising if the Emiratis were not helping deliver the drones used in the Port Sudan attacks.",
      "He also determined with similar near-certainty that the Iranians were supplying weapons to the SAF, and he helped authenticate documents provided to the Washington Post that detail the sale of drones and warheads to the army by a Turkish defence firm.",
      "Iran has not responded to the allegations. Turkish officials have denied involvement.",
      "The increasing use of drones by both sides may be redefining the war, but it is the ability of the RSF to strike strategic targets hundreds of kilometres from its positions that has rattled the region.",
      "Over a week of daily attacks on Port Sudan, the paramilitaries hit the country's only working international airport, a power station, several fuel depots, and the air base, apparently trying to disrupt the army's supply lines.",
      "The city is also the main entry port for relief supplies and the UN has warned that this \"major escalation\" could further complicate aid operations in the country and lead to large-scale civilian casualties.",
      "\"This was such a shock and awe campaign that it has not only stunned SAF, I think it's also stunned Egypt, Saudi Arabia, others who were behind SAF, and remakes the entire war,\" says Mr Boswell, adding that it closing the gap in air power between the RSF and the army.",
      "\"The RSF is widely viewed as a non-state actor,\" he says \"and normally, groups like that can muster quite a bit of an insurgent force. But the government with the air force is the one that always has the aerial capacity, and this just turns all those old adages on its head.\"",
      "The development has triggered comparisons to the long-range drone warfare between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "\"These weapons have more precision, you don't need a manned aircraft any more, and they are much more affordable than operating sophisticated jets,\" says Mr Binnie.",
      "\"This is part of a broader trend in technological proliferation where you can see what used to be really high-end capabilities being used in a civil war in sub-Saharan Africa.\"",

      "In his eagerness to accept a plane from Qatar, Donald Trump has achieved a remarkable feat, uniting many partisans across America's bitter political divide.",
      "The problem for the White House is that unity is happening in opposition to it.",
      "Predictably, Trump's opponents in the Democratic Party slammed the president after he indicated he would accept a luxury jet from the Qatari royal family.",
      "More noteworthy \u2013 and potentially more troubling for the president \u2013 is that some of his strongest supporters also have serious reservations about the deal, even as it's yet to be finalised.",
      "Maga influencers have described the move as a \"bribe\", grift, or an example of the high-level corruption that Trump himself has consistently promised to root out.",
      "The Qatari royal family plans to give the luxury Boeing 747-8, estimated to be worth $400m (\u00a3300m), to the US Department of Defence to be used as part of a fleet of planes dubbed Air Force One \u2013 the president's official mode of air travel.",
      "The current fleet includes two 747-200 jets which have been in use since 1990, along with several smaller and somewhat secretive 757s.",
      "The White House says that the new plane \u2013 which could require years and millions of dollars to refit and upgrade \u2013 will be transferred to Trump's presidential library at the end of his term.",
      "After the news broke on Sunday, the backlash was fierce and immediate.",
      "\"I think the technical term is 'skeezy',\" deadpanned conservative Daily Wire commentator Ben Shapiro on his podcast.",
      "\"Qatar is not allegedly giving President Trump a $400m jet out of the goodness of their sweet little hearts,\" he said. \"They try to stuff money into pockets in totally bipartisan fashion.\"",
      "He and others pointed to allegations that Qatar has funnelled money into terrorist groups \u2013 allegations the country has denied \u2013 and called Qataris \"the world's largest proponents of terrorism on an international scale.\"",
      "Laura Loomer, the conspiracy-spreading social media influencer who agitates for sackings of top White House officials deemed insufficiently loyal, interrupted her steady stream of pro-Trump messaging to criticise the move.",
      "Although she said she still supports the president, she called the plane deal \"a stain\" and posted a cartoon of the Trojan Horse, redrawn as a plane and filled with armed Islamist militants.",
      "Trump found little support for the plan in more mainstream outlets as well.",
      "The New York Post, which usually can be counted on to back much of the populist Maga agenda, ran a blunt editorial: \"Qatar's 'Palace in the Sky' jet is NOT a 'free gift' - and Trump shouldn't accept it as one.\"",
      "And Mark Levin, a consistent cheerleader of the president on Fox News and his radio talk show, posted on X accusing Qatar of being a \"terror state\" and wrote: \"Their jet and all the other things they are buying in our country does not provide them with the cover they seek\".",
      "During his first term, Trump himself accused Qatar of funding terror groups.",
      "When contacted by the BBC, the Qatari embassy in Washington pointed to an interview Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani gave CNN about the plane.",
      "\"It is a government-to-government transaction. It has nothing to do with personal relationships - neither on the US side, nor the Qatari side. It's between the two defence ministries,\" he said.",
      "\"Why would we buy influence in the United States?\" he added, arguing Qatar has \"always been a reliable and trusted partner. This is not a one-way relationship.\"",
      "Is Trump allowed to accept a $400m luxury plane as a gift?",
      "Is Trump allowed to accept a $400m luxury plane as a gift?",
      "In response to criticism of the deal, the White House has doubled down. Trump's press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that the administration was \"committed to full transparency\".",
      "\"Any gift given by a foreign government is always accepted in full compliance with all applicable laws,\" she said.",
      "Although there has been nothing offered in exchange for the plane, many commentators said it would be na\u00efve to expect that that Qatari royal family would hand out such a large item with no strings attached.",
      "\"They very obviously see that if you reward Donald Trump with gifts, that may pay off down the road,\" Doug Heye, a political strategist and former communications director for the Republican National Committee, told the BBC. \"Flattery gets you somewhere with Donald Trump, and we've seen that time and time again.\"",
      "The US Constitution includes a clause preventing officials from accepting \"any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.\"",
      "But the White House has pointed out that, at least to begin with, the plane is being gifted to the US government.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi reportedly investigated the legality of the deal and determined that because there are no explicit conditions attached, it would not amount to a bribe.",
      "Conservatives and others were quick to point out that Bondi was registered as a lobbyist for Qatar prior to joining Trump's cabinet, at some points earning up to $115,0000 (\u00a387,000) a month from her work for the Qatari government.",
      "The Trump Organisation also continues to maintain links to Qatar and last month announced a deal to build a luxury golf resort in the country.",
      "During a news conference at the White House on Tuesday the president berated a reporter who raised questions about the ethics of the transaction.",
      "\"What do you say to people who view that luxury jet as a personal gift to you?\" asked ABC reporter Rachel Scott.",
      "\"You should be embarrassed asking that question,\" Trump replied, after using his standard \"fake news\" jibe.",
      "\"They're giving us a free jet,\" the president said. \"I could say 'No, no, no, don't give us, I want to pay you a billion or 400 million'\u2026 or I could say 'thank you very much'.\"",
      "On Truth Social, the president later reposted several messages pointing out that the Statue of Liberty was a gift from France, and wrote late Tuesday: \"The Boeing 747 is being given to the United States Air Force/Department of Defense, NOT TO ME!\"",
      "\"Only a FOOL would not accept this gift on behalf of our Country,\" he wrote.",
      "However even some within Trump's Republican Party were expressing concern.",
      "\"I think it's not worth the appearance of impropriety, whether it's improper or not,\" Rand Paul, Republican senator from Kentucky, told Fox News.",
      "\"I wonder if our ability to judge [Qatar's] human rights record will be clouded by the fact of this large gift,\" Paul said.",
      "Another Republican senator, Ted Cruz of Texas, said accepting the gift would pose \"significant espionage and surveillance problems\".",
      "Trump did find some support within his party. \"Free is good. You know, we don't have a lot of money right now to buy things like that,\" Sen Tommy Tuberville told CNN.",
      "Doug Heye, the Republican strategist, suggested that the deal might not hurt Trump's popularity with his base in the long term.",
      "\"Trump has been able for years now to turn scandals that would otherwise be debilitating for other politicians into things that we forget,\" he said. \"He's very skilled at that.\"",

    "summary": "Israel alleges several buildings are being used by Hamas. Local authorities and aid agencies say thousands of civilians are sheltering there.",
    "story": [
      "Israel has issued one of the most sweeping evacuation orders for civilians in Gaza yet seen in this war.",
      "Large swathes of Gaza City, an area already partially destroyed by bombing, have been declared unsafe, the residents taking shelter there told to leave for their own safety ahead of \"intense strikes\" by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).",
      "Among the buildings highlighted by Israel are the Islamic University, Al-Shifa Hospital and three former schools.",
      "While Israel alleges that the buildings are being used by Hamas as \"command and control centres\", local authorities and aid agencies say there are thousands of civilians sheltering there.",
      "Evacuating these areas would require time, they say, and there could be huge numbers of casualties.",
      "It's an ominous sign of Israel's threat to significantly expand its military campaign in Gaza.",
      "The former Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, has been one of very few senior Israelis so far to speak out against expanding the military campaign in Gaza.",
      "In an interview with the BBC, Olmert said: \"Most Israelis are against what is happening, large numbers of the [army's] commanders are against expanding the military operation and want to end the war right now.\"",
      "Olmert is a frequent and increasingly vocal critic of Israel's current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and his views reflect growing concern about the impact of the 20-month-long war on the country's morale, economy and international standing.",
      "Olmert was also outspoken on the humanitarian impact of the war on the residents of Gaza.",
      "\"It's totally intolerable, unacceptable and unforgivable, it needs to be stopped right away,\" said the former top official, who has been accused by pro-government outlets of \"lobbying for Palestinians\".",
      "He added: \"We have to provide all of the humanitarian needs of the population. We can't allow morally the beginning of famine in Gaza. That has to stop.\"",
      "Such opinions are rarely reflected in the Israeli media or in public opinion polls but they've been urgently repeated in passionate speeches in recent days by UN organisations, aid agencies and by some of Israel's allies abroad \u2013 French President Emmanuel Macron called Israel's actions in Gaza \"shameful\". Netanyahu accused him of \"standing with Hamas\".",
      "There's growing evidence of profound suffering across Gaza after a 10-week blockade, during which Israel has prevented the entry of any food, medicines or fuel into the Palestinian enclave.",
      "A UN-backed assessment has said that Gaza's population of around 2.1 million Palestinians is at \"critical risk\" of famine and faces \"extreme levels of food insecurity\". The World Health Organisation says without enough nutritious food, clean water and access to health care, an entire generation will be permanently affected.",
      "Israeli government spokesman David Mencer insisted to the BBC that \"Israel is certainly not starving Gaza\".",
      "\"I don't dispute that there is hunger in Gaza, but we believe that it is hunger caused by Hamas. There is food in Gaza, that's our information. There is no famine,\" he said.",
      "Israel also resumed its aerial bombardment of Gaza on 18 March and its attacks have killed 2,799 since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, including 80 people on Wednesday.",
      "There are faint hopes that an updated US-sponsored ceasefire proposal could still be accepted by Israel and Hamas. It reportedly would see the release of some remaining hostages in exchange for an unspecified period of calm.",
      "However Netanyahu has said Israel will expand its military offensive in Gaza and that nothing will stop the war. Hamas meanwhile has refused to release the remaining hostages unless Israel agrees to a permanent ceasefire and withdraws from Gaza.",
      "On Wednesday evening 67 former hostages signed a letter urging Netanyahu to reach a \"comprehensive deal\" for the return of all captives still being held by Hamas.",
      "\"The majority of Israeli society wants the hostages home - even at the cost of halting military operations,\" the letter said.",
      "The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said the letter was written to build on the \"historic momentum\" after Edan Alexander's release. Hamas said it freed the 21-year-old as a goodwill gesture to Donald Trump, who is visiting the region.",
      "The ex-hostages' letter appealed to Trump not to \"let this historic momentum stop\".",
      "A poll for Israel's Channel 12 at the end of April suggested that 68% of respondents supported signing a hostage deal with Hamas even if it meant ending the war, while just 22% supported continued fighting in Gaza.",
      "So far Netanyahu remains unmoved.",
      "\"Despite American determination, there is no change in the PM's position - we will not allow an end to the war,\" an official in Mr Netanyahu's entourage said, according to diplomatic sources.",
      "Israel launched a military campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",

      "The European Commission was wrong to refuse to release text messages sent by Ursula von der Leyen to the head of Pfizer during negotiations to secure Covid-19 vaccines, the EU's top court has ruled.",
      "The General Court said the commission had not given a plausible explanation as to why the exchanges between its president and Pfizer's Albert Bourla could not be made public when an investigative journalist requested them in 2021.",
      "That year, Pfizer signed billions of euros in vaccine contracts with the EU, including a deal for 1.8bn extra doses.",

      "At least one Russian soldier is injured, possibly dead after the strike.",
      "It's chilling to watch the live footage. It drives home the bloody consequences of the war that Russia started, in which hundreds of thousands have so far been killed, a \"never-ending bloodbath\" as US President Donald Trump calls it.",
      "We are in a rural house converted into a command centre for the 155th mechanised brigade of the Ukrainian army. It's a few miles from front-line artillery positions.",
      "The scale of the devastation that we see on the screens, homes and buildings completely flattened, is far greater than what we saw six months ago.",
      "It is evidence of the fierce battle that has been fought over the past several months to defend Pokrovsk, a crucial transport hub in the Donetsk region.",
      "This week, there's cautious optimism, even among sceptical soldiers who have witnessed hopes of a ceasefire being dashed over and over again, as diplomatic efforts from the US, Europe, Turkey and others have pushed Russia and Ukraine to direct talks for the first time in three years.",
      "\"I think something should happen since Russia was the first one to push for these talks. I mean since 2022, they have refused to go into any contact,\" says an officer who wants to be referred to with his call sign \"Kozak\".",
      "\"I want to believe this would be the beginning of the end of the war.",
      "\"But now I see, we have been successful in destroying their rear positions and their supply lines. Russia does not have the same strength and power it had at the beginning. So I think that something will happen.\"",
      "Yurii, 37, used to work in a technology company before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. \"They (Russia and Ukraine) have to start talking. Us soldiers, we wish this war would end. But it's important to remember that we cannot stop it because we did not start it,\" he says.",
      "He looks up at the screen and spots Russian soldiers moving again. He and his colleagues calculate the co-ordinates of their positions and pass them on to their artillery unit.",
      "We drive from the command centre to the artillery position, on mud tracks running through a wide expanse of open fields. Clumps of mud fly in the air, our car slips and slides, as we move as fast as possible. The speed is a mitigation against strikes from drones, which have sharply increased fatalities for both Russia and Ukraine since they were deployed in large numbers in 2023.",
      "And war technology keeps evolving. Now there's a new threat \u2013 drones equipped with a real fibre optic cable which unrolls as they fly. \"We cannot detect them or neutralise them, so there are probably a lot more drones in the area right now than we know,\" says Yurii.",
      "As we drive into the artillery position hidden under trees and bushes, soldiers are already loading the gun. It's a French made self-propelled artillery gun called the \"Caesar\". Scores have been deployed in Ukraine since the start of the war, and France has been trying to ramp up production.",
      "\"I'm very impressed by its accuracy, and we can use a large range of ammunition. The most important thing is that bringing it into combat is very fast. It is much more effective than the old Soviet equipment I've used,\" says Kozak.",
      "Ukrainian soldiers fire four rounds, each one emitting a deafening sound. From around us, we also hear the sound of incoming shells. The battle rages on.",
      "\"As you can hear, there is a wave of assaults from the enemy and we need a lot of ammunition to suppress that. We hope our international partners can give us as much ammunition as possible, because if we have to start choosing priority and non-priority targets then the enemy will be successful,\" says Kozak.",
      "We ask the soldiers how they feel about suggestions that Ukraine will have to make concessions, that it might have to give up land to secure peace.",
      "\"It's painful to hear that. Even I want to go home to my family. My daughter is eight and I miss her so much. But we need to be strong. I don't believe that if we give up some territory, they will stop. In a couple of years, they will return and start over,\" says Yurii.",
      "\"A person who has not come here, who hasn't felt the consequences of Russian aggression, those armchair commentators say you can give up land and everything will be over. They will never understand how many brothers and friends we have lost. We shouldn't give up a single metre of our land,\" says Kozak.",
      "The cost Ukraine has paid to defend its land is visible everywhere, most acutely in the photos of smiling, young soldiers posted by the side of highways, on memorial walls in central city squares, and on rows and rows of freshly dug graves in the country.",
      "Yana Melnikova lovingly buys her son's favourite treats - a cup of steaming hot chocolate and a chocolate roll.",

      "The Israeli government suspended food and medicine deliveries into Gaza in March.",

      "The UN has said the blockade has caused severe shortages of food, medicines and fuel, and an assessment on Monday warned that Gaza's population of around 2.1 million people was at \"critical risk\" of famine.",
      "The US confirmed last week that it was preparing a new system for providing aid from a series of hubs inside Gaza, which would be run by private companies and protected by security contractors and Israeli forces.",
      "Images analysed by BBC Verify show that land has already been cleared, with new roads and staging areas constructed at a number of locations in southern and central Gaza in recent weeks.",
      "Israel has not publicly said where the hubs will be, but humanitarian sources - briefed previously by Israeli officials - told BBC Verify that at least four centres will be built in the southern section of Gaza and one further north near the Netzarim Corridor, a strip of land controlled by the military that effectively divides the territory.",
      "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation - an organisation set up to support the plan - initially said food, water and hygiene kits would be supplied to 1.2 million people, less than 60% of the population.",
      "On Wednesday it announced it would start operations before the end of May, and appeared to call for Israel to allow aid through normal channels until its distribution centres were fully operational. It also called for aid hubs to be built in northern Gaza, something not envisaged under the original plan and which had led to criticism that people would be forced to move south.",
      "UN agencies have insisted they will not co-operate with the plan - which is in line with one previously approved by Israel's government - saying it contradicted fundamental humanitarian principles.",
      "A spokesperson for the UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) accused Israel of seeking to use \"food and fuel as leverage, as part of a military strategy\".",
      "\"All aid would be channelled through a handful of militarised hubs,\" Olga Cherevko told BBC Verify.",
      "\"That kind of arrangement would cut off vast areas of Gaza \u2013 particularly the most vulnerable, who can't move easily, or are otherwise marginalised \u2013 from any help at all.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Bushra Khalidi of Oxfam described the new plan as a \"farce\".",

      "A photo taken on site, geolocated by BBC Verify, also shows lighting being installed on the perimeter.",
      "Further imagery from 11 and 12 May shows this, along with three other sites, continuing to expand. One site is about half a kilometre from a collection of eight UN warehouses, and 280m from another large warehouse.",
      "Stu Ray - a senior imagery analyst with McKenzie Intelligence - agreed the sites were likely to be secure distribution centres. He noted that some of the facilities are in \"close proximity to IDF Forward Operating Bases which ties in with the IDF wishing to have some control over the sites\".",
      "Analysts with another intelligence firm, Maiar, said the facilities appeared to be designed with separate entrances for trucks to move in and out, and with other gaps in the berms that would be suitable for pedestrian entrances.",
      "The IDF did not comment on the potential aid centres when approached by BBC Verify, but said that its operations in Gaza were carried out \"in accordance with international law\".  Cogat - the Israeli body responsible for managing crossings into Gaza - did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3v5r1erdpgo",
    "published": "Wed, 14 May 2025 23:48:46 GMT",
    "summary": "As one of 25 member groups on the IMF board, India's influence at the fund is limited, say experts.",
    "story": [
      "Last week the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a $1bn (\u00a3756m) bailout to Pakistan \u2013 a move that drew sharp disapproval from India as military hostilities between the nuclear-armed neighbours flared, before a US-led ceasefire was unexpectedly declared.",
      "Despite India's protests, the IMF board approved the second instalment of a $7bn loan, saying Islamabad had demonstrated strong programme implementation leading to a continuing economic recovery in Pakistan.",
      "It also said the fund would continue to support Pakistan's efforts in building economic resilience to \"climate vulnerabilities and natural disasters\", providing further access of around $1.4bn in funding in the future.",
      "In a strongly worded statement India raised concerns over the decision, citing two reasons.",
      "Delhi questioned the \"efficacy\" of such bailouts or the lack thereof, given Pakistan's \"poor track record\" in implementing reform measures. But more importantly it flagged the possibility of these funds being used for \"state-sponsored cross-border terrorism\" \u2013 a charge Islamabad has repeatedly denied - and said the IMF was exposing itself and its donors to \"reputational risks\" and making a \"mockery of global values\".",
      "The IMF did not respond to the BBC's request for a comment on the Indian stance.",
      "Even Pakistani experts argue that there's some merit to Delhi's first argument. Pakistan has been prone to persistently seeking the IMF's help \u2013 getting bailed out 24 times since 1958 \u2013 without undertaking meaningful reforms to improve public governance.",
      "\"Going to the IMF is like going to the ICU [intensive care unit]. If a patient goes 24 or 25 times to the ICU then there are structural challenges and concerns that need to be dealt with,\" Hussain Haqqani, former Pakistani ambassador to the US, told the BBC.",
      "But addressing Delhi's other concerns \u2013 that the IMF was \"rewarding continued sponsorship of cross-border terrorism\" thereby sending a \"dangerous message to the global community\" \u2013 is far more complex, and perhaps explains why India wasn't able to exert pressure to stall the bailout.",
      "India's decision to try to prevent the next tranche of the bailout to Islamabad was more about optics then, rather than a desire for any tangible outcome, say experts. As per the country's own observations, the fund had limited ability to do something about the loan, and was \"circumscribed by procedural and technical formalities\".",
      "As one of the 25 members of the IMF board, India's influence at the fund is limited. It represents a four-country group including Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Bhutan. Pakistan is part of the Central Asia group, represented by Iran.",
      "Unlike the United Nations' one-country-one-vote system, the voting rights of IMF board members are based on a country's economic size and its contributions \u2013 a system which has increasingly faced criticism for favouring richer Western countries over developing economies.",
      "For example, the US has the biggest voting share - at 16.49% - while India holds just 2.6%. Besides, IMF rules do not allow for a vote against a proposal - board members can either vote in favour or abstain \u2013 and the decisions are made by consensus on the board.",
      "\"This shows how vested interests of powerful countries can influence decisions,\" an economist who didn't want to speak on the record told the BBC.",
      "Addressing this imbalance was a key proposal in the reforms mooted for the IMF and other multilateral lenders during India's G20 presidency in 2023.",
      "In their report, former Indian bureaucrat NK Singh and former US treasury secretary Lawrence Summers recommended breaking the link between IMF voting rights and financial contributions to ensure fairer representation for both the \"Global North\" and the \"Global South\". But there has been no progress so far on implementing these recommendations.",
      "Furthermore, recent changes in the IMF's own rules about funding countries in conflict add more complexity to the issue. A $15.6bn loan by the fund to Ukraine in 2023 was the first of its kind by the IMF to a country at war.",
      "\"It bent its own rules to give an enormous lending package to Ukraine - which means it cannot use that excuse to shut down an already-arranged loan to Pakistan,\" Mihir Sharma of the Observer Research Foundation (ORF) think tank in Delhi told the BBC.",
      "If India really wants to address its grievances,  the right forum to present them would be the United Nations FATF (Financial Action Task Force), says Mr Haqqani.",
      "The FATF looks at issues of combating terror finance and decides whether countries need to be placed on grey or black lists that prevent them from accessing funds from bodies like the IMF or the World Bank.",
      "\"Grandstanding at the IMF cannot and did not work,\" said Mr Haqqani. \"If a country is on that [FATF] list it will then face challenges in getting a loan from the IMF \u2013 as has happened with Pakistan earlier.\"",
      "As things stand though, Pakistan was officially removed from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list in 2022.",
      "Separately, experts also caution that India's calls to overhaul the IMF's funding processes and veto powers could be a double-edged sword.",
      "Such reforms \"would inevitably give Beijing [rather than Delhi] more power\", said Mr Sharma.",
      "Mr Haqqani agrees. India should be wary of using \"bilateral disputes at multilateral fora\", he said, adding that India has historically been at the receiving end of being vetoed out by China in such places.",
      "He points to instances of Beijing blocking ADB (Asian Development Bank) loans sought by India for the north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, citing border disputes between the two countries in the region.",

      "\"Promoting South Africa is something I am passionate about - I have no intention of taking up [US President Donald Trump's] offer because South Africa is my home,\" the proud Afrikaner tells the BBC, days after a small group of his fellow white compatriots left South Africa for their new life as refugees in the US.",
      "The US president, and his South-Africa born ally Elon Musk, says that white Afrikaners are being persecuted in their home country, and that they are being subjected to a \"genocide\".",
      "This is a claim that has been circulating for many years even though it has been widely discredited.",
      "Although some white farmers have been attacked and killed, South Africa has one of the world's highest murder rates, so this is an issue that affects all of its citizens, whatever their race.",

      "Four centuries after the first group of Dutch settlers arrived in what is now South Africa, most Afrikaners regard themselves as fully African \u2013 as seen in the name \u2013 and no longer identify with their European roots.",
      "But many are unhappy both with the high crime rate and the government's policies aimed at reducing economic inequality in the country \u2013 especially a law passed earlier this year that allowed the government to seize land without compensation \"when it is just and equitable and in the public interest\". White South Africans are 7% of the country's population, but own half of its farmland.",
      "Some Afrikaners are farmers and see the law as being aimed at them.",
      "Trump said the legislation prompted him to offer to help resettle \"Afrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored race-based discrimination\".",

      "But despite numerous claims in the past of the systematic targeting of the country's white Afrikaner minority group, local crime statistics figures paint a different picture.",
      "South Africa does not release crime figures based on race but the latest figures revealed that 6,953 people were murdered in the country between October and December 2024. Of these, 12 were killed in farm attacks. Of the 12, one was a farmer, while five were farm dwellers and four were employees, who are likely to have been black.",
      "On Monday, the first group of 59 Afrikaners granted refugee status arrived at the Dulles airport near Washington DC after choosing to leave their home country.",
      "The arrival of the group drew dismay and outrage across South Africa, as the country's civil society and leadership sought to dispel the claims that the white minority was being persecuted.",
      "\"They are leaving because they don't want to embrace the changes that are taking place in our country and our constitution,\" said South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.",
      "He later labelled their move a \"cowardly act\" as he addressed farmers at a convention held in the Free State province.",
      "The president's sentiments were echoed by many South Africans, including Mr Janse van Vuuren, who is proud of his Afrikaner origins.",
      "While he was not raised in a farming family, he has relatives and friends in agriculture who have been victims of crime.",
      "He said that while it was undeniable that some farmers faced \"genuine threats and hardships\", it was important to be cautious \"when discussing claims of persecution or discrimination that portray an entire group as victims of targeted violence or systemic oppression\".",

      "The people who invaded destroyed critical infrastructure, making it impossible to sell, she said.",
      "Despite efforts to have them removed through the courts, Ms Steenkamp said they were forced to abandon the land as it was repossessed by the bank.",
      "Ms Steenkamp said that while she and her family were familiar with South Africa's high crime levels and often tried to \"not let it get us under\", this latest attack \"was the straw that broke the camel's back\".",
      "Even though her family were eager to embrace Trump's offer when it was first announced, the mother-of-three told the BBC that the decision to leave \"was very difficult because you're... leaving a whole way of life\".",
      "Asked whether it was unfair that Afrikaners were being granted refugee status at a time when the US was cracking down on refugees and asylum seekers from everywhere else in the world, Ms Steenkamp said she \"completely disagreed\".",
      "She pointed to assaults on farmers, saying there was a \"hatred that seems to go with these attacks\".",

      "Thirty-five seconds to make sure the props are in place and tightly secured.",
      "While you're at home watching the introductory videos known as postcards, dozens of people swarm the stage, setting the scene for whatever comes next.",
      "\"We call it the Formula 1 tyre change,\" says Richard van Rouwendaal, the affable  Dutch stage manager who makes it all work.",
      "\"Each person in the crew can only do one thing. You run on stage with one light bulb or one prop. You always walk on the same line. If you go off course, you will hit somebody.",
      "\"It's a bit like ice skating.\"",
      "The stage crew start rehearsing their \"F1 tyre change\" weeks before the contestants even arrive.",
      "Every country sends detailed plans of their staging, and Eurovision hires stand-ins to play the acts (in Liverpool 2023, it was pupils from the local performing arts school), while stagehands start shaving precious seconds off the changeovers.",
      "\"We have about two weeks,\" says Van Rouwendaal, who's normally based in Utrecht but is in Basel for this year's contest.",
      "\"My company is around 13 Dutchies and 30 local guys and girls, who rock it in Switzerland.",
      "\"In those two weeks, I have to figure out who's right for each job. Someone's good at running, someone's good at lifting, someone's good at organising the backstage area. It is a bit like being good at Tetris because you have to line everything up in a small space, in the perfect way.\"",
      "As soon as a song finishes, the team are ready to roll.",
      "As well as the stagehands, there are people responsible for positioning lights and setting pyrotechnics; and 10 cleaners who sweep the stage with mops and vacuum cleaners between every performance.",
      "\"My cleaners are just as important as the stage crew. You need a clean stage for the dancers  - but also, if there's an overhead shot of somebody lying down, you don't want to see shoeprints on the floor.\"",
      "The attention to detail is clinical. Backstage, every performer has their own microphone stand, set to the correct height and angle, to make sure every  performance is camera perfect.",
      "\"Sometimes the delegation will say the artist wants to wear a different shoe for the grand final,\" says Van Rouwendaal. \"But if that happens, the mic stand is at the wrong height, so we've got a problem!\"",
      "Spontaneously changing footwear isn't the worst problem he's faced, though. At the 2022 contest in Turin, the stage was 10m (33ft) higher than the backstage area.",
      "As a result, they were pushing heavy stage props \u2013 including a mechanical bull \u2013 up a steep ramp between every act.",
      "\"We were exhausted every night,\" he recalls. \"This year is better. We've even got an extra backstage tent where we prepare the props.\"",
      "Props are a huge part of Eurovision. The tradition started at the second ever contest in 1957, when Germany's Margot Hielscher sang part of her song Telefon, Telefon into (you guessed it) a telephone.",
      "Over the intervening decades, the staging has become ever more elaborate. In 2014, Ukraine's Mariya Yaremchuk trapped one of her dancers in a giant hamster wheel, while Romania brought a literal cannon to their performance in 2017.",

      "\"It's all organised in a kind of a circle. The [props] come onto the stage from the left, and then get taken off to the right.",
      "\"Backstage, the props that have been used are pushed back to the back of the queue, and so on. It's all in the planning.\"",
      "'Smuggling routes'",
      "During the show, there are several secret passageways and \"smuggling routes\" to get props in and out of vision, especially when a performance requires new elements half-way through.",
      "Cast your mind back, if you will, to Sam Ryder's performance for the UK at the 2022 contest in Italy.",
      "There he was, alone on the stage, belting out falsetto notes in his spangly jumpsuit, when suddenly, an electric guitar appeared out of thin air and landed in his hands.",
      "And guess who put it there? Richard van Rouwendaal.",
      "\"I'm a magician,\" he laughs. \"No, no, no\u2026 That was a collaboration between the camera director, the British delegation and the stage crew.\"",
      "In other words, Richard ducked onto the stage, guitar in hand, while the director cut to a wide shot, concealing his presence from viewers at home.",
      "\"It's choreographed to the nearest millimetre,\" he says. \"We're not invisible, but we have to be invisible.\"",
      "What if it all goes wrong?",
      "There are certain tricks the audience will never notice, Van Rouwendaal reveals.",
      "If he announces \"stage not clear\" into his headset, the director can buy time by showing an extended shot of the audience.",
      "In the event of a bigger incident \u2013 \"a camera can break, a prop can fall\" \u2013 they cut to a presenter in the green room, who can fill for a couple of minutes.",
      "Up in the control room, a tape of the dress rehearsal plays in sync with the live show, allowing directors to switch to pre-recorded footage in the event of something like a stage invasion or a malfunctioning microphone.",
      "A visual glitch isn't enough to trigger the back-up tape, however - as Switzerland's Zo\u00eb M\u00eb discovered at Tuesday's first semi-final.",
      "Her performance was briefly interrupted when the feed from an on-stage camera froze, but producers simply cut to a wide shot until it was fixed. (If it had happened in the final, she'd have been offered the chance to perform again.)",
      "\"There's actually lots of measures that are being taken to make sure that every act can be shown in the best way,\" says Reist.",
      "\"There are people who know the regulations by heart, who have been playing through what could happen and what we would do in various different situations.",
      "\"I'll be sitting next to our head of production, and if there's [a situation] where somebody has to run, maybe that's going to be me!\"",
      "It's no surprise to learn that staging a live three-hour broadcast with thousands of moving parts is incredibly stressful.",
      "This year, organisers have introduced measures to protect the welfare of contestants and crew, including closed-door rehearsals, longer breaks between shows, and the creation of a \"disconnected zone\" where cameras are banned.",
      "Even so, Reist says she has worked every weekend for the past two months, while Van Rouwendaal and his team are regularly pulling 20-hour days.",
      "The shifts are so long that, back in 2008, Eurovision production legend Ola Melzig  built a bunker under the stage, complete with a sofa, a \"sadly underused\" PS3 and two (yes, two) espresso machines.",
      "\"I don't have hidden luxuries like Ola. I'm not at that level yet!\" laughs Van Rouwendaal",
      "\"But backstage, I've got a spot with my crew. We've got stroopwafels there and, last week, it was King's Day in Holland, so I baked pancakes for everyone.",
      "\"I try to make it fun. Sometimes we go out and have a drink and cheer because we had a great day.",
      "\"Yes, we have to be on top, and we have to be sharp as a knife, but having fun together is also very important.\"",

      "In 1989, brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez killed their parents by shooting them multiple times at close range at their mansion in Beverly Hills.",
      "They were found guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to murder in 1996, and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.",
      "However, in a resentencing hearing in Los Angeles a judge reduced their term, making them eligible for parole.",
      "Public interest in the case has grown since a new Netflix drama, Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, was released in September.",
      "Why was there a hearing to resentence the brothers?",
      "In 2024, the previous district attorney of Los Angeles, George Gasc\u00f3n, requested that the brothers' sentence of life without the possibility of parole be changed to 50 years to life.",
      "The issue was put to Los Angeles County superior court Judge Michael Jesic on 13 May, who agreed.",
      "\"I do believe they've done enough in the past 35 years that they should get that chance,\" he said, concluding a day-long hearing.",
      "Menendez sentences reduced, given them chance of freedom",
      "Menendez sentences reduced, given them chance of freedom",
      "The brothers are now eligible for parole under California's youthful offender law which allows individuals who committed crimes before the age of 26 to seek a reduced sentence.",
      "The siblings were aged 18 and 21 at the time. They are now aged 54 and 57.",
      "What happened at the resentencing hearing?",
      "During the hearing, family members and a former fellow inmate were among those who testified in support of the resentencing.",
      "People who worked with the brothers in prison spoke about the educational courses they had completed, and described a hospice initiative they created for the elderly and sick.",
      "The district attorney's office, which fiercely opposes a lower sentence, said the brothers have continued to \"make excuses\" for their conduct instead of taking full responsibility and were not rehabilitated.",
      "The brothers spoke to the court via video and apologised for their actions.",
      "They also expressed their hope to work with sex abuse victims and help those incarcerated if they were given a second chance outside prison.",

      "Menendez brothers feel 'hope' for parole after decades in jail",
      "Who decides whether the Menendez brothers will be released?",
      "The California parole board will now decide whether to release the brothers from prison.",
      "Separately, the state's governor, Gavin Newsom, is considering a request from the brothers for clemency. If approved, it could lead to a reduced sentence or a pardon.",
      "Governor Newsom requested that the parole board conduct a risk assessment that examines whether the brothers pose a risk to the general public if released.",
      "The full report has not been released, but the district attorney said it indicated a \"moderate risk of violence\".",
      "The parole board hearing on the clemency petition is set to take place on 13 June.",
      "It is unclear whether the board will also consider the possibility of parole based on Judge Jesic's resentencing at the same hearing.",
      "What did the Menendez brothers do?",
      "Lyle and Erik Menendez killed their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, on 20 August 1989 at their home in Beverly Hills.",
      "Their father, a 45-year-old Hollywood executive, was shot six times with a shotgun the brothers had purchased days before the attack.",
      "Their mother died after suffering 10 shotgun blasts to several parts of her body.",
      "The brothers initially told police they found their parents dead when they arrived home.",
      "They were arrested after the girlfriend of a psychologist that had been treating Erik Menendez went to police to say that he had physically threatened the doctor.",
      "Why did the Menendez brothers kill their parents?",
      "The brothers claimed they committed the murders in self defence after years of alleged physical, emotional and sexual abuse, although no molestation was ever proven in court.",
      "They said they feared their father would kill them after they threatened to expose him.",
      "However, prosecutors argued that the young men had killed their successful parents to inherit their multi-million-dollar estate.",
      "What happened during the original Menendez trials?",
      "The brothers were taken into custody in 1990, and in 1993 they were tried for the murders, first individually, with one jury for each brother.",
      "However, both juries were deadlocked in 1994, resulting in a mistrial, and the pair were later tried again together in 1995.",
      "During their joint trial the judge excluded apparent evidence of abuse from their defence case. Taped sessions with a doctor, in which the killings were discussed, were ruled admissible in court by the judge.",
      "A jury found them guilty and the pair were convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to murder in 1996.",
      "The brothers, who were separated during their detention after a detective who investigated the slayings said they may conspire to escape if housed together, reunited in jail in 2018.",
      "What impact has the Netflix drama had on the case?",
      "The case was thrust back into the spotlight after Netflix released a drama series about the brothers in September 2024.",
      "Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, shot to the top of the platform's streaming chart and was reported to have had more than 12 million views in the first weekend after release alone.",
      "The programme explores what might have led the siblings to kill their parents and presents the murders from different perspectives.",
      "Its creators said the series was based on extensive research.",
      "It includes the brothers' claims of abuse as well as showing things from the parents' point of view.",
      "The show introduced the case to a new generation and garnered attention from celebrities - including Kim Kardashian and Rosie O'Donnell - who called for the brothers to be released.",
      "The series was a follow-up to the controversial first Monsters series about US serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer.",
      "What have the Menendez brothers said about the Netflix series?",
      "Following its release, Erik Menendez shared a statement, released on X by his wife.",
      "He said the show was \"disheartening slander\" and he \"believed we had moved beyond the lies and ruinous character portrayals of Lyle\".",
      "\"It is sad for me to know that Netflix's dishonest portrayal of the tragedies surrounding our crime have taken the painful truths several steps backward - back through time to an era when the prosecution built a narrative on a belief system that males were not sexually abused, and that males experienced rape trauma differently than women,\" he added.",
      "Members of the family also spoke out and said the brothers had been \"victimised by this grotesque shockadrama,\" and the show was \"riddled with mistruths\".",
      "Ryan Murphy, who created the show, told Variety that the comments were \"predictable at best\".",
      "He added that the family's response was \"interesting because I would like specifics about what they think is shocking or not shocking. It's not like we're making any of this stuff up. It's all been presented before\".",

    "story": [
      "Virat Kohli's retirement from Tests has left Indian cricket beleaguered and the sporting world gasping in surprise.",
      "Coming on the heels of captain Rohit Sharma quitting a few days earlier, it adds up to a double whammy for India who embark on a tough tour of England for a five-Test series come June without their two most experienced batters.",
      "Like Sharma, Kohli took to Instagram, where he commands more than 270 million followers, to make his retirement public.",
      "\"As I step away from this format, it's not easy \u2013 but it feels right\u2026'' he explained to his disconsolate fans.",
      "Tributes for Kohli have come in a deluge since: from fellow cricketers, past and present, old and young, and also legends from other disciplines like tennis ace Novak Djokovic and football star Harry Kane, which highlights the sweep and heft of Kohli's global appeal.",
      "Leading India to victory in the Under-19 World Cup in 2008, Kohli was fast tracked into international cricket by the then-chairman of selectors, former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar, against the judgement of others in the cricket establishment.",
      "\"Many in the Indian cricket board felt he was too young but he was scoring heavily in domestic cricket, and the hunger to succeed was palpable in him,\" recalls Vengsarkar.",
      "An example of Kohli's obsessive passion for the sport comes imbued with poignancy. Kohli was playing his second Ranji Trophy match for Delhi. His father passed away suddenly with his team in a crisis. After the funeral, he went back and scored a battling 90.",
      "Vengsarkar's approving eye earned Kohli an ODI debut in 2009. At 23, he was the youngest member of India's 2011 ODI World Cup winning team under MS Dhoni. A few weeks later, he made his Test debut in the West Indies. Some months on, during the disastrous tour of Australia with his place under threat, Kohli made a gritty maiden century and never looked back. Within a couple of years he established himself as the pre-eminent batter of his generation.",
      "Brash and provocative, without a benign muscle in his body, he was as volatile as potassium on water in his early years. He was unafraid to take on the most reputed opponents, often indulging in on-field fracases that sometimes earned him criticism.",
      "Happily, this was not to become his defining identity in cricket. Prolific run-getting in dashing style across formats provided another more compelling dimension and was to take him to the pinnacle.",
      "When his idol Sachin Tendulkar retired in 2013, Kohli, allying unbridled ambition with his abundant skills, grabbed the baton hungrily and went on to sketch one of the most stellar careers in cricket history.",
      "He wielded the bat like a Jedi, with great skill and telling thrust to slay opponents, as it were. Coupled with his high-octane persona, his scintillating batting made him a cult hero whose very presence ensured blockbuster box-office returns everywhere he played.",
      "Kohli always wore his passion on his sleeve. He was always demonstrative and dramatic on the field but over a period of time, misplaced angst was sublimated into a raging inner pursuit of excellence that took him to dizzying heights.",
      "Marriage to film star Anushka Sharma made them the country's foremost power couple, putting both under the glare of even more intense spotlight.",
      "Metaphorically, Kohli's outstanding exploits, especially in the first decade of his career, epitomised the emerging India of the 21st century: unabashedly, unrelentingly ambitious, discarding all past demons, willing to take on the best in the world.",
      "His achievements across formats are monumental.",
      "In ODIs, he is third in run aggregate behind Tendulkar and Kumar Sangakarra, but boasts the best average (57.88) among batters who have played more than 100 games. His ability to win ODI matches in the most daunting run chases is the stuff of folklore, many of his record 51 centuries coming in such pursuit.",
      "In T20s, his run aggregate and centuries don't put him in the top five, but he's immortalised himself with incredible knocks, notably 82 not out in an emotion-charged, pulsating match against arch-rivals Pakistan in the 2022 World Cup and a vital 76 in the 2024 final against South Africa, which helped India win the title.",
      "He is also the highest run scorer in the history of the Indian Premier League.",
      "At one point, Kohli averaged 50-plus in all three formats, making him the most productive and versatile batter of his era - way ahead of contemporaries Joe Root, Kane Williamson and Steve Smith. The four were locked in a fascinating, long-running race for batting supremacy.",
      "When it appeared he would break all batting records, Kohli's career took an inexplicable downturn. From the start of the pandemic, the flow of runs began to ebb and centuries became a trickle. In his pomp \u2013 between 2014 and 2019 \u2013 he had been unstoppable, at one time scoring six double centuries in just 18 months.",
      "The drought of runs hit him most adversely in Test cricket where his average, from a high of 55-plus in 2019 slumped to the current 46.75. In this period, Kohli also lost the captaincy, though his stellar standing in international cricket remained untouched.",
      "Kohli finishes his Test career with 9,230 runs, which puts him 19th overall in aggregate, and fourth among Indians behind Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Sunil Gavaskar, all of whom finished with a 50-plus average and more centuries. But to judge him only on this yardstick would diminish the massive impact he has had on this format .",
      "As captain, Kohli easily hurdles over Gavaskar, Tendulkar and Dravid. In Test cricket, winning 40 of the 68 matches he led in, making him the fourth most successful in the format. In the Indian context, this assumes Himalayan proportions.",
      "Former Australia captain Greg Chappell says that Kohli's energy, grit, sense of purpose and aura was \"transformative\" for Indian cricket. Chappell marks him out as the most influential Indian captain, ahead of even Sourav Ganguly and M S Dhoni.",
      "Former India captain and chief coach Ravi Shastri, who collaborated with Kohli for years, gives first-hand perspective.",
      "\"Kohli made India into a fighting unit, especially when playing overseas,\" says Shastri.",
      "The lack of ICC and IPL titles according to Shastri, is misleading as an index to his  captaincy ability.",
      "\"He always played to win, sought and nurtured fast bowlers to win overseas, demanded high intent and supreme fitness from all players, putting himself in the forefront, not as a backseat driver.\"",
      "For seven years when Kohli and Shastri collaborated, India were in the top three in ICC rankings in all formats almost continuously which is unprecedented.",
      "The most cherished and significant triumph of  this period came in 2018 when India beat Australia in its own backyard in a Test series for the first time ever.",
      "Australia is where Kohli had launched himself into batting greatness, scoring 692 runs in four Tests in 2014-15. In 2018, he contributed as captain and batter to break an hitherto unassailable psychological barrier. In 2020 touring Australia, Kohli played only one match (which was lost) returning home for the birth of his child. But India, having overcome the mental barrier two years earlier, went on to win the rubber in a melodramatic see-saw series.",
      "Australia was Kohli's happy hunting ground and his last visit Down Under in late 2024 grabbed worldwide attention. He began with a roar, hitting  a century in the first test at Perth. But his form fizzled out alarmingly and made only 190 runs in the five Tests.",
      "How much this contributed to his decision to retire is moot. Advancing years, the dislike of being constantly under harsh scrutiny, wanting to be close to his young family and behind the scene shenanigans that abound in Indian cricket have doubtless played a part too.",
      "Kohli ends his retirement post on Instagram enigmatically.",
      "\"I'll always look back at my Test career with a smile. #269 signing off,\" he wrote.",
      "The greatest ambassador for the five-day format in the last decade and a half had moved into the sunset.",

    "story": [
      "Kenya's President William Ruto is a man of many nicknames.",
      "El Chapo, Kasongo, Hustler, Deputy Jesus and Chicken Seller are just some that he has acquired in recent years.",
      "As is often the case when people are given alternative monikers, some are affectionate but some are intended to mock, while others reflect a profound anger.",
      "A history of the president's aliases offer a window into how the perception of him has changed.",
      "Ruto has acknowledged the rechristening trend, joking recently that Kenyans are \"finishing\" him with the numerous labels.",
      "\"You have given me so many names. I had the name William Kipchirchir Samoei Ruto. You added Survivor\u2026 Zakayo... now you are at Kasongo [the title of a Congolese song about abandonment and heartbreak]. Will you stop at 10, or should I prepare for more?\" he recently asked.",
      "The crowd, at a rally in the capital, Nairobi, responded that they had even more.",
      "Before he was elected president in 2022, Ruto attracted handles that bolstered his reputation as a man of the people.",
      "Hustler - Kenyan parlance for someone eking out a living against the odds - helped portray him as someone who would prioritise the needs of the struggling folk.",
      "Chicken Seller, referring to his childhood when he hawked poultry on the roadside, resonated with many who saw his life as an epitome of their own.",
      "\"These were very positive [names]. They sold him to the public in terms of votes,\" political analyst Prof Herman Manyora told the BBC, arguing that they helped catapult him into the top job.",
      "\"Names really stick with Ruto,\" he added.",
      "But the president has been a high-profile figure in Kenyan politics for a long time, including serving as deputy president for nine years until 2022, and has never been far from controversy.",
      "Prof Manyora recalls the label Arap Mashamba \u2013 which translates as \"son of farms\" \u2013 coined just under a decade ago and relates to Ruto's ownership of vast tracts of land across the country. Concerns have been raised about how some of these have been acquired.",
      "In 2013, a court ordered Ruto to surrender a 100-acre (40-hectare) farm and compensate a farmer who had accused him of grabbing it during the 2007 post-election violence. He denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Ruto's penchant for quoting Bible verses also earned him the Deputy Jesus tag. He has also been given the name Nabii, or prophet.",
      "However, it is since his rise to the presidency that the nickname manufacturers have been working overtime \u2013 with at least a dozen being created - and they have become increasingly critical.",
      "One that has stood out is Zakayo - Swahili for the name Zaccheaus, a Biblical figure who is portrayed as a greedy tax collector who climbed a tree to see Jesus.",
      "The \u2018tax collector\u2019 president sparking Kenyan angerBBC identifies security forces who shot Kenya anti-tax protesters",

      "Ruto's government introduced a raft of unpopular taxes and many Kenyans began to say that he had betrayed the \"hustlers\".",
      "\"He failed to deliver after becoming president,\" Prof Manyora said.",
      "The pain of paying more taxes, and a perception that the extra money will be wasted, is the focus of many conversations.",
      "Last year, young people came out onto the streets of Nairobi for weeks of protests, which turned deadly, against a fresh government proposal to raise taxes that was later dropped.",
      "The chant \"Ruto must go\" became a rallying call for the demonstrators and now Must Go has become another way to refer to the leader.",
      "The creative christeners have also focussed on the allegation that the president enjoys foreign travel.",
      "Hence the title Vasco da Ganya \u2013 a play on the name of the 15th Century Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, and the Swahili word danganya, which means \"to lie\".",
      "Africa's 'flying presidents' under fire",
      "Africa's 'flying presidents' under fire",
      "Ruto's honesty has also been called into question with Kaunda Uongoman, which mimics late Congolese musician Kanda Bongoman.",
      "The first part refers to the president's love for the Kaunda suit - a safari jacket with matching trousers \u2013 and Uongoman, which incorporates the Swahili word uongo, meaning \"lies\".",
      "But the president seems impervious to this volley of verbal attacks.",
      "Government spokesman Isaac Mwaura said the manifold nicknames \"don't raise concerns\" in the office of the president but simply \"capture how people view a person\".",
      "Ruto is \"very hands-on and doing his best to transform the economy... It's normal for any leader to have many nicknames as this signifies his various attributes and initiatives as a leader\", he told the BBC.",
      "Mwaura also argued that the government has had to raise taxes to pay for new projects, reduce the budget deficit and fix the economy.",
      "Nevertheless, when people have gone beyond inventing new names and used satire and forms of art to ridicule the president, there has been a negative reaction from officials.",
      "Some cartoons and AI-generated images, including showing the president in a casket, have been described as \"reckless\" and \"distasteful\".",
      "Some of the alleged producers of this online content have been victims of abductions. This, Prof Manyora said, should be seen as a sign of intolerance by the government.",
      "Lachon Kiplimo, a 23-year-old university student, said that while he supported the president, some of the promises he has made have been \"unrealistic\", which fuels the nicknames.",
      "He cited the use of El Chapo, referring to the former Mexican drug lord, after Ruto promised a machine that would produce a million chapatis (also known as chapo in Kenya) every day to feed schoolchildren in the capital.",
      "Mr Kiplimo however reckons that the way the president brushes off the monikers, and in fact seems to embrace them, shows how strong he is.",
      "Prof Manyora believes the young people who come up with the alternative labels for the president do it as a form of catharsis, a way of releasing tension.",
      "This view is backed up by 24-year-old student Margaret Wairimu Kahura, who said that many Kenyans \"are in a lot of pain\".",
      "She feels that the mockery is a way of letting Ruto know how the youth are feeling.",
      "She says that no other Kenyan president has been subjected to this level of lampooning, and \"so this is unique [but] in a bad way\".",
      "It is true that previous heads of state had nicknames but they have not been so numerous.",
      "The last President, Uhuru Kenyatta, was called Kamwana (\"young boy\"), Jayden (a Kenyan reference to a pampered or lazy child) and Wamashati (for his love of print shirts).",
      "His predecessor, Mwai Kibaki, was known as General Kiguoya (a general who is afraid) and Fence Sitter.",
      "Perhaps the age of social media, with its insatiable appetite for new content to keep people amused, has increased the trend towards name calling.",
      "But for many, like Ms Kahura, the volume of nicknames for Ruto are a genuine reflection of \"the different problems that people are facing\".",

    "title": "How real is the risk of nuclear war between India and Pakistan?",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2e373yzndro",
    "published": "Tue, 13 May 2025 23:35:23 GMT",
    "summary": "Recent hostilities were a reminder of how easily a crisis could escalate into catastrophe.",
    "story": [
      "In the latest India-Pakistan stand-off, there were no ultimatums, no red buttons.",
      "Yet the cycle of military retaliation, veiled signals and swift international mediation quietly evoked the region's most dangerous shadow. The crisis didn't spiral towards nuclear war, but it was a reminder of how quickly tensions here can summon that spectre.",
      "Even scientists have modelled how easily things could unravel. A 2019 study by a global team of scientists opened with a nightmare scenario where a terrorist attack on India's parliament in 2025 triggers a nuclear exchange with Pakistan.",
      "Six years later, a real-world stand-off - though contained by a US-brokered ceasefire on Saturday - stoked fears of a full-blown conflict. It also revived uneasy memories of how fragile stability in the region can be.",
      "As the crisis escalated, Pakistan sent \"dual signals\" - retaliating militarily while announcing a National Command Authority (NCA) meeting, a calculated reminder of its nuclear capability. The NCA oversees control and potential use of the country's nuclear arsenal. Whether this move was symbolic, strategic or a genuine alert, we may never know. It also came just as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio reportedly stepped in to defuse the spiral.",
      "President Trump said the US didn't just broker a ceasefire - it averted a \"nuclear conflict\". On Monday, in an address to the nation, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said: \"[There] is no tolerance for nuclear blackmail; India will not be intimidated by nuclear threats.",
      "\"Any terrorist safe haven operating under this pretext will face precise and decisive strikes,\" Modi added.",
      "India and Pakistan each possess about 170 nuclear weapons, according to the think-tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri). As of January 2024, Sipri estimated there were 12,121 nuclear warheads worldwide. Of these, about 9,585 were held in military stockpiles, with 3,904 actively deployed - 60 more than the previous year. The US and Russia together account for more than 8,000 nuclear weapons.",
      "The bulk of both India's and Pakistan's deployed arsenals lies in their land-based missile forces, though both are developing nuclear triads capable of delivering warheads by land, air and sea, according to Christopher Clary, a security affairs expert at the University at Albany in the US.",
      "\"India likely has a larger air leg (aircraft capable of delivering nuclear weapons) than Pakistan. While we know the least of Pakistan's naval leg, it is reasonable to assess that India's naval leg is more advanced and more capable than Pakistan's sea-based nuclear force,\" he told the BBC.",
      "One reason, Mr Clary said, is that Pakistan has invested nowhere near the \"time or money\" that India has in building a nuclear-powered submarine, giving India a \"clear qualitative\" edge in naval nuclear capability.",
      "Since testing nuclear weapons in 1998, Pakistan has never formally declared an official nuclear doctrine.",
      "India, by contrast, adopted a no-first-use policy following its own 1998 tests. But this stance has shown signs of softening. In 2003, India reserved the right to use nuclear weapons in response to chemical or biological attacks - effectively allowing for first use under certain conditions.",
      "Further ambiguity emerged in 2016, when then\u2013defence minister Manohar Parrikar suggested India shouldn't feel \"bound\" by the policy, raising questions about its long-term credibility. (Parrikar clarified that this was his own opinion.)",
      "The absence of a formal doctrine doesn't mean Pakistan lacks one - official statements, interviews and nuclear developments offer clear clues to its operational posture, according to Sadia Tasleem of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "Pakistan's nuclear threshold remains vague, but in 2001, Khalid Kidwai - then head of the Strategic Plans Division of the NCA - outlined four red lines: major territorial loss, destruction of key military assets, economic strangulation or political destabilisation.",
      "In 2002, then-president Pervez Musharraf clarified that \"nuclear weapons are aimed solely at India\", and would only be used if \"the very existence of Pakistan as a state\" was at stake.",
      "In his memoir, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote that he was jolted awake at night to speak with an unnamed \"Indian counterpart\" who feared Pakistan was preparing to use nuclear weapons during the 2019 stand-off with India.",
      "Around the same time, Pakistani media quoted a senior official issuing a stark warning to India: \"I hope you know what the [National Command Authority] means and what it constitutes. I said that we will surprise you. Wait for that surprise\u2026 You have chosen a path of war without knowing the consequences for the peace and security of the region.\"",
      "During the 1999 Kargil War, Pakistan's then-foreign secretary Shamshad Ahmed warned that the country would not \"hesitate to use any weapon\" to defend its territory. Years later, US official Bruce Riedel revealed that intelligence indicated Pakistan was preparing its nuclear arsenal for possible deployment.",
      "But there is scepticism on both sides over such claims.",
      "Former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria wrote in his memoir that Pompeo overstated both the risk of nuclear escalation and the US role in calming the conflict in 2019. And during Kargil, Pakistan \"knew the Indian Air Force wouldn't cross into its territory\" - so there was no real trigger for even an implicit nuclear threat, insist Pakistani analysts.",
      "\"Strategic signalling reminds the world that any conflict can spiral - and with India and Pakistan, the stakes are higher due to the nuclear overhang. But that doesn't mean either side is actively threatening nuclear use,\" Ejaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst, told the BBC.",
      "But nuclear escalation can happen by accident too. \"This could happen by human error, hackers, terrorists, computer failures, bad data from satellites and unstable leaders,\" Prof Alan Robock of Rutgers University, lead author of the landmark 2019 paper by a global team of scientists, told the BBC.",
      "In March 2022, India accidentally fired a nuclear-capable cruise missile which travelled 124km (77 miles) into Pakistani territory before crashing, reportedly damaging civilian property. Pakistan said India failed to use the military hotline or issue a public statement for two days. Had this occurred during heightened tensions, the incident could have spiralled into serious conflict, experts say. (Months later, India's government sacked three air force officers for the \"accidental firing of a missile\".)",
      "Yet, the danger of nuclear war remains \"relatively small\" between India and Pakistan, according to Mr Clary.",
      "\"So long as there is not major ground combat along the border, the dangers of nuclear use remain relatively small and manageable,\" he said.",
      "\"In ground combat, the 'use it or lose it' problem is propelled by the possibility that your ground positions will be overrun by the enemy.\" ('Use it or lose it' refers to the pressure a nuclear-armed country may feel to launch its weapons before they are destroyed in a first strike by an adversary.)",
      "Sumit Ganguly, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, believes that \"neither India nor Pakistan wants to be labelled as the first violator of the post-Hiroshima nuclear taboo\".",
      "\"Furthermore, any side that resorts to the use of nuclear weapons would face substantial retaliation and suffer unacceptable casualties,\" Mr Ganguly told the BBC.",
      "At the same time, both India and Pakistan appear to be beefing up their nuclear arsenal.",
      "With new delivery systems in development, four plutonium reactors and expanding uranium enrichment, Pakistan's nuclear arsenal could reach around 200 warheads by the late 2020s, according to The Nuclear Notebook, researched by the Federation of American Scientists' Nuclear Information Project.",
      "And as of early 2023, India was estimated to have about 680kg of weapons-grade plutonium - enough for roughly 130-210 nuclear warheads, according to the International Panel on Fissile Materials.",
      "Despite repeated crises and close calls, both sides have so far managed to avoid a catastrophic slide into nuclear conflict. \"The deterrent is still holding. All Pakistanis did was to respond to conventional strikes with counter-conventional strikes of their own,\" writes Umer Farooq, an Islamabad-based analyst.",
      "Yet, the presence of nuclear weapons injects a constant undercurrent of risk - one that can never be entirely ruled out, no matter how experienced the leadership or how restrained the intentions.",
      "\"When nuclear weapons can be involved, there is always an unacceptable level of danger,\"John Erath, senior policy director at the non-profit Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, told the BBC.",
      "\"The Indian and Pakistani governments have navigated these situations in the past, so the risk is small.  But with nuclear weapons, even a small risk is too large.\""

    "summary": "The US leader has faced criticism over his plan to accept a plane from Qatar worth an estimated $400m.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has said his administration wants to accept a plane worth an estimated $400m (\u00a3303m) as a gift from Qatar, calling it \"a great gesture\" that he would be \"stupid\" to turn down.",
      "The potential move has been labelled \"wildly illegal\" by some members of the rival Democratic Party - something the White House denies - and it has attracted criticism from some of Trump's supporters.",
      "Qatar itself earlier said the reports about the plane were \"inaccurate\", and that negotiations were continuing.",
      "The news comes as Trump visits several countries in the Middle East, including Qatar.",
      "BBC Verify has been looking into the legality of presidents accepting gifts.",
      "What do we know about the plane?",
      "On Sunday, US media reported that the Trump administration was preparing to accept a Boeing jumbo jet from the Qatari royal family - saying that the plane would be refitted and used temporarily as Air Force One, the name for the plane used by presidents.",
      "Trump later posted on Truth Social: \"The Defense Department is getting a gift, free of charge, of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40-year-old Air Force One, temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction.\"",
      "When questioned by reporters, Trump said: \"It's a great gesture from Qatar. I appreciate it very much. I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer.\"",
      "In February, Trump said he was \"not happy with Boeing\" about delays to two new Air Force One jets that he is expecting to receive directly from the firm. He added that the White House could instead \"buy a plane or get a plane, or something\".",
      "The Qatari plane was pictured in Palm Beach, Florida, in February where Trump inspected it. It is currently fitted with three bedrooms, a private lounge and an office, according to its specification summary document from 2015.",
      "Trump and Saudi crown prince sign partnership on first leg of president's diplomatic tour",
      "Trump heads to Saudi Arabia eyeing more investment in US",
      "A Qatari official has told CNN the plane is being given from the Qatari defence ministry to the Pentagon, and that it will be modified to meet Air Force One's safety and security standards.",
      "Experts say this is likely to take years, which means the plane may not be ready for use until near the end of Trump's term.",
      "Trump has said the plane will go directly to his presidential library after he leaves office, and that he \"wouldn't be using it\" after his presidency.",
      "Nonetheless, the move has led to criticism from Democrats as well as some long-time Trump supporters, including Laura Loomer who said: \"This is really going to be such a stain on the admin if this is true.\"",
      "Is the gift legal?",
      "Several senior Democrats have claimed that accepting the gift would be illegal.",
      "Democratic Senator Adam Schiff quoted a section of the US Constitution that said no elected official could accept \"any present... of any kind whatever\" from the leader of a foreign state without congressional approval.",
      "Frank Cogliano, a professor of American history at the University of Edinburgh, says this clause \"was intended to prevent bribery to influence the government\".",
      "\"It is certainly stretching the Constitution and we have not seen a gift on this scale, or of this nature\", says Professor Andrew Moran, a constitutional law expert at London Metropolitan University.",
      "There have been a number of other laws passed by Congress relating to the acceptance of foreign gifts, such as the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act of 1966, which means that congressional consent is required for the acceptance of foreign gifts above a certain value.",
      "Currently US officials can accept gifts valued at less than $480 (\u00a3363).",
      "Although Trump has referred to the plane ultimately going to his \"library\", experts have suggested he really means his museum foundation.",
      "Ex-presidents typically have a library housing their archive of documents, and a museum - typically funded by private donations - full of memorabilia and open to the public.",
      "Experts who BBC Verify spoke to said the fact that the plane could be given to the administration - and not to the president directly - before being transferred to his museum, may not get around the potential violation of the constitution.",
      "Jordan Libowitz - from the organisation Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington - said any use of the plane by Trump after leaving office would cross a line: \"Reagan's Air Force One ended up in his presidential library, but there's a difference there. The plane was decommissioned, Reagan never flew on it again, and it sits inside as a museum piece.\"",
      "The US Justice Department has reportedly drafted a memo explaining why it thinks accepting the jet would be permissible, although this has not been made public.",
      "When the White House Press Secretary, Karoline Leavitt was asked about the legality of the deal, she said: \"The legal details of that are still being worked out, but of course, any donation to this government is always done in full compliance with the law.\"",
      "What is Trump's family doing in the Middle East?",
      "President Trump is on a four-day trip to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and UAE, hoping to drum up investment for the US.",
      "His visit follows a series of business deals announced by the Trump Organization, which is run by the president's sons, Eric and Donald Jr.",
      "These include plans to build golf courses and luxury villas in Qatar and the UAE.",
      "President Trump is not currently affiliated with the Trump Organization, having handed over management responsibilities to his children after entering the White House on 20 January.",
      "A deal was announced by the Trump Organization at the beginning of May to develop a Trump-branded luxury 18-hole golf course and a collection of luxury villas north of Qatar's capital, Doha.",
      "At the time, Eric Trump said: \"We are incredibly proud to expand the Trump brand into Qatar through this exceptional collaboration with Qatari Diar and Dar Global.\"",
      "Dar Global is a publicly owned Saudi construction company; Qatari Diar is a Qatari state-owned company.",

    "summary": "Trade wars and volatile markets have contributed to a gold rush, but investors shouldn't put all their eggs in this one basket, warn experts",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Theo read this article",
      "\"What you have there is about \u00a3250,000 worth of gold,\" Emma Siebenborn says as she shows me a faded plastic tub filled with old, shabby jewellery - rings, charm bracelets, necklaces and orphaned earrings.",
      "Emma is the strategies director of Hatton Garden Metals, a family-run gold dealership in London's Hatton Garden jewellery district, and this unprepossessing tub of bric-a-brac is a small sample of what they buy over the counter each day. It is, in effect, gold scrap, which will be melted down and recycled.",
      "Also on the table, rather more elegantly presented in a suede-lined tray, is a selection of gold coins and bars. The largest bar is about the size and thickness of a mobile phone. It weighs a hefty 1kg, and it's worth about \u00a380,000.",
      "The coins include biscuit-sized Britannias, each containing precisely one ounce of 24 carat bullion, as well as smaller Sovereigns. These are all available to buy - and the recent surge in gold prices has led to a surge in demand.",
      "Zoe Lyons, who is Emma's sister and the managing director, has never seen anything like it \u2013 often she finds would-be sellers queuing in the street. \"There's excitement and buzz in the market but also nervousness and trepidation,\" she tells me.",
      "\"There's anxiety about which way the market is going to go next, and when you get those emotions, ultimately it creates quite big trades.\"",
      "At MNR jewellers a couple of streets away, a salesman agrees: \"Demand for gold has increased, definitely,\" he says.",
      "Gold is certainly on a roll. Its price has increased by more than 40% over the past year. In late April it rose above $3,500 (\u00a32,630) per troy ounce (a measurement for precious metals). This marked an all-time record, even allowing for inflation, exceeding the previous peak reached in January 1980. Back then the dollar price was $850, or $3,493 in today's money.",
      "Economists have attributed this to a variety of factors. Principal among them has been the unpredictable changes in US trade policy, introduced by the Trump administration, the effects of which have shaken the markets. Gold, by contrast, is seen by many as a solid investment. Fears about geopolitical uncertainty have only added to its allure. Many investors have come to appreciate the relative stability offered by a commodity once dismissed by the billionaire Warren Buffett as \"lifeless\" and \"neither of much use nor procreative\".",
      "\"It's the kind of conditions that we consider a bit of a perfect storm for gold,\" explains Louise Street, senior markets analyst at the World Gold Council, a trade association funded by the mining industry.",
      "\"It's the focus on potential inflationary pressures. Recessionary risks are rising, you've seen the IMF [International Monetary Fund] downgrading economic forecasts very recently\u2026\"",
      "But what goes up can also come down. While gold has a reputation as a stable asset, it is not immune to price fluctuations. In fact, in the past, major surges in the price have been followed by significant falls.",
      "So what is the risk this could happen again, leaving many of today's eager investors nursing big losses?",
      "What really triggered the goldrush",
      "Helped by its relative rarity, gold has been seen as an intrinsic store of value for centuries. The global supply is limited. Only around 216,265 tonnes have ever been mined, according to the World Gold Council, (the total is currently increasing by about 3,500 tonnes per year). This means that it is widely perceived as a \"safe haven\" asset that will retain its value.",
      "As an investment, however, it has both advantages and disadvantages.",
      "Unlike shares, it will never pay a dividend. Unlike bonds, it will not provide a steady, predictable income, and its industrial applications are relatively limited.",
      "The draw, however, is that it is a physical product that exists outside of the banking system. It is also used as an insurance policy against inflation: while currencies tend to lose value over time, gold does not.",
      "\"Gold can't be printed by central banks, and it can't be conjured out of thin air,\" says Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell. \"In recent times, a big policy response from authorities when there's been a crisis has been: slash interest rates, boost money supply, quantitative easing, print money. Gold is seen as a haven from that, and therefore a store of value.\"",
      "There has recently been a significant rise in demand for gold from so-called Exchange Traded Funds, investment vehicles that hold an asset such as gold themselves, while investors can buy and sell shares in the fund.",
      "They are popular with large institutional investors \u2013 and their actions have helped to push up the price.",
      "When gold hit its previous record in January 1980, the Soviet Union had just invaded Afghanistan. Oil prices were surging, driving up inflation in developed economies, and investors were looking to protect their wealth. The price also rose sharply in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, leading to another peak in 2011.",
      "The recent increases appear to owe a great deal to the way markets have responded to the confusion triggered by the Trump administration.",
      "The most recent surge came after US President Donald Trump launched an online attack on Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve. Calling for immediate interest rate cuts, he described Mr Powell as a \"major loser\" for failing to reduce the cost of borrowing quickly enough.",
      "His comments were interpreted by some as an attack on the independence of the US central bank. Share markets fell, as did the value of the dollar compared to other major currencies \u2013 and gold hit its most recent record.",
      "But gold's recent strength is not wholly explained by the Trump factor.",
      "Fears of weaponisation of the dollar system",
      "The price has been on a steep upward curve since late 2022, partly, according to Louise Street, because of central banks. \"[They] have been net buyers of gold, to add to their official reserves, for the past 15 years,\" she explains. \"But we saw that really accelerate in the past three years.\"",
      "Central banks have collectively bought more than 1,000 tonnes of gold each year since 2022, up from an average of 481 tonnes a year between 2010 and 2021. Poland, Turkey, India, Azerbaijan and China were among the leading buyers last year.",
      "Analysts say central banks may themselves have been trying to build up buffers at a time of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty.",
      "According to Daan Struyven, co-head of global commodities research at Goldman Sachs: \"In 2022 the reserves of the Russian Central Bank got frozen in the context of the invasion of Ukraine, and reserve managers of global central banks around the world realised, 'Maybe my reserves aren't safe either, what if I buy gold and hold it in my own vaults?'",
      "\"And so we have seen this big structural fivefold increase in demand for gold from central banks\".",
      "Simon French, chief economist and head of research at investment firm Panmure Liberum also believes that independence from dollar-based banking systems has been a major driver for central banks. \"I would look at China, but also Russia, their central bank is a big buyer of gold, also Turkey.",
      "\"There are a number of countries who fear weaponisation of the dollar system and potentially the Euro system,\" he says.",
      "\"If they are not aligning themselves with the US or the Western view, on diplomatic grounds, on military grounds\u2026 having an asset in their central bank that is not controlled by their military or political foes is quite an attractive feature.\"",
      "Another factor may now be helping to drive the gold market upwards: FOMO, or fear of missing out. With new all-time records being set, it has filtered through into everyday conversation in some quarters.",
      "Zoe Lyons believes that this is the case in Hatton Garden. \"[People] want a piece of the golden pie,\" she says, \"and they're willing to do that through buying physical gold.\"",
      "Safe, but for how long?",
      "The big question, though, is what happens next. Some experts believe the upward trend will continue, fuelled by unpredictable US policy, inflationary pressures and central bank buying. Indeed Goldman Sachs has forecast gold will reach $3,700/oz (\u00a32,800/oz) by the end of 2025 and $4,000 (\u00a33,000) by mid 2026.",
      "But it adds that in the event of a recession in the US or an escalation of the trade war it could even hit $4,500 (\u00a33,400) later this year.",
      "\"The US stock market is 200 times bigger than the gold market, so even a small move out of the big stock market or the big bond market would mean a big percent increase in the much smaller gold market,\" explains Daan Struyven.",
      "In other words, it wouldn't take a huge amount of turbulence in major investment markets to drive gold upwards.",
      "Yet others are concerned that the price of gold has risen so far, so fast that a market bubble is forming \u2013 and bubbles can burst.",
      "Back in 1980, for example, the dramatic spike in the gold price was followed by an equally remarkable correction, dropping from $850 (\u00a3640) in late January to just $485 (\u00a3365) in early April. By mid-June the following year, it stood at just $297 (\u00a3224) \u2013 a decline of 65% from its peak.",
      "The peak in 2011, meanwhile, was followed by a sharp dip, then a period of volatility. Within four months it had dropped by 18%. After plateauing for a while, it continued to fall, reaching a low point in mid-2013 that was 35% down from its highest.",
      "The question that remains is, could something similar happen now?",
      "Could the bubble burst?",
      "Some analysts do think prices will ultimately fall significantly. Jon Mills, an industry expert at Morningstar, made headlines in March when he suggested the cost of an ounce of gold could drop to just $1,820 over the next few years.",
      "His view was that as mining firms increased their production and more recycled gold entered the market, the supply would increase. At the same time central banks would ease off their buying spree, while other short-term pressures stimulating demand would subside, bringing prices down.",
      "Those forecasts have since been revised upwards slightly, largely because of increased mining costs.",
      "Daan Struyven disagrees. He believes there could be a short-term dip, but prices will generally continue to rise. \"If we were to get a Ukraine peace deal, or a rapid trade de-escalation, I think hedge funds would be willing to take some of their money out of gold and put it into risky assets, such as the stock market\u2026",
      "\"So you could see temporary dips. But we are quite confident that in this highly uncertain geopolitical setup, where central banks want safer reserve holdings, that they will continue to push demand higher over the medium term.\"",
      "Russ Mould believes there will, at the very least, be a lull in the upwards trend. \"Given that it has had such a stunning run, it would be logical to expect it to have a pause for breath at some stage,\" he says.",
      "But he believes that if there is a sharp economic slowdown and interest rates are slashed, the gold price could go higher in the long run.",
      "There are signs Trump could be ready to retreat on tariffs",
      "The curious case of why a billionaire wants to buy Royal Mail",
      "David Dimbleby: I thought the free market was with us forever - then Trump came along",
      "One problem for investors is working out whether the recent record price for gold was simply a staging point in a continued upward climb \u2013 to more than $4,000 for example \u2013 or the peak.",
      "Simon French at Panmure Liberum believes the peak may now be very close, and people piling into the market now in the hope of making big money are likely to be disappointed. Others have warned that those recently lured into buying gold by hype and headlines could lose out if the market goes into reverse.",
      "\"Short-term speculating can backfire, even though there will be a temptation to hang on to the coat-tails of the record run upwards,\" is how Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, has put it.",
      "\"Investors considering investing in gold should do so as part of a diversified portfolio \u2013 they shouldn't put all their eggs in a golden basket.\"",

    "story": [
      "I grew up in Nepal's capital watching the Himalayas. Ever since I left, I've missed sweeping, panoramic views of some of the highest mountain peaks on Earth.",
      "Each time I visit Kathmandu, I hope to catch a glimpse of the dramatic mountain range. But these days, there's usually no luck.",
      "The main culprit is severe air pollution that hangs as haze above the region.",
      "And it's happening even during the spring and autumn months, which once offered clear skies.",
      "Just last April, the international flight I was in had to circle in the sky nearly 20 times before landing in Kathmandu, because of the hazy weather impacting visibility at the airport.",
      "The hotel I checked in at was at a reasonable height from which mountains are visible on a clear day \u2013 but there was no such day during my two-week stay.",
      "Even from the major vantage point of Nagarkot, just outside Kathmandu, all that could be seen was haze, as if the mountains did not exist.",
      "\"I no longer brand the place for views of 'sunrise, sunset and Himalayas' as I did in the past,\" said Yogendra Shakya, who has been operating a hotel at Nagarkot since 1996.",
      "\"Since you can't have those things mostly now because of the haze, I have rebranded it with history and culture as there are those tourism products as well here.\"",
      "During an earlier trip a year ago, I was hopeful I would be able to see the mighty Himalayan peaks on a trek in the mesmerising Annapurna region \u2013 but had hardly any luck there either.",
      "Scientists say hazy conditions in the region are becoming increasingly intense and lasting longer, reducing visibility significantly.",
      "Haze is formed by a combination of pollutants like dust and smoke particles from fires, reducing visibility to less than 5,000m (16,400ft). It remains stagnant in the sky during the dry season - which now lasts longer due to climate change.",
      "June to September is the region's rainy season, when Monsoon clouds rather than haze keep the mountains covered and visibility low.",
      "Traditionally, March to May and October to November were the best times for business because that was when skies remained clear and visibility was best.",
      "But with rising temperatures and a lack of rain, and worsening air pollution, the spring months are now seeing thick haze with low visibility. Those conditions are beginning as early as December.",
      "'No sighting means no business'",
      "Lucky Chhetri, a pioneering female trekking guide in Nepal, said hazy conditions had led to a 40% decrease in business.",
      "\"In one case last year, we had to compensate a group of trekkers as our guides could not show them the Himalayas due to the hazy conditions,\" she added",
      "An Australian tourist who has visited Nepal more than a dozen times since 1986 described not seeing the mountains as a \"major let-down\".",
      "\"It wasn't like this 10 years ago but now the haze seems to have taken over and it is extraordinarily disappointing for visitors like me,\" said John Carrol.",
      "Krishna Acharya, the provincial chair of the Trekking Agents Association of Nepal in the western Gandaki province, says the trekking industry is in deep trouble.",
      "\"Our member trekking operators are getting depressed because no sighting of the Himalayas means no business. Many of them are even considering changing professions,\" he told the BBC.",
      "On the Indian side, near the central Himalayas, hoteliers and tour operators say haze is now denser and returns quicker than before.",
      "\"We have long dry spells and then a heavy downpour, unlike in the past. So with infrequent rain the haze persists for much longer,\" said Malika Virdi, who heads a community-run tourism business in the state of Uttarakhand.",
      "However, Ms Virdi says tourists are persistent - with many who didn't catch the mountain range returning to try their luck again.",
      "The western Himalayas in Pakistan have been relatively less affected by the haze because the mountains are relatively far from cities.",
      "But locals say that even the ranges that were once easily visible from places like Peshawar and Gilgit are often no longer seen.",
      "\"The sheet of haze remains hanging for a longer period and we don't see the mountains that we could in the past,\" said Asif Shuja, the former head of Pakistan's environmental protection agency.",
      "Hazes and dust storms increasing",
      "South Asian cities regularly top lists of places with highest levels of air pollution in the world.",
      "Public health across the region has been badly impacted by the toxic air, which frequently causes travel disruption and school closures.",
      "Vehicular and industrial emissions, dust from infrastructure construction and dry gravel roads as well as the open burning of waste are major sources of air pollution year-round.",
      "This is compounded by soot from massive forest fires - which are increasing due to a longer dry season - and the burning of crop residues after the harvest by farmers in northern India, Pakistan and Nepal.",
      "Weather conditions keeping warmer air above cooler air trap these pollutants and limit vertical air movement - preventing pollution from dispersing.",
      "\"Hazes and dust storms are increasing in South Asia, and this trend is projected to continue due to climate change and other factors,\" Dr Someshwor Das from the South Asia Meteorological Association told the BBC.",
      "In 2024, the number of hazy days recorded at the airport in Pokhara, a major tourism hub in western Nepal, was 168 - up from 23 in 2020 and 84 in 2021, according to Nepal's department of hydrology and meteorology.",
      "Experts believe the Himalayas are probably the worst affected mountain range in the world given their location in a populous and polluted region.",
      "This could mean the scintillating view of the Himalayas could now largely be limited to photographs, paintings and postcards.",

      "Those in the know, then, are not surprised that US President Donald Trump - known for his unorthodox diplomacy - has touched a raw nerve in Delhi.",
      "On Saturday, he took to social media to announce that India and Pakistan - after four tense days of cross-border clashes - had agreed to a \"full and immediate ceasefire\", brokered by the US.",
      "Later, in another post he said: \"I will work with you both to see if, after a thousand years, a solution can be arrived at, concerning Kashmir.\"",
      "The Kashmir dispute dates back to 1947, when India got independence from British rule and was partitioned to create Pakistan. Both neighbours claim the Kashmir region in whole, but administer it only in part.",

As per the Simla agreement signed by the country's leaders, they \"resolved to settle their differences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations\".",
      "Indian officials also argue that even when they reach an understanding with a civilian government in Pakistan, the country's powerful military launched operations undermining those deals. They point to the Kargil war in 1999, when another conflict between the two countries began after a group of Pakistan-backed militants occupied strategic areas in Indian-administered Kashmir.",

      "Pakistani strategic experts like Syed Muhammad Ali argue it is because of India's consistent refusal to engage with Pakistan that the international community should step in to avoid any future conflict.",
      "\"Kashmir is one of the most critical issues for the international community. The recent rapid escalation proves that the sabre-rattling can go out of hand,\" Mr Ali says.",
      "India's assertive diplomacy, particularly since Modi took over in 2014, has been seen as a sign of its confidence as a rising global economic power.",
      "But it will have to pull off a tough balancing act, to stave off Trump's advances.",
      "The US has courted India in recent years as a bulwark against an increasingly assertive China. India is a key member of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue group (Quad), along with the US, Australia and Japan, that was formed to counter Chinese expansionism in the Indo-Pacific.",

      "The previous American administrations were aware of India's sensitivities towards the Kashmir issue and largely stayed away from interfering with it. But with Trump, there's a question mark over whether that position still holds.",
      "The US is the largest trading partner of India with bilateral trade reaching about $130bn (\u00a398bn) in 2024. Modi's government is currently negotiating a trade deal with Washington to avoid tariffs.",
      "Delhi will have to walk a fine line. It will be averse to taking up Trump's offer to mediate,  or see the US-brokered ceasefire, or \"understanding\" as it calls it, going beyond the current military tensions. But it's also keen to have a favourable trading relationship with the US.",
      "Any attempt to broaden the talks - on contentious bilateral issues like the now suspended river water-sharing treaty or the status of Kashmir - will invite strong criticism at the domestic level, a trap that Modi is well aware of."

      "The agreement marks a major de-escalation of the trade war between the world's two biggest economies, which has sent shockwaves impacting countless other countries, including the UK.",
      "Here's what it all means.",
      "What has been announced?",
      "Both the US and China have confirmed a reduction in the tariffs they imposed on each other following the initial escalation by President Donald Trump earlier this year.",
      "The deal involves both nations cancelling some tariffs altogether and suspending others for 90 days, by 14 May.",
      "The result is that additional US tariffs on Chinese imports - that's the extra tariffs imposed in this recent stand-off - will fall to from 145% to 30%, while recently-hiked Chinese tariffs on some US imports will fall from 125% to 10%.",
      "China has also halted and scrapped other non-tariff countermeasures, such as the export of critical minerals to the US, which it put in place in response to the initial escalation.",
      "The US measures still include an extra 20% component aimed at putting pressure on Beijing to do more to curb the illegal trade in fentanyl, a powerful opioid drug.",

      "What happens after 90 days?",
      "Trying to predict the next steps in this ongoing trade war between the US and China  these past few months has been difficult to say the least.",
      "But this is a major agreement between the world's two powerhouse economies and has been broadly welcomed.",
      "Even if the suspended tariffs are reinstated after 90 days, because the vast majority of the tariffs that were announced after Liberation Day have been cancelled, US tariffs on China would only rise to 54% and Chinese tariffs on the US would rise to 34%.",

      "In a word - lots.",
      "In 2024, the biggest category of goods exported from the US to China were soybeans \u2013 primarily used to feed China's estimated 440 million pigs. The US also sent pharmaceuticals and petroleum.",
      "Meanwhile, China exported large volumes of electronics, computers and toys.",
      "The biggest category of US imports from China is smartphones, accounting for 9% of the total. A large proportion of these smartphones, Apple iPhones, are made in China.",
      "However, the US buys much more from China ($440bn) than it sells to it ($145bn), which is something Trump has long been unhappy with.",
      "His reasoning in part for introducing tariffs, and higher ones on countries which sell more to the US than they buy, is to encourage US consumers to buy more American-made goods, increase the amount of tax raised and boost manufacturing jobs.",
      "The escalating trade war in recent months has led to a collapse in the amount of goods being shipped across the Pacific Ocean, but investors believe the truce will lead to a rebound, with shares up for some of the world's biggest shipping firms.",

      "Politicians on both sides have started and will no doubt continue to claim victory over this truce.",
      "Despite the US and China calling this a joint agreement, people in Beijing will interpret it as the Trump administration walking back from the tariffs, according to Janka Oertel, director of the Asia programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\"We are back to square one, now negotiating can begin. The outcome is uncertain but China is in a psychologically stronger position now than before,\" she said.",

    "summary": "The president promises sweeping price cuts \"almost immediately\", but experts say these are unlikely.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that aims to reduce high prescription drug prices \u2013 but its details and long-term effects are far from clear.",
      "Citing figures that patients in other countries pay much less than Americans for pharmaceuticals, Trump said he would order drug companies to reduce their prices inside the US.",
      "He touted the move as \"one of the most consequential\" executive orders in US history, claiming prices would fall \"almost immediately, by 30% to 80%\".",
      "But experts are highly sceptical of the claims, and stock market moves indicate that investors think they will have little immediate effect.",
      "Why are American drug prices so high?",
      "The US has a particularly complex healthcare system - including a large private insurance industry, employer subsidies, and publicly funded insurance programmes for the elderly and poor, known as Medicare and Medicaid respectively.",
      "In many other developed countries, more centralised systems mean that officials can negotiate blanket rates for drugs, and in some cases refuse to buy if they deem the price too high.",
      "In 2021, the US Government Accounting Office made a comparison with Australia, Canada and France, and found that prescription drugs were on average two to four times more expensive in the US.",
      "Politicians from both US political parties have taken aim at the costs. During Monday's White House announcement, Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr noted that prices had been a preoccupation of Democrats and a main target in socialist Senator Bernie Sanders' presidential campaigns.",
      "Both Trump in his first term and former President Joe Biden tried to tackle the issue, particularly the cost of life-saving drugs such as insulin, but US prices remain stubbornly high.",
      "Speaking at the White House on Monday, Trump and his health officials blamed the lack of progress on pharmaceutical lobbying efforts and large donations to members of Congress.",
      "\"The drug lobby is the strongest lobby,\" Trump told reporters. \"But starting today, the United States will no longer subsidise the health care of foreign countries, which is what we were doing.\"",
      "It should also be noted that Trump's trade tariffs \u2013 which he has consistently used to threaten other countries - could increase costs even further. Trump has previously said he will tax drugs imported into the US.",
      "What was in Trump's order?",
      "Trump's order is much wider than previous efforts to bring down costs - however, many details are yet to be worked out.",
      "The wording directs US officials to make sure that deals over drug costs made by foreign countries do not result in \"unreasonable or discriminatory\" price hikes for Americans.",
      "But what exactly is covered by those terms is unclear \u2013 as is the question of what measures the White House would take if \"unreasonable\" practices are discovered.",
      "The White House also wants drug companies to sell more products directly to consumers - cutting out insurance companies and pharmaceutical benefit managers - and look into importing drugs from foreign countries where they are sold at lower prices. That idea has previously hit stumbling blocks over safety and trade rules.",
      "An official said that Monday's order was the start of negotiations between the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and industry.",
      "What is Most Favoured Nation status?",
      "The order also proposed that the US be given Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status \u2013 meaning drug companies would be asked to match the lowest price for a drug abroad when selling to US consumers.",
      "\"Big pharma will either abide by this principle voluntarily or we'll use the power of the federal government to ensure that we are paying the same price as other countries,\" Trump told reporters.",
      "It was unclear what mechanism the White House would use to punish drug companies that refuse to voluntarily comply.",
      "Drug prices are very opaque, according to Alan Sager, a professor of health policy at Boston University. Drug manufacturers could easily argue that they were complying with the order by touting the price discounts that they already routinely provide on very high listed retail prices, he told the BBC.",
      "\"Will they act? Maybe. Will they claim they act? Sure,\" Prof Sager said.",
      "\"Whether this will signal a durable and meaningful cut in extraordinarily high US drug prices is very unclear,\" he said. \"This is rhetoric, not reality.\"",
      "How did markets react?",
      "Trump's preview of the announcement hit share prices of major drug makers, such as Pfizer, Eli Lilly and the UK's GSK.",
      "But they staged a quick recovery, rallying after the administration shared the scope of its plans \u2013 an indication that investors do not expect the moves to have a major impact.",
      "What else could hinder Trump's plan?",
      "To try to retain their profits in the US, drugs companies could simply pull out of other nations in which they are selling their products more cheaply, according to researchers Darius Lakdawalla and Dana Goldman at the University of Southern California.",
      "The researchers also said that foreign governments routinely underestimated the true value of drugs to patients, and that \"shifting to a European pricing model in the US would lead to shorter, less healthy lives for Americans\".",
      "Meanwhile, it is unclear how lower prescription drug prices would fit into Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda. The health secretary has consistently emphasised diet and exercise as the key to improving Americans' health \u2013 and has criticised the proliferation of many pharmaceutical products, including vaccines and drugs to treat mental illness.",
      "However, any potential reduction in drug prices is likely to be popular with Americans - as polls consistently show that high costs are a top concern when it comes to the US healthcare system.",
      "C Michael White, a pharmacy professor at the University of Connecticut, said that the results of the Trump administration's actions on drug prices \"will be minimal for many Americans\" but that any attempts towards greater transparency and lower costs \"are a positive step in the right direction\".",
      "But the order is expected to face challenges from the pharmaceutical industry in courts and Congress.",
      "What does industry say?",
      "Industry groups are largely opposed to the executive order and say it will be counterproductive \u2013 potentially choking off the supply of drugs and funds for research while doing little to quell high costs.",
      "Stephen J Ubl, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said in a statement that \"importing foreign prices from socialist countries would be a bad deal\" for American patients.",
      "John F Crowley, president of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, called MFN status \"a deeply flawed proposal that would devastate our nation's small- and mid-size biotech companies\" by potentially choking off funding for research.",
      "\"Patients and families are not a bargaining chip in a trade war, but that's exactly how they are being treated \u2013 first through proposed tariffs on our nation's medicines, now with foreign reference pricing in the name of fairness.\"",
      "But Alan Sager, the Boston University professor, was sceptical about the industry's arguments. He pointed out that the money used to research a drug was spent before any profits were made, and suggested that there might be other ways to fund research - such as large cash prizes for cures for specific diseases.",
      "Prof Sager suggested that real action to drive down drug prices would depend on the president's attention span.",
      "\"Given the president's apparent public vacillation on many topics, it just isn't clear that he'll stay with this problem or that he'll be willing and able to act effectively,\" he said.",

The alleged incident with the gun was the final straw.",
      "Moshe Sharvit did not respond to BBC Eye's requests for a response to Ayesha's account.",
      "Back on the mountainside, the man accused of this violence stopped his car and approached us. Nodding towards Gil Alexander he asked us: \"Do you know he's a very dangerous guy?\"",

      "In this he is supported by senior ministers in the government, including the Minister of Finance, Bezalel Smotrich, and the Minister of Public Security, Itamar Ben-Gvir. Both men are settlers and leaders of far-right ultranationalist parties.",
      "Smotrich has said Gaza will be \"totally destroyed\" and that its people will be \"totally despairing, understanding that there is no hope and nothing to look for in Gaza and will be looking for relocation to begin a new life in other places\".",
      "The 'other places' he envisages are foreign countries. Ben-Gvir, who is responsible for the police, has convictions for inciting racism and supporting a terrorist organisation.",

      "Israel rejects this and argues that settlements are necessary for security, citing lethal attacks by Palestinian gunmen on settlers, such as the killing of three people last January in the West Bank.",
      "Settlement expansion is anathema to Gil Alexander. He considers himself a Zionist, but within the existing borders of Israel.",
      "These are the frontiers that existed before it seized the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war.",
      "He is part of a network called the Jordan Valley Activists \u2013 Moshe Sharvit calls them \"anarchists\" - offering solidarity, and working for peaceful co-existence with the Palestinians.",

      "The violence has escalated sharply since the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 kidnapped, and which triggered the Gaza war.",
      "According to a report issued by the UN office for Humanitarian Affairs there were 1,804 attacks by settlers against Palestinians in the period January 2024 to March 2025.",
      "The Israeli human rights group, Yesh Din (There is Law), reported that only 3% of complaints made against settlers resulted in a conviction. In six days last month - from 22 to 28 April - the UN recorded 14 incidents involving settlers that left 36 Palestinians injured.",
      "In the tense atmosphere on the mountainside, and wanting to avoid any escalation, we decided to leave.",
      "As we walked away, Moshe Sharvit went to his jeep and drove ahead of us, stopping where the track turned down the mountain. Our way out was blocked. There was no-one we could appeal to apart from the man preventing us from leaving.",
      "Again, he phoned the police asking them to come. Gil Alexander phoned the police and his lawyer. Our team was worried that more settlers would come.",
      "Then something surprising happened. I suggested to Moshe Sharvit that he should agree to be interviewed. After a brief pause, he said: \"Bring the camera.\"",
      "What followed was less an interview, than a series of declarations. He was doing the work of God, he said.",
      "Why did local Bedouin shepherds say they were very afraid of him? I asked.",

      "\"The Arabs, since the formation of the country and before - all the past 77 years they've been preoccupied with harming the people of Israel, harming the land of Israel and causing the nation of Israel to be miserable and pitiful. But they don't understand that the harder they try, the Lion will wake from his sleep and within one day we'll end this story.\"",

      "\"7 October was small. One day it'll be big.\"",
      "As for peaceful co-existence such as Gil Alexander supports, he said there was \"no such thing as peace with enemies who try to destroy you\".",
      "Moshe Sharvit's brother Harel was killed fighting in Gaza in December 2023.",
      "His world is the pastureland, the stony hills of the Jordan Valley, his sheep and cattle, the bed and breakfast he has opened.",
      "He produced a glossy video, replete with a backing track of American country music, to promote his venture.",
      "He spoke with contempt for the British sanctions against him. They were a new kind of antisemitism, he claimed.",
      "\"The minute someone tries to hurt me I get stronger. My spirit\u2026I receive energies, my spirit continues on its mission, I continue advancing forward and planting roots deep into the land of Israel. I'm not bothered by Britain or America or anyone.\"",
      "Then he drove away. We were free to move on. Later as we were having lunch in a caf\u00e9 about 15km (nine miles) away, a policeman appeared, looking for Gil Alexander.",
      "He went with the police officer for questioning. After about an hour he returned, telling us he had been ordered not to enter the Jordan Valley for two weeks. He plans to lodge his own complaint against Moshe Sharvit over the incident.",
      "We went to Gil Alexander's home in a kibbutz inside Israel that overlooks the Valley. Gunmen from the Palestinian city of Jenin fired at the kibbutz two years ago.",
      "Gil Alexander is not a pacifist. If he is attacked by Hamas or any other group, he will defend himself.",
      "He said: \"A son of our friends, two months ago he was killed here by a terrorist. He was a soldier in the reserves, 46 years old with six children. He volunteered for the reserves to protect me.\"",
      "\"If the army hadn't been there, they would have come here. He was killed while defending me. And today he is buried next to my two sons.\"",
      "But Gil Alexander seemed weary as we sat drinking tea amid the bright red flowers of his well-tended garden, and the fluttering yellow flags that symbolise Israel's hostages held in Gaza.",
      "He spoke of a beloved nephew killed fighting in Lebanon in an earlier war.",
      "Did he not, I wondered, at the age of 72, think about retiring from the struggle and enjoying his garden? He laughed.",
      "There was no chance of that. After two of his sons took their own lives \u2013 one was in the army, the other was about to enter the military \u2013 he had found a purpose in working for what he calls the \"humanitarian\" ideals of Judaism.",

      "Here's what to know about the charges and key names in the case.",
      "Who is Cassie Ventura? Hotel video a key piece of evidence",
      "Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, rose to fame with the single \"Me & U\" on her self-titled debut album. The song landed the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart in 2006.",
      "In her testimony, she said she signed with Bad Boy Records when she was 19, and Combs first kissed her on her 21st birthday. She and Combs dated off-and-on for more than 10 years, from about 2007 to 2018.",
      "She said she recorded hundreds of songs as part of a 10-album deal, but most were never released. She testified Combs became controlling and violent, and the \"freak offs\" became her job.",
      "Ventura spoke about years of alleged psychological and physical abuse. She also said Wednesday that he raped her after they had broken up in 2018.",
      "The security video of Combs attacking Ventura in the hallway of the InterContinental hotel\u00a0is a key piece of evidence in his trial. The video,\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0by CNN last year, shows Combs throw her onto the floor before kicking and dragging her.",
      "Prosecutors allege the hotel assault happened during a \"freak off,\" but Combs' lawyers, who\u00a0sought to have the video excluded from trial, argue it was a \"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship.\"",
      "Ventura filed a federal lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of rape and physical abuse. The suit also said Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the footage.",
      "\"After years in silence and darkness, I am finally ready to tell my story, and to speak up on behalf of myself and for the benefit of other women who face violence and abuse in their relationships,\" Ventura said in a statement to CBS News at the time. \"With the expiration of New York's Adult Survivors Act fast approaching, it became clear that this was an opportunity to speak up about the trauma I have experienced and that I will be recovering from for the rest of my life.\"",
      "Combs later apologized for the behavior seen on the video, but denied the allegations in the lawsuit. In a social media post that has since been removed, he said he was \"f---ed up\" and \"hit rock bottom.\"",
      "\"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video,\" he said. \"I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now. I went and I sought out professional help. I got into going to therapy, going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I'm so sorry. But I'm committed to be a better man each and every day. I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm truly sorry.\"",

      "Many of the accusers said they were drugged and then abused while incapacitated, and some claimed other celebrities were present or participated in the abuse.",

      "\"The film company the Lee family created is really reflective of a kind of 'do-it-yourself' mentality, and an entrepreneurialship within Chinese-American communities,\" Tam said.",
      "The studio eventually moved to Shanghai, producing around two dozen films in a decade. Few still remain, most were lost. The company went dark with the onset of the Great Depression, but the Lee family's impact in the world of cinema continued with the creation of the New York Chinese Film Exchange.",
      "\"My grandfather also bought a theater right on Park Row... and he renamed it the Silver Star,\" Lee said. \"It was a really big deal. On the weekends, you would go to the Chinese movies.\"",

      "Combs is seen attacking Ventura in video footage CNN\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0last year, which shows him throwing her to the floor, kicking and dragging her in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel.",
      "\"Control was everything\"",
      "Ventura characterized Combs as physically and psychologically abusive throughout the first hours of her testimony.",
      "\"Control was everything \u2014 from the way that I looked, to what I was working on that day, who I was speaking to,\" she said. \"Control was an all-around thing to a certain point.\"",
      "Combs allegedly introduced Ventura to \"freak offs,\" drug-fueled events where he is accused of forcing women to perform sex acts with hired sex workers, which were a focus of the indictment outlining his alleged crimes.",
      "Ventura said Combs broached the idea of sexual encounters involving voyeurism during the first year of their relationship, and he would hire an escort or dancer with whom he would watch her engage while he directed them. The singer testified she felt confused and nervous, \"but I also loved him very much and wanted to make him happy.\"",
      "She testified she worried about making Combs angry because of how much control he had over her life and career, and the possibility that he could blackmail her by releasing images of the \"freak offs.\" Prosecutors alleged in court documents that Combs often recorded these performances with or without participants' consent.",
      "A shift in the relationship",
      "Ventura recalled Combs looking out for her when she first met him. They fell in love, she said, while spending time together in the studio or traveling elsewhere.",
      "\"I think I was just enamored by him. We were just having a good time. It was really fun at this point,\" she told the court. But as her appearance, transportation, rent and overall lifestyle came under Combs' control, Ventura said her music career \u2014 and record deal \u2014 eventually took a backseat to the alleged \"freak offs,\" which left her feeling humiliated.",
      "She testified that despite recording hundreds of songs and nine albums while she was with Combs, the work was never released because \"freak offs\" became her job. They took up too much time and energy to leave room for other pursuits, Ventura said, adding that she would stay up for several days at a time to party, drink and have sex with strangers.",
      "The \"freak offs\" could last from 36 to 72 hours at a time, she said, with the longest continuing for four days. She recalled them happening almost weekly for years.",
      "Ventura felt \"disgusted\" and \"humiliated\" by \"freak offs\"",
      "Ventura began to cry during her testimony when asked whether she wanted to participate in every \"freak off.\" She said she didn't and that she felt \"disgusted\" and \"humiliated\" by them, but she also didn't want to disappoint Combs.",
      "Ventura told the court Combs dismissed her when she expressed how she felt about them, calling her predictable for not wanting to engage.",
      "Testifying at length about the \"freak offs,\" Ventura said Combs provided ecstasy and cocaine, which she took to stay awake during the incidents.",
      "2016 hotel incident",
      "Ventura recalled the 2016 hotel altercation seen on video footage. After being shown a clip from the incident during the second day of her testimony, she recounted that Combs was yelling and threw something at her during the attack.",
      "She said she told Combs via text message she had a black eye from the incident and reminded him of a premiere she was supposed to attend.",
      "\"You are sick for thinking it's OK to do what you've done,\" she wrote in a text to Combs. \"Please stay far away from me.\"",
      "Ventura told the court she wore sunglasses to cover her eyes and used makeup to hide bruises on other parts of her body when she attended the premiere.",
      "Prosecutors showed several photos of Ventura at the premiere event and after party, where the injuries could be seen.",
      "Drug use",
      "Combs allegedly provided stimulant drugs, like cocaine, to keep participants awake for the length of his \"freak offs,\" Ventura said. She also testified about a time when she requested ketamine, an anesthetic that has been used recreationally for its hallucinogenic and dissociative effects.",
      "Prosecutors allege Combs' \"freak offs\" involved excessive drug use, \"in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,\" and accuse him of using substances in part to exercise control over the people he targeted.",
      "She said Combs didn't like the drug and argued a successful \"freak off\" can be remembered, but explained ketamine was her preference because it allowed her to be less present in the moment.",

      "\"All my life I've been a chameleon. Everything is a costume,\" Simmons said in an interview for \"CBS Mornings\" that aired on Wednesday.",
      "But his devilish make-up and theatrical persona are a stark contrast to his very humble upbringing as the son of an immigrant single mother. Long before he became a KISS icon, he was known simply as Chaim Witz, meaning \"life\" in Hebrew.",
      "The road to KISS",
      "\"You want to be in a rock band?\" Simmons recalled his mother asking. \"That's not going to fly, babe.\"",
      "Before moving to New York at age 8, Simmons was born in Israel \u2013 a child of Jewish refugees from Hungary. His mother, Flora Klein, survived the Holocaust.",
      "\"After the horrific unimaginable life my mother went through where she saw her entire family, our family, wiped out in front of her face, every decision I was going to make I thought about my mother first,\" Simmons said.",
      "Simmons vowed to be there for his mother every step of the way, reminding himself, \"Don't break your mother's heart. Don't do it.\"",
      "He said it was an observation his mother made that inspired him to be a musician. While watching The Beatles perform on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" one night, Simmons recalled his mother coming in and commenting in Hungarian.",
      "\"I'll never forget this\u2026she said something like, in Hungarian, 'They're really weird people.' And at that point, I thought they're cool,\" Simmons said.",
      "The birth of \"Rock and Roll All Nite\"",
      "After making some money from singing background for other artists at New York City's Electric Lady Studios, Simmons and his pal Paul Stanley went on to form the legendary band KISS in their early 20s.",
      "Eddie Kramer, who worked with The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix, agreed to produce and engineer their first demo. But they struggled in obscurity until a challenge from their label's president led to one of the most famous lines in rock history.",
      "While buying frozen hot dogs and a can of beans in San Francisco, Simmons recalls Stanley turning to him and humming some of the lyrics to the song that would later become the iconic 1975 hit \"Rock and Roll All Nite.\"",
      "\"We were in San Francisco, we went downstairs to buy frozen hotdogs and a can of beans. And Paul said, what do you think of this?\"",
      "\"That's really good. What do you got? He goes, 'That's all I've got,'\" said Simmons after Stanley sang the chorus. They eventually put more verses together.",
      "\"And that's how the song was born,\" he said.",
      "By 1977, following the release of their concert album \"Alive!\", they were one of the most famous bands in America. Today, KISS has more gold albums than any other American band and has sold more than 100 million records worldwide.",
      "Though KISS retired from performing as a band, Simmons, now 75, is currently on tour.",

    "published": "Tue, 13 May 2025 22:01:30 -0400",
    "summary": "During a 40-year screen career, Robert Benton received six Oscar nominations and won three times.",
    "story": [
      "Robert Benton, the Oscar-winning filmmaker who helped reset the rules in Hollywood as the co-creator of \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" and later received mainstream validation as the writer-director of \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" and \"Places in the Heart,\" has died at age 92.",
      "Benton's son, John Benton, said that he died Sunday at his home in Manhattan of \"natural causes.\"",
      "During a 40-year screen career, the Texas native received six Oscar nominations and won three times: for writing and directing \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" and for writing \"Places in the Heart.\" He was widely appreciated by actors as attentive and trusting, and directed Oscar-winning performances by Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep and Sally Field. Although severe dyslexia left him unable to read more than a few pages at a time as a child, he wrote and directed film adaptations of novels by Philip Roth, E.L. Doctorow and Richard Russo, among others.",
      "Benton was an art director for Esquire magazine in the early 1960s when a love for French New Wave movies and old gangster stories \u2014 and news that a friend got $25,000 for a Doris Day screenplay \u2014 inspired him and Esquire editor David Newman to draft a treatment about the lives of Depression-era robbers Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, imagining them as prototypes for 1960s rebels.",
      "Their project took years to complete as Francois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard were among the directors who turned them down before Warren Beatty agreed to produce and star in the movie. \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" directed by Arthur Penn and starring Beatty and Faye Dunaway, overcame initial critical resistance in 1967 to the film's shocking violence and became one of the touchstones of 1960s culture and the start of a more open and creative era in Hollywood.",
      "The original story by Benton and Newman was even more daring: they had made Clyde Barrow bisexual and involved in a 3-way relationship with Bonnie and their male getaway driver. Beatty and Penn both resisted, and Barrow instead was portrayed as impotent, with an uncredited Robert Towne making numerous other changes to the script. \"I honestly don't know who the 'auteur' of 'Bonnie and Clyde' was,\" Benton later told Mark Harris, author of \"Pictures at a Revolution,\" a book about \"Bonnie and Clyde\" and four other movies from 1967.",
      "Over the following decade, none of Benton's films approached the impact of \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" although he continued to have critical and commercial success. His writing credits included \"Superman\" and \"What's Up, Doc?\" He directed and co-wrote such well-reviewed works as \"Bad Company,\" a revisionist Western featuring Jeff Bridges, and \"The Late Show,\" a melancholy comedy for which his screenplay received an Oscar nomination.",
      "His career soared in 1979 with his adaptation of the Avery Corman novel \"Kramer vs. Kramer,\" about a self-absorbed advertising executive who becomes a loving parent to his young son after his wife walks out, only to have her return and ask for custody. Starring Hoffman and Streep, the movie was praised as a perceptive, emotional portrait of changing family roles and expectations and received five Academy Awards, including best picture. Hoffman, disenchanted at the time with the film business, would cite \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" and Benson's direction for reviving his love for movie acting.",
      "Five years later, Benton was back in the Oscars race with a more personal film, \"Places in the Heart,\" in which he drew upon family stories and childhood memories for his 1930s-set drama starring Fields as a mother of two in Texas who fights to hold on to her land after her husband is killed.",
      "\"I think that when I saw it all strung together, I was surprised at what a romantic view I had of the past,\" Benton told The Associated Press in 1984, adding that the movie was in part a tribute to his mother, who had died shortly before the release of \"Kramer vs. Kramer.\"",
      "Benton was born in Waxahachie, Texas, outside of Dallas. He owed his early love for movies to his father, telephone company employee Ellery Douglass Benton, who, instead of asking about homework, would take his family to the picture shows. The elder Benton would also share memories of attending the funerals of outlaws Barrow and Parker, Texas natives who grew up in the Dallas area.",
      "Robert Benton studied at the University of Texas and Columbia University, then served in the U.S. Army from 1954 until 1956. While at Esquire, Benton helped start the magazine's long-standing Dubious Achievement Award and dated Gloria Steinem, then on staff at the humor magazine Help! He married artist Sallie Rendigs in 1964. They had one son.",
      "Between hits, Benton often endured long dry spells. His latter films included such disappointments as the thrillers \"Billy Bathgate,\" \"The Human Stain\" and \"Twilight.\" He had much more success with \"Nobody's Fool,\" a wry comedy released in 1994 and starring Paul Newman, in his last Oscar-nominated performance, as a small-town troublemaker in upstate New York. Benton, whose film was based on Russo's novel, was nominated for best adapted screenplay.",
      "\"Somebody asked me once when the Academy Award nominations came out and I'd been nominated, 'What's the great thing about the Academy Awards?'\" Benton told Venice magazine in 1998. \"I said, 'When you go to the awards and you see people, some of whom you've had bitter fights with, some of whom you're close friends with, some people you haven't seen in ten years, some people you just saw two days before \u2014 it's your family.' It's home. And home is what I've spent my life looking for.\"",

      "\"I forgive you,\" Kardashian told Aomar A\u00eft Khedache, the man alleged to be the brains behind the robbery, after his lawyer read a letter to the court sent by his client to the celebrity a year after the robbery, in which he said he was sorry.",

      "Flanked by four bodyguards, Kardashian entered the courthouse by the rear entrance. As she mounted the stone steps, she turned, took off her dark sunglasses and smiled at the gathered crowd of fans, curious passersby and press photographers.",
      "Dressed in black, with her hair up in a chignon, the celebrity was accompanied by her mother, Kris Jenner.",
      "The hearing was not broadcast publicly, as France rarely allows cameras in courtrooms. Some 400 reporters applied to attend the trial, but there were only 40 places allocated for media inside the courtroom. A side room was set up for 200 more journalists to watch a live transmission from inside the courtroom.",
      "After giving evidence all afternoon, Kardashian left the courthouse with her mother and bodyguards, without speaking to the crowds of fans and press waiting for her.",

Ten people \u2014 nine men and a woman \u2014 face charges including robbery and kidnapping against the American media personality and the concierge of the residence where she was staying on the night of Oct. 2, 2016.",
      "Before the celebrity took the stand herself, her longtime friend-turned-stylist Simone Harouche told the court on Tuesday that she heard Kardashian begging for her life during the attack in the hotel suite they were sharing.",
      "\"'I have babies and I need to live!' That is what she kept on saying, 'Take everything. I need to live,'\" Harouche told the court. \"I was scared that she was raped or violated. I thought the worst.\"",
      "Prosecutors have told the court that when the gang, dressed as police officers, arrived at the luxury suites hotel known only as \"The No Address\" where Kardashian was staying, they demanded that the concierge, at gunpoint, guide them to \"the rapper's wife,\" a reference to her then-husband.",
      "In interviews and on her family's reality TV show, Kardashian has described being terrified during the intrusion, thinking she was going to be raped and killed.",
      "\"They dragged me out to the hallway on top of the stairs, that's when I saw the gun, like clear as day,\" she said on her show \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians,\" adding: \"It makes me so upset thinking about it.\"",

      "Oprah Winfrey unveiled her latest book club selection Tuesday on \"CBS Mornings,\" choosing \"The Emperor of Gladness\" by acclaimed author and poet Ocean Vuong.",
      "During the exclusive announcement, Winfrey described the novel as containing \"some of the most beautiful writing I've experienced in my lifetime,\" and praised Vuong's ability to \"capture the essence of just ordinary people.\"",
      "\"When I tell everybody, would you just read the first chapter. And if you read the first chapter, you're gonna be hooked,\" Winfrey said.",
      "The novel opens with the line, \"The hardest thing in the world is to live only once,\" and follows 19-year-old Hai who develops a profound connection with Grazina, an elderly widow suffering from dementia.",
      "In the interview, Vuong shared that the story was inspired by personal experience, noting that suicide is \"a very personal thing\" following his uncle's death by suicide in 2012. Rather than focusing solely on the moment of crisis, Vuong said he wanted to explore what happens after.",
      "\"Often in stories or news segments, we have the suicide at the edge of the bridge. And then when they come off that bridge, and God willing they do, we all clap. Everything's back to normal,\" Vuong said. \"But I've always thought what's happened for that person on day two of that decision. Day three, day 20. Because their life still is in shambles.\"",
      "The author said the unlikely bond between his main characters, noting that \"both the young people and the very old have been pushed on the margins\" of society, creating \"masses amount of loneliness on both sides of that age spectrum.\"",
      "There is also a personal connection between Winfrey and Vuong, who shared that his mother, a nail salon worker in Connecticut, regularly watched \"The Oprah Show.\" Vuong said as a child, he watched women feel empowered through reading.",
      "When asked what his late mother would think of his book being selected for Oprah's Book Club, Vuong said it would be the only literary achievement she would have fully recognized, saying \"This is the only thing that would be legible to her.\"",

    "summary": "French cinema icon G\u00e9rard Depardieu has been found guilty of sexually assaulting two women during the filming of Les Volets Verts (The Green Shutters) in Paris in 2021.",
    "story": [
      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 French cinema icon G\u00e9rard Depardieu was convicted Tuesday of sexually assaulting two women on a film set in Paris in 2021 and handed an 18-month suspended sentence. The 76-year-old actor had denied the charges that he forcefully groped a set decorator and an assistant producer on the set of \"Les Volets Verts\" (\"The Green Shutters\").",
      "Depardieu was not in court for the verdict or sentencing on Tuesday, as he's currently filming in Portugal. His lawyer said he would appeal the verdict.",
      "Depardieu was accused by a set decorator, 34, and an assistant producer, 54, who said the actor grabbed and groped them during filming in Paris in August and September 2021.",
      "\"I am deeply moved, I'm very happy with this decision,\" the assistant producer, identified in court only as Am\u00e9lie, said after Tuesday's decision was handed down. \"It is a victory for me, a step forward. Justice was served, I feel.\"",
      "Taking the stand in March for the first time, Depardieu told the court he was nothing like the man described by the two women.",
      "\"I don't see why I would grope a woman, her buttocks, her breasts,\" he said. \"I'm not somebody who rubs himself up against people on the metro.\"",
      "The two women did not immediately report the alleged offenses, but after the Depardieu published an open letter in Le Figaro newspaper in October 2023 in which he stated: \"Never, never have I abused a woman,\" the set designer went to the police. She reported Depardieu for alleged sexual assault, sexual harassment and sexist insults.",
      "The trial opened in October, but it was adjourned due to Depardieu's failing health. His lawyer told the court in March that Depardieu was diabetic and had undergone a quadruple-bypass heart surgery.",
      "Medical experts later deemed him fit to attend the trial, but limited the hearings to six hours per day, with a provision for 15-minute pauses if Depardieu needed them.",
      "\"G\u00e9rard Depardieu is someone who is very free, who can be extremely direct,\" said his lawyer J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous, who dismissed the accusations as \"lies.\"",
      "Dozens of protesters, mostly women, gathered outside the courthouse in March, denouncing what they called endemic sexism and impunity for sex offenders in French cinema and French society. They said they were pleased the actor was finally in court to answer the allegations, and waved placards with messages including: \"Victims, we believe you; rapists, we see you\"; \"Touch one, you answer to all.\"",
      "A giant of French cinema, Depardieu has been more infamous than famous in recent years. He's been accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women in the movie industry. Many of the claims surfaced years after the alleged incidents took place, however, so under French law the actor cannot be tried for them.",
      "In a high-profile move, the actor left his native France for a few years about a decade ago, moving to Belgium, having criticized French tax increases.",
      "Depardieu has been open about his admiration for Russia under autocratic President Vladimir Putin, who bestowed Russian citizenship on him in 2013.",
      "He later also became a citizen of Dubai.",

      "Ticketmaster, long a subject of complaints about its hidden fees, was among those targeted by the new rule, which was announced in December by the Federal Trade Commission. The rule requires ticket sellers, hotels, vacation rental platforms and others to disclose processing fees, cleaning fees and other charges up front.",
      "Ticketmaster said Monday it commended the FTC's action.",
      "\"Ticketmaster has long advocated for all-in pricing to become the nationwide standard so fans can easily compare prices across all ticketing sites,\" Ticketmaster Chief Operating Officer Michael Wichser said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, the music mogul accused of sexually assaulting, trafficking and otherwise exploiting women in recurring incidents over multiple decades, is standing trial on federal charges in New York City. Jury selection began May 5, and 12 jurors were seated\u00a0along with six alternates on Monday, May 12. The selected group included 12 men and six women.",
      "Opening statements immediately followed, and the prosecutors' case against Combs started to take shape.",
      "\"To the public, he was Puff Daddy or Diddy, a cultural icon, a businessman, larger than life. But there was another side to him,\" one prosecutor said.",
      "Combs, 55, faces multiple charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. He has been jailed since September, when he was ordered held without bail. He has pleaded not guilty and at his final pre-trial hearing, rejected a plea deal.",
      "As the trial is underway in Manhattan federal court, here's what to know.",
      "Combs is being tried on 5 charges",
      "One of the most powerful figures in hip-hop, Combs is accused of running a criminal enterprise, with help from associates and employees, since at least 2004 that engaged in or attempted to engage in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, obstruction of justice and other offenses, according to an indictment.",
      "Combs was initially charged in September 2024 with one count of racketeering conspiracy, one count of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one count of transportation for purposes of prostitution. A superseding indictment brought two additional counts \u2014 one of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one of transportation for purposes of prostitution \u2014 against him in early April.",
      "The indictment alleges Combs \"engaged in a persistent and pervasive pattern of abuse toward women and other individuals,\" which was \"verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual.\" It accuses him of manipulating women into participating in commercial sex acts with him and sometimes with male sex workers. He allegedly arranged for women and sex workers to be flown to him.",
      "The acts with sex workers, which prosecutors say Combs called \"freak offs,\" are described in the indictment as elaborate performances that Combs directed and often filmed with or without participants' consent. Prosecutors have alleged the events involved excessive drug use, \"in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,\" and sometimes lasted multiple days.",
      "Combs is also accused of assaulting women repeatedly over many years by \"striking, punching, dragging, throwing objects at, and kicking them,\" the indictment said. The violence extended to his employees and people who witnessed his alleged abuse, prosecutors say. In one instance, Combs is accused of dangling a victim over an apartment balcony, according to the indictment.",
      "In addition to abuse, Combs allegedly maintained control over victims with money, drugs and threats to their careers, among other means. Prosecutors also allege Combs used bribes and blackmail to hide evidence of his conduct.",
      "According to prosecutors, the racketeering conspiracy charge involves allegations that Combs sex-trafficked three victims and forced a fourth, one of his employees, into sexual activity with him. The indictment refers to three female victims as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3.",
      "Four accusers are expected to testify against Combs, according to prosecutors.",
      "If Combs is found guilty on all counts, he could face up to life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty to each of the charges against him.",
      "His attorneys have said the allegations against him came from \"former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships.\"",
      "\"This was their private sex life, defined by consent, not coercion,\" the defense said in a statement in April following the superseding indictment.",
      "2016 hotel security video",
      "A security tape showing Combs attacking his then-girlfriend, R&B singer Casandra Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, in 2016 is expected to serve as a key piece of evidence for prosecutors during the trial.",
      "The video shows Combs throwing Ventura to the floor in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel, kicking her and dragging her. CNN\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0the footage last year following public allegations of physical and sexual violence against Combs.",
      "Ventura accused Combs of rape and physical abuse in a lawsuit in November 2023 that was settled the day after she filed it. The lawsuit also alleges Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the 2016 security footage.",
      "Combs apologized for his behavior seen in the video but denied the allegations in the lawsuit.",
      "Prosecutors contend the assault in the video happened during a \"freak off.\" Combs' lawyers, who tried to convince the judge to exclude it from the trial, argue the footage was nothing more than a \"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship\" between the two.",
      "U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian said Combs' lawyers failed to convince him that the footage should be excluded. Its relevance to the case outweighs any potential prejudice to Combs, the judge said.",
      "Jury selection",
      "A jury of 12 jurors and six alternates was sworn in on Monday.",
      "Prospective jurors were asked if they had been aware of the case, if they have any experience with sexual assault or domestic violence, what their views on law enforcement are, how they view hip-hop artists, and what their feelings about having multiple partners are, among other questions.",
      "They were also given a lengthy list of people and places and asked if they recognized any of the names, which included rapper Kanye West, who now goes by Ye; rapper Kid Cudi; actor Michael B. Jordan; actor Mike Myers; singer Aubrey O'Day; and Ventura, Combs' ex-girlfriend and one of his accusers.",
      "It was not immediately clear how all the people on the list will be referenced, if at all, during the trial.",
      "Ahead of jury selection, Combs' legal team and prosecutors disagreed on what to include in the questionnaire used to evaluate potential jurors.",
      "In court filings, Combs' attorneys argued that prosecutors' proposed questionnaire did not \"explore at all the prejudices and biases that are central to an effective inquiry to seating a fair jury\" nor acknowledge \"the unprecedented and negative media attention they may have been exposed to, related to Mr. Combs.\"",
      "They requested that jurors be questioned about their views regarding sex, drugs, violence and people with multiple sexual partners.",
      "Prosecutors criticized the defense's proposed questionnaire as too long and touching on subjects that would be better asked in person by the judge, if at all. They said some of the questions were \"utterly irrelevant to the ability to serve on a jury.\"",

      "\"This is very clich\u00e9, but it truly gave me my life back,\" he said.",
      "Psilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in 'magic mushrooms.' When administered in controlled, clinical research settings, it has shown promise in treating depression and anxiety, both of which are mood symptoms associated with Parkinson's that are linked to a faster physical decline.",
      "\"The neurodegeneration that is happening isn't just impacting motor circuitry \u2013 it's impacting a lot of brain circuitry. That creates this huge burden of symptoms that we often overlook and don't talk about enough, maybe,\" said Dr. Ellen Bradley, of UCSF. \"We were really surprised by how well this trial went.\"",

      "12 patients participated in this first-round study, which involved a first and second course of Psilocybin treatment.",
      "\"We had folks do a lower dose of Psilocybin \u2013 a 10 mg dose initially \u2013 and monitored them for a couple of weeks to see how that went,\" Bradley said. \"If it did go well, if we didn't have safety concerns, then they were eligible for the full therapeutic dose of 25 mg.\"",
      "All 12 patients were able to complete both courses of treatment without reporting any serious side effects, according to Bradley.",
      "\"We want to find out not just does Psilocybin therapy work, but if it does, how does it work? That mechanistic piece is so important,\" she said. \"Can it change the brain's ability to adapt to its environment and to rewire itself?\"",
      "While there were no serious adverse effects reported, every patient didn't have the same life-changing experience as Deming says he experienced. Though many did report their motor and cognitive functions improved afterwards, per Bradley.",
      "\"We don't have a reason to believe that this is a treatment that is going to be a good fit for every patient. That is never really our expectation in medicine. But our goal is to figure out when is it the right treatment and how much for which patient,\" Bradley said.",

      "\"That was really exciting just to see that promising safety profile in this initial pilot. That kind of gives us a green light to go forward with more in-depth research,\" she said. \"We really desperately need new treatments for Parkinson's.

    "published": "Wed, 14 May 2025 16:34:13 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump is now seeking to implement the idea through an executive order.",
    "story": [
      "Senate Democrats and the Biden administration dropped plans to set drug price caps based on the amount paid in other high-income countries, during talks years ago to push through the law that empowered Medicare to negotiate down the cost of prescription medications.",
      "A version of the idea was revived by President Trump in the executive order signed Monday, which called on the Department of Health and Human Services next month to draw up regulations to impose price restrictions tied to lower amounts paid in other developed nations, if drugmakers did not voluntarily reduce what they were charging in the U.S.",
      "\"Democrats could have done this a long time ago. They have fought like hell, for the drug companies. And they knew they were doing the wrong thing,\" Mr. Trump told reporters, speaking at a White House event to announce the move.",
      "For Democrats on Capitol Hill, this kind of approach to price controls has roots in a bill their own party successfully passed under House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2019.",
      "As part of giving Medicare the ability to negotiate the price of costly drugs it covered, the bill passed by House Democrats wanted the maximum price to be tied to an average based on prices paid in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom.",
      "\"We were hoping to get Trump. Trump said, 'I want to negotiate.' But then Republicans in Congress got to him,\" said Wendell Primus, who served for nearly two decades as Pelosi's top aide on health policy.",
      "The bill did not make it through the Senate at the time, which was controlled by Mr. Trump's party. After Democrats flipped control of the Senate, the idea ran into headwinds years later, as Biden aides and lawmakers tried to incorporate the measure into the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "Multiple Democrats involved in the talks on Capitol Hill at the time blamed a series of meetings in early 2021 with the staff from the Senate Finance Committee and party leadership for scuttling the idea.",
      "Staff on the committee said that they were worried that moderate Democrats like then-Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona would not support the bill if it included the measure, Primus said. Menendez and Sinema are no longer in the Senate.",
      "\"Members did not want to have something referencing foreign countries. They wanted it to make a function of the manufacturer's price here, what drug companies were offering to commercial insurers,\" Primus said.",
      "One former Biden White House aide involved in the talks said that there were several senators who understood that drug prices were too high, but they worried those price caps could undercut innovation from drugmakers in the U.S.",
      "Instead, the deal struck by lawmakers and White House aides to pass the law in 2022 ultimately turned to a different formula: capping them using calculations based on the price previously paid by Medicare and a fixed discount off the list price in the private U.S. market.",
      "\"President Biden and Democrats in Congress cared about getting something done, and so there was a compromise on the table that wasn't perfect, but it was going to make a huge amount of difference. And so that's the law they ultimately enacted,\" said Christen Linke-Young, deputy director of the White House Domestic Policy Council under Mr. Biden.",
      "Medicare has gone on to implement the law, resulting in talks that are continuing under the current Trump administration to lower the maximum price that the federal insurance program will pay for a growing list of costly drugs.",
      "\"It's a good thing for prescription drug costs in this country to be lower, we need to continue to work on that. And one of the ways to do that is actually put a proposal before Congress and get it enacted, so it has the force of law,\" said Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under Mr. Biden.",
      "Meanwhile, as the White House was working with their allies in Congress to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration moved to formally scrap a bid by Mr. Trump to impose caps tied to lower prices in other high-income countries using executive power during his first term.",
      "Called the \"most favored nation\" model, Trump officials had directed Medicare to only reimburse hospitals and clinics for some costly drugs based on the lowest price paid for in other high-income countries.",
      "CMS under Mr. Biden ultimately rescinded that move in 2022, after a legal fight that had blocked the proposal on the grounds that the Trump administration had unlawfully shortcutted the normal rulemaking steps to finalize the policy.",
      "\"The proposal was always pretty transparently illegal. The statute says that Medicare has to pay for prescription drugs in one particular way, and the Trump administration proposal was that we are going to ignore the statute and pay for drugs in an entirely different way. If the statute allowed that, a president before Donald Trump would have done it,\" Linke-Young said.",
      "A White House official under Mr. Trump disagreed with the accusation that their initial proposal was unlawful, arguing that the initial authority they used for the \"demonstration\" model in Medicare used powers that were broadly written by Democrats.",
      "While they are not planning to go down the exact same path, the official said, saying that they \"learned certain things from that first demonstration,\" the Trump administration believes they \"absolutely have that authority in our pocket.\"",
      "\"We are confident that we have authorities within our government programs to do this. And any dispute from the Biden administration is an intentional misinterpretation of the statute for political reasons, because they are the ones that walked away,\" the White House official said.",
      "Trump administration officials have painted their second run at the \"most favored nation\" idea as even broader in scope than their first term, which had been limited to only some costly drugs administered by healthcare providers through Medicare Part B.",
      "The White House official said Wednesday that they \"firmly believe\" they have the ability to pursue wider actions to push drugmakers to lower their prices within Medicare. They cited other authorities in the law being considered like section 402, which affords HHS powers to \"develop and engage in experiments\" which could affect payment rates in Medicaid as well.",
      "Asked this week on Fox Business Network whether the president's promise of steep drug price cuts would also extend to Medicare Part D, which covers the broad swath of prescriptions filled at drug store pharmacies, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said \"they absolutely will.\"",
      "\"They'll apply to Medicare, and they'll apply in the private market as well,\" Kennedy said.",

      "The head of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health and a handful of teams at the agency had their layoff notices rescinded Tuesday, multiple officials say, and several worker safety programs that had been eliminated by layoffs last month are being restored.",

      "Health officials and scientists being brought back to work include everyone in NIOSH's respiratory health division, division of safety research, division of compensation and analysis support and National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory according to an email obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"Secretary Kennedy has been working hard to ensure that the critical functions under NIOSH remain intact. The Trump Administration is committed to supporting coal miners and firefighters, and under the Secretary's leadership, NIOSH's essential services will continue as HHS streamlines its operations,\" HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in an email.",
      "A handful of NIOSH staff working in the agency's World Trade Center Health Program previously had their layoffs reversed, after a second round of cuts at the agency earlier this month.",
      "\"While we celebrate with those who received a rescission letter from HHS, I am mindful that others did not. I am hopeful that we can continue to make the case for reinstating everyone at NIOSH,\" the agency's now-reinstated director, Dr. John Howard, wrote in the email.",
      "The reinstatements mean that some NIOSH programs might soon be able to resume, after they were previously hobbled by the layoffs.",
      "For example, the agency's National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory had been forced to suspend new approvals of equipment like new N95 respirators and protective gear for firefighters after the initial round of cuts on April 1. Investigations of workplace health risks through NIOSH's Health Hazard Evaluation program were also upended by the layoffs, but staff working in those probes have now been reinstated.",
      "But many workers also remain effectively laid-off at the wide-ranging agency, which functions as the research and testing counterpart to the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Mine Safety and Health Administration.",
      "In NIOSH's Spokane and Pittsburgh Mining Research Division, laid-off scientists and engineers were called back to work, but only for a few more weeks to wind down their laboratories and research before their layoff notices take effect. Those NIOSH employees have not received letters formally rescinding their layoffs, unlike some of their colleagues.",
      "Part of their work includes overseeing miner safety programs like the personal dust monitors, or PDM, required by the Department of Labor for coal miners. NIOSH is responsible for testing PDM's accuracy. The monitors are needed to reduce the risk of black lung disease.",
      "NIOSH had also been in the process of developing similar monitors for miners exposed to silica dust, before the layoffs gutted the teams overseeing that work.",
      "Other NIOSH teams like the Health Effects Laboratory Division were also not listed among the reinstatements.",
      "Other parts of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which currently houses NIOSH, also remain off the job, despite calls from states and lawmakers for their reinstatements. HHS previously said it was planning on moving what remained of NIOSH into a new agency called the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "Among the CDC scientists still laid-off include the agency's laboratories for investigating STD and viral hepatitis, which upended work helping states investigate outbreaks. Staff in the CDC's National Center for Environmental Health, which had been responsible for a range of issues including lead poisoning and cruise ship outbreaks, also have not been reinstated.",
      "Other workers who have been promised by their supervisors that they would be reinstated elsewhere at HHS have also so far not received notices, like at the Food and Drug Administration's drug safety labs in Puerto Rico and Detroit.",

      "A CDC report late last year showed that overdose deaths in the U.S. fell 17% between July 2023 and July 2024 \u2014 credited in part to wider naloxone access. Naloxone, also sold under the brand name Narcan,  was made\u00a0available for over-the-counter purchase\u00a0in 2023 and is\u00a0standard for first responders\u00a0to carry. It's even popped up\u00a0in some classrooms.",
      "The Trump administration has proposed cutting a $56 million grant that teaches first responders how to use the lifesaving overdose reversal drug naloxone, which experts have previously said could reverse progress the U.S. has made in lowering opioid overdose deaths.",

      "Experts note that there have been past moments when U.S. overdose deaths seemed to have plateaued or even started to go down, only to rise again. That happened in 2018.",
      "But there are reasons to be optimistic.",
      "Drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacy chains and other businesses have settled lawsuits with state and local governments over the painkillers that were a main driver of overdose deaths in the past. The deals over the last decade or so have promised about $50 billion over time, with most of it required to be used to fight addiction.",

      "The money, along with federal taxpayer funding, is going to a variety of programs, including supportive housing and harm reduction efforts, such as providing materials to test drugs for fentanyl, the biggest driver of overdoses now.",

To get back to that pre-pandemic level of affordable homes, the U.S. would have to add more than 400,000 new listings priced at $255,000 or below, it found.",
      "The median sale price in the first-quarter of 2025 was almost $420,000, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Rising home prices and higher mortgage rates are pushing many homes out of the price range for middle-class households, said Nadia Evangelou, senior economist and director of real estate research at the National Association of Realtors (NAR). The affordability gap has its roots in the housing crisis that started in 2006, which caused new construction to dry up for years afterward, she added.",

      "Even though Pennsylvania isn't seeing the same type of population growth as states like Texas or Florida, housing costs in the state have surged due to its lack of building over the past several years, Pew added. The biggest increases were in the state's northeastern region, which includes Scranton and Philadelphia, it noted.",
      "Where housing availability is improving",
      "Thirty cities are showing improvements in affordable listings, including metropolitan areas such as Raleigh-Cary, North Carolina and Columbia, South Carolina, the research found. These areas saw the availability of affordable listings increase by 5% in the last year.",
      "Columbia, for one, has seen an increase in construction, with more properties such as townhomes built in the last few years, according to South Carolina's The State publication.",
      "Another 44 cities are stuck in the middle, neither improving nor decreasing in their share of affordable listings, the NAR analysis found.",
      "Both federal and local initiatives could help spur more homebuilding, helping relieve the affordability crunch in many regions, Evangelou said. For instance, easing zoning and building regulations could encourage more builders to construct new homes, while the federal and state governments could bolster downpayment assistance programs.",
      "Innovative forms of housing could also help, according to new research from Pew Charitable Trusts. For instance, it singled out so-called micro-apartments, which are small, co-living designs where residents share kitchens and bathrooms \u2014 like a college dormitory \u2014 as a low-cost way to provide more housing.",

    "story": [
      "Dick's Sporting Goods is buying ailing shoe company Foot Locker for $2.4 billion, the second deal for a large U.S. footwear maker in recent weeks as the industry grapples with the impact of steep new American tariffs on their production.",
      "Dick's said Thursday that it expects to run Foot Locker as a standalone unit and keep the Foot Locker brands, which include Kids Foot Locker, Champs Sports, WSS and Japanese sneaker brand atmos.",
      "\"Sports and sports culture continue to be incredibly powerful, and with this acquisition, we'll create a new global platform that serves those ever evolving needs through iconic concepts consumers know and love, enhanced store designs and omnichannel experiences, as well as a product mix that appeals to our different customer bases,\" Dick's CEO Lauren Hobart said in a statement.",
      "Skechers announced that it was being taken private earlier this month by the investment firm by 3G Capital in a transaction worth more than $9 billion.",
      "Foot Locker shareholders can choose to receive either $24 in cash or 0.1168 shares of Dick's common stock for each Foot Locker share that they own.",
      "The footwear industry has been growing increasingly concerned over Mr. Trump's trade war with other countries, particularly China. Athletic shoe makers have invested heavily in production in Asia.",
      "Fool Locker's stock slide",
      "Shares of sporting goods and athletic shoe companies have been under pressure all year. Before the Dick's deal, Foot Locker's stock price has tumbled more than 40% this year. Foot Locker shares surged $10.90, or nearly 85%, to $23.78 after the start of trade on Thursday.",
      "About 97% of the clothes and shoes purchased in the U.S. are imported, predominantly from Asia, according to the American Apparel & Footwear Association. Using factories overseas has kept labor costs down for U.S. companies, but neither they nor their overseas suppliers are likely to absorb price increases due to new tariffs.",
      "Foot Locker offers Dick's a lot of potential, namely its huge real estate footprint, and would give the Pittsburgh company its first foothold overseas.",
      "\"The addition of Foot Locker, with its 4.3% share of the sporting goods market, would produce an immediate boost,\" retail industry analysts Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData, said in an email. \"It would also give Dick's substantially more bargaining power with national brands, especially in the sneaker space. As the chains operate in a similar segment there would also likely be scope for synergistic savings.\"",
      "Foot Locker has about 2,400 retail stores across 20 countries in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. It also has a licensed store presence in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The company had global sales of $8 billion last year.",
      "\"While there is some overlap between the locations, the nature of the stores is different, and Foot Locker would give Dick's access to a wider selection of malls and customers,\" Saunders said.",
      "Dick's said that it expects to close the Foot Locker deal in the second half of the year. The transaction still needs approval from Foot Locker shareholders.",
      "Dick's stock dropped more than 13% before the market open, while shares of Foot Locker surged more than 82%.",

The sides are expected to continue negotiations, although ongoing uncertainty over trade policy is weighing on companies.",
      "\"The merchandise that we import comes from all over the world from dozens of countries,\" McMillon said. \"Other than the U.S., the other large markets are China, Mexico, Vietnam, India and Canada. China, in particular, represents a lot of volume in certain categories like electronics and toys. All of the tariffs create cost pressure for us, but the larger tariffs on China have the biggest impact. The cost pressure from all the tariff impacted markets started in late April, and it accelerated in May.\"",
      "Still, the Walmart executive emphasized that the retailer will do what it can to avoid\u00a0passing the import taxes onto customers.",

      "The new dress code, which went into effect on Monday, requires employees at company-operated and licensed stores in the U.S. and Canada to wear a solid black shirt and khaki, black or blue denim bottoms under their green apron.",
      "Under the previous dress code, baristas could wear a broader range of dark colors and patterned shirts. Starbucks said the new rules would make its green aprons stand out and create a sense of familiarity for customers as it tries to establish a warmer, more welcoming feeling in its stores.",
      "The new dress code comes as the company works on its\u00a0\"Back to Starbucks\"\u00a0mission, aimed at revitalizing its cafes and boosting sales. CEO Brian Niccol, who was brought on from Chipotle to lead the coffee chain\u00a0last year, has said \"there's a shared sense that we have drifted from our core.\"",

Instead of listening to baristas who make the Starbucks experience what it is, they are focused on all the wrong things, like implementing a restrictive new dress code,\" said Paige Summers, a Starbucks shift supervisor from Hanover, Maryland. \"Customers don't care what color our clothes are when they're waiting 30 minutes for a latte.\"",
      "Most stores remain open",

    "story": [
      "Flying can be a hassle even under the best of circumstances. When trips are marred by delays, cancellations and mishandled luggage, air travel can become a nightmare.",
      "In 2024, customers lodged a record 66,675 complaints against U.S. airlines, according to a new report from the U.S. PIRG Education Fund, a consumer advocacy group, based on data from the U.S. Department of Transportation. Passenger complaints have surged since the pandemic, rising every year since 2021, according to PIRG.",
      "\"When you file a complaint, the DOT asks if you talked to airline, so it's not like the DOT complaint line is your first stop,\" U.S. PIRG consumer watchdog director Teresa Murray told CBS MoneyWatch. \"When people try to get their money back and the airline hasn't done it, that's when people file complaints.\"",
      "For example, some customers sought refunds they were due related to flight cancellations or delays, while others sought reimbursement they were owed for lost or damaged piece of luggage. Airlines now face added pressure under new rules\u00a0adopted in 2024 that require them to provide automatic refunds to customers when their flights are canceled or significantly delayed.",
      "Pandemic impact",
      "Prior to 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic erupted in the U.S., annual complaints against all airlines hovered below 20,000. That year, they jumped to more than 102,000 during what was a catastrophic period for air carriers, given travel restrictions and plummeting demand for flying. Airlines struggled to ramp capacity back up in 2021 and 2022, resulting in plenty of cancellations and delays.",
      "At the top 10 U.S. airlines, cancellations rose from 1.28% of flights in 2023 to 1.36% last year, resulting in a total of 102,908 canceled flights in 2024, according to the report. Delays also worsened, with 78.1% of flights arriving on time last year, down from 78.3% in 2023. In total, roughly 1.7 million flights were either delayed or canceled in 2024.",
      "Nationwide air traffic controller shortages could lead to more snarls in schedules for the remainder of 2025, PIRG said.",
      "One relative bright spot in the report: Airlines mishandled fewer bags and wheelchairs in 2024 compared to the previous year. While that showed some modest improvement, 2.7 million bags were still lost or damaged, as were 11,357 wheelchairs and scooters.",
      "The carrier with the highest rate of complaints per 100,000 passengers: Frontier Airlines, which had the worst cancellation record, worst record for on-time arrivals and worst record for involuntary bumping, PIRG found. It ranked second-worst for the share of wheelchairs that it mishandled.",

      "Kroger shoppers might be paying more at checkout than they bargained for.",
      "A new investigation\u00a0found price tag errors at the supermarket giant's stores leading to customers being overcharged on many items marked as discounted or on sale. Expired discount tags were found on everyday products ranging from Cheerios cereal to Nescaf\u00e9 instant coffee, according to an investigation by Consumer Reports, The Guardian and the Food & Environment Reporting Network (FERN).",
      "The probe stems from allegations made by Kroger employees in Colorado who are currently in labor negotiations with the supermarket chain.",
      "\"People should pay the price that is being advertised, that's the law,\" Edgar Dworsky, a consumer advocate and former assistant attorney general in Massachusetts, who runs the Consumer World website, told Consumer Reports. \"The issue here is that shoppers can't rely on the shelf price being accurate, and that's a big problem.\"",
      "Kroger operates roughly 2,700 stores throughout the U.S., according to the company's\u00a0website, and owns a suite of supermarkets that includes Harris Teeter, Fred Meyer, Fry's and Ralphs.",
      "To conduct the investigation, Consumer Reports, The Guardian and FERN recruited people to shop at more than two dozen Kroger and Kroger-owned stores in 14 states and the District of Columbia over a roughly three-month period this year.",
      "The investigation found that expired sales labels led to overcharges on more than 150 grocery items, with an average overcharge of $1.70 per item, or 18.4%. For instance, a bag of Mission Flour Tortillas at a Harris Teeter in Alexandria, Virginia, was advertised as on sale for $2.99, while customers were charged $4.99.",
      "Although pricing mistakes were not found at all the Kroger stores in the investigation, the probe found issues at over half of the 26 locations it examined.",
      "Kroger took issue with the findings, saying the investigation greatly overstates the pricing issues.",
      "The \"characterization of widespread pricing concerns is patently false,\" a Kroger spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch, adding that the errors cited by the investigators represented only a \"few dozen examples across several years out of billions of customer transactions annually.\"",
      "Although Consumer Price Index\u00a0data shows\u00a0the rate of inflation and grocery prices eased last month, Americans continue to face higher\u00a0costs for household goods.",
      "\"Even if the incidents are careless rather than calculated, it creates a perception that Kroger is ripping people off,\" said Neil Saunders, an analyst with retail industry research firm GlobalData in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's not what any grocery retailer wants or needs when the consumer is looking to maximize value for money.\"",
      "Kroger not alone in overcharging claims",
      "The overcharging problem is not unique to Kroger: Retailers like Walmart, Safeway, Albertsons and Vons have\u00a0been hit with similar allegations.",
      "Grocery giant Albertsons in October agreed to pay $4 million to settle a lawsuit accusing the California chain of selling items for more than their lowest advertised price.",
      "But the Kroger case stand out for several reasons said Derek Kravitz, an investigative journalist and author of the Consumer Reports story. One is that in states in the Midwest and the South, where the retailer has a strong foothold, Kroger is often one of just a few places to choose from for grocery shopping.",
      "Kravitz also pointed to the persistent flow of complaints from Kroger customers over out-of-date sales prices, dating back to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Ohio, for example, the attorney general's office has received nearly 60 complaints of price tag and overcharge issues at Kroger since 2021.",
      "\"Almost every single time I go in the store, the listed price of an item is NOT what rings up at the register,\" Belpre resident Allison Hadfield noted in one of three complaints she and her husband, Derek, filed against their local Kroger store, according to Consumer Reports.",
      "In addition to individual complaints, customers have also filed multiple class-action lawsuits alleging pricing errors at Kroger locations, with cases ongoing in California, Ohio and Illinois, according to The Guardian.",
      "Kroger said it has taken steps to fix price discrepancies. That includes instituting a policy that gives employees the authority to fix price problems on the spot.",
      "\"Kroger is committed to affordable and accurate pricing, and we conduct robust price check processes that reviews millions of items weekly to ensure our shelf prices are accurate,\" a spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Potential staffing issues",
      "Between 2019 and 2024, the average number of employees at the Kroger-owned stores that the researchers focused on fell by 10.3%, or 17 employees per store, according to the report, which cites data from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The average number of hours worked also fell by 2.7 hours per week.",
      "\"There are simply not enough employees to manually switch out price labels on shelves because some stores have tens of thousands of price tags hanging at any one time,\" Kravitz wrote in the report.",
      "Kroger denies there is a problem with understaffing. In a statement to CBS MoneyWatch, the Kroger spokesperson said work hours and staffing at its stores have not been reduced.",
      "\"We intentionally staff our stores to keep them running smoothly while creating an enjoyable place to shop,\" the spokesperson said. \"Our staffing decisions are data-driven to balance workload and schedules.\"",

    "summary": "The bottom 60% of U.S. households don't make enough money to afford a \"minimal quality of life,\" according to a new analysis.",
    "story": [
      "The gap between what Americans earn and how much they need to bring in to achieve a basic standard of living is growing, according to a new report.",
      "The analysis, from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP), looks beyond whether people can afford daily necessities like food and shelter to consider whether they have the means to pay for things like the technology tools necessary for work, higher education, and health and child care costs.",
      "In tracking costs associated with what the group calls a \"basket of American dream essentials,\" LISEP says its Minimal Quality of Life index provides a truer picture of how Americans are faring than standard economic data, such as the nation's gross domestic product and jobless rate. The index captures the annual change in the typical costs facing low- and moderate-income households who are looking to maintain a basic quality of life.",
      "\"We analyze these components not just in terms of financial figures but as crucial elements that shape a family's capability to achieve a desirable standard of living,\" the group explains in a paper describing its approach.",
      "The findings? For the bottom 60% of U.S. households, a \"minimal quality of life\" is out of reach, according to the group, a research organization focused on improving lower earners' economic well-being.",
      "\"The middle class has been declining \u2014 we just haven't recognized it fully,\" LISEP Chairman Gene Ludwig told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's really dangerous because it's the kind of thing that leads to social unrest, and it's not fair. The American dream is not that it's given to you \u2014 it's that if you work hard, you have a chance to get ahead and achieve the things in life that you want to achieve. It's not living in a tent, not having to steal.\"",
      "Peering beneath the surface",
      "By those standards, the lowest-earning Americans around the U.S. are falling well short, according to LISEP. These households, which in 2023 earned an average of $38,000 per year, would need to make $67,000 to afford the items the group tracks as part of its index, which also includes professional clothing and basic leisure activities.",
      "\"Traditional headline economic indicators like GDP and unemployment tell us the economy is thriving, but they don't reflect the lived reality of most Americans,\" Ludwig said in a statement. \"Americans are working harder than ever, fueling our economic growth, but the benefits of that hard work are not being distributed in a way that supports upward mobility for too many middle- and low-income Americans.\"",
      "From 2001 to 2023, the cost of affording what amounts to a basic level of economic security doubled, according to LISEP's analysis. Housing and health care costs surged, while the amount of savings required to attend an in-state, public university soared 122%.",
      "Meanwhile, median earnings for the bottom 60% of income earners fell 4% over that span when adjusting for the cost of goods tracked by the group's index, according to LISEP. Income growth for these households has also lagged, rising 0.37% per year during the same period \u2014 less than half as much as for the top 40% of earners, the group found.",
      "The gap between how much low-income families earn and how much they need to afford a minimum cost of living is expected to keep widening, Ludwig told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Unfortunately, it is growing because the items that go into the basket of goods and services that make the minimal quality of life are inflating at a higher rate than wages are inflating,\" he said.",

    "summary": "A Republican-backed House bill includes a range new tax breaks, including a $4,000 deduction for seniors. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "As a Republican-backed bill moves ahead in the House, proposed tax cuts under the measure include some new and surprising changes that could impact the wallets of millions of Americans.",
      "On Wednesday, the House Ways and Means Committee voted in favor of the bill, which would make Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while also adding a host of other reductions.",
      "The extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions would mean that most taxpayers wouldn't see much of a change because their tax brackets would remain at the same levels they've been at since the cuts took effect in 2018. Without an extension, more than 6 in 10 filers would face a tax increase in 2026,\u00a0according\u00a0to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.",
      "Aside from extending the 2017 tax cuts, the proposed bill would provide taxpayers with an average $1,300 tax reduction, according to the House Ways and Means Committee. Some of the additional tax cuts include those promised on the campaign trail by Mr. Trump, such as eliminating taxes on overtime pay, as well as new provisions that would lower taxes for senior citizens and parents.",
      "The proposed bill is likely to change as it moves through the legislative process, with House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, aiming to send it to the Senate by Memorial Day. Democratic lawmakers have opposed the bill for its proposed cuts to Medicaid\u00a0and food stamps, part of the GOP's goal to find $880 billion in savings to help pay for the tax cuts.",
      "Some Democrats also pointed out that some of the tax cuts promised by Mr. Trump, such as eliminating taxes on tips, would expire after 2028, limiting the benefits.",
      "\"[T]hey made provisions like addressing taxes on tips and overtime pay temporary, as opposed to the cuts for the richest 1%, which they made permanent,\" said Rep. Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia who serves on the House Ways and Means Committee, in a statement.",
      "Still, the bill released Wednesday by the House's tax panel provides a laundry list of tax breaks that could soon become law. Here's what the legislation would do:",
      "Adds a new $4,000 deduction for people 65 and older",
      "Senior citizens who are 65 and older would get a new tax benefit \u2014 an extra deduction of $4,000 per filer.",
      "The new deduction could be used by people who either itemize or take the standard deduction. But there would be an income limit, with the $4,000 deduction available for people with a modified adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less for single filers and $150,000 for married couples who file joint returns.",
      "The tax break would be available starting in the current 2025 tax year and extend through 2028.",
      "By contrast, for seniors the latest version of the House bill has one notable omission: There's no plan to eliminate taxes on Social Security income, as Mr. Trump promised in his campaign.",
      "Proposing to scrap income taxes on Social Security proved controversial because those taxes directly fund the retirement program. That would likely hasten the\u00a0insolvency of its trust funds, policy experts have warned.",
      "Increases the standard deduction for all taxpayers",
      "The current standard deduction, which was expanded under the 2017 tax bill, is set to expire on Dec. 31. The House GOP bill would make the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's bigger deduction permanent, as well as give it a boost.",
      "Starting in the current 2025 tax year through 2028, here's how the standard deduction would increase:",
      "Single taxpayers would see their standard deduction rise from $15,000 to $16,000Head of households would rise from $22,500 to $24,000Married couples filing jointly would increase from $30,000 to $32,000",
      "Single taxpayers would see their standard deduction rise from $15,000 to $16,000",
      "Head of households would rise from $22,500 to $24,000",
      "Married couples filing jointly would increase from $30,000 to $32,000",
      "The standard deduction reduces your tax liability because it lowers your taxable income by that amount. For instance, single taxpayers earning $50,000 would reduce their taxable income to $34,000 for the 2025 tax year under the proposed standard deduction.",
      "Extends and increases the Child Tax Credit",
      "The House bill also extends the $2,000 Child Tax Credit, which otherwise would revert to its pre-Tax Cuts and Jobs Act level of $1,000 per eligible child starting in 2026. That change would be permanent, the House Ways and Means Committee said.",
      "The proposal would also increase the Child Tax Credit to $2,500 per child for the current 2025 tax year through 2028, after which it would drop back to $2,000.",
      "Eliminates the 1099-K reporting rule",
      "The proposed legislation would also abolish a\u00a0controversial rule that would have required payment platforms like Venmo or Paypal to send 1099-K tax forms to anyone receiving over $600.",
      "Previously, such payment services only had to report users' income to the Internal Revenue Service if they had more than 200 transactions, exceeding $20,000 in revenue. The IRS had delayed the implementation of the $600 rule after pushback from some online platforms as well as from Republican lawmakers.",
      "Increases the pass-through deduction for small businesses",
      "The pass-through deduction for small businesses, which was enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, also would increase under the House bill.",
      "The deduction allows small businesses, including partnerships, sole proprietorships (who are often gig workers) and S corporations, to subtract 20% of their qualified business income from their taxes, lowering their tax liability. Under the new bill, the deduction would rise to 23%.",
      "Eliminates taxes on tips",
      "This follows Mr. Trump's campaign pledge to eliminate taxes on tipped income, but it would apply only from the current 2025 tax year through 2028.",
      "The provision would create \"an above-the-line deduction for qualified tips received by an individual in an occupation which traditionally and customarily receives tips during a given taxable year,\" according to a summary of the bill from the House Ways and Means Committee.",
      "Eliminates taxes on overtime pay",
      "Another proposal from Mr. Trump \u2014 to eliminate taxes on eligible workers' overtime pay \u2014 would also become a reality, but only for three years.",
      "Under the House bill, an above-the-line deduction for OT would be created from the current 2025 tax year through 2028.",
      "Allow car loan interest to be deducted",
      "The House bill would also eliminate taxes on car loan interest by allowing consumers to deduct up to $10,000 for interest paid on vehicle loans.",
      "This would have an income limit, phasing out for taxpayers with a modified adjusted gross income above $100,000 for single filers or $200,000 for married couples. Vehicles must have been assembled in the U.S. to qualify for the deduction.",

China meanwhile, has agreed to cut its tariffs on American goods to 10% from 125%.",

As part of the agreement, a quota of 100,000 U.K. vehicles can be imported to the U.S. at a 10% tariff.",
      "Still,\u00a0uncertainty reigns. With that in mind, CBS News spoke with shopping expert Trae Bodge, who shared the following tips for consumers who are looking to avoid any added strain on their already strained household budgets.",
      "Look for sales: Start at the sales rack",
      "With summer fast approaching, retailers are likely to advertise Memorial Day sales. Official Memorial Day sales tend to start the weekend before Memorial Day. However, many retailers, including Lands' End and DreamCloud mattresses, have started hosting sales as early as the beginning of May.",
      "Father's Day and July 4th sales, along with Amazon Prime Day-scheduled for July, also offer shoppers opportunities to secure discounted retail prices on a range of goods and appliances.",
      "Check where products are from",
      "Not all goods are impacted equally by the tariffs. There is currently a 25% tariff on goods from\u00a0Canada and Mexico. However, certain products under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) are exempt. Under the USMCA, most goods traded between the U.S., Mexico and Canada are exempt from tariffs, as long as they meet rules of origin requirements-meaning the product must be made primarily in North America.",
      "Canadian cosmetics company Lush, for example, does not have tariffs on its products.",
      "Purchase domestic products",
      "Certain produce \u2014 including tomatoes, bell peppers and cucumbers imported from Mexico \u2014 could see price hikes over the coming months. Shoppers should turn to domestically produced staples, like apples, potatoes and oranges to avoid price hikes.",
      "Toilet paper is one item that shoppers shouldn't be worried about. According to the North Carolina State's College of Natural Resources, roughly 99% of toilet paper Americans use is made in the United States.",
      "What items will be hit hardest?",
      "Electronics and toys are the most likely to be hit the hardest by tariffs. 80% of toys are imported from China and toy maker Mattel has already warned of increasing prices. Overall, shoppers should consider whether an item is worth purchasing, especially if price hikes are coming.",
      "According to Trae Bodge, shoppers shouldn't panic shop. Instead, they should consider what items they were already planning on purchasing and possibly move the purchasing timeline up. \"So, if your dishwasher is on its last legs and you were thinking about getting one anyway \u2014 or your car, your laptop \u2014 those are the things that I would think about getting now,\" said Bodge. \"But, again, not in a panic.\""

      "Nissan said it will reduce the number of its auto plants to 10 from 17, under what it called its recovery plan to carry out \"decisive and bold actions to enhance performance and create a leaner, more resilient business that adapts quickly to market changes.\" It did not say which plants were being closed but confirmed the closures will include factories in Japan.",
      "\"We have a mountain to climb,\" CEO Ivan Espinosa told reporters, stressing the task will not be easy, requiring discipline and team work. \"Starting today, we build the future for Nissan.\"",
      "The job cuts to be done by March 2028 include the 9,000 head count reduction announced last year. Nissan also previously announced the scrapping of plans to build a battery plant in Japan.",
      "Espinosa, who took the helm earlier this year, said the latest plans followed a careful review of operations, to align production with demand, including coming up with market and product strategies. Nissan will also leverage its partnerships such as the one with Renault SA of France in Europe and Dongfeng Nissan in China, he said.",
      "Nissan said President Trump's tariffs on auto imports also hurt the company's results. The Yokohama, Japanese-based automaker racked up a loss of $4.5 billion for the fiscal year through March. It also said its recovery plan includes trying to reduce costs by $3.4 billion.",
      "\"As new management, we are taking a prudent approach to reassess our targets and actively seek every possible opportunity to implement and ensure a robust recovery,\" Espinosa said.",
      "Nissan aims to return to profitability by fiscal year 2026.",
      "But Nissan Chief Financial Officer Jeremie Papin acknowledged the automaker faces serious challenges. Nissan did not give a profit projection for the fiscal year through March 2026, citing uncertainties.",
      "Tariffs weighing on automakers",
      "The Trump administration in March\u00a0imposed a 25% tariff on the roughly 8 million vehicles assembled abroad that the U.S. imports annually.",
      "General Motors earlier this month said it's\u00a0lowering its profit expectations for the year as it braces for a potential impact from auto tariffs as high as $5 billion in 2025. The revised forecast came after Mr. Trump signed executive orders in April\u00a0to relax some tariffs on automobiles and car parts.",
      "Ford Motors also pointed to higher U.S. tariffs in announcing last week that\u00a0it is raising prices\u00a0on three models produced in Mexico. And Toyota last week said Mr. Trump's tariffs would cost the company $1.3 billion in just two months. The carmaker stopped short of making predictions on future tariff hits on business, with Toyota CEO Koji Sato saying that any future impact would be \"very difficult to forecast.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cpi-report-today-april-2025-inflation-trump-tariffs/",
    "published": "Tue, 13 May 2025 18:48:56 -0400",
    "summary": "The CPI report was cooler than expected, although inflation is still higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% annual goal.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index in April\u00a0rose\u00a02.3% on an annual basis, rising less than economists had expected yet still reflecting price hikes that remain above the Federal Reserve's goal of bringing down inflation to a 2% rate.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was forecast to rise 2.4% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in those prices over time.",
      "April's reading reflects the lowest level since February 2021, government data shows.",
      "On a month-over-month basis, the CPI rose 0.2%, lighter than the 0.3% pace forecast by economists.",
      "Housing costs were a major driver of inflation last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. And energy costs also ticked higher, despite lower gasoline prices, due to increases in natural gas and electricity costs.",
      "Grocery prices dropped slightly last month, declining 0.1% from March. The average price for a dozen Grade A eggs dropped 12.7% to $5.12 in April, marking the first month-to-month decline in egg prices since October 2024.",
      "Still, egg prices remain near historic highs as a persistent outbreak of bird flu continues to wipe out flocks of egg-laying hens. The April figure is 79% higher than the same month a year earlier, when the price averaged $2.86 per dozen.",
      "What experts say",
      "Economists are looking for early signs that Mr. Trump's tariffs are trickling through to American households. Because tariffs are import taxes paid by U.S. companies, which largely pass on the added costs to shoppers, they are at some point expected to boost consumer prices.",
      "Earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank is taking a wait-and-see approach on Mr. Trump's tariffs, which he said could boost inflation and blunt economic growth. But so far, the tariff impact hasn't shown up in economic data, which typically is backward-looking because it reflects activity from the previous month.",
      "Mr. Trump has also announced tariffs, such as his April 2 \"Liberation Day\" levies, and then backed off from them. On April 9, he hit the pause button with a 90-day delay, scaling back the tariffs to a 10% rate.",
      "And on Monday, the Trump administration and China agreed to a temporary but significant easing of tariffs imposed over the last couple months, scaling back the import duties on Chinese-made goods from 145% to 30%.",
      "Meanwhile, some consumers and businesses rushed to order goods ahead of the tariffs' imposition, aiming to skirt the new import duties by front-loading their purchases. Because of this, the impact of the tariffs might not show up in economic data for another few months, economists say.",
      "\"[I]n reality, the data for April is likely to be largely unaffected by President Trump's announcements on Liberation Day,\" said Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank, in an email. \"This is because exemptions were granted for goods that had left exporting countries before 2 April, and because consumers and businesses rushed to front-run tariffs in February and March.\"",
      "He added, \"As such, both the Fed and global investors will still need to be a bit more patient before they can properly assess the impact of the trade uncertainty on consumer prices.\"",
      "What does the CPI report mean for your money",
      "Because of the tentative trade agreement between China and the U.S., inflation may not rise as much as earlier anticipated, noted EY's Daco, who said he's lowered his year-end CPI forecast by 0.4 percentage points to 3.2%.",
      "With inflation still expected to pick up later this year, albeit at a lower pace than earlier forecast, the Fed may decide to cut rates twice in 2025, rather than the three cuts Daco had earlier expected. He added that he believes the first rate cut will occur in September, rather than July.",
      "April's cooler-than-expected data may also give the Fed more breathing room to hold off\u00a0on cutting rates as it assesses the impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies, said Carl Weinberg, chief economist with High Frequency Economics, said in a report.",
      "\"The Fed can stand still on rate hikes and cuts based on this data while it patiently waits to see the impact of erratic policy changes on prices in the months ahead, at least for now,\" Weinberg said.",
      "The result for consumers and businesses could be a longer wait for relief on borrowing costs, as the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate helps determine what banks, credit card companies and other lenders charge borrowers.",

      "Positioned at the front of the business class section, the Polaris Studio suites will include a host of luxury amenities for travelers who are willing to dish out more money for the premium experience. Among the offerings are skincare kits, flatbed seating with ottomans, champagne service, and exclusive dining options including \"curated food and drinks,\" according to the United website.",
      "Also included are wireless charging, Bluetooth connectivity and 27-inch screens. United Polaris Studio seats will also be 25% larger than standard United Polaris seats and come with privacy doors, the airline said.",
      "\"We're planning to fly this aircraft to Singapore, but there's 140 of these aircraft on order that are all going to come with this amazing suite on board,\" United Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Nocella told CBS News.",
      "United hasn't disclosed the cost of the enhanced seating.",
      "\"We've created a everything around it to make sure that we can deliver it reliably and we can deliver it for a price that I think consumers will be excited to pay,\" Nocella said.",
      "United posted its best quarterly\u00a0performance in five years earlier this year, raking in $13.2 billion in\u00a0first-quarter revenue.",
      "Standard United Polaris seats \u2014 the tier below the new studio suites \u2014 will also see some upgrades, including 19-inch screens and sliding doors.",
      "The Boeing 787-9 aircraft will have 99 premium seats total, the most of any in United's fleet and the highest percentage among U.S. carriers, according to the airline. That number includes seating in eight United Polaris Studio and 56 United Polaris business class suites.",
      "Despite the focus on offering a more luxurious travel experience, United also wants to enhance flights for passengers with more modest budgets.",
      "\"[W]e also know we need to pay attention to the rear of the aircraft, because the bulk of the passengers are flying in the main cabin, not in the Polaris cabin,\" Nocella said. \"And we've made efforts to make sure that that experience is going to get better, not worse.\"",
      "This nose-to-tail transformation comes as the luxury travel sector continues to expand. Demand for luxury tourism and hospitality is expected to grow faster than any other travel segment, according to a 2024 McKinsey & Company report.",

      "The dinner contest has raised concerns from government watchdogs and Democratic lawmakers about purchases of a Trump-branded asset being linked to access to the president. Also, because the $TRUMP coin is partly owned by an affiliate of the Trump Organization, the president's real estate organization, he and his family stand to benefit financially from purchases of the meme coin, critics add.",
      "The @TRUMP meme coin site hasn't disclosed the identities of the 220 top holders, who under the promotion are in line to dine with Mr. Trump.

      "A massive change could soon be in the works for the 71 million Americans on Medicaid, with House Republicans unveiling new legislation on Sunday that would require many enrollees in the government health care program to prove they are either working, volunteering or in school to receive coverage.",
      "The proposal is part of an effort by House Republicans to find $880 billion in savings over the next decade to help pay for President Trump's tax bill, which will extend his 2017 tax cuts while introducing some new reductions, like eliminating taxes on tips.",
      "Because President Trump has vowed not to touch Medicare \u2014 the health insurance program for people 65 and older \u2014 Republican lawmakers have turned their sights to Medicaid, which provides health coverage for low- and middle-income households. GOP lawmakers contend that Medicaid should be scrutinized because it's prone to financial waste, and that, by doing so, the program will be better able to serve the people who need it.",
      "\"Medicaid is hugely problematic because it has a lot of fraud, waste and abuse,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana,\u00a0said\u00a0in February. Rooting out waste \"preserves the programs, so it is available for those who desperately need it.\"",
      "Some policy experts and Democrats in Congress warn that slashing Medicaid would hurt many vulnerable Americans, with millions likely to lose coverage if the bill passes, while also posing a financial risk to some hospitals that rely on the program.",
      "\"[Nowhere] in the bill are they cutting 'waste, fraud, and abuse' \u2014 they're cutting people's health care and using that money to give tax breaks to billionaires,\" said Rep. Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees health care spending, in a May 12\u00a0statement about the new bill.",
      "The House Republican bill could change considerably as it moves through the legislative process. More than a dozen House Republicans have told Johnson and GOP leaders they will not support cuts to the health care safety net programs that their constituents depend on.",
      "\"Community engagement requirement\"",
      "Under the House bill, many Medicaid recipients would be subject to something the measure calls a \"community engagement requirement.\" That provision would mandate that people who are enrolled in the program either work, participate in volunteer work or be enrolled in an educational program for at least 80 hours a month.",
      "Medicaid recipients also would have to verify their community engagement eligibility twice a year. The bill also adds a more rigorous income verification process for those who enroll in the Affordable Care Act's health care coverage.",

The remaining 8% were either retired, couldn't find work or weren't working for another reasons.",
      "Two states \u2014 Georgia and Arkansas \u2014 have added work requirements for Medicaid recipients, although Arkansas dropped the mandate after a court struck it down in 2019, a year after it was implemented.",
      "Bumped off the rolls",
      "A 2020 analysis of Arkansas' work requirements found that 18,000 adults lost coverage after the policy went into effect, with more than half of those reporting that they delayed medical care and more than 6 in 10 saying they delayed taking medications because of cost. The requirements didn't boost employment, the study, by researchers at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, also found.",
      "Georgia maintains a work requirement for a Medicaid expansion program called Pathways to Coverage, which provides insurance to some low-income adults who wouldn't otherwise qualify for coverage. But that program has fallen short of enrollment goals, partly because of the administrative hurdles involved in verifying employment as well as technical glitches, according to a Pro Publica report.",
      "\"[W]ork requirements are the worst sort of red tape \u2014 blocking health coverage for working people, people with serious health conditions and people with disabilities,\" said Laura Harker, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Public Policies, a public policy think tank, in a December post about Georgia's program.",
      "An April 2025 estimate from the Urban Institute finds that as many as 5.2 million people ages 19- to 55-years-old could lose coverage if federal work requirements go into effect for Medicaid.",
      "Other cost-cutting measures",
      "Some Medicaid recipients who make more than 100% of the federal poverty level \u2014 about $32,000 a year for a family of four \u2014 would be required under the House GOP bill to pay out-of-pocket costs for some services.

      "The \"de minimis\" tariff rate on low-value parcels from China will come down to 54% from 120%, the White House said in an executive order Monday, after reaching an agreement with Beijing over the weekend.",
      "The so-called de minimis package loophole had long allowed Chinese e-commerce firms to ship low-value goods to U.S.-based customers duty-free.",
      "In February, President Trump moved to eliminate the low-value parcel exemption by imposing a 120% tax, or a flat fee of $100 on packages. When the exemption was eliminated on May 2, tariffs of up to 145% became applicable to packages from China worth $800 or less.",
      "Effective May 14, the tariff rate on low-value imports from China will be slashed to 54%. Additionally, the U.S. will lower its maximum tariff rate on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, including a 10% baseline levy plus a fentanyl-specific 20% levy, for a period of 90 days.",
      "Mr. Trump alleged in an April 2\u00a0executive order\u00a0that shippers in China had been exploiting the loophole to \"hide illicit substances and conceal the true contents of shipments sent to the United States through deceptive shipping practices.\"",
      "\"These shippers often avoid detection due to administration of the de minimis exemption,\" the executive order stated.",
      "The end of the de minimis exemption has upended the business models of companies like\u00a0Shein and Temu, leaving U.S. consumers\u00a0unable to procure\u00a0\u00a0affordable fashion from the popular e-commerce sites.

      "With the end of the loophole, which exempted packages worth $800 from import levies, many goods from China and other countries will no longer\u00a0be as low-priced as they once were. Trade experts also note that to comply with the law, importers and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) now face a new administrative challenge: the burden of inspecting millions of additional packages daily. That could mean substantial delays in shipments, experts note.",
      "What is the de minimis loophole?",
      "The provision was introduced in 1938 as Section 321 of the Tariff Act of 1930. It was designed to facilitate trade by eliminating the administrative burden of collecting negligible duties on low-value goods at a high cost to the government.",
      "From 2018 to 2023, the value of low-value e-commerce exports from China ballooned from $5.3 billion to $66 billion, according to a February report from the Congressional Research Service.",

      "Why did Trump eliminate the de minimis exemption?",

      "Mr. Trump in April signed an executive order eliminating the duty-free treatment for low-value packages from China and Hong Kong, effective May 2. As of Friday, packages that would have qualified for exemption under the de minimis provision will \"be subject to all applicable duties,\" the executive order states.",

      "Goods from China are subject to new tariffs of up to 145%, while Beijing has retaliated with tariffs of 125% on goods from the U.S.",
      "What does the end of the exemption mean for consumers?",

      "\"The way we shop online will never be the same,\" Ram Ben Tzion, CEO of Publican, a company that authenticates shipment documentation, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Specifically, \"everything will take more time, cost more money, and everything that's price-sensitive won't be available,\" he said.",
      "The rise of trade between the U.S. and China allowed for a much greater variety of goods to enter U.S. markets. But the end of the loophole will lead to a \"much diminished market,\" said Mary Lovely, an international trade expert and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "If prices of Chinese goods rise, there will be less demand, and sellers could decide to import fewer goods.",
      "\"You'll see much diminished market and at some point it won't be worth it to import to a small market,\" so you'll see products disappearing, Lovely said.",
      "Could the new rule cause delays?",
      "Requiring millions more packages to be inspected daily will create a challenge for CBP, experts noted.",
      "\"It will be an administrative nightmare, so you will see a lot of delays,\" Ryan Young, a trade policy expert at the Competitive Enterprise Institute told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "It's unclear if the government has enough CBP agents to efficiently inspect packages and enforce policies, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"As these adjustments are made, a key question remains, which is the ability of CBP to effectively regulate and enforce these measures,\" Ben Tzion said. \"As of today. CBP does not have that ability.\"",
      "\"Without personnel, you'll have backlogs and pile ups and U.S. customs might have to get more warehousing space,\" Young added.",
      "Who might benefit?",
      "Companies that sell goods made in the U.S. could face less competition as previously cheap China-made goods rise to new price highs.",
      "\"Consumers could become more wary of foreign brands to avoid paying hefty prices,\" Ines Durand, a retail strategist at Similarweb, a web analytics company.",

    "summary": "Here's what an agreement by the U.S. and China to suspend steep tariffs for 90 days means for consumers, businesses and the economy.",
    "story": [
      "A\u00a0tariff truce\u00a0between the U.S. and China announced on Monday will offer companies some relief, but also prolong the kind of economic uncertainty that makes it hard for businesses to plan for the future.",
      "Beginning May 14, the U.S. will lower its maximum tariff rate on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, including a 10% baseline levy plus a fentanyl-specific 20% levy. China will reduce its 125% tariff on American goods to 10%.",
      "But clinching a long-term trade deal is likely to prove challenging, while the reduced 30% tariff rate could still lead to price hikes for consumers, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It remains to be seen whether the U.S. and China can agree to a trade deal that keeps tariffs from rebounding in 90 days,\" analysts with Gavekal, an investment research firm, said in a report. \"So far, only the U.K. has reached an agreement with the U.S., and that doesn't tell us much.\"",
      "Is the 30% tariff permanent?",
      "No. Absent a formal trade deal, there's no guarantee that President Trump won't again raise tariffs on China once the truce expires after 90 days and that Beijing won't also retaliate. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called the new baseline tariff a \"floor\" in an interview with Bloomberg Surveillance.",
      "\"This is just a 90-day pause that allows the two countries to work toward a deal,\" supply-chain expert Sina Golara, an assistant professor at Georgia State University's Robinson College of Business, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Is a 30% tariff on Chinese imports still high?",
      "Under the agreement, the U.S. will lower tariffs on Chinese goods from as much as 145% to 30%. Still, that represents a steep hike on the level of U.S. levies on China before Mr. Trump took office.",
      "\"If you look at where we were pre-'Liberation Day' or when Trump took office, this 'agreement' is just a baseline tariff increase to 30% across the board,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning public policy think tank, referring to the phrase President Trump used in announcing a barrage of tariffs on April 2. \"While it's a walk-back from the prohibitive 145% tariffs, it still leaves us no closer to any concessions or renegotiations vis-\u00e0-vis China than we were.\"",
      "Tariff rates aren't the only potential sticking points as the countries continue to negotiate.",
      "\"The two countries have a lot of grievances in many dimensions, so it's not just tariff rates,\" Golara noted. \"It's where they strand on other trade barriers, the trade imbalance, and the U.S. accusing China of currency manipulation, so there's a lot to discuss. It makes sense for them to want to take more time.\"",
      "What does the U.S-China truce mean for economic growth?",
      "There's good news here: If both countries' reduced tariffs remain in place, consumer confidence is likely to improve and boost spending. That should help contain U.S. inflation and help support the job market, according to Oxford Economics associate economist Grace Zwemmer.",
      "The announcement also reduces the odds of the U.S. economy entering a recession this year, according to experts. Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet lowered his forecast for a recession to 35% from more than 50%.",
      "Will shipments from China start flowing again?",
      "Large and small businesses alike in the U.S. have warned that higher tariffs will raise consumer prices, while some companies have canceled orders from Chinese factories because of the high levies.",
      "\"It's very clear that Trump was staring down the barrel of a huge drop in imports from China across the busiest shipping season, as companies build inventory for Christmas and the holiday season,\" Groundwork Collaborative's Jacquez told CBS MoneyWatch.\u00a0 \"There were more announcements from companies about burning through their inventory and having to pass costs to customers, or having to cease importing from China.\"",
      "Freight shipments from China are expected to surge during the 90-day tariff pause, as companies bulk up their inventories to guard against the trade talks foundering and levies rising. \u00a0As a result, shipping rates will rise, and squeeze smaller businesses, whose margins are already thin.",
      "\"Right now, you'll see a huge rush in trying to get imports in from China in this 90-day period. That will strain shipping logistics just as it did in Covid, when everything opened back up,\" Jacquez said.",
      "Will consumer prices still rise?",
      "Businesses still face added costs with 30% tariffs in place, and they are likely to pass some of those expense onto consumers. But the price hikes could be less substantial depending on how companies handle tariffs, according to Georgia State University's Golara.",
      "\"If we have a mix of some companies handling tariffs well, we won't see broad-based inflation rise to a painful level. We might see pocketed effects in different and specific products and sectors,\" he said.",
      "Other experts agree the pause is good news for companies and consumers.",
      "\"The tariffs were so punishing that it was creating this incentive not to import anything from China,\" Veronique de Rugy, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The announcement is also good news because it means supply is not going to be as restrained as it was.\"",
      "It doesn't mean the U.S. it completely out of the woods, though. \"It's still a significant increase in taxes for American consumers. We are still in a worse position than we were,\" de Rugy said.",
      "How are companies reacting?",
      "Businesses are still grappling with significant economic uncertainty, making it hard to plan for the future.",
      "\"If you're a small business and don't know what your inputs will cost next week or in 90 days, it's going to be extremely difficult to do business in this uncertain environment,\" Jacquez said.",
      "Kim Vaccarella, founder and CEO of Bogg, a U.S-based beach bag and accessories company that makes its products in China, has been scrambling to shift at least some of its manufacturing to Vietnam and Sri Lanka because of the Trump administration's stepped-up tariffs.",
      "\"We were looking at alternatives and set up viable sources in both countries, and we were working toward manufacturing there,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Then came The White House's announcement on Monday. With the U.S. earlier this year having raised its country-based tariffs on Vietnam and Sri Lanka to o46% and 44%, respectively, China may again be Vaccarella's best option.",
      "\"Now we are back to square one, because at 30% it's less expensive to manufacture in China,\" she said. \"If tariffs stay at 30% or go lower, it just looks like we spent a lot of money quickly trying to ramp up production somewhere else, because that would have been more acceptable under this current nightmare.\"",
      "A leading index of small business optimism has fallen every month this year, although it remains above its levels before the November presidential election.",
      "Vaccarella had warned customers that the price of her company's\u00a0bags could jump as early as July. \"But 30% we can work with,\" she said. \"There might have to be a small increase, but it won't be what it would have been at 145%.\"",

    "story": [
      "With home prices near a record high and mortgage rates remaining elevated, renting a place to live around the U.S. is today considered a\u00a0better alternative to buying. But here's the catch: Rents are surging, too.",
      "Zillow calculates\u00a0that renters need at least $80,000 in annual income to comfortably afford the typical apartment rental \u2014 up from $60,000 in 2020. And if you want to live in a larger urban area, apartment hunters now need to earn $100,000 or more to live in Boston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Diego, San Francisco and San Jose, while even modestly sized Riverside, California, requires six figures for people to keep their heads above water, according to the real estate firm.",
      "\"Today renters need to make six figures to afford the typical rental in eight major metropolitan areas \u2014twice as many as before the pandemic,\" said Kara Ng, senior economist at Zillow. \"That means renters have less money in their budgets for essentials like groceries and transportation, or for saving for a down payment.\"",
      "The typical guidance is to spend no more than 30% of your income on rent. To put that in perspective, that's $2,500 a month for someone making $100,000. To stay below the 30% threshold, renters in the eight cities listed by Zillow need to make at least six figures.",
      "\"This Zillow data backs up what every renter has been feeling when they've been looking for an apartment or trying to renew their lease,\" said Rachel Fee, executive director of the New York Housing Conference, a nonprofit that advocates for affordable housing. \"Not just in New York City, but across the country, the cost of housing is skyrocketing and they just can't keep up.\"",
      "Here's a look at where around the country you need to earn six figures to afford the rent \u2014 plus cities where you might be able to get away with a lower salary.",
      "Most and least expensive",
      "It's no surprise that New York City tops Zillow's list. The Big Apple has in many ways has come to represent the home affordability crisis. According to the Zillow analysis, New York City dwellers need annual income of roughly $135,000 to be able to comfortably afford rent. That's nearly double the average income for a New York City renter, Fee said.",
      "The average rent in New York City is $2,950, 59% higher than the national average, according to Zillow\u00a0data. The city is doing away with broker fees starting this summer, which could give renters a bit more wiggle room when it comes to their apartment search.",
      "The second-priciest city is Boston, where renters need to earn $127,000 a year to comfortably afford rent, according to Zillow.",
      "Renters in search of more affordable metro areas can look to cities like Buffalo, New York, and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In those cities, renters need to earn less than half of what they would to live in New York and Boston \u2013 or around $55,000.",
      "Zillow's data drives home how much rents have risen in recent years. Since April 2020, monthly rent for a typical U.S. apartment has increased almost 30% to $1,858. At the same time, wage growth over that period has lagged, with median annual income rising 22.5% to roughly $82,000, according to the\u00a0Census Bureau.",
      "At the center of the problem is the nation's inadequate housing supply. Even with\u00a0hundreds of thousands of apartments being constructed each year, it's not enough to keep up with demand.",
      "\"We've seen so much pressure since the pandemic and competition for housing,\" Fee said. \"And the inventory just isn't there because, again, we're not building enough as a nation.\"",

    "summary": "The ban requires ticket sellers, hotels, vacation rental platforms and others to disclose fees and other charges up front.",
    "story": [
      "As a Biden administration ban on so-called \"junk fees\" took effect Monday, Ticketmaster said it will start displaying the full price of a ticket as soon as consumers begin shopping.",
      "Ticketmaster, long a subject of complaints about its hidden fees, was among those targeted by the new rule, which was announced in December by the Federal Trade Commission. The rule requires ticket sellers, hotels, vacation rental platforms and others to disclose processing fees, cleaning fees and other charges up front.",
      "Ticketmaster said Monday it commended the FTC's action.",
      "\"Ticketmaster has long advocated for all-in pricing to become the nationwide standard so fans can easily compare prices across all ticketing sites,\" Ticketmaster Chief Operating Officer Michael Wichser said in a statement.",
      "Additional improvements",
      "Ticketmaster said it will also tell shoppers where they are in line when they log in to buy tickets to an event. It will also give real-time updates to customers whose wait times exceed 30 minutes, letting them know ticket price ranges, availability and whether new event dates have been added.",
      "Ticketmaster, which is owned by Beverly Hills, California-based concert promoter Live Nation, is the world's largest ticket seller, processing 500 million tickets each year in more than 30 countries. Around 70% of tickets for major concert venues in the U.S. are sold through Ticketmaster.",
      "Ticketmaster said Monday's changes will bring North America in line with the rest of the world, where the full ticket price was already displayed as soon as customers started shopping.",
      "Cracking down on bots",
      "The company also says it plans to step up its fight against\u00a0ticket bots, or automated software used by resellers to bulk-buy mass quantities of tickets. Complaints about these systems came to a head during the November 2022 presale to\u00a0Taylor Swift's Eras tour, when its site crashed during a presale event for Taylor Swift's upcoming stadium tour.",
      "The company at the time said its site was overwhelmed by both fans and attacks from bots, which were posing as consumers in order to scoop up tickets and sell them on secondary sites. Thousands of people lost tickets after waiting for hours in an online queue.",
      "\"We now block an average of 200 million bot attempts every day, stopping them from stealing tickets meant for real fans,\" Ticketmaster said in a statement. \"In 2024 alone, we blocked over 53 billion bot attacks, a more than 5x increase from 2019.\"",
      "Monopoly trial",
      "Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice sued Ticketmaster and Live Nation, accusing them of running an illegal monopoly that drives up U.S. ticket prices and asking a court to break them up. That case is ongoing.",
      "President Donald Trump is also eyeing the industry. In March, he signed an executive order that he said will help curb ticket scalping and bring \"commonsense\" changes to the way live events are priced.",
      "Under the order, the FTC must ensure \"price transparency at all stages of the ticket-purchase process\" and take enforcement to prevent unfair, deceptive, and anti-competitive conduct.",
      "\"Anyone who's bought a concert ticket in the last decade, maybe 20 years \u2014 no matter what your politics are \u2014 knows that it's a conundrum,\" said Kid Rock, who joined Mr. Trump in the Oval Office as Mr. Trump signed the order.",

      "Wisconsin judge Hannah Dugan pleaded not guilty Thursday to\u00a0federal obstruction charges\u00a0stemming from her allegedly helping a man evade immigration authorities during a federal law enforcement operation at her courthouse.",
      "Dugan, a Milwaukee county circuit court judge, was arrested in April by the FBI after director Kash Patel said she \"intentionally misdirected federal agents away\" from an illegal immigrant who had a criminal court hearing in front of the judge and was set to be arrested after his hearing ended.",
      "A federal judge set Dugan's trial to begin the week of July 21.",
      "Dugan was charged with one count of concealing an individual to prevent arrest and obstruction, and on Tuesday a federal grand jury indicted her on those charges.",

      "According to a sworn statement by an FBI agent, Flores-Ruiz was deported from the United States in 2013 and illegally reentered the U.S. During this period, Flores-Ruiz was accused of committing battery.",
      "After a fingerprint match from Flores-Ruiz's first arrest in 2013 and a local case in Milwaukee, a warrant for his arrest and deportation was issued by ICE.",
      "While Flores-Ruiz was scheduled to appear before Dugan for a criminal court appearance, law enforcement waited outside of her courtroom to arrest him on an administrative warrant.",

      "\"Witnesses uniformly reported that Judge Dugan was visibly upset and had a confrontational, angry demeanor,\" the agent wrote. Dugan, according to witnesses, told the arrest team to go to the chief judge's office to speak with them about the permissibility of making the arrest inside the courthouse, and looked around the hallway near her courtroom to seek out other law enforcement officers who were waiting to arrest Flores-Ruiz.",
      "One agent, who Dugan did not recognize as part of the arrest team, remained in the hallway waiting for Flores-Ruiz.",
      "After that, the special agent said multiple witnesses in Dugan's courtroom saw her say, \"Wait, come with me,\" to Flores-Ruiz as he headed toward the public courtroom exit where the officers were waiting.",

    "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 10:08:17 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration's bid to enforce its birthright citizenship executive orders gives the Supreme Court an opportunity to address the soundness of nationwide injunctions.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday is considering a bid by the Trump administration to narrow three lower court orders blocking President Trump from ending birthright citizenship, in cases that test judges' power to block a president's policies nationwide.",
      "The arguments before the court, taking place in a rare May session, are the first involving a policy rolled out by Mr. Trump in his second term. But the high court is not examining the legality of the president's birthright citizenship executive order, which seeks to deny U.S. citizenship to children born to a mother or father who are in the U.S. unlawfully or on a temporary basis.",
      "Instead, the Trump administration has said district court judges overseeing three legal challenges to Mr. Trump's policy lacked the authority to issue sweeping injunctions that extend beyond the parties involved in the litigation. The plaintiffs that brought the three lawsuits are 22 states, two organizations and seven individuals, and the Justice Department is pushing for the injunctions to apply only to them.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court in favor of the administration could allow it to partially enforce the birthright citizenship measure while the litigation proceeds \u2014 but not enforce it against the plaintiffs, including residents of California, New York and 20 other states.",
      "\"This is one of a range of efforts to close the courthouse doors, to make it harder, more expensive, more complicated, slower to challenge illegal government action,\" said Cody Wofsy, deputy director of the Immigrants' Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. \"A case like birthright citizenship puts that in really stark relief where you have an executive order that is blatantly illegal, but the administration is asking the Supreme Court to make it harder for courts to protect people and vindicate constitutional rights.\"",
      "The fight over nationwide, or universal, injunctions has been simmering for years, and several of the justices themselves have indicated that the Supreme Court would have to clarify their legality.",
      "\"Universal injunctions are legally and historically dubious,\" Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a concurring opinion to the Supreme Court's 2018 decision upholding the travel ban\u00a0Mr. Trump put in place during his first term. \"If federal courts continue to issue them, this court is dutybound to adjudicate their authority to do so.\"",
      "But criticisms of these broad orders reached a fever pitch this year, as the Trump administration fends off more than 200 legal challenges targeting nearly every aspect of the president's second-term agenda, and courts around the country issue injunctions that stop his policies from taking effect.",
      "Most of these decisions have been appealed, and the Trump administration has sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court in more than a dozen cases, including over his birthright citizenship executive order. The high court left the lower court injunctions preventing implementation of the birthright citizenship policy in place for now.",
      "Among the president's other plans that have been blocked were his transgender military ban, which the Supreme Court then allowed to take effect; his effort to restrict federal funding to medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care for young people; and cuts to certain federal funds.",
      "\"The pace of universal injunctions has gotten to the point where it really is an urgent issue for the court to resolve, not just because it has meant the thwarting of the president's ability to implement the policies for which he was elected, but also because it has led to an inundation of emergency petitions to the Supreme Court as a result of these universal injunctions,\" said Joel Alicea, a law professor at the Catholic University of America.",
      "These sweeping orders have frustrated not just Mr. Trump and his agenda, but also his predecessors. A study from the Harvard Law Review published in April 2024 found that at least 127 nationwide injunctions were issued from 1963 through 2023, though most of those, 96, were entered from 2001 through 2023.",
      "In March, the Congressional Research Service identified 86 nationwide injunctions that were issued under Mr. Trump's first four years in office and 28 during former President Joe Biden's term. But the report warned that it is \"not possible to provide a single definitive count of nationwide injunctions.\"",
      "As to Mr. Trump's second term, the Congressional Research Service identified 17 nationwide injunctions issued during his first two months back in office. The Trump administration estimates there have been at least 28 of these orders entered against it by judges.",
      "\"What universal injunction practice effectively means is that a single district court judge has a veto over the president's national policy and because there are 94 district courts in the country, that means that you have 94 opportunities in theory to shut down any given national policy,\" Alicea said. \"That is a recipe for genuine paralysis in terms of national policy-making and in a way that subverts the separation of powers because single district court judges were never supposed to have this kind of authority to stop national policy in its tracks.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and his allies have attacked by name the judges issuing these decisions, and his administration has extended that battle to the relief they are granting. In a filing in one of the birthright citizenship cases, the Justice Department said universal injunctions have reached \"epidemic\" proportions since Mr. Trump returned to the White House in January.",
      "\"Those injunctions thwart the executive branch's crucial policies on matters ranging from border security, to international relations, to national security, to military readiness,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote. \"They repeatedly disrupt the operations of the Executive Branch up to the Cabinet level.\"",
      "Republicans in Congress have also taken up the cause against universal injunctions. The GOP-controlled House in April passed a bill that would restrict district court judges from issuing broad injunctive relief. It's unclear whether the measure will pass the Republican-led Senate, where 60 votes are needed for legislation to advance.",
      "But Wofsy, of the ACLU, said the number of lawsuits and injunctions stems from the volume of executive actions taken by the president in the opening months of his second term.",
      "\"The administration has been subject to so many nationwide injunctions and injunctions more generally because it's doing an incredible volume of illegal things, and that is not a reason to take away a tool that the judiciary has to check executive authority. It's the opposite,\" he said. \"Now more than ever it is vital that the judiciary is a strong and robust check against illegal executive actions.\"",
      "The Supreme Court may not stop universal injunctions altogether but could curtail them, as there are instances where relief naturally extends beyond the parties involved in a case. Take, for example, a landowner who sues a factory for polluting a river. In that instance, an injunction that orders the factory to stop would benefit all who live along it, not just the single plaintiff.",
      "\"The basic principle here is courts may only issue injunctions that are as broad as necessary to remedy the plaintiff's asserted harm,\" Alicea said. \"Sometimes that will require an injunction that gives protection even to nonparties as an incidental result of giving protection to the actual plaintiff.\"",
      "If the Supreme Court does curtail judges' ability to enter universal injunctions, courts could still enter tailored relief. Plaintiffs seeking to represent a broader group of people could also file class-action lawsuits. In the context of the birthright citizenship case, a class-action lawsuit could be brought by affected pregnant women in the U.S. illegally and children at risk of losing their right to U.S. citizenship, the Trump administration has argued.",
      "But Wofsy said class-action lawsuits, like nationwide injunctions, are one of many tools available to federal courts and may not be appropriate in every case.",

    "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 09:42:02 -0400",
    "summary": "The Environmental Protection Agency says it will roll back limits on several types of \"forever chemicals\" in drinking water.",
    "story": [
      "The Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday that it plans to weaken limits on some \"forever chemicals\" in drinking water that were finalized last year, while maintaining standards for two common ones.",
      "The Biden administration set the first federal drinking water limits for PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, finding they increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and babies being born with low birth weight. Those limits were expected to reduce PFAS levels in drinking water for millions of people.",
      "Commonly called \"forever chemicals,\"\u00a0PFAS\u00a0are found nearly everywhere \u2014 in air,\u00a0water\u00a0and soil \u2014 and can take thousands of years to break down in the environment.",
      "Limits on three types of PFAS, including so-called GenX substances found in North Carolina, will be scrapped and reconsidered by the agency, as will a limit on a mixture of several types of PFAS.",
      "The Biden administration's rule also set standards for the two common types of PFAS, referred to as PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion, effectively the lowest level at which they can be reliably detected. The EPA will keep those standards in place, but give utilities two extra years \u2014 until 2031 \u2014 to comply and treat for the chemicals.",
      "\"We are on a path to uphold the agency's nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water. At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance,\" said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.",
      "The development was first reported by The Washington Post.",
      "It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for certain, newer types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration's limits. But the vast majority of utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.",
      "Health advocates praised the Biden administration for the tight limits. But water utilities took issue with the rule, saying treatment systems are expensive to install and that customers will end up paying more for water. The utilities sued the EPA.",
      "The EPA's actions align with some of the arguments utilities made in their lawsuit. They argued that the EPA lacked the authority to regulate a mixture of PFAS and said the agency didn't properly support limits on several newer types of PFAS that are now rescinded. They also asked for the now-granted two-year extension.",
      "Erik Olson, a senior strategic director of health at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, said the move is illegal. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit contaminants in drinking water and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.",
      "\"With a stroke of the pen, EPA is making a mockery of the Trump administration's promise to deliver clean water for Americans,\" Olson said.",
      "President Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks. The EPA plans to loosen regulations for greenhouse gas emissions, cleanup standards for coal plant waste and car emission limits, among many other clean air and water rules.",
      "Zeldin's history with PFAS is more nuanced; during his time as a New York congressman, he supported legislation to regulate forever chemicals.",
      "Manufactured by companies like Chemours and 3M, PFAS were incredibly useful in many applications \u2014 among them, helping clothes to withstand rain and ensuring that firefighting foam snuffed out flames. But the chemicals also accumulate in the body. As science advanced in recent years, evidence of harm at far lower levels became clearer.",
      "The Biden-era EPA estimated the rule will cost about $1.5 billion to implement each year. Water utility associations say the costly rules, combined with recent mandates to replace harmful lead pipes, will raise residents' bills and fall hardest on small communities with few resources.",
      "The Biden administration did work to address cost concerns. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $9 billion for chemicals like PFAS and utilities have won multibillion-dollar settlements against PFAS polluters that will help.",
      "Some utilities have been surprised to find out they are over the limits.",
      "\"This gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time. Some utilities are just finding out now where they stand and that's almost too late already for 2029,\" said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry communications firm.",
      "But what utilities really wanted was a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water global practice leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith. He suspects the utility industry will continue to sue over those limits. Dissatisfied environmental groups will likely file challenges, too.",
      "Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group, said utilities may not have to install treatment that's as broadly effective if they just have to focus on two types of older PFAS.",
      "\"You really reduce what utilities have to do to make sure that the other, newer generation PFAS are captured,\" she said.",
      "When the Biden administration announced its rule, the head of the EPA traveled to North Carolina and was introduced by activist Emily Donovan, who said she was grateful for the first federal standards. She had long campaigned for tougher rules for GenX substances that had contaminated a local river.",
      "Now the EPA says it will roll back those GenX limits.",
      "\"This current administration promised voters it would 'Make America Healthy Again' but rescinding part of the PFAS drinking water standards does no such thing,\" she said.",

    "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 06:00:11 -0400",
    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Stephanie Haines, a Trump nominee, ruled the president is legally allowed to use the 18th-century law to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of belonging to the gang Tren de Aragua.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's push to remove people from the U.S. using the wartime Alien Enemies Act got a rare stamp of approval from a federal judge this week, as one of the more controversial parts of Mr. Trump's immigration strategy faces a slew of court challenges.",
      "U.S. District Judge Stephanie Haines of Pennsylvania, a Trump nominee, ruled Tuesday the president is legally allowed to use the 18th-century law to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of belonging to the gang Tren de Aragua. However, Haines also said the administration hasn't given people facing Alien Enemies Act removal enough notice to bring court challenges.",
      "The ruling is fairly narrow: The case only applies to one person, a Venezuelan man who was arrested in central Pennsylvania and moved to Texas. But it further complicates a nationwide battle over the Alien Enemies Act, which Mr. Trump has used to rapidly expel hundreds of migrants and send them to a supermax prison in El Salvador.",
      "What is the Alien Enemies Act?",
      "The Alien Enemies Act of 1798 says the government can remove people during an invasion or a \"predatory incursion\" launched by a foreign nation. Prior to this year, the law had been invoked three times in history, during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.",
      "In all other cases, the law has been used for citizens of countries at war with the United States. But the Trump administration argued in a March proclamation that accused Tren de Aragua members count as \"alien enemies,\" claiming the gang \u2014 which Mr. Trump has deemed a foreign terrorist group \u2014 has extensive links to the Venezuelan government.",
      "The use of the Alien Enemies Act has drawn controversy, with critics arguing the administration hasn't given people an opportunity to challenge their cases in court. Many of the migrants who were sent to a Salvadoran prison don't have clear criminal records, CBS News' \"60 Minutes\" found last month. The Trump administration has stood by its use of the law, casting it as a necessary step to crack down on crime by the notorious Tren de Aragua.",
      "Why does the judge say the Trump administration can use the Alien Enemies Act?",
      "Haines wrote on Tuesday the Alien Enemies Act can apply to Tren de Aragua members. The judge defined a \"predatory incursion\" as a \"hostile entry into the United States by a cohesive group,\" like a U.S.-designated terrorist group, with a \"common goal of causing significant disruption\" \u2014 which she said lines up with Mr. Trump's proclamation in March.",
      "Haines also deferred to Mr. Trump on the question of whether Tren de Aragua is directed by Venezuela's government, though some U.S. intelligence agencies disagree with the administration, according to a memo obtained by several news outlets.",
      "But the judge broke with the administration in one key respect: She said the government must give people facing Alien Enemies Act removal at least 21 days' notice, in both English and Spanish, so they can bring court challenges. That's far more than the 12 hours' notice Haines said the government had promised to give in the past.",
      "The case reached Haines' desk after a Venezuelan man, referred to as A.S.R., filed a habeas corpus petition last month asking her to stop the government from deporting him.",
      "The man's lawyers say he was detained by ICE agents, asked about his tattoos and accused of links to Tren de Aragua, which he strongly denies. He was later moved to Texas. The petition says the man \u2014 who entered the U.S. in 2023 and is seeking asylum \u2014 fears the government will try to use the Alien Enemies Act against him.",
      "Why is Judge Haines' Alien Enemies Act ruling unusual?",
      "Haines is the first judge to explicitly say the Trump administration can use the Alien Enemies Act to remove Venezuelan migrants, making the Pennsylvania jurist an \"outlier among all of the other federal courts,\" says Columbia Law School professor Elora Mukherjee.",
      "Judges in three other states \u2014 Texas, Colorado and New York \u2014 have blocked Alien Enemies Act removals in their court districts. In some of these cases, the judges have said outright that the Trump administration's use of the 1798 law is likely illegal, often concluding that Tren de Aragua likely isn't involved in an invasion under the law.",
      "Last week, U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein of Manhattan rejected the government's arguments. His ruling also took aim at the Trump administration for transporting hundreds of Alien Enemies Act subjects to the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador under a deal with that country's government, calling it a \"notoriously evil jail.\"",
      "Ahilan Arulanantham, a University of California, Los Angeles Law School professor who has worked on cases involving the Alien Enemies Act, called Haines' ruling \"wrong on a couple of key points.\"",
      "He says it gives too much legal weight to the fact that the Trump administration considers Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organization, calling it \"deeply misguided\" and at odds with other rulings on terrorism designations. He also believes Haines gives excessive deference to the administration on whether an invasion is taking place.",
      "\"If every group of individuals \u2026 who the U.S. government says are controlled by a foreign government can be therefore treated as an invading force, then the Alien Enemies Act power is truly unbounded,\" Arulanantham told CBS News.",
      "Georgetown Law School Professor David Super also questioned the amount of deference that Haines gave the administration, including on the questions of whether Tren de Aragua is invading the U.S. and whether the Venezuelan government is responsible.",
      "\"This is involving individual liberties, and sweeping deference to the executive to abridge individual liberties is not part of our tradition,\" Super told CBS News.",
      "Mr. Trump and his allies have defended his use of the law, arguing it's a necessary tool to deport Tren de Aragua members and halt gang violence. His March proclamation said Tren de Aragua members have \"unlawfully infiltrated the United States and are conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions against the United States.\"",
      "Tren de Aragua \"is one of the most violent and ruthless terrorist gangs on planet earth. They rape, maim and murder for sport,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has said.",
      "In court papers, the administration has argued it is \"the President's call alone\" whether the Alien Enemies Act applies, and whether the U.S. faces a \"predatory incursion\" is the type of foreign policy decision that's typically left to the president. The government's lawyers have also said the term \"predatory incursion\" can apply to Tren de Aragua members, arguing it can have a broader definition than just military action.",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Haines' ruling.",
      "What does Judge Haines' ruling mean for migrants?",
      "The ruling is fairly narrow because \u2014 at least for now \u2014 it appears to only impact the Venezuelan man who initially brought the habeas corpus petition.",
      "In an earlier ruling last month, the judge treated the case as a class action, temporarily blocking the Trump administration from removing anybody from western Pennsylvania under the Alien Enemies Act unless they've gotten 14 days' notice.",
      "But Haines wrote Tuesday that there is no evidence anyone in her court district is currently being held under the law \u2014 including the man who brought the case, since he was transferred to Texas last month. For that reason, she narrowed the case to just the one petitioner.",
      "\"My read of it is that Judge Haines' order is extremely limited,\" Mukherjee said.",
      "Mukherjee also noted that Haines' ruling still requires the administration to give migrants plenty of notice \u2014 a view that other courts have held, including the Supreme Court.",
      "\"Universally, the federal courts are trying to curb the executive branch's reliance on the Alien Enemies Act as a mechanism for swift deportations from the United States without providing meaningful due process and notice to people,\" Mukherjee said.",
      "Still, Arulanantham said the ruling will be \"enormously significant\" if it's upheld on appeal.",
      "If the government can keep using the Alien Enemies Act to remove alleged Tren de Aragua members, but those migrants can challenge their detentions in court based on the specific facts of their situation, it could \"become an enormous drain on the legal system,\" requiring judges to hold a \"mini-trial\" for each planned removal, Arulanantham said.",
      "Has the Supreme Court ruled on the Alien Enemies Act?",
      "The Supreme Court hasn't weighed in directly on the question of whether the Alien Enemies Act is being used properly, but it has said the government needs to give migrants held under the law a chance at judicial review \u2014 which Haines' ruling cites.",
      "The high court handed down that ruling in April. In the same order, the justices overturned a ruling from a Washington, D.C., judge blocking Alien Enemies Act removals \u2014 but the Supreme Court focused on whether the judge had jurisdiction over migrants held in Texas, not on whether the Trump administration was allowed to use the 1798 law.",
      "The court also temporarily blocked Alien Enemies Act rulings in one part of Texas last month, in a brief emergency order that still remains in effect.",
      "Super believes the Supreme Court is likely to weigh in on the Alien Enemies Act again \u2014 possibly before its summer recess.",
      "\"This is certainly going back to the Supreme Court sooner rather than later,\" Super said.",
      "Can the Trump administration suspend habeas corpus?",
      "Many of the cases challenging the Alien Enemies Act are brought under writs of habeas corpus \u2014 a centuries-old legal concept that grants people the right to challenge their imprisonment.",
      "Last week, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told reporters the Trump administration is \"actively looking at\" suspending habeas corpus, citing a provision of the Constitution that allows it to be suspended \"in cases of rebellion or invasion.\" That step has only been taken under extremely rare circumstances in the past, including during the Civil War.",
      "Many legal experts believe the idea of suspending habeas corpus to deal with illegal immigration is unlikely to pass legal muster. Super told CBS News the gambit would put \"an even higher burden on the administration that we are at war.\"",
      "\"Habeas corpus goes all the way back to the Magna Carta,\" Super said. \"I think courts will be very concerned about discarding a provision that is 800 years old in defense of our liberties.\"",
      "It's also widely believed that suspensions of habeas corpus must be authorized by Congress.",
      "\"There are centuries of case law on this question,\" Mukherjee said. \"If the executive branch tries to suspend habeas corpus, that would be unconstitutional and illegal, and a dramatic escalation of the authoritarian overreach of the executive branch.\"",

      "House Republicans Wednesday moved forward with a tax bill to cut billions of dollars in climate-related funding, reduce regulations and prematurely phase out clean energy tax credits as part of President Trump's \"One, Big, Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "The heart of the Republican budget legislation targets key climate and energy provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "Cuts would impact businesses and consumers, affecting renewable energy, manufacturing, energy efficiency and electric vehicles. Concurrently, House Republicans proposed streamlining permitting for fossil fuels, rescinding Clean Air Act pollution funding and allocating $2 billion to the strategic petroleum reserve.",
      "The Inflation Reduction Act has led to $321 billion worth of climate investment being completed, with $522 billion worth of investments still in process, according to a report from the Clean Investment Monitor. Congress was tasked with finding $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to fund Mr. Trump's tax cuts.",
      "House Republicans are hoping to have a floor vote next week prior to Memorial Day, after which the bill will go to the Senate.",
      "Four Republican senators wrote a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune cautioning the caucus against a \"full-scale repeal\" of tax credits, adding that repealing credits would be disruptive to businesses which had made investments based on the Inflation Reduction Act's tax framework. They also added that cuts would lead to higher energy costs.",
      "Twenty-one House Republicans wrote a similar letter\u00a0in March urging against cuts to energy credits from the Inflation Reduction Act. A 2024 CBS News report found that over 80% of Inflation Reduction Act spending and tax credits went toward Republican congressional districts.",
      "Environmental groups and renewable energy companies have been on Capitol Hill lobbying to protect tax credits they say are vital to support new industries. Raghu Belur, co-founder of Enphase Energy, a solar components manufacturer, expected changes to the IRA, but didn't expect them to go this far.",
      "\"I thought there would be a glide path, I thought there would be a reasonable transition period. Instead it's become very abrupt,\" he told CBS News.",
      "His company has manufacturing facilities in South Carolina and Texas, made possible by the Inflation Reduction Act. But Belur also worries about the downstream effects on businesses that have formed around renewable energy, like solar installers, which tend to be small businesses.",
      "Among their concerns, Belur and the Solar Energy Industries Association have been focusing on the importance of a tax credit that helps homeowners to finance solar projects. The GOP budget proposal would abruptly end the credit at the end of 2025. The credit was previously slated to be phased out by 2034. He says the credits help support customer demand for nascent businesses, and that the renewable energy sector finally had momentum that should be supported as promised at this stage of their industry.",
      "\"Fossil fuels have been receiving subsidies for the last 100-plus years,\" Belur told CBS News. \"I always believe that subsidies must be a catalyst, not a crutch, we are not asking for an infinite extension of this.\"",
      "The Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group, estimates that 75% of the affected credits and spending cuts would affect local economies in Republican districts.",
      "\"At a time when billions of dollars are being invested in states that overwhelmingly voted for President Trump, this proposed legislation will effectively dismantle the most successful industrial onshoring effort in U.S. history,\" the group said in a statement.",
      "Several tax credits and incentives are set to be phased out early or end, impacting a wide range of projects, including solar, geothermal, nuclear, wind, and hydrogen. The $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit that Mr. Trump campaigned against will be ended, as well as manufacturing credits to produce electric vehicles.",
      "Funding for other Inflation Reduction Act initiatives are also projected to be cut. Republican Rep. Brett Guthrie, the House Energy and Commerce Committee chair, wrote in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal this week that the cuts would include $6.5 billion of unspent Inflation Reduction Act funding that is earmarked for the Environmental Protection Agency's Green House Gas Reduction Fund, clean pollution reduction, clean ports and environmental justice grants.",
      "Evan Chapman, senior director of policy at Clean Tomorrow, a nonpartisan clean energy advocacy group, believes the version of the budget proposed by the GOP would make it harder to quickly increase energy production through renewables, and could lead American renewable energy industries to fall behind the rest of the world.",
      "\"This is largely a repeal of the inflation Reduction Act,\" Chapman told CBS News. \"What this bill will do is reduce the availability of energy, increase costs for energy that's coming on the grid, and make it more difficult to pull innovative American technologies that will produce clean energy towards the market.\"",

      "Ways and Means faces SALT conflict",
      "After a nearly 18-hour markup, the Ways and Means panel, which is responsible for the tax portions of the bill, advanced its portion of the legislation Wednesday morning, in a 26-19 vote. But the key sticking point, a cap on the state and local tax deduction, often referred to as SALT, appeared to go unresolved.

      "Energy and Commerce deals with Medicaid",

    "story": [
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has proposed a pause to the enrollment of more low-income immigrants without legal status for state-funded health care benefits in 2026 as the state faces economic uncertainty.",
      "Newsom outlined his nearly $332 billion state spending plan on Wednesday, revealing that California is facing a $12 billion budget deficit.",
      "\"California is under assault,\" Newsom said. \"We have a president that's been reckless in terms of assaulting those growth engines.\"",
      "The Democratic governor noted that the freeze does not mean California is backing away from its support for immigrants.",
      "\"No state has done more than the state of California, no state will continue to do more than the state of California by a long shot. And that's a point of pride,\" Newsom said.",
      "The decision, the details for which were revealed before Wednesday's budget revision presentation, is driven by a higher-than-expected price tag on the program and economic uncertainty from federal tariff policies, Newsom said. It also comes as Newsom faces his final years in the governor's office, with speculation continuing to mount about his future political prospects.",
      "California's push to offer free health care benefits to all low-income adults, regardless of their immigration status, was announced in late 2023. Newsom touted the planned expansion as \"a transformative step towards strengthening the health care system for all Californians.\"",
      "However, the cost has exceeded the state's initial $6.4 billion estimate by more than $2 billion.",
      "Still, as late as March of this year, Newsom suggested to reporters he was not considering rolling back health benefits for low-income people living in the country illegally \u2014 even with California grappling with a $6.2 billion Medicaid shortfall. He also repeatedly defended the expansion, saying it saves the state money in the long run. The program is state-funded and does not use federal dollars.",
      "Under Newsom's plan, low-income adults without legal status will no longer be eligible to apply for Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program, starting in 2026. Those who are already enrolled won't be kicked off their plans because of the enrollment freeze, and the changes won't impact children. Newsom's office didn't say how long the freeze would last.",
      "Starting in 2027, adults with \"unsatisfactory immigration status\" on Medi-Cal, including those without legal status and those who have legal status but aren't eligible for federally funded Medicaid, will also have to pay a $100 monthly premium. The governor's office said that is in line with the average cost paid by those who are on subsidized heath plans through California's own marketplace. There's no premium for most people currently on Medi-Cal.",
      "\"We believe that people should have some skin in the game as it relates to contributions,\" Newsom said.",
      "In total, Newsom's office estimated the changes will save the state $5.4 billion by 2028-2029.",
      "The Medi-Cal expansion, combined with other factors such as rising pharmacy costs and larger enrollment by older people, has forced California to borrow and authorize new funding to plug the multibillion-dollar hole earlier this year. California provides free health care to more than a third of its 39 million people.",
      "The proposals come ahead of Newsom's scheduled presentation on the updated budget. Recovery from the Los Angeles wildfires, changing federal tariff policies, and the expensive health care expansion are putting a strain on California's massive state budget. Lawmakers are expecting a multibillion-dollar shortfall this year, and more deficits are projected for several years ahead.",
      "Newsom blamed President Donald Trump's tariff policies for the shortfalls, estimating that the polices have cost the state $16 billion in tax revenues. California is also bracing for major budget hits if Republicans in Congress follow through with a plan to slash billions of dollars in Medicaid and penalize states for providing health care to immigrants without legal status.",
      "Newsom now opens budget negotiations with lawmakers and it's unclear how Democrats who control the Legislature will react to his plan to freeze new Medi-Cal enrollment for some immigrants. A final budget proposal must be signed by June. California's budget is by far the largest among states.",
      "\"This is going to be a very challenging budget,\" Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, who chairs the budget committee, said before Newsom's proposals were announced. \"We're going to have to make some tough decisions.\"",
      "The budget proposals presented this week will build on some of the impacts of federal policies, but many unknowns remain.",
      "The governor already said he's planning to scale back on baseline spending this year. Analysts and economists also warn that California will face bigger deficits in the tens of billions of dollars in the coming years due to economic sluggishness and stock market volatility brought on by the tariff war.",
      "The budget Newsom first proposed in January included little new spending. But it allows the state to fully implement the country's first universal transitional kindergarten program and increase the state's film and TV tax credit to $750 million annually to bring back Hollywood jobs that have gone to New York and Georgia. He recently called on Trump to pass a $7.5 billion film tax credit at the federal level.",
      "Last year, Newsom and the Legislature agreed to dip into the state's rainy day fund, slash spending \u2014 including a nearly 10% cut for nearly all state departments \u2014 and temporarily raise taxes on some businesses to close an estimated $46.8 billion budget deficit.",

    "published": "Wed, 14 May 2025 20:30:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump says he will move to normalize relations and lift sanctions on Syria's new government to give the country \"a chance at peace.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump met Wednesday in Saudi Arabia with Syria's interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, highlighting the stunning reversal in fortunes for a former Islamist militant with ties to al Qaeda who spent years with a U.S. government bounty on his head. Al-Sharaa's rebel forces led the charge on Damascus last year that toppled the decades-long, iron-fisted rule of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, and he has since installed himself as the head of a government presenting itself to the world as inclusive and democratic.",
      "Mr. Trump's decision to meet with al-Sharaa, after some European leaders have done the same, could be a huge boost to the new Syrian government as it tries to rebuild ties with the Western world. Those relationships have been marked by blistering sanctions and acrimony during and after the Middle Eastern nation's bloody civil war, which started in 2011.",
      "\"Young, attractive guy, tough guy, strong past,\" Mr. Trump told reporters of al-Sharaa   aboard Air Force One following the meeting.",
      "In a readout on the two leaders' meeting in Saudi Arabia, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Mr. Trump had told the Syrian leader that \"he has a tremendous opportunity to do something historic in his country,\" and urged him to join Saudi Arabia in signing onto the U.S.-backed Abraham Accords, to normalize ties with Israel.",
      "Mr. Trump also told al-Sharaa he should \"tell all foreign terrorists to leave Syria; Deport Palestinian terrorists; help the United States to prevent the resurgence of ISIS,\" and \"assume responsibility for ISIS detention centers in Northeast Syria,\" according to Leavitt.",
      "They were joined in their meeting by the host of Mr. Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia, de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, and on the phone by the President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan.",
      "The meeting came a day after Mr. Trump announced on his visit to the Saudi capital Riyadh that his administration would lift U.S. sanctions on Syria, \"to give them a chance at greatness.\"",
      "\"The sanctions were brutal and crippling, and served ... an important function, nevertheless, at the time, but now it's their [Syrians'] time to shine,\" Mr. Trump said in a speech on Tuesday. \"I say good luck, Syria. Show us something very special.\"",
      "In her readout on Wednesday, Leavitt said \"President Erdogan praised President Trump for lifting sanctions on Syria and committed to working alongside Saudi Arabia to encourage peace and prosperity in Syria. The Crown Prince also commended President Trump for his decision to lift the sanctions, calling it courageous.\"",
      "She said al-Sharaa had thanked Mr. Trump, along with MBS and Erdogan, \"for their efforts to put together the meeting, and recognized the significant opportunity presented by the Iranians leaving Syria, as well as shared U.S.-Syrian interests in countering terrorism and eliminating chemical weapons.\"",
      "The \"Iranians\" referred to by the White House appeared to be a reference to the ousted Assad regime's backers in Tehran.",
      "\"President Al-Sharaa concluded with his hope that Syria would serve as a critical link in facilitating trade between east and west, and invited American companies to invest in Syrian oil and gas,\" Leavitt said.",
      "The White House said Tuesday that Secretary of State Marco Rubio would also meet with the Syrian foreign minister in Turkey later this week.",
      "Mr. Trump became on Wednesday the first U.S. president to meet with a Syrian leader since Bill Clinton met with Assad's father Hafez al-Assad.",
      "A former insurgent, al-Sharaa ascended to power last year as Assad's government rapidly crumbled in the span of several days \u2014 bringing an abrupt end to the more than decadelong civil war that devastated Syria.",
      "Al-Sharaa previously led Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, an Islamist rebel group that fought the Assad regime and had its roots in the al Qaeda-allied Nusra Front. Al-Sharaa also participated in the insurgency against U.S. forces in Iraq in the 2000s.",
      "Until last year, the U.S. had a $10 million bounty on al-Sharaa due to his leadership of HTS, which is designated by the U.S. as a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "Syrian-American activist Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the nonprofit Syrian Emergency Task Force, is helping rebuild severed ties, and claims al-Sharaa is \"100% a changed man.\"",
      "\"I want to say, well, let's judge him by his actions,\" Mustafa told CBS News Wednesday. \"I'm not here to say any of these decisions in his checkered past is nonexistent. But the fact is, this is a changed man. And this is a person who is not interested in anything but rebuilding the country, and wants to see peace with all of the neighbors, wants to stay out of war with everyone in the Middle East.\"",
      "Despite the collapse of Assad's government, many of the intense U.S. sanctions placed on Syria during the last 13 years of Assad's reign have remained in place. The Trump administration appears to be pushing for normalized relations with the new government in Syria in the hope it can help curb Iranian influence in the country and the wider Middle East, despite al-Sharaa's roots in extremism.",
      "Saudi Arabia has also started building a relationship with al-Sharaa's government, a move that could also be aimed at limiting the influence of the kingdom's archrival Iran, which along with Russia, aided Assad in his fight against rebels during the civil war.",
      "Key U.S. ally Israel has been more wary of al-Sharaa, however, and has continued airstrikes against targets inside Syria \u2014 angering al-Sharaa's government.",
      "Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham urged caution and said the White House should go through the proper congressional channels in to ease sanctions against Syria. Graham arrived in Turkey on Tuesday to meet with U.S. and Turkish officials about the situation in Syria.",
      "\"I am very inclined to support sanctions relief for Syria under the right conditions,\" Graham said in a statement. \"However, we must remember that the current leadership in Syria achieved its position through force of arms, not through the will of its people. I know the Trump administration has provided guidance to Syrian officials about conditions that need to be met before any sanctions can be relieved.\"",
      "Graham said he was \"certain that Congress would need to be informed of changes in conditions placed on Syria and how they have met those conditions before Congress can make an informed decision on whether or not it should approve the change in designation.\" He also said Israeli officials were \"extremely concerned\" about the \"state of play in Syria.\"",
      "\"Waiving congressionally passed sanctions is a complicated process,\" Graham said. \"While I would like to empower the new players in Syria, it has to be done in a coordinated fashion with our allies \u2014 especially our friends in Israel \u2014 so that numerous security concerns can be addressed.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday for the first stop of his four-day trip to the Middle East. It is the first foreign trip of Mr. Trump's second term. It will include stops in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates later this week.",
      "The president delivered remarks at a U.S.-Saudi investment summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia's capital, as the White House announced a $600 billion investment from Saudi Arabia, including what it touted as the \"largest defense sales agreement in history.\"",

      "When the crypto mining firm American Bitcoin announced plans to go public on the Nasdaq stock exchange this week, the company called it a \"major milestone\" for a key stakeholder, Dominari Holdings \u2014 a little-known investment house that recently added a very recognizable name to its advisory board: Donald Trump Jr.",
      "It was the latest maneuver in a series of high-stakes, and potentially lucrative business deals Trump Jr. and his younger brother Eric, also a Dominari adviser, stand to benefit from.",
      "Since his father won the 2024 election, Trump Jr. has joined at least eight corporate boards or advisory committees, adding political clout and his famous family brand to companies that sell handguns, make drones, and offer healthcare services online.",
      "During President Trump's second term, his son Donald Jr. has morphed from a lower profile presence in Washington to what Trump first term press secretary Sean Spicer, who knows Trump Jr. well, describes as the \"most prominent non-elected representative of the MAGA base hands down, the number one surrogate and power player in the ecosystem outside of his father.\" The most overt symbol of that ascendence \u2013 and of the Trump family's unique blend of governing and deal-making, went public last month, with the announcement of a highly-exclusive private club, which is named\u00a0 \"Executive Branch.\"",
      "At the coming-out event, the cocktails flowed and servers passed caviar to A-list guests that included Secretary of State Marco Rubio; Attorney General Pam Bondi; Paul Atkins, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and FCC chair Brendan Carr. The Capital's buzzy newsletters revealed the club's eye-popping club membership fee: $500,000.",
      "Private clubs have long been a fixture of official Washington, where lobbyists and well-heeled donors can mingle with members of Congress and high-ranking officials.\u00a0 But this venture launched by the president's oldest son is something new \u2014 and, according to critics, serves as the latest example of how the Trump family has turbo-charged Washington's pay-to-play culture.",
      "\"I don't think there has ever been anything comparable to this use of the presidency to advance private business interests,\" said Joseph Briffaut, a law professor who specializes in government ethics at Columbia Law School.",
      "Critics fear a pay-to-play culture",
      "To government watchdogs, the members-only social club embodies what they say is an increasingly brazen mingling of private business interests and government policy.",
      "\"It's unseemly and it undermines the public's faith that the government is operating in the public interest,\" said Brett Kappel, a veteran Washington, D.C., election lawyer.",
      "Melanie Sloan, a former federal prosecutor who has for years advocated for stronger ethics rules in the nation's capital, told CBS News she views the club as a blatant play to cash in with interest groups seeking access to the Trump administration.",
      "\"This is literally members bringing money into the pockets of Donald Trump Jr, and his business partners,\" Sloan said.",
      "Trump Jr's allies disagree. They argue the extravagant membership fee actually cuts against the claim that it is a vehicle for influence peddling \u2014 because members are already so well connected.",
      "\"If your goal was to let as many people in as possible, you'd have every lobbyist in DC join,\" said one source familiar with the concept behind the club, pointing out that members who could afford the sky-high admission fee would likely already be well known in Washington's power corridors.",
      "For his part, Trump Jr. disputes suggestions that he is cashing in on his father's name or testing any ethical boundaries.",
      "\"I'm a private citizen who has been a businessman my entire life,\" he said in a statement provided to CBS News.\u00a0 \"It's laughable that the left-wing media thinks that I should lock myself in a padded room and cease what I've been doing for over 25 years to earn a living and provide for my five children,\" Trump Jr. added.",
      "The White House calls Trump Jr's private sector dealings ethically sound, pointing out that President Trump's assets are held in a trust controlled by his family",
      "The \"Executive Branch\" club is only one of the ways Trump Jr. has raised his profile during his father's second term. The president's son has rapidly expanded the family's crypto profile and continued to pursue real estate investments.\u00a0 He has also been a front-facing leader of the MAGA empire, supplanting his sister Ivanka and brother-in-law, Jared Kushner, as the most high-profile \u2014 and politically astute \u2014 Trump scion in Washington.",
      "The \"Trump bump\"",
      "The family business is a global enterprise.\u00a0 Recently, Trump Jr. made a whirlwind tour of several foreign nations, including Serbia, Hungary and Bulgaria, where he looked in on real estate interests, delivered lucrative speeches and met with government leaders, according to The New York Times.",
      "At home, Trump Jr.'s move to join a spree of corporate boards in the role of adviser or board member traces in part to his relationship with Omeed Malik, the financier and mega Trump donor who is also Trump Jr.'s co-founder in the DC social club.",
      "Just days after the election, Malik brought on Trump Jr. as a partner in his venture capital firm, 1789 Capital, which says on its website that it invests in conservative companies and eschews \"woke capitalism\" and other left-wing causes, a deal a knowledgeable source said was in the works before the election. \u00a0 Trump Jr. soon joined the boards of arms retailer GrabAGun as well as the online health care company BlinkRX, both 1789 Capital properties.",
      "It is not hard to see the impact when a company adds Trump Jr. to its board. When Dominari Holdings inc., a wealth management and banking services company, announced that it was bringing on both of the president's sons, its stock price shot up 83% to a record high, eventually settling down to 30%above where it was before Trump Jr. joined.\u00a0 Shortly thereafter, Dominari's CEO announced that the company was planning investments in AI and data centers, growth industries where the Trump administration has been massively rolling back regulations. In a company press release, CEO Kyle Wood he cited Trump Jr's and Eric Trump's \"strategic insight\" in both of those sectors.",
      "And this week, the Bitcoin mining company owned partly by Trump sons Donald Jr. and Eric engineered a listing on the NASDAQ after merging with a smaller, publicly traded mining firm called Gryphon Digital Mining Inc.\u00a0 Dominari Holdings is effectively acting as the banker for the deal and has been reaching out to potential investors.",
      "In another example of the so-called \"Trump bump,\" the stock price of Unusual Machines, a Florida-based drone manufacturer, nearly doubled when the news hit that Trump Jr. was joining the board.",
      "Unusual Machines, which manufactures its unmanned aerial vehicles and components in the US, is aiming to reduce American dependence on Chinese drones.\u00a0 But for the time being the company is reliant on Chinese parts, which means that the Trump administration's yo-yoing tariffs on China could hurt the company's bottom line. CEO Allan Evans has said he would not ask Trump Jr. to intervene with the federal government on the company's behalf for relief.",
      "\"I would never ask him to do anything or facilitate anything like that,\" Evans told the Wall Street Journal.",
      "Trump Jr. and his defenders clap back at critics who suggest his moves to join board seats and champion business interests carry the echoes of past ventures by presidential relatives like Billy Carter, Neil Bush or Hunter Biden. They call him a skilled entrepreneur with a long record of business success who has capitalized on his position by making shrewd business decisions, cultivating lucrative connections among tech and finance leaders, all while building up a powerful political operation in Washington.",
      "The Hunter Biden comparisons, in particular, have drawn a sharp response: \"He became a 'businessman' after his dad got elected,\" Trump Jr. said in a social media post. \"I joined a Venture Capital Firm that invests in private American companies - Nothing to do with the government.\"",
      "MAGA power broker",
      "\"Don Jr. was an accomplished businessman long before his father got into politics and just continues to grow,\" said Sean Spicer, who served the president as press secretary in his first term and now hosts the Sean Spicer podcast.",
      "Today, Spicer says Trump Jr. is the man to see. Spicer, who worked closely with the president's son during the first term, says has seen the evolution up close.",
      "\"If the phone rings and it's Don Jr., you better pick it up on the first ring,\" Spicer said. During the 2020 campaign Trump Jr. emerged as a potent asset for his father, stumping on the trail and fully embodying the MAGA brand.\u00a0 He flung \"red meat\" to the rapturous crowds at Trump rallies and showed an instinct for the jugular that reminded observers of Trump senior.",
      "A big part of his success, his friends say, is an ability to blend with the grassroots\u00a0 MAGA world.",
      "\"Don Jr. isn't just a billionaire's son, he's one of us,\" said Andrew Kolvet, spokesman for Turning Point USA, the pre-eminent MAGA aligned youth organization and an associate of Trump Jr.",
      "Trump Jr.'s inside and outside game makes him a unique player in Trump's Washington, his allies say -- someone with unparalleled clout within the administration who is also able to operate freely in the private sector.",
      "He has forged close ties with powerful tech titans like Elon Musk and David O. Sacks, the angel investor who was a key figure in bringing a powerful and wealthy contingent of Silicon Valley over to Trump. Sacks is currently serving as the White House Czar for both Crypto and AI.\u00a0 Last month he became Member #1 of the Executive Branch club.",

    "summary": "Democratic leadership opposed the impeachment effort by Rep. Shri Thanedar, calling it a distraction.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democratic Rep. Shri Thanedar of Michigan backed down from his attempt to force a vote on impeaching President Trump after it lacked support from his own party.",
      "The House was expected to vote Wednesday evening to table Thanedar's motion to impeach Mr. Trump for alleged high crimes and misdemeanors, which would have effectively killed it.",
      "Thanedar filed his\u00a0seven articles of impeachment\u00a0against Mr. Trump in April, but moved Tuesday to bring it up as \"privileged,\" requiring the House to act on the motion within two legislative days. But Thanedar changed course by Wednesday afternoon after having conversations with his colleagues.",
      "\"Instead, I will add to my articles of impeachment and continue to rally the support of both Democrats and Republicans to defend the Constitution with me,\" he wrote, adding that he will \"continue to pursue all avenues to put this President on notice and hold him accountable for his many impeachable crimes.\"",
      "Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, said he explained to Thanedar that \"it's not enough to be right.\"",
      "\"You need consensus,\" Raskin said. \"You need a strategy to move forward because impeachment as a constitutional matter is a mixed question of law and politics.\"",
      "Thanedar's 29-page resolution accuses Mr. Trump of obstructing justice, overriding Congress' power to appropriate funds, abusing the power of the presidency, violating First Amendment rights and unlawfully creating the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "His effort was not expected to receive much support from Democrats. The three Democrats who were listed as initial co-sponsors of the resolution when it was introduced last month quickly pulled their names after learning it was not cleared by leadership. And, Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, the Democratic caucus chair, said the move to impeach Mr. Trump was impractical because Republicans control both chambers of Congress.",
      "\"This is not the right approach we should be taking,\" Aguilar told reporters earlier Wednesday, adding that Democratic leadership would be joining Republicans in voting to block the attempt.",
      "Aguilar said Democrats are focused on Republican attempts to cut Medicaid through the reconciliation process as they seek to slash spending to pay for trillions in tax cuts.",
      "\"Everything else is a distraction,\" Aguilar said.",
      "Thanedar acknowledged the hesitancy in his party to impeach Mr. Trump in a news conference Wednesday morning, but defended his action as something supported by the public and said that he would continue pushing the issue \"until we have a victory.\"",
      "\"Many people in my party and elsewhere say, 'Is this the right time to do this?,\" he said. \"People all over the country are saying this is the right time to do it!\"",
      "\"Some Democrats have called me a lunatic, just like the president has called me lunatic,\" he said. \"Nobody has said to me, 'Mr. Thanedar, the seven articles of impeachment that you presented to the U.S. Congress, they're piece of s***. They're not good. You missed the point.'\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, called the effort an \"embarrassing political stunt.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was impeached twice during his first term \u2014 in 2019 for his efforts to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate his political rival Joe Biden, and again in 2021 for the Capitol riot. The Senate voted to acquit him in both cases.",
      "Thanedar is not the only Democrat to push for Mr. Trump to be impeached again. Rep. Al Green of Texas has repeatedly threatened to file his own articles of impeachment against the president during his second term but has yet to do so.",

    "summary": "Sen. Amy Klobuchar is set to argue President Trump is \"disregard[ing] the rule of law\" and his tariff policies will leave small businesses as \"roadkill,\" according to excerpts obtained by CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar is set to give a speech on the rule of law and what she paints as President Trump's overreach on Wednesday night, as Democrats look to find effective messaging that will resonate with voters about the early days of the Republican's second term in the White House.",
      "Excerpts obtained by CBS News ahead of the event hosted by The New Republic show Klobuchar, a leading Senate Democrat who has not ruled out a 2028 presidential run, plans to make the case that \"Donald Trump is trying to remake the executive office into one that is immune from outside accountability.\"",
      "\"He's engaging in unprecedented overreach that disregards the rule of law and pretends as if the independent judiciary is a bug rather than a feature of our system,\" the Minnesota senator plans to say, according to the excerpts.",
      "Mr. Trump's first months since he returned to the White House have found the president and his allies leaning heavily on executive power. His administration has clashed with Democrats over its attempts at curtailing spending already approved by Congress and has\u00a0tangled with multiple\u00a0federal judges\u00a0over immigration.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai responded to Klobuchar's planned remarks by criticizing Democrats over the legal cases Trump faced during the 2024 cycle and the party's immigration policies.",
      "\"The Trump administration will continue to legally use every lever of power granted to the Executive Branch by the Constitution and Congress to finally put Americans and America First,\" Desai said in an email.",
      "Klobuchar, who is the leading Democrat on the Senate's agriculture committee and served as the Hennepin County Attorney in Minnesota before being elected to Washington, is also expected to try to put a real-world face on what she views as the impact of tariffs during Mr. Trump's second term.",
      "\"Who's the roadkill with Trump's tariffs?\" Klobuchar's excerpts show. \"The small businesses. The small farmers. The consumers who are facing a $4,000 tariff tax.\"",
      "Mr. Trump recently took to social media and defended his tariff policy, writing that \"the very STUPID Democrats are doing everything within their power to disparage what is happening. They are totally unhinged, and have lost all levels of Confidence. It is a financial REVOLUTION, and they are being Crushed.\"",
      "Minnesota's senior senator is viewed as a potential 2028 presidential candidate, after a 2020 primary run that saw her finish a strong and surprising third in the New Hampshire primary only to face struggles expanding her base of support shortly afterward. Klobuchar has not indicated whether she will seek the presidency in 2028, but did not explicitly rule out running when asked by \"Meet The Press\" moderator Kristen Welker on Sunday.",
      "Since her 2020 campaign, Klobuchar's political power has risen in Washington while she's also maintained a major focus on antitrust issues, a topic that is also interwoven into her approach during her upcoming remarks on Wednesday.",
      "\"We hear that phrase a lot these days \u2013 the rule of law. With our economy heading toward a cliff, you may ask \u2013 \"Why is this important to me?\" It's a legitimate question,\" Klobuchar is set to say Wednesday. \"My answer? Everything we hold faith in across this country \u2014 including our economy \u2014 is glued together by law.\"",
      "Klobuchar's speech comes as intrigue continues to swirl about who truly is the leader of the Democratic party after the setbacks the left faced in the 2024 election. Democrats are looking to chart a path forward after last fall's election saw the party lose the White House and Senate and fail to retake the House. At the same time, there's clear tension within the base of the party about the best way to politically challenge Mr. Trump after his convincing win in November.",
      "Even though national Democrats struggled in 2024, the Minnesota senator is fresh off a strong political performance in her home state.",
      "Last year, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris won Minnesota by more than 4 points, in what amounted to a surprisingly close result in a state that has not voted for a Republican for president since Richard Nixon in 1972. Klobuchar in turn performed far better than the top of the Democratic ticket in Minnesota as she successfully ran for a fourth term, winning around 135,000 more votes than Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.",

    "published": "Wed, 14 May 2025 16:34:13 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump is now seeking to implement the idea through an executive order.",
    "story": [
      "Senate Democrats and the Biden administration dropped plans to set drug price caps based on the amount paid in other high-income countries, during talks years ago to push through the law that empowered Medicare to negotiate down the cost of prescription medications.",
      "A version of the idea was revived by President Trump in the executive order signed Monday, which called on the Department of Health and Human Services next month to draw up regulations to impose price restrictions tied to lower amounts paid in other developed nations, if drugmakers did not voluntarily reduce what they were charging in the U.S.",
      "\"Democrats could have done this a long time ago. They have fought like hell, for the drug companies. And they knew they were doing the wrong thing,\" Mr. Trump told reporters, speaking at a White House event to announce the move.",
      "For Democrats on Capitol Hill, this kind of approach to price controls has roots in a bill their own party successfully passed under House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2019.",
      "As part of giving Medicare the ability to negotiate the price of costly drugs it covered, the bill passed by House Democrats wanted the maximum price to be tied to an average based on prices paid in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom.",
      "\"We were hoping to get Trump. Trump said, 'I want to negotiate.' But then Republicans in Congress got to him,\" said Wendell Primus, who served for nearly two decades as Pelosi's top aide on health policy.",
      "The bill did not make it through the Senate at the time, which was controlled by Mr. Trump's party. After Democrats flipped control of the Senate, the idea ran into headwinds years later, as Biden aides and lawmakers tried to incorporate the measure into the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "Multiple Democrats involved in the talks on Capitol Hill at the time blamed a series of meetings in early 2021 with the staff from the Senate Finance Committee and party leadership for scuttling the idea.",
      "Staff on the committee said that they were worried that moderate Democrats like then-Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona would not support the bill if it included the measure, Primus said. Menendez and Sinema are no longer in the Senate.",
      "\"Members did not want to have something referencing foreign countries. They wanted it to make a function of the manufacturer's price here, what drug companies were offering to commercial insurers,\" Primus said.",
      "One former Biden White House aide involved in the talks said that there were several senators who understood that drug prices were too high, but they worried those price caps could undercut innovation from drugmakers in the U.S.",
      "Instead, the deal struck by lawmakers and White House aides to pass the law in 2022 ultimately turned to a different formula: capping them using calculations based on the price previously paid by Medicare and a fixed discount off the list price in the private U.S. market.",
      "\"President Biden and Democrats in Congress cared about getting something done, and so there was a compromise on the table that wasn't perfect, but it was going to make a huge amount of difference. And so that's the law they ultimately enacted,\" said Christen Linke-Young, deputy director of the White House Domestic Policy Council under Mr. Biden.",
      "Medicare has gone on to implement the law, resulting in talks that are continuing under the current Trump administration to lower the maximum price that the federal insurance program will pay for a growing list of costly drugs.",
      "\"It's a good thing for prescription drug costs in this country to be lower, we need to continue to work on that. And one of the ways to do that is actually put a proposal before Congress and get it enacted, so it has the force of law,\" said Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under Mr. Biden.",
      "Meanwhile, as the White House was working with their allies in Congress to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration moved to formally scrap a bid by Mr. Trump to impose caps tied to lower prices in other high-income countries using executive power during his first term.",
      "Called the \"most favored nation\" model, Trump officials had directed Medicare to only reimburse hospitals and clinics for some costly drugs based on the lowest price paid for in other high-income countries.",
      "CMS under Mr. Biden ultimately rescinded that move in 2022, after a legal fight that had blocked the proposal on the grounds that the Trump administration had unlawfully shortcutted the normal rulemaking steps to finalize the policy.",
      "\"The proposal was always pretty transparently illegal. The statute says that Medicare has to pay for prescription drugs in one particular way, and the Trump administration proposal was that we are going to ignore the statute and pay for drugs in an entirely different way. If the statute allowed that, a president before Donald Trump would have done it,\" Linke-Young said.",
      "A White House official under Mr. Trump disagreed with the accusation that their initial proposal was unlawful, arguing that the initial authority they used for the \"demonstration\" model in Medicare used powers that were broadly written by Democrats.",
      "While they are not planning to go down the exact same path, the official said, saying that they \"learned certain things from that first demonstration,\" the Trump administration believes they \"absolutely have that authority in our pocket.\"",
      "\"We are confident that we have authorities within our government programs to do this. And any dispute from the Biden administration is an intentional misinterpretation of the statute for political reasons, because they are the ones that walked away,\" the White House official said.",
      "Trump administration officials have painted their second run at the \"most favored nation\" idea as even broader in scope than their first term, which had been limited to only some costly drugs administered by healthcare providers through Medicare Part B.",
      "The White House official said Wednesday that they \"firmly believe\" they have the ability to pursue wider actions to push drugmakers to lower their prices within Medicare. They cited other authorities in the law being considered like section 402, which affords HHS powers to \"develop and engage in experiments\" which could affect payment rates in Medicaid as well.",
      "Asked this week on Fox Business Network whether the president's promise of steep drug price cuts would also extend to Medicare Part D, which covers the broad swath of prescriptions filled at drug store pharmacies, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said \"they absolutely will.\"",
      "\"They'll apply to Medicare, and they'll apply in the private market as well,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Asked Tuesday whether he supported the president's plan, Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he thought \"it'll be the subject of probably multiple lawsuits, and I think the courts will probably have something to say about it.\"",

    "summary": "Challenges to President Trump's use of emergency power to impose sweeping tariffs cite legal doctrines that have been embraced by the conservative Supreme Court justices.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Legal challenges to President Trump's tariffs could put the president on a collision course with a Supreme Court that he shaped, as his use of emergency power to unilaterally impose the levies could run into legal doctrines championed by the conservative justices to limit executive authority.",
      "Several things have to happen before the Supreme Court would consider the legality of Mr. Trump's tariffs: the losing party in a lawsuit challenging his tariffs would have to appeal all the way up to the high court, and at least four justices would then have to agree to review the lower court's decision. The high court would then have to decide the case on the merits, rather than a procedural issue.",
      "But if that were to occur, the president could face skepticism from its six-member conservative wing \u2014 which includes three justices he appointed \u2014\u00a0 as the cases raise doctrines that have been embraced by the conservative legal movement and invoked by the justices themselves in other cases: the major questions doctrine and nondelegation doctrine.",
      "\"If this issue gets to the Supreme Court, which is a big if, and if it comes down to the major questions doctrine or the nondelegation doctrine, and those are big ifs as well, we believe the court's precedent requires them to rule in our favor,\" said Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University, who is involved in a lawsuit brought by the Liberty Justice Center on behalf of a group of small businesses in the U.S. Court of International Trade.",
      "That suit is one of at least six court battles targeting Mr. Trump's tariffs, which he has rolled out through a series of executive orders starting in February. The most sweeping tariffs were announced in April on what the White House has called \"Liberation Day,\" when the president imposed a 10% baseline tariff on nearly all U.S. trading partners and higher \"reciprocal tariffs\" on imports from 57 countries, which are now largely paused.",
      "The tariffs have been in flux as the Trump administration has sought to engage in trade negotiations with countries to possibly lessen their burden.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump announced a framework for an agreement with the United Kingdom, which would leave in place 10% tariffs on imports from the country. Then, on Sunday, the White House said that the U.S. and China had agreed to a temporary easing of tariffs following negotiations between the two countries over the weekend.",
      "The reductions would lessen the U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports to roughly 30%, while levies on American goods would drop to 10%.",
      "While the president has said that there are more deals in the works, he hasn't unveiled any additional agreements yet. Meanwhile, the lawsuits are moving forward. The U.S. Court of International Trade on Tuesday weighed a temporary bid to block the tariffs in one of the cases, which was the first major test of their legality.",
      "The court battles may be brought by different parties, but several of them invoke the major questions and nondelegation doctrines in arguing that the tariffs cannot stand.",
      "Major questions doctrine",
      "Under the major questions doctrine, Congress must give clear authorization for a federal agency to decide an issue of major political or economic significance \u2014 a view that conservatives on the court have often cited in recent years to limit\u00a0federal agency actions.",
      "In the suit that Somin is involved in, the small businesses are challenging Mr. Trump's authority to unilaterally impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. The plaintiffs argue that his attempt to use the law violates the major questions doctrine because Congress did not \"speak clearly in granting such a broad and consequential power to upend the global economy.\"",
      "IEEPA makes no mention of the words tariffs or taxes, and no other president has used the law to impose levies on trading partners. The law gives the president the authority to impose economic sanctions, such as freezing foreign assets, after declaring a national emergency. Mr. Trump has declared that persistent trade deficits pose a national emergency and said the 10% baseline tariffs will remain in place until he determines that the threat posed by trade deficits is resolved.",
      "In another lawsuit, led by the stationary company Simplified, lawyers with the New Civil Liberties Alliance argue that because Mr. Trump's executive orders present a question of major political and economic significance, the major questions doctrine requires the president to show that IEEPA clearly gives him the power to impose tariffs. Mr. Trump, the suit alleges, cannot make that showing.",
      "\"Under the major questions doctrine, the court says that if Congress is going to delegate a significant power to the executive branch, we expect to see something pretty clear about it,\" said Andrew Morris, one of the NCLA lawyers representing Simplified. \"This is as big as it gets. This is restructuring the entire tariff framework for every country.\"",
      "Both the NCLA and the Liberty Justice Center are conservative-backed public interest law firms.",
      "The Peterson Institute for International Economics, a research organization, estimated in February \u2014 after the president rolled out his first round of levies \u2014 that Mr. Trump's tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China would cost the typical U.S. household more than $1,200 annually.\u00a0The president's 25% tariffs on most imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as a 10% increase in tariffs on products from China proposed by Mr. Trump at the time, mark the \"largest tax increase in at least a generation,\" the organization said in a\u00a0report.",
      "Separately, the Tax Foundation found that Mr. Trump's current tariff regime will raise $2.1 trillion in revenue over the next 10 years and reduce U.S. gross domestic product by 0.7%.",
      "That economic impact is at least as significant, and likely much larger, than actions that the Supreme Court has previously ruled were \"major questions\" that required a clear statement by Congress to authorize the executive action, the companies involved in the lawsuits say. Those efforts include former President Joe Biden's attempt to cancel roughly $400 billion in student loan debt and a COVID-era vaccine mandate for companies with more than 100 employees, both of which were blocked by the Supreme Court.",
      "\"Here, we have an obvious major question in that this is the biggest trade war since the Great Depression. It makes previous cases look small by comparison,\" Somin said. \"To put it mildly, it is very far from clear that Congress delegated that kind of sweeping power to the president here.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued in court filings that Congress, through IEEPA, delegated to the president the power to regulate importation through tariffs under specific circumstances. Justice Department lawyers have also said the major questions doctrine does not apply to presidential actions, especially those involving national security and foreign affairs.",
      "Nondelegation doctrine",
      "If a case involving Mr. Trump's tariffs makes it to the Supreme Court and if the high court declines to apply the major questions doctrine, lawyers say the levies also violate the nondelegation doctrine, a long dormant legal concept rooted in the separation of powers.",
      "Under that principle, Congress cannot delegate its legislative powers to executive branch agencies. The nondelegation doctrine was last invoked by the Supreme Court in two cases during the New Deal era, but some members of the Supreme Court have advocated for reviving it.",
      "The high court has the chance to do that through a case challenging the constitutionality of a Federal Communications Commission's mechanism for expanding phone and internet access to low-income and rural communities. But following oral arguments in March, the high court appeared skeptical of the effort to invalidate the fund.",
      "In the tariff fights playing out in the courts, the plaintiffs argue that even if IEEPA granted the president broad, unlimited authority to issue tariffs worldwide, it would be an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. Congress has the power to tax and regulate commerce with foreign nations, and IEEPA does not have an \"intelligible principle\" that limits the president's authority in slapping tariffs on imports, they say.",
      "\"If Congress passed this emergency statute that permits the president to rewrite tariff law from top to bottom and change it on a whim \u2014 set it at 10% across the board then 125% for China, then increase it, then pause it, then put it back in place \u2014 if Congress can give that to the president, there's no limitation on the power passed along,\" Morris said. \"That's a problem.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has notched some significant wins before the Supreme Court, and the court's conservative 6-3 majority may be sympathetic to some of his assertions of executive power, such his firings of independent agency heads.",
      "But the Supreme Court's recent decisions \u2014 and writings from the justices \u2014 foreshadow that it could view his use of emergency power to unilaterally levy tariffs on goods from nearly every country as a step too far.",
      "\"One of the benefits of being a justice is you can reverse or ignore precedents,\" Somin said, \"but if you follow your own doctrines consistently, the outcome in this case should be pretty clear.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Senate Democrats will hold hearings next week on the dramatic overhaul at the Department of Health and Human Services amid widespread terminations that have drawn questions about the functioning of key health programs.",
      "The hearings, led by Democratic Sens. Peter Welch of Vermont and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, will center on the impact of the restructuring, featuring testimony from former officials from agencies under the HHS umbrella, including the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the National Institute of Health, among others.",
      "A sweeping restructuring ordered by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has played out in recent weeks, with department-wide layoffs at health agencies. HHS announced in March that it aimed to reduce its employees by nearly 25% with layoffs, buyouts and early retirement offers.",
      "The restructuring came after thousands of probationary workers at health agencies received termination letters in February amid a government-wide effort by the Elon Musk-helmed Department of Government Efficiency to cut recently hired or promoted employees, before the firings were put on pause amid court intervention. And earlier this month, HHS moved for a second time to fire probationary employees, in what an HHS spokesperson said was the \"the final step of the process.\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Welch called the HHS overhaul an \"assault on the structures that provide scientific research, that are engaged in disease prevention, that are engaged in the delivery of health.\"",
      "\"You've got a Health and Human Service Secretary in Robert Kennedy who is on a destructive rampage, tearing apart institutional structures that have been in place to help us with the science and research and delivery of healthcare in this country,\" Welch added.",
      "The widespread restructuring has raised concerns about some key health agency functions, like monitoring food and drug safety and preparing for the next pandemic, with cuts hitting the FDA and CDC, while also impacting departments that handle mental health, federal poverty guidelines and other services. Some of the layoff notices were ultimately revoked.",
      "Still, Kennedy told CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook last month that things were going according to plan, noting that the agency had grown in the past four years, and \"these reductions just bring it down to pre-COVID levels.\"",
      "\"What this reorganization is meant to do is to eliminate the redundancies, to streamline the agency, and to reorient it so that we are trying to make America healthy,\" Kennedy said.",
      "The HHS secretary returned Wednesday to Capitol Hill, appearing before congressional committees for the first time since his arduous confirmation process.",
      "Last month, the leaders of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee requested testimony about Kennedy's \"reorganization\" of HHS in a letter, citing his commitment to come before the committee on a quarterly basis \u2014 a commitment that GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a medical doctor, outlined following his decision to deliver Kennedy the key support he needed to become secretary, despite consternation over his record on vaccines.",
      "Cassidy said in his opening statement at Wednesday's hearing, which focused on the White House's proposed budget, that \"people fear change even when it's from worse to better. But without a clearly defined plan or objective, people assume the worst.\"",
      "\"Americans need direct reassurance from the administration and from you, Mr. Secretary, that these reforms will make their lives easier, not harder,\" Cassidy said.",
      "Democrats derided Kennedy's nomination during the confirmation process, and Welch, who sits on the committee that ultimately advanced Kennedy's nomination said at the time that \"it's hard, in many ways, to see how we could do worse.\"",
      "Three months later, Welch said Kennedy has \"exceeded my low expectations.\"",

      "Alexandria, Virginia \u2014\u00a0 A federal judge on Wednesday ordered the immediate release of a Georgetown University researcher who was detained by immigration authorities in March as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on activists across college campuses.",
      "U.S. District Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles ordered the release of Badar Khan Suri, an Indian national and postdoctoral associate who was studying and teaching at Georgetown on a student visa and who is currently detained by ICE in Texas. Giles found that Suri's detention violated his First Amendment and Fifth Amendment rights.",
      "Suri is married to a U.S. citizen whose father was a government official and advisor in Gaza.",
      "The government cited his alleged \"close connections\" to a Hamas official as justification for revoking the visa, saying he was \"actively spreading Hamas propaganda.\" In March, Suri was surrounded and detained by masked Homeland Security agents as he was returning to his home in Rosslyn, Virginia, after breaking his fast for Ramadan.",
      "One day after he was taken into custody, Giles blocked the government from deporting Suri as court proceedings played out.",
      "ACLU Attorney Sophia Gregg called Suri's detention an \"ongoing infringement\" on his constitutional rights that \"chills the speech of millions and millions\" across the country who are protesting the ongoing war in Gaza.",
      "In a statement after the ruling, the ACLU's legal director in Virginia Eden Heilman called Suri's detention an \"unprecedented attack by this administration designed to punish students and academics for their views.\"",
      "The Justice Department, as it did in the cases of other students who were detained for what the government has classified as \"illegal protests,\" said that only immigration judges could free Suri and that the government had a right to detain him until his removal proceedings were finalized.",
      "Giles disagreed with their arguments.",
      "\"The government has consistently made that argument across multiple jurisdictions,\" Giles said. \"No one has adopted that.\" She said in her order from the bench that she has jurisdiction to free Suri while his habeas proceedings play out in Virginia and his removal proceedings continue.",
      "Giles also refuted the government's claims that he has ties to Hamas through his father-in-law.",
      "Despite public statements from the White House and other Trump administration officials about Suri, his wife and father-in-law, Giles said \"there was no evidence submitted to this court regarding statements that he made,\" in support of Hamas.",
      "\"I join several other courts... that speech regarding the conflict [in Gaza] and opposing Israel's military actions are likely protected First Amendment speech,\" Giles said, adding that she finds Suri's \"detention and apprehension was caused by his speech.\"",
      "Earlier this month, Giles ruled that she has appropriate jurisdiction in the case and that the Eastern District of Virginia is the proper venue, siding with Suri's attorneys despite a Justice Department argument that the case should be moved to Texas, where Suri is detained.",
      "In their initial court filings, Suri's attorneys said his detention is \"unjustified\" and violates his due process rights. They argued that the Trump administration's targeting of noncitizens for removal based on protected speech, namely his and his wife's views of Israel and Gaza, is \"arbitrary and capricious\" and constitutes viewpoint discrimination. They said that he has no criminal record and has not been charged with any crime.",
      "The complaint alleged that the couple had \"long been doxxed and smeared\" online by an \"anonymously-run blacklisting site\" known as The Canary Mission. The site alleges that Saleh, who Suri's attorneys said is a U.S. citizen, \"has worked for Hamas, expressed support for Hamas terrorism and called for Israel's destruction,\" according to a profile dedicated to her on the site. The Canary Mission, the complaint said, runs a blacklist of individuals who its creators believe support Palestinian rights and \"is infamous for bullying, slandering, and defaming academics and students.\" The complaint also alleges that the couple were \"smeared\" by other websites.",
      "A Georgetown University spokesperson said Suri obtained his visa \"to continue his doctoral research on peacebuilding in Iraq and Afghanistan.\"",
      "\"We are not aware of him engaging in any illegal activity, and we have not received a reason for his detention,\" the school spokesperson told CBS News. \"We support our community members' rights to free and open inquiry, deliberation and debate, even if the underlying ideas may be",
      "difficult, controversial or objectionable. We expect the legal system to adjudicate this case fairly.\"",
      "Giles ordered Suri's release with no bond and no conditions, finding that he was not a flight risk or a danger to the community.",

    "story": [
      "The head of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health and a handful of teams at the agency had their layoff notices rescinded Tuesday, multiple officials say, and several worker safety programs that had been eliminated by layoffs last month are being restored.",
      "Letters reversing the layoffs arrived in the inboxes of some NIOSH staff a day ahead of House and Senate hearings Wednesday with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. where he was expected to face questions about the layoffs.",
      "Health officials and scientists being brought back to work include everyone in NIOSH's respiratory health division, division of safety research, division of compensation and analysis support and National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory according to an email obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"Secretary Kennedy has been working hard to ensure that the critical functions under NIOSH remain intact. The Trump Administration is committed to supporting coal miners and firefighters, and under the Secretary's leadership, NIOSH's essential services will continue as HHS streamlines its operations,\" HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in an email.",
      "A handful of NIOSH staff working in the agency's World Trade Center Health Program previously had their layoffs reversed, after a second round of cuts at the agency earlier this month.",
      "\"While we celebrate with those who received a rescission letter from HHS, I am mindful that others did not. I am hopeful that we can continue to make the case for reinstating everyone at NIOSH,\" the agency's now-reinstated director, Dr. John Howard, wrote in the email.",
      "The reinstatements mean that some NIOSH programs might soon be able to resume, after they were previously hobbled by the layoffs.",
      "For example, the agency's National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory had been forced to suspend new approvals of equipment like new N95 respirators and protective gear for firefighters after the initial round of cuts on April 1. Investigations of workplace health risks through NIOSH's Health Hazard Evaluation program were also upended by the layoffs, but staff working in those probes have now been reinstated.",
      "But many workers also remain effectively laid-off at the wide-ranging agency, which functions as the research and testing counterpart to the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Mine Safety and Health Administration.",
      "In NIOSH's Spokane and Pittsburgh Mining Research Division, laid-off scientists and engineers were called back to work, but only for a few more weeks to wind down their laboratories and research before their layoff notices take effect. Those NIOSH employees have not received letters formally rescinding their layoffs, unlike some of their colleagues.",
      "Part of their work includes overseeing miner safety programs like the personal dust monitors, or PDM, required by the Department of Labor for coal miners. NIOSH is responsible for testing PDM's accuracy. The monitors are needed to reduce the risk of black lung disease.",
      "NIOSH had also been in the process of developing similar monitors for miners exposed to silica dust, before the layoffs gutted the teams overseeing that work.",
      "Other NIOSH teams like the Health Effects Laboratory Division were also not listed among the reinstatements.",
      "Other parts of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which currently houses NIOSH, also remain off the job, despite calls from states and lawmakers for their reinstatements. HHS previously said it was planning on moving what remained of NIOSH into a new agency called the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "Among the CDC scientists still laid-off include the agency's laboratories for investigating STD and viral hepatitis, which upended work helping states investigate outbreaks. Staff in the CDC's National Center for Environmental Health, which had been responsible for a range of issues including lead poisoning and cruise ship outbreaks, also have not been reinstated.",
      "Other workers who have been promised by their supervisors that they would be reinstated elsewhere at HHS have also so far not received notices, like at the Food and Drug Administration's drug safety labs in Puerto Rico and Detroit.",
      "While their counterparts at food safety labs in Chicago and San Francisco were reinstated, multiple scientists in those labs said they had yet to receive formal written notices revoking their layoffs, weeks after they were told they would be reinstated.",

    "summary": "Gov. Gavin Newsom dramatically expanded California's Medicaid program, but after six years in office, the Democrat is forced to contemplate deep cuts.",
    "story": [
      "SACRAMENTO \u2014 Gov. Gavin Newsom didn't expect to be reckoning with another health care crisis.",
      "In March, as President Trump and congressional Republicans escalated a nationwide debate over whether to slash health care for poor and disabled Americans, the Democratic governor had to tell state lawmakers that California's health care costs had spiraled out of control due to major Medicaid initiatives he backed \u2014 including the nation's largest expansion of taxpayer-financed health care for immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.",
      "His top officials at the state Department of Finance quietly disclosed to California lawmakers in a letter that the state had borrowed $3.4 billion to pay health insurers, doctors, and hospitals caring for patients enrolled in California's Medicaid program, known as Medi-Cal. Facing rising health care costs amid a deepening state budget crisis, Newsom now must contemplate rolling back coverage and benefits.",
      "The second-term governor faces a tough political decision: renege on his promise to achieve universal health care and strip coverage from millions of immigrants who lack legal status or look elsewhere for budget cuts. With nearly 15 million low-income or disabled residents enrolled in Medi-Cal, California has more to lose on health care than any other state. Yet even as Newsom has condemned Mr. Trump's approach to\u00a0tariffs\u00a0and environmental policies, he is already adjusting his health policies.",
      "Complicating his political tightrope: Polling shows that providing health care coverage for immigrants without legal status has tepid support. And any resulting budget trouble could harm his political legacy should he run for president in 2028.",
      "\"We all know that the cuts are definitely coming,\" said Carlos Alarcon, a health and public benefits analyst with the California Immigrant Policy Center, which has helped spearhead a decadelong campaign in California to expand Medicaid to eligible immigrants without legal status. \"The governor should keep his commitment \u2014 we'll be very disappointed if we see cuts and rollbacks. When times get hard, it's always our marginalized and underserved communities that lose out.\"",
      "California allows any low-income adults to enroll in Medi-Cal if they earn 138% of the federal poverty level, or $21,597 a year or less, regardless of immigration status. But the costs have been dramatically higher than expected.",
      "Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown first expanded Medi-Cal to people age 19 and younger without legal status, but he expressed reluctance to go further because of potential costs. Newsom signed bills into law adding people age 20 and older. An estimated 1.6 million immigrants without legal status are now covered, and costs have soared to $9.5 billion per year, up from $6.4 billion estimated in November. The federal government chips in roughly $1.1 billion of that total for pregnancy and emergency care.",
      "\"We can expand out of the graciousness of our heart to everywhere and anywhere, but the moment these resources run out, now everybody loses. We're hitting that breaking point,\" said California Assembly member David Tangipa (R-Fresno). \"Either we get fiscally responsible, or there's not going to be services for anybody \u2014 and that includes the Californian and the undocumented immigrant.\"",
      "Democratic leaders responsible for approving the state budget declined interviews. In a statement, state Sen. Mar\u00eda Elena Durazo (D-Los Angeles), who championed the expansion in the legislature, said, \"Rolling back this progress would be a harmful and shortsighted decision.\"",
      "Lawmakers are considering freezing enrollment for immigrants without legal status, imposing cost-sharing measures such as drug copays or premiums, or restricting benefits, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified to protect relationships at the state Capitol.",
      "The governor's budget revision proposed an enrollment freeze as soon as 2026 for immigrants 19 and older who lack legal status, along with a $100 monthly premium for them starting in 2027. Newsom pledged that no children would be affected and insisted that \"no one will be kicked off their health care.\" He blamed a \"Trump Slump\" for cutting $16 billion from the state's projected revenue.",
      "\"This is going to be very problematic for the governor. Budget cuts will disrupt the lives of millions of immigrants who just got health care, but the governor has got to do something, because this is not sustainable,\" said Mark Peterson, an expert on health care and national politics at UCLA. \"The prospect of cutting other places in order to support immigrants living in the country illegally would be a hard political sale; I don't see that happening.\"",
      "Should Newsom, along with the Democratic-controlled legislature, be forced to make cuts, he could argue he had no choice. Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans have threatened states like California with the latest U.S. House proposal cutting Medicaid funding by 10 percentage points for states that provide coverage for immigrants without legal status. For Newsom, political analysts say, Mr. Trump could make an easy scapegoat.",
      "\"He can blame Trump \u2014 there's only so much money to go around,\" said Mike Madrid, an anti-Trump Republican political analyst in California who specializes in Latino issues. \"It's making people look at the health care that they can't afford and ask, 'Why the hell are we giving it for free to people who are here illegally?'\"",
      "The exorbitant cost has come as somewhat of a surprise.",
      "In Newsom's first budget proposal as governor \u2014 in which he called for expanding Medi-Cal to young adults without legal status \u2014 his administration estimated it would cost roughly $2.4 billion annually to extend benefits to all eligible people regardless of status. But the latest figure reported to legislators was nearly four times as much.",
      "Newsom declined to respond to questions from KFF Health News, instead referencing previous comments that leave the door open to scaling back Medi-Cal. The governor noted \"sober\" discussions with lawmakers and said cutting Medi-Cal is \"an open-ended question\" that the president will heavily influence.",
      "\"What's the impact of Donald Trump on a lot of these things? What's the impact of federal vandalism to a lot of these programs?\" Newsom asked rhetorically in December, suggesting it's unclear whether he'll be able to sustain the expansion to immigrants without legal status in future years.",
      "Newsom expanded Medi-Cal in three phases, starting with immigrants ages 19 to 25, who became eligible in 2020, resisting pressure from health care advocates for one big, costly expansion. He argued doing it incrementally would ultimately save California money.",
      "\"It is the right thing morally and ethically,\" Newsom said in 2020. \"It is also the financially responsible thing to do.\"",
      "Record budget surpluses in recent years allowed Democrats to continue. Older adults ages 50 to 64 became eligible in 2022, and Newsom closed the gap the following year, approving coverage starting in 2024 for the biggest group, those ages 26 to 49.",
      "But the costs have grown tremendously while the budget picture has soured, according to a KFF analysis of the most recent 2023 records available from the state Department of Health Care Services, which administers Medi-Cal.",
      "Aside from children, it was more expensive to provide Medicaid coverage to immigrants without legal status than to legal residents. For instance, Medi-Cal paid L.A. Care, a major health insurer in Los Angeles, an average of $495.32 monthly to provide care for a childless adult without legal status and $266.77 for a legal resident without kids.",
      "Not only were immigrants without legal status more expensive, California footed most of the cost. The state paid roughly between 60% and 70% of health care costs for a childless adult immigrant covered by L.A. Care, and about 10% for a legal resident without kids. Those costs don't encapsulate the entire cost of providing care, which can vary depending on where Medi-Cal patients live, and grow higher when filling prescriptions, going to the dentist, or seeking mental health care.",
      "These payments also differ by insurer, but the trend holds across the state's Medi-Cal health insurance plans. Patients in most of the state can choose from more than one health plan.",
      "Children without legal status in many cases were cheaper to cover than children who were legal residents. Generally, kids are healthier and require less care.",
      "Mike Genest, who served as finance director under former Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, argued that the state should have planned for the immense price tag.",
      "\"The idea that we'd be able to afford in the long run paying for health care for all these undocumented people \u2014 it's beyond unsustainable,\" Genest said.",
      "While costs are high now, the expansion of Medi-Cal will result in long-term savings to taxpayers and the health care system, said Anthony Wright, who previously lobbied for the expansion as the head of the nonprofit Health Access and is now fighting Medicaid cuts as the executive director of Families USA, based in Washington, D.C.",
      "\"They're going to be showing up in our health care system regardless,\" Wright said. \"Leaving them without health insurance is just going to end in more crowded emergency rooms, and it's going to cost even more. It doesn't make any sense economically for them to be uninsured; that takes critical revenue from clinics and hospitals, just causing more problems.\"",

      "\"Boeing had a responsibility to provide a new Air Force One now. They didn't do the job,\" McCarthy said on \"CBS Mornings Plus.\"",
      "Mr. Trump arrived Wednesday in Qatar following a visit to Saudi Arabia, as the president makes his first international trip of his second term this week. Meanwhile, the unprecedented offer by the royal family of Qatar to donate a jumbo jet for Mr. Trump's exclusive use as a presidential plane has loomed over the trip, as Democrats \u2014 and some Republicans \u2014 have called the ethics and national security implications of the potential gift into question.",
      "But the Republican, who was ousted as speaker by his own members in 2023 and left Congress later that year, said he thinks of the issue differently, saying \"here's a problem, and you need to solve it.\"",
      "\"If you understand President Trump, he's always a business man, he's looking for a deal, and he doesn't want the taxpayers to pay for something,\" McCarthy said.",
      "McCarthy argued that \"we need a new Air Force One,\" noting that the two plans that currently serve in that role were manufactured around 40 years ago. Boeing had taken \"too long,\" he said, to fulfill the contract it has with Congress to build replacement aircraft. The former speaker said Boeing should lease another plane to the president, even if it's the Qatari jet, which he argued would \"take away all implication that somebody says we're getting some gift, because Boeing is responsible, because they're too delayed.\"",
      "\"They should lease the plane, fix it, and provide an Air Force One, new one, for the president,\" McCarthy said of Boeing.",
      "The comments come as McCarthy's relationship with Mr. Trump have taken twists and turns. After the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol, McCarthy accused the president of \"inciting people\" to carry out the attack. But McCarthy later sought to mend fences with the president, while largely avoiding criticizing him since.",
      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump defended the gift, while citing a delay on the Boeing planes.",
      "\"When I came back, I said, by the way, what's going on with the Boeings that are coming? 'Well sir, they're way behind,'\" the president said of his return to office.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that the Qatari government had \"graciously offered to donate a plane to the Department of Defense,\" while noting that the details were still being worked out.",
      "Still, some Republicans in Congress have expressed concern about the offer. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, told reporters Tuesday that he thinks there are \"lots of issues associated with that offer,\" which he said should be further discussed.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said he understood the need for a new Air Force One, but he told reporters that \"I'd love to have a big, beautiful jet that's built in the United States of America,\" although the 747 the Qataris are offering was built in the U.S. GOP Sen. Rick Scott of Florida expressed concern for the president's safety, saying \"Qatar is not in my opinion a great ally.\" And Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, said \"everybody needs to know that Air Force One is not like every other Boeing.\"",
      "\"It's going to have to be put through a lot of paces and probably every square inch analyzed before I think the president should consider it as a primary means of transportation,\" Tillis added.",

      "As a Republican-backed bill moves ahead in the House, proposed tax cuts under the measure include some new and surprising changes that could impact the wallets of millions of Americans.",
      "On Wednesday, the House Ways and Means Committee voted in favor of the bill, which would make Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while also adding a host of other reductions.",
      "The extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions would mean that most taxpayers wouldn't see much of a change because their tax brackets would remain at the same levels they've been at since the cuts took effect in 2018. Without an extension, more than 6 in 10 filers would face a tax increase in 2026,\u00a0according\u00a0to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.",
      "Aside from extending the 2017 tax cuts, the proposed bill would provide taxpayers with an average $1,300 tax reduction, according to the House Ways and Means Committee. Some of the additional tax cuts include those promised on the campaign trail by Mr. Trump, such as eliminating taxes on overtime pay, as well as new provisions that would lower taxes for senior citizens and parents.",
      "The proposed bill is likely to change as it moves through the legislative process, with House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, aiming to send it to the Senate by Memorial Day. Democratic lawmakers have opposed the bill for its proposed cuts to Medicaid\u00a0and food stamps, part of the GOP's goal to find $880 billion in savings to help pay for the tax cuts.",
      "Some Democrats also pointed out that some of the tax cuts promised by Mr. Trump, such as eliminating taxes on tips, would expire after 2028, limiting the benefits.",
      "\"[T]hey made provisions like addressing taxes on tips and overtime pay temporary, as opposed to the cuts for the richest 1%, which they made permanent,\" said Rep. Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia who serves on the House Ways and Means Committee, in a statement.",
      "Still, the bill released Wednesday by the House's tax panel provides a laundry list of tax breaks that could soon become law. Here's what the legislation would do:",
      "Adds a new $4,000 deduction for people 65 and older",
      "Senior citizens who are 65 and older would get a new tax benefit \u2014 an extra deduction of $4,000 per filer.",
      "The new deduction could be used by people who either itemize or take the standard deduction. But there would be an income limit, with the $4,000 deduction available for people with a modified adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less for single filers and $150,000 for married couples who file joint returns.",
      "The tax break would be available starting in the current 2025 tax year and extend through 2028.",
      "By contrast, for seniors the latest version of the House bill has one notable omission: There's no plan to eliminate taxes on Social Security income, as Mr. Trump promised in his campaign.",
      "Proposing to scrap income taxes on Social Security proved controversial because those taxes directly fund the retirement program. That would likely hasten the\u00a0insolvency of its trust funds, policy experts have warned.",
      "Increases the standard deduction for all taxpayers",
      "The current standard deduction, which was expanded under the 2017 tax bill, is set to expire on Dec. 31. The House GOP bill would make the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's bigger deduction permanent, as well as give it a boost.",
      "Starting in the current 2025 tax year through 2028, here's how the standard deduction would increase:",
      "Single taxpayers would see their standard deduction rise from $15,000 to $16,000Head of households would rise from $22,500 to $24,000Married couples filing jointly would increase from $30,000 to $32,000",
      "Single taxpayers would see their standard deduction rise from $15,000 to $16,000",
      "Head of households would rise from $22,500 to $24,000",
      "Married couples filing jointly would increase from $30,000 to $32,000",
      "The standard deduction reduces your tax liability because it lowers your taxable income by that amount. For instance, single taxpayers earning $50,000 would reduce their taxable income to $34,000 for the 2025 tax year under the proposed standard deduction.",
      "Extends and increases the Child Tax Credit",
      "The House bill also extends the $2,000 Child Tax Credit, which otherwise would revert to its pre-Tax Cuts and Jobs Act level of $1,000 per eligible child starting in 2026. That change would be permanent, the House Ways and Means Committee said.",
      "The proposal would also increase the Child Tax Credit to $2,500 per child for the current 2025 tax year through 2028, after which it would drop back to $2,000.",
      "Eliminates the 1099-K reporting rule",

      "Maikelys Espinoza arrived at an airport outside the capital, Caracas, along with more than 220 deported migrants.",
      "Footage aired by state television showed Venezuela's first lady Cilia Flores carrying Maikelys at the airport. Later, Flores was shown handing the girl over to her mother, who had been waiting for her arrival at the presidential palace along with President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",

      "Saudi Arabia is of key diplomatic importance to the Trump White House, especially amid ongoing efforts to negotiate a deal with Iran over its nuclear program, and with the Israel-Hamas war still raging in Gaza. The Trump administration also held talks with Russia in the Saudi capital of Riyadh earlier this year on how to end the war in Ukraine.",
      "But the visit is also expected to focus on business. Mr. Trump spoke at an investment conference in Miami in February sponsored by Saudi government entities, as the Trump Organization has sought to expand its real estate empire in Saudi Arabia, and the president looks to strengthen ties with the Middle East partner.",

      "The Trump administration brokered a diplomatic breakthrough during his first term that normalized relations between Israel and a number of Arab states, known as the Abraham Accords. Eight years later, as the administration has made a goal of expanding the agreement, Leavitt said Mr. Trump is returning to the region to \"re-emphasize his continued vision for a proud, prosperous and successful Middle East, where the United States and Middle Eastern nations are in cooperative relationships, and where extremism is defeated in place of commerce and cultural exchanges.\"",
      "\"This trip ultimately highlights how we stand on the brink of the golden age for both America and the Middle East, united by a shared vision of stability, opportunity and mutual respect,\" Leavitt added.",

      "The top federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C., has called the incidents \"pizza doxxing\" \u2014 a spin on \"doxxing,\" in which somebody's address or other personal information is maliciously made public, often as a form of intimidation.",
      "In about two dozen cases nationwide, judges have gotten unsolicited pizza deliveries with the recipient listed as Daniel Anderl, the late son of U.S. District Judge Esther Salas, the New Jersey judge told CBS News. Anderl was killed at the family's New Jersey home in 2020 by a disgruntled gunman who was targeting Salas.",
      "Salas called the cases attempts at \"psychological warfare\" against judges.",

      "A U.S. Marshals Service official told CBS News the agency \u2014 which handles judicial security \u2014 is \"looking into all the unsolicited pizza deliveries to federal judges and taking appropriate steps to address the matter.\"",
      "During a news conference Tuesday, outgoing U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., Ed Martin said \"pizza doxxers\" are also a focus of the federal prosecutor's office in the nation's capital, a jurisdiction where a large number of federal judges reside.",

      "\"To do this, is inviting tragedy and something terrible to happen. They're making a mockery of the justice system and they're playing a dangerous game,\" Clark said.",
      "Security analysts have previously warned \"pizza doxxing\" \u2014 or hoax deliveries \u2014 could also be a technique to lure a public official to the front door of his or her home, to confirm their address for a possible future attack.",
      "Threats against judges have been on the rise in recent years, part of a broader trend for public officials. The U.S. Marshals Service recorded more than 450 threats against federal judges in 2023, up more than 300 from 2019, with threats against prosecutors also growing at a rapid clip over the same period, CBS News has previously reported.",
      "In a separate interview with CBS News in March, Salas said, \"I worry for judicial officers who have to render tough decisions, who have to render decisions that may be unpopular to some individuals.\" She also cited \"the inflammatory rhetoric and language that's coming from both our leaders as well as people in positions of power that have large platforms.\"",
      "\"Those are dangerous combinations, because \u2026 we don't know what might set someone off,\" she said. \"I'm living proof. My son isn't here anymore.\"",

    "summary": "A Soviet-era spacecraft meant to land on Venus a half century ago is expected to plunge uncontrolled back to Earth within days.",
    "story": [
      "Just weeks ago, scientists warned that a \"city killer\" asteroid had a small chance of hitting Earth. While that prediction was thankfully\u00a0revised, the planet may have to worry about another object plummeting down from the heavens \u2014 a 1970s spacecraft called Kosmos 482.",
      "The Soviet-era spacecraft meant to land on Venus a half century ago is expected to plunge uncontrolled back to Earth within hours. The Aerospace Corporation's reentry prediction map\u00a0currently forecasts the object to fall through the atmosphere at 05:54 UTC on Saturday, or 1:54 am ET, but that forecast has fluctuated.",
      "It's too early to know where the half-ton mass of metal might come down or how much of it will survive reentry, according to space debris-tracking experts.",
      "Dutch scientist Marco Langbroek, a lecturer at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, predicts the failed spacecraft will reenter around May 10. He estimates it will come crashing in at 150 mph, if it remains intact.",
      "\"While not without risk, we should not be too worried,\" Langbroek said in an email.",
      "Given its orbit, the spacecraft could land anywhere between latitude 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south, Langbroek wrote in a\u00a0blog post. That represents a vast area, including the United States, South America, Africa, Australia, and most of Europe and Asia south of the Arctic Circle. Still, most of the Earth is covered by water so the risk to humans remains low.",
      "The object is relatively small and, even if it doesn't break apart, \"the risk is similar to that of a random meteorite fall, several of which happen each year. You run a bigger risk of getting hit by lightning in your lifetime,\" he said.",
      "The chance of the spacecraft actually hitting someone or something is small, he added. \"But it cannot be completely excluded.\"",
      "Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Center for Astrophysics at Harvard & Smithsonian, told NPR that the spacecraft is making its \"final death plunge.\"",
      "\"I expect it'll have the usual one-in-several-thousand chance of hitting someone,\" McDowell wrote last month. \"No need for major concern, but you wouldn't want it bashing you on the head.\"",
      "Kosmos 482 launched in 1972",
      "The Soviet Union launched Kosmos 482 in 1972, one of a series of Venus missions. But it never made it out of Earth's orbit because of a rocket malfunction.",
      "Most of it came tumbling down within a decade. But Langbroek and others believe the landing capsule itself \u2014 a spherical object about 3 feet in diameter \u2014 has been circling the world in a highly elliptical orbit for the past 53 years, gradually dropping in altitude.",
      "It's quite possible that the 1,000-pound-plus spacecraft will survive reentry. It was built to withstand a descent through the carbon dioxide-thick atmosphere of Venus, said Langbroek.",
      "Experts doubt the parachute system would work after so many years. The heat shield may also be compromised after so long in orbit.",
      "It would be better if the heat shield fails, which would cause the spacecraft to burn up during its dive through the atmosphere, McDowell said in an email. But if the heat shield holds, \"it'll reenter intact and you have a half-ton metal object falling from the sky.\"",
      "The spacecraft could reenter anywhere between 51.7 degrees north and south latitude, or as far north as London and Edmonton in Alberta, Canada, almost all the way down to South America's Cape Horn. But since most of the planet is water, \"chances are good it will indeed end up in some ocean,\" Langbroek said.",
      "Space debris could impact planes",
      "Space junk crashing back back to Earth could be a growing problem for aircraft, researchers warned in a\u00a0recent study.",
      "The study's authors said that the probability of space debris hitting an airplane is small, but the risk is rising due to increases in both space debris reentries and flights.",
      "The study found that high-density regions close to major airports have an 0.8% chance per year of being affected by an uncontrolled rocket reentry, but in \"larger but still busy\" airspace areas like those found in the northeastern U.S. or around major cities in Asia, the risk rose to 26%.",
      "\"While the probability of a strike is low, the consequences could be catastrophic,\" the researchers said in the study, which was\u00a0published in Scientific Reports.",
      "Space junk has hit Earth recently",
      "Space debris has crashed back into Earth in recent months.",
      "In February, debris from a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket that blasted off in the United States entered the Earth's atmosphere over Poland. Two chunks from an unidentified object \u2014 both measuring about 5 feet by 3 feet \u2014 were later found on the ground. Police said it was possible the objects came from the SpaceX rocket.",
      "Last New Year's Eve, fragments of metal, believed to be from a rocket, crashed into a village in Kenya.",
      "In March 2024, NASA faced a lawsuit\u00a0from a family whose Florida home was hit by a piece of falling metal.",
      "The month before that, the European Space Agency said a satellite \u2014 weighing as much as an adult male rhinoceros \u2014 made an\u00a0uncontrolled return to Earth, reentering the atmosphere over the north Pacific Ocean between Alaska and Hawaii. Most of the satellite burned up as it reentered Earth's atmosphere.",
      "Stijn Lemmens, senior space debris mitigation analyst at the European Space Agency, told the BBC that the \"re-entry of human-made objects into Earth's atmosphere occurs quite frequently,\" happening weekly for bigger spacecraft and daily for smaller ones. But objects typically burn up in the Earth's atmosphere before they reach the ground.",

      "The lack of affordable homes is partly responsible for driving up prices even higher, as would-be buyers often bid up home prices to secure a property, Evangelou said. The result: More middle-income families are getting shut out of the housing market in many regions.",
      "\"It's discouraging for many people now,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We hear from people who are earning a good income, and still feel homeownership is out of reach.\"",
      "These households represent people in careers such as nursing and teaching and in trades like plumbing, she added. \"The middle-income buyers are the backbone of the housing market, so we need homes they can actually afford,\" Evangelou said.",
      "Where the affordability gap is worst",
      "Twenty-six of the biggest 100 cities have affordability gaps that are worsening, the NAR research found. The cities with the worst affordability gaps are frequently in regions with zoning or permitting restrictions that make it difficult to construct new properties, Evangelou added.",
      "They range from high-cost cities like Los Angeles to more affordable areas like the Harrisburg-Carlisle and Scranton in Pennsylvania, the report found.",
      "Partly because of restrictive zoning rules, Pennsylvania ranked 44th out of all U.S. states in the pace of new housing built from 2017 to 2023, according to The Pew Charitable Trusts, a nonprofit foundation that conducts research on areas that shape public policy.",
      "Even though Pennsylvania isn't seeing the same type of population growth as states like Texas or Florida, housing costs in the state have surged due to its lack of building over the past several years, Pew added. The biggest increases were in the state's northeastern region, which includes Scranton and Philadelphia, it noted.",
      "Where housing availability is improving",
      "Thirty cities are showing improvements in affordable listings, including metropolitan areas such as Raleigh-Cary, North Carolina and Columbia, South Carolina, the research found. These areas saw the availability of affordable listings increase by 5% in the last year.",
      "Columbia, for one, has seen an increase in construction, with more properties such as townhomes built in the last few years, according to South Carolina's The State publication.",
      "Another 44 cities are stuck in the middle, neither improving nor decreasing in their share of affordable listings, the NAR analysis found.",
      "Both federal and local initiatives could help spur more homebuilding, helping relieve the affordability crunch in many regions, Evangelou said. For instance, easing zoning and building regulations could encourage more builders to construct new homes, while the federal and state governments could bolster downpayment assistance programs.",
      "Innovative forms of housing could also help, according to new research from Pew Charitable Trusts. For instance, it singled out so-called micro-apartments, which are small, co-living designs where residents share kitchens and bathrooms \u2014 like a college dormitory \u2014 as a low-cost way to provide more housing.",

      "Dick's Sporting Goods is buying ailing shoe company Foot Locker for $2.4 billion, the second deal for a large U.S. footwear maker in recent weeks as the industry grapples with the impact of steep new American tariffs on their production.",
      "Dick's said Thursday that it expects to run Foot Locker as a standalone unit and keep the Foot Locker brands, which include Kids Foot Locker, Champs Sports, WSS and Japanese sneaker brand atmos.",
      "\"Sports and sports culture continue to be incredibly powerful, and with this acquisition, we'll create a new global platform that serves those ever evolving needs through iconic concepts consumers know and love, enhanced store designs and omnichannel experiences, as well as a product mix that appeals to our different customer bases,\" Dick's CEO Lauren Hobart said in a statement.",
      "Skechers announced that it was being taken private earlier this month by the investment firm by 3G Capital in a transaction worth more than $9 billion.",
      "Foot Locker shareholders can choose to receive either $24 in cash or 0.1168 shares of Dick's common stock for each Foot Locker share that they own.",
      "The footwear industry has been growing increasingly concerned over Mr. Trump's trade war with other countries, particularly China. Athletic shoe makers have invested heavily in production in Asia.",
      "Fool Locker's stock slide",
      "Shares of sporting goods and athletic shoe companies have been under pressure all year. Before the Dick's deal, Foot Locker's stock price has tumbled more than 40% this year. Foot Locker shares surged $10.90, or nearly 85%, to $23.78 after the start of trade on Thursday.",
      "About 97% of the clothes and shoes purchased in the U.S. are imported, predominantly from Asia, according to the American Apparel & Footwear Association. Using factories overseas has kept labor costs down for U.S. companies, but neither they nor their overseas suppliers are likely to absorb price increases due to new tariffs.",
      "Foot Locker offers Dick's a lot of potential, namely its huge real estate footprint, and would give the Pittsburgh company its first foothold overseas.",
      "\"The addition of Foot Locker, with its 4.3% share of the sporting goods market, would produce an immediate boost,\" retail industry analysts Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData, said in an email. \"It would also give Dick's substantially more bargaining power with national brands, especially in the sneaker space. As the chains operate in a similar segment there would also likely be scope for synergistic savings.\"",
      "Foot Locker has about 2,400 retail stores across 20 countries in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. It also has a licensed store presence in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The company had global sales of $8 billion last year.",
      "\"While there is some overlap between the locations, the nature of the stores is different, and Foot Locker would give Dick's access to a wider selection of malls and customers,\" Saunders said.",
      "Dick's said that it expects to close the Foot Locker deal in the second half of the year. The transaction still needs approval from Foot Locker shareholders.",
      "Dick's stock dropped more than 13% before the market open, while shares of Foot Locker surged more than 82%.",

China, in particular, represents a lot of volume in certain categories like electronics and toys. All of the tariffs create cost pressure for us, but the larger tariffs on China have the biggest impact.

    "summary": "The Trump administration's bid to enforce its birthright citizenship executive orders gives the Supreme Court an opportunity to address the soundness of nationwide injunctions.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday is considering a bid by the Trump administration to narrow three lower court orders blocking President Trump from ending birthright citizenship, in cases that test judges' power to block a president's policies nationwide.",
      "The arguments before the court, taking place in a rare May session, are the first involving a policy rolled out by Mr. Trump in his second term. But the high court is not examining the legality of the president's birthright citizenship executive order, which seeks to deny U.S. citizenship to children born to a mother or father who are in the U.S. unlawfully or on a temporary basis.",
      "Instead, the Trump administration has said district court judges overseeing three legal challenges to Mr. Trump's policy lacked the authority to issue sweeping injunctions that extend beyond the parties involved in the litigation. The plaintiffs that brought the three lawsuits are 22 states, two organizations and seven individuals, and the Justice Department is pushing for the injunctions to apply only to them.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court in favor of the administration could allow it to partially enforce the birthright citizenship measure while the litigation proceeds \u2014 but not enforce it against the plaintiffs, including residents of California, New York and 20 other states.",
      "\"This is one of a range of efforts to close the courthouse doors, to make it harder, more expensive, more complicated, slower to challenge illegal government action,\" said Cody Wofsy, deputy director of the Immigrants' Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. \"A case like birthright citizenship puts that in really stark relief where you have an executive order that is blatantly illegal, but the administration is asking the Supreme Court to make it harder for courts to protect people and vindicate constitutional rights.\"",
      "The fight over nationwide, or universal, injunctions has been simmering for years, and several of the justices themselves have indicated that the Supreme Court would have to clarify their legality.",
      "\"Universal injunctions are legally and historically dubious,\" Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a concurring opinion to the Supreme Court's 2018 decision upholding the travel ban\u00a0Mr. Trump put in place during his first term. \"If federal courts continue to issue them, this court is dutybound to adjudicate their authority to do so.\"",
      "But criticisms of these broad orders reached a fever pitch this year, as the Trump administration fends off more than 200 legal challenges targeting nearly every aspect of the president's second-term agenda, and courts around the country issue injunctions that stop his policies from taking effect.",
      "Most of these decisions have been appealed, and the Trump administration has sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court in more than a dozen cases, including over his birthright citizenship executive order. The high court left the lower court injunctions preventing implementation of the birthright citizenship policy in place for now.",
      "Among the president's other plans that have been blocked were his transgender military ban, which the Supreme Court then allowed to take effect; his effort to restrict federal funding to medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care for young people; and cuts to certain federal funds.",
      "\"The pace of universal injunctions has gotten to the point where it really is an urgent issue for the court to resolve, not just because it has meant the thwarting of the president's ability to implement the policies for which he was elected, but also because it has led to an inundation of emergency petitions to the Supreme Court as a result of these universal injunctions,\" said Joel Alicea, a law professor at the Catholic University of America.",
      "These sweeping orders have frustrated not just Mr. Trump and his agenda, but also his predecessors. A study from the Harvard Law Review published in April 2024 found that at least 127 nationwide injunctions were issued from 1963 through 2023, though most of those, 96, were entered from 2001 through 2023.",
      "In March, the Congressional Research Service identified 86 nationwide injunctions that were issued under Mr. Trump's first four years in office and 28 during former President Joe Biden's term. But the report warned that it is \"not possible to provide a single definitive count of nationwide injunctions.\"",
      "As to Mr. Trump's second term, the Congressional Research Service identified 17 nationwide injunctions issued during his first two months back in office. The Trump administration estimates there have been at least 28 of these orders entered against it by judges.",
      "\"What universal injunction practice effectively means is that a single district court judge has a veto over the president's national policy and because there are 94 district courts in the country, that means that you have 94 opportunities in theory to shut down any given national policy,\" Alicea said. \"That is a recipe for genuine paralysis in terms of national policy-making and in a way that subverts the separation of powers because single district court judges were never supposed to have this kind of authority to stop national policy in its tracks.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and his allies have attacked by name the judges issuing these decisions, and his administration has extended that battle to the relief they are granting. In a filing in one of the birthright citizenship cases, the Justice Department said universal injunctions have reached \"epidemic\" proportions since Mr. Trump returned to the White House in January.",
      "\"Those injunctions thwart the executive branch's crucial policies on matters ranging from border security, to international relations, to national security, to military readiness,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote. \"They repeatedly disrupt the operations of the Executive Branch up to the Cabinet level.\"",
      "Republicans in Congress have also taken up the cause against universal injunctions. The GOP-controlled House in April passed a bill that would restrict district court judges from issuing broad injunctive relief. It's unclear whether the measure will pass the Republican-led Senate, where 60 votes are needed for legislation to advance.",
      "But Wofsy, of the ACLU, said the number of lawsuits and injunctions stems from the volume of executive actions taken by the president in the opening months of his second term.",
      "\"The administration has been subject to so many nationwide injunctions and injunctions more generally because it's doing an incredible volume of illegal things, and that is not a reason to take away a tool that the judiciary has to check executive authority. It's the opposite,\" he said. \"Now more than ever it is vital that the judiciary is a strong and robust check against illegal executive actions.\"",
      "The Supreme Court may not stop universal injunctions altogether but could curtail them, as there are instances where relief naturally extends beyond the parties involved in a case. Take, for example, a landowner who sues a factory for polluting a river. In that instance, an injunction that orders the factory to stop would benefit all who live along it, not just the single plaintiff.",
      "\"The basic principle here is courts may only issue injunctions that are as broad as necessary to remedy the plaintiff's asserted harm,\" Alicea said. \"Sometimes that will require an injunction that gives protection even to nonparties as an incidental result of giving protection to the actual plaintiff.\"",
      "If the Supreme Court does curtail judges' ability to enter universal injunctions, courts could still enter tailored relief. Plaintiffs seeking to represent a broader group of people could also file class-action lawsuits. In the context of the birthright citizenship case, a class-action lawsuit could be brought by affected pregnant women in the U.S. illegally and children at risk of losing their right to U.S. citizenship, the Trump administration has argued.",
      "But Wofsy said class-action lawsuits, like nationwide injunctions, are one of many tools available to federal courts and may not be appropriate in every case.",
      "\"The existence of that tool doesn't mean courts shouldn't have other tools available,\" he said. \"The question here isn't, 'should nationwide injections be entered in every case?' The question is, 'are we going to take away the discretion that district courts have to use this as an appropriate tool to craft a remedy in a case where it's necessary?'\"",
      "He said birthright citizenship is an example of a situation in which the constitutional question is so clear, there is no reason the government needs to apply the policy to a single child while the legal challenges move forward.",
      "\"Citizenship really cuts through so many aspects of our society. It matters for so many educational, health, nutrition, other kinds of programs,\" Wofsy said. \"The idea that we would have a patchwork system where people's citizenship isn't just a matter of whether you're born in the United States, but who your parents are, what their status is, do you have documentation, are you a member of this organization, were you born in this state or that state invites confusion, chaos, discrimination and for no real purpose.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/epa-forever-chemicals-rollback-drinking-water/",
    "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 09:42:02 -0400",
    "summary": "The Environmental Protection Agency says it will roll back limits on several types of \"forever chemicals\" in drinking water.",
    "story": [
      "The Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday that it plans to weaken limits on some \"forever chemicals\" in drinking water that were finalized last year, while maintaining standards for two common ones.",
      "The Biden administration set the first federal drinking water limits for PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, finding they increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and babies being born with low birth weight. Those limits were expected to reduce PFAS levels in drinking water for millions of people.",
      "Commonly called \"forever chemicals,\"\u00a0PFAS\u00a0are found nearly everywhere \u2014 in air,\u00a0water\u00a0and soil \u2014 and can take thousands of years to break down in the environment.",
      "Limits on three types of PFAS, including so-called GenX substances found in North Carolina, will be scrapped and reconsidered by the agency, as will a limit on a mixture of several types of PFAS.",
      "The Biden administration's rule also set standards for the two common types of PFAS, referred to as PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion, effectively the lowest level at which they can be reliably detected. The EPA will keep those standards in place, but give utilities two extra years \u2014 until 2031 \u2014 to comply and treat for the chemicals.",
      "\"We are on a path to uphold the agency's nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water. At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance,\" said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.",
      "The development was first reported by The Washington Post.",
      "It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for certain, newer types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration's limits. But the vast majority of utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.",
      "Health advocates praised the Biden administration for the tight limits. But water utilities took issue with the rule, saying treatment systems are expensive to install and that customers will end up paying more for water. The utilities sued the EPA.",
      "The EPA's actions align with some of the arguments utilities made in their lawsuit. They argued that the EPA lacked the authority to regulate a mixture of PFAS and said the agency didn't properly support limits on several newer types of PFAS that are now rescinded. They also asked for the now-granted two-year extension.",
      "Erik Olson, a senior strategic director of health at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, said the move is illegal. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit contaminants in drinking water and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.",
      "\"With a stroke of the pen, EPA is making a mockery of the Trump administration's promise to deliver clean water for Americans,\" Olson said.",
      "President Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks. The EPA plans to loosen regulations for greenhouse gas emissions, cleanup standards for coal plant waste and car emission limits, among many other clean air and water rules.",
      "Zeldin's history with PFAS is more nuanced; during his time as a New York congressman, he supported legislation to regulate forever chemicals.",
      "Manufactured by companies like Chemours and 3M, PFAS were incredibly useful in many applications \u2014 among them, helping clothes to withstand rain and ensuring that firefighting foam snuffed out flames. But the chemicals also accumulate in the body. As science advanced in recent years, evidence of harm at far lower levels became clearer.",
      "The Biden-era EPA estimated the rule will cost about $1.5 billion to implement each year. Water utility associations say the costly rules, combined with recent mandates to replace harmful lead pipes, will raise residents' bills and fall hardest on small communities with few resources.",
      "The Biden administration did work to address cost concerns. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $9 billion for chemicals like PFAS and utilities have won multibillion-dollar settlements against PFAS polluters that will help.",
      "Some utilities have been surprised to find out they are over the limits.",
      "\"This gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time. Some utilities are just finding out now where they stand and that's almost too late already for 2029,\" said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry communications firm.",
      "But what utilities really wanted was a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water global practice leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith. He suspects the utility industry will continue to sue over those limits. Dissatisfied environmental groups will likely file challenges, too.",
      "Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group, said utilities may not have to install treatment that's as broadly effective if they just have to focus on two types of older PFAS.",
      "\"You really reduce what utilities have to do to make sure that the other, newer generation PFAS are captured,\" she said.",
      "When the Biden administration announced its rule, the head of the EPA traveled to North Carolina and was introduced by activist Emily Donovan, who said she was grateful for the first federal standards. She had long campaigned for tougher rules for GenX substances that had contaminated a local river.",
      "Now the EPA says it will roll back those GenX limits.",
      "\"This current administration promised voters it would 'Make America Healthy Again' but rescinding part of the PFAS drinking water standards does no such thing,\" she said.",

      "The side door of Smith's house had been broken, and Hobson found his friend \u2014 barely alive \u2014 lying on the floor of the blood-soaked kitchen. Smith had a gunshot wound to the head and a woman, later identified as Leslie Reeves from nearby Troy, Illinois, was lying dead on the living room floor with a single bullet wound to her head, according to a sheriff's report.",
      "Friends later told sheriff's deputies that the couple had gone on their first date the previous night after meeting online. In the first hours of the investigation, no one knew what happened, but investigators believed a third person was involved because no gun was found at the scene.",
      "Smith survived the shooting but doesn't remember anything from that Thanksgiving Day. Hobson later told him some details. \"He said I had no pulse,\" Smith told Moriarty. \"He screamed my name three times, and I took a gasp and I said, 'Denny, I'm f***ing freezing.'\"",
      "Hobson later told Smith that Tiki likely helped to save his life. The temperature inside the house on that Thanksgiving Day was much colder than normal because the suspect had broken the glass on the side door.",
      "\"But somebody was keeping you warm,\" Moriarty said. \"I had Tiki there,\" Smith replied. \"My little girl, my little four-legged daughter.\"",
      "Smith had owned Tiki, a beagle-terrier mix, for three years. He says he found her in a Craigslist ad and adopted her when she was a pup. Tiki apparently was Smith's lifesaver when she huddled with him, and provided much needed warmth, in the 12 hours before he was rescued.",

      "A Montgomery County Sheriff's report later pieced together what happened that night. Smith and Reeves, after a night of barhopping and getting to know one another, had returned to his rented house in Farmersville.",

      "Pardo \"intentionally and knowingly aided\" her son, San Antonio police wrote in the affidavit.",

      "As they climbed down, the four attached their ropes to a piton \u2014 a metal spike pounded into rock cracks or ice and used to secure ropes \u2014 that had been placed by a past climber.

      "Three were killed by the fall. One \u2014 38-year-old Anton Tselykh \u2014  was knocked unconscious.",
      "Tselykh later awoke in the dark. It had been hours since the fall. And over the course of the next several hours, he extricated himself from the mess of ropes, gear and debris and trekked over rough terrain of rock and snow \u2014 with help from a pick-like ice tool \u2014 to his car.",
      "He drove for some 40 miles before finding a pay phone and calling for help in Newhalem, an unincorporated community about an hour's drive away. It was Sunday morning, eight hours since he regained consciousness.",

The team had followed coordinates from a GPS device the climbers had been carrying, which were shared by a friend of the men.",
      "The rough terrain required a helicopter, which removed the bodies one at a time, Woodworth said. The helicopter's flight through 16 miles of rugged, mountainous terrain took longer than usual \u2014 about an hour \u2014due to harsh weather, CBS affiliate\u00a0KIRO\u00a0reported. Video of the aerial recovery showed the helicopter navigating blustery winds as it made its way to the climbers.",
      "As responders pored over the recovered equipment, they found the piton still clipped into the climbers' ropes, Okanogan County Coroner Dave Rodriguez said. Pitons are difficult to remove from rock, he said, and the anchor's presence on the rope was a clue to what happened.",
      "\"There's no other reason it would be hooked onto the rope unless it pulled out of the rock,\" Rodriguez had said.",
      "It's still unclear whether the four had a backup anchor, which Joshua Cole, a guide and co-owner of North Cascades Mountain Guides, said is a common practice among climbers.",
      "The four climbers were friends, some of whom had climbed together before and appeared fairly experienced, Woodworth said, adding that Tselykh was \"obviously very much affected by this.\"",
      "Irigireddy was a vice president of engineering at the Fluke Corporation, a test equipment manufacturing company, which released a statement Wednesday.",
      "\"Vishnu was an extraordinary leader, and his loss is felt profoundly across our organization,\" the statement read.",

      "In 2024, customers lodged a record 66,675 complaints against U.S. airlines, according to a new report from the U.S. PIRG Education Fund, a consumer advocacy group, based on data from the U.S. Department of Transportation. Passenger complaints have surged since the pandemic, rising every year since 2021, according to PIRG.",
      "\"When you file a complaint, the DOT asks if you talked to airline, so it's not like the DOT complaint line is your first stop,\" U.S. PIRG consumer watchdog director Teresa Murray told CBS MoneyWatch. \"When people try to get their money back and the airline hasn't done it, that's when people file complaints.\"",
      "For example, some customers sought refunds they were due related to flight cancellations or delays, while others sought reimbursement they were owed for lost or damaged piece of luggage. Airlines now face added pressure under new rules\u00a0adopted in 2024 that require them to provide automatic refunds to customers when their flights are canceled or significantly delayed.",

That year, they jumped to more than 102,000 during what was a catastrophic period for air carriers, given travel restrictions and plummeting demand for flying. Airlines struggled to ramp capacity back up in 2021 and 2022, resulting in plenty of cancellations and delays.",
      "At the top 10 U.S. airlines, cancellations rose from 1.28% of flights in 2023 to 1.36% last year, resulting in a total of 102,908 canceled flights in 2024, according to the report. Delays also worsened, with 78.1% of flights arriving on time last year, down from 78.3% in 2023. In total, roughly 1.7 million flights were either delayed or canceled in 2024.",
      "Nationwide air traffic controller shortages could lead to more snarls in schedules for the remainder of 2025, PIRG said.",
      "One relative bright spot in the report: Airlines mishandled fewer bags and wheelchairs in 2024 compared to the previous year. While that showed some modest improvement, 2.7 million bags were still lost or damaged, as were 11,357 wheelchairs and scooters.",
      "The carrier with the highest rate of complaints per 100,000 passengers: Frontier Airlines, which had the worst cancellation record, worst record for on-time arrivals and worst record for involuntary bumping, PIRG found.

    "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 00:31:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The heart of the Republican budget legislation targets key climate and energy provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act.",
    "story": [
      "House Republicans Wednesday moved forward with a tax bill to cut billions of dollars in climate-related funding, reduce regulations and prematurely phase out clean energy tax credits as part of President Trump's \"One, Big, Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "The heart of the Republican budget legislation targets key climate and energy provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "Cuts would impact businesses and consumers, affecting renewable energy, manufacturing, energy efficiency and electric vehicles. Concurrently, House Republicans proposed streamlining permitting for fossil fuels, rescinding Clean Air Act pollution funding and allocating $2 billion to the strategic petroleum reserve.",
      "The Inflation Reduction Act has led to $321 billion worth of climate investment being completed, with $522 billion worth of investments still in process, according to a report from the Clean Investment Monitor. Congress was tasked with finding $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to fund Mr. Trump's tax cuts.",
      "House Republicans are hoping to have a floor vote next week prior to Memorial Day, after which the bill will go to the Senate.",
      "Four Republican senators wrote a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune cautioning the caucus against a \"full-scale repeal\" of tax credits, adding that repealing credits would be disruptive to businesses which had made investments based on the Inflation Reduction Act's tax framework. They also added that cuts would lead to higher energy costs.",
      "Twenty-one House Republicans wrote a similar letter\u00a0in March urging against cuts to energy credits from the Inflation Reduction Act. A 2024 CBS News report found that over 80% of Inflation Reduction Act spending and tax credits went toward Republican congressional districts.",
      "Environmental groups and renewable energy companies have been on Capitol Hill lobbying to protect tax credits they say are vital to support new industries. Raghu Belur, co-founder of Enphase Energy, a solar components manufacturer, expected changes to the IRA, but didn't expect them to go this far.",
      "\"I thought there would be a glide path, I thought there would be a reasonable transition period. Instead it's become very abrupt,\" he told CBS News.",
      "His company has manufacturing facilities in South Carolina and Texas, made possible by the Inflation Reduction Act. But Belur also worries about the downstream effects on businesses that have formed around renewable energy, like solar installers, which tend to be small businesses.",
      "Among their concerns, Belur and the Solar Energy Industries Association have been focusing on the importance of a tax credit that helps homeowners to finance solar projects. The GOP budget proposal would abruptly end the credit at the end of 2025. The credit was previously slated to be phased out by 2034. He says the credits help support customer demand for nascent businesses, and that the renewable energy sector finally had momentum that should be supported as promised at this stage of their industry.",
      "\"Fossil fuels have been receiving subsidies for the last 100-plus years,\" Belur told CBS News. \"I always believe that subsidies must be a catalyst, not a crutch, we are not asking for an infinite extension of this.\"",
      "The Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group, estimates that 75% of the affected credits and spending cuts would affect local economies in Republican districts.",
      "\"At a time when billions of dollars are being invested in states that overwhelmingly voted for President Trump, this proposed legislation will effectively dismantle the most successful industrial onshoring effort in U.S. history,\" the group said in a statement.",
      "Several tax credits and incentives are set to be phased out early or end, impacting a wide range of projects, including solar, geothermal, nuclear, wind, and hydrogen. The $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit that Mr. Trump campaigned against will be ended, as well as manufacturing credits to produce electric vehicles.",
      "Funding for other Inflation Reduction Act initiatives are also projected to be cut. Republican Rep. Brett Guthrie, the House Energy and Commerce Committee chair, wrote in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal this week that the cuts would include $6.5 billion of unspent Inflation Reduction Act funding that is earmarked for the Environmental Protection Agency's Green House Gas Reduction Fund, clean pollution reduction, clean ports and environmental justice grants.",
      "Evan Chapman, senior director of policy at Clean Tomorrow, a nonpartisan clean energy advocacy group, believes the version of the budget proposed by the GOP would make it harder to quickly increase energy production through renewables, and could lead American renewable energy industries to fall behind the rest of the world.",
      "\"This is largely a repeal of the inflation Reduction Act,\" Chapman told CBS News. \"What this bill will do is reduce the availability of energy, increase costs for energy that's coming on the grid, and make it more difficult to pull innovative American technologies that will produce clean energy towards the market.\"",

      "Espinosa, who took the helm earlier this year, said the latest plans followed a careful review of operations, to align production with demand, including coming up with market and product strategies. Nissan will also leverage its partnerships such as the one with Renault SA of France in Europe and Dongfeng Nissan in China, he said.",
      "Nissan said President Trump's tariffs on auto imports also hurt the company's results. The Yokohama, Japanese-based automaker racked up a loss of $4.5 billion for the fiscal year through March. It also said its recovery plan includes trying to reduce costs by $3.4 billion.",

      "Mexican authorities on Wednesday arrested a former senior judge in connection with the disappearance and presumed murders of 43 students a decade ago.",
      "Lambertina Galeana, who faces charges of forced disappearance, is accused of helping to conceal videos that allegedly showed the incident unfolding, a government statement said.",
      "Security camera videos allegedly captured the moment the students were kidnapped by armed men right in front of a judicial building, El Pais reported. In 2022, a commission concluded that Galeana ordered the videos destroyed because the images \"were not clear due to technical problems,\" the outlet reported.",
      "The case, one of the violence-plagued country's worst human rights atrocities, has become emblematic of a missing persons crisis that has seen more than 120,000 people disappear.",
      "Galeana, now retired, was president of the Superior Court of Justice in the southern Mexican state of Guerrero, where the students from a rural teacher training college disappeared in September 2014.",
      "So far, the remains of only three of the missing students have been found and identified, and relatives denounce impunity.",
      "The students from the Ayotzinapa school \u2014 whose members have a history of political activism \u2014 had commandeered buses to travel to a demonstration in Mexico City when they went missing.",
      "Investigators believe they were abducted by a drug cartel with the help of corrupt police, although exactly what happened is unclear.",
      "In 2022, a truth commission set up by former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador's government branded the case a \"state crime\" and said the military shared responsibility, either directly or through negligence.",

      "The commission found that the army was aware of what was happening and had real-time information about the kidnapping and disappearance.",
      "One theory the commission put forward was that cartel members targeted the students because they had unknowingly taken a bus with drugs hidden inside.",

      "Istanbul \u2014 Russia and Ukraine traded insults on Thursday as negotiators were due, tentatively, to meet in Turkey for the first direct peace talks in more than three years. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy slammed Russia for sending a \"decorative\" delegation as he touched down in Ankara for a meeting with his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan.",
      "Russian officials, for their part, called Zelenskyy \"pathetic\" and a \"clown\" for challenging President Vladimir Putin to show up in person for the talks, while touting further territorial gains in eastern Ukraine.",
      "The Kremlin made it clear on Thursday that President Trump's push for a ceasefire in the three-year war \u2014 a war he repeatedly claimed he could end within hours \u2014 was not changing Moscow's entrenched position on the standoff.",
      "The exchange of personal barbs between Moscow and Kyiv undermined the chances of any breakthrough at the talks in Turkey. It wasn't even clear if any talks between the warring parties would take place.",
      "Putin did not come to Turkey, despite days of international pressure. Instead Russia's negotiating team, which touched down in Istanbul on Thursday morning, was led by a hardline historian and Kremlin aide who has denied Ukraine's right to exist.",
      "\"We need to understand the level of the Russian delegation and what their mandate is, if they are capable of making any decisions themselves,\" Zelenskyy said from the tarmac at Ankara airport. \"From what we see, it looks more like a decorative\" deployment by Moscow, he added.",
      "President Trump said he was keeping open the possibility of travelling to Turkey on Friday, if there was any meaningful progress in the talks. But the absence of Putin \u2014 as well as any top diplomats such as Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov or foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov \u2014 appeared to diminish the talks' importance, or any possibility of a breakthrough.",

      "No nearer to a Ukraine-Russia peace deal?",
      "Despite the flurry of diplomacy, Moscow and Kyiv's positions remain far apart. The Kremlin's naming of Vladimir Medinsky, a hardline aide to Putin though not a major decision-maker, as its top negotiator suggested Moscow does not plan to make concessions.",
      "Medinsky led failed negotiations in 2022, in which Moscow made sweeping claims to Ukrainian territory and demanded restrictions on Kyiv's military. He is known for writing ultra-nationalistic school textbooks that question Ukraine's right to exist and justify the ongoing invasion.",
      "Even as he touched down in Turkey, Russia's defense ministry claimed in a social media post that troops had captured two more villages in eastern Ukraine, Torskoye and Novooleksandrivka in the Donetsk region.",

    "summary": "President Trump says he will move to normalize relations and lift sanctions on Syria's new government to give the country \"a chance at peace.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump met Wednesday in Saudi Arabia with Syria's interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, highlighting the stunning reversal in fortunes for a former Islamist militant with ties to al Qaeda who spent years with a U.S. government bounty on his head. Al-Sharaa's rebel forces led the charge on Damascus last year that toppled the decades-long, iron-fisted rule of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, and he has since installed himself as the head of a government presenting itself to the world as inclusive and democratic.",
      "Mr. Trump's decision to meet with al-Sharaa, after some European leaders have done the same, could be a huge boost to the new Syrian government as it tries to rebuild ties with the Western world. Those relationships have been marked by blistering sanctions and acrimony during and after the Middle Eastern nation's bloody civil war, which started in 2011.",
      "\"Young, attractive guy, tough guy, strong past,\" Mr. Trump told reporters of al-Sharaa   aboard Air Force One following the meeting.",
      "In a readout on the two leaders' meeting in Saudi Arabia, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Mr. Trump had told the Syrian leader that \"he has a tremendous opportunity to do something historic in his country,\" and urged him to join Saudi Arabia in signing onto the U.S.-backed Abraham Accords, to normalize ties with Israel.",
      "Mr. Trump also told al-Sharaa he should \"tell all foreign terrorists to leave Syria; Deport Palestinian terrorists; help the United States to prevent the resurgence of ISIS,\" and \"assume responsibility for ISIS detention centers in Northeast Syria,\" according to Leavitt.",
      "They were joined in their meeting by the host of Mr. Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia, de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, and on the phone by the President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan.",
      "The meeting came a day after Mr. Trump announced on his visit to the Saudi capital Riyadh that his administration would lift U.S. sanctions on Syria, \"to give them a chance at greatness.\"",
      "\"The sanctions were brutal and crippling, and served ... an important function, nevertheless, at the time, but now it's their [Syrians'] time to shine,\" Mr. Trump said in a speech on Tuesday. \"I say good luck, Syria. Show us something very special.\"",
      "In her readout on Wednesday, Leavitt said \"President Erdogan praised President Trump for lifting sanctions on Syria and committed to working alongside Saudi Arabia to encourage peace and prosperity in Syria. The Crown Prince also commended President Trump for his decision to lift the sanctions, calling it courageous.\"",
      "She said al-Sharaa had thanked Mr. Trump, along with MBS and Erdogan, \"for their efforts to put together the meeting, and recognized the significant opportunity presented by the Iranians leaving Syria, as well as shared U.S.-Syrian interests in countering terrorism and eliminating chemical weapons.\"",
      "The \"Iranians\" referred to by the White House appeared to be a reference to the ousted Assad regime's backers in Tehran.",
      "\"President Al-Sharaa concluded with his hope that Syria would serve as a critical link in facilitating trade between east and west, and invited American companies to invest in Syrian oil and gas,\" Leavitt said.",
      "The White House said Tuesday that Secretary of State Marco Rubio would also meet with the Syrian foreign minister in Turkey later this week.",
      "Mr. Trump became on Wednesday the first U.S. president to meet with a Syrian leader since Bill Clinton met with Assad's father Hafez al-Assad.",
      "A former insurgent, al-Sharaa ascended to power last year as Assad's government rapidly crumbled in the span of several days \u2014 bringing an abrupt end to the more than decadelong civil war that devastated Syria.",
      "Al-Sharaa previously led Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, an Islamist rebel group that fought the Assad regime and had its roots in the al Qaeda-allied Nusra Front. Al-Sharaa also participated in the insurgency against U.S. forces in Iraq in the 2000s.",
      "Until last year, the U.S. had a $10 million bounty on al-Sharaa due to his leadership of HTS, which is designated by the U.S. as a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "Syrian-American activist Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the nonprofit Syrian Emergency Task Force, is helping rebuild severed ties, and claims al-Sharaa is \"100% a changed man.\"",
      "\"I want to say, well, let's judge him by his actions,\" Mustafa told CBS News Wednesday. \"I'm not here to say any of these decisions in his checkered past is nonexistent. But the fact is, this is a changed man. And this is a person who is not interested in anything but rebuilding the country, and wants to see peace with all of the neighbors, wants to stay out of war with everyone in the Middle East.\"",
      "Despite the collapse of Assad's government, many of the intense U.S. sanctions placed on Syria during the last 13 years of Assad's reign have remained in place. The Trump administration appears to be pushing for normalized relations with the new government in Syria in the hope it can help curb Iranian influence in the country and the wider Middle East, despite al-Sharaa's roots in extremism.",
      "Saudi Arabia has also started building a relationship with al-Sharaa's government, a move that could also be aimed at limiting the influence of the kingdom's archrival Iran, which along with Russia, aided Assad in his fight against rebels during the civil war.",
      "Key U.S. ally Israel has been more wary of al-Sharaa, however, and has continued airstrikes against targets inside Syria \u2014 angering al-Sharaa's government.",
      "Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham urged caution and said the White House should go through the proper congressional channels in to ease sanctions against Syria. Graham arrived in Turkey on Tuesday to meet with U.S. and Turkish officials about the situation in Syria.",
      "\"I am very inclined to support sanctions relief for Syria under the right conditions,\" Graham said in a statement. \"However, we must remember that the current leadership in Syria achieved its position through force of arms, not through the will of its people. I know the Trump administration has provided guidance to Syrian officials about conditions that need to be met before any sanctions can be relieved.\"",
      "Graham said he was \"certain that Congress would need to be informed of changes in conditions placed on Syria and how they have met those conditions before Congress can make an informed decision on whether or not it should approve the change in designation.\" He also said Israeli officials were \"extremely concerned\" about the \"state of play in Syria.\"",
      "\"Waiving congressionally passed sanctions is a complicated process,\" Graham said. \"While I would like to empower the new players in Syria, it has to be done in a coordinated fashion with our allies \u2014 especially our friends in Israel \u2014 so that numerous security concerns can be addressed.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday for the first stop of his four-day trip to the Middle East. It is the first foreign trip of Mr. Trump's second term. It will include stops in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates later this week.",
      "The president delivered remarks at a U.S.-Saudi investment summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia's capital, as the White House announced a $600 billion investment from Saudi Arabia, including what it touted as the \"largest defense sales agreement in history.\"",

    "story": [
      "Thai officials on Wednesday said they seized 238 tons of illegally imported electronic waste from the United States at the port of Bangkok, one of the biggest lots they've found this year.",
      "The waste, which came in 10 large containers, was declared as mixed metal scrap containing aluminium, copper and iron, but turned out to be circuit boards mixed in a huge pile of metal scrap, said Theeraj Athanavanich, director-general of the Customs Department.",
      "The electronic waste \u2014 which is classified as hazardous waste under the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal \u2014 was found on Tuesday after the 40-foot containers became the subject of a routine random inspection, officials said.",
      "The Basel Convention is an international treaty signed in 1989 meant to deal with hazardous waste flowing into developing countries as costs for disposal grew along with the amount of waste.",
      "A U.N. report last year said electronic waste is piling up worldwide. Some 62 million tons of electronic waste was generated in 2022 and that figure is on track to reach 82 million tons by 2030, the report said. It said only 22% of the waste was properly collected and recycled in 2022 and that quantity is expected to fall to 20% by the end of the decade due to higher consumption, limited repair options, shorter product life cycles, and inadequate management infrastructure.",
      "Theeraj said Thai authorities are looking to press charges including falsely declaring imported goods, illegally importing electronic waste and planning to re-export the waste back to its country of origin.",
      "\"It's important that we take action on this kind of goods,\" he said. \"There are environmental impacts that are dangerous to the people, especially communities around factories that might import these things for processing, then recycling.\"",
      "Electronic waste creates huge\u00a0health hazards. Many components are laden with lead and mercury, cadmium and other toxins. Recyclers are after gold, silver, palladium and copper, mainly from printed circuit boards, but lax controls mean that facilities often burn plastics to release encased copper and use unsafe methods to extract precious metals.",
      "Thailand passed a ban on the import of a range of electronic waste products in 2020. The Cabinet in February approved an expanded list of the banned waste.",
      "Sunthron Kewsawang, deputy director-general of the Department of Industrial Works, said officials suspected at least two factories in Samut Sakhon province, which borders Bangkok, are involved in importing the waste. Last year, Thai officials found thousands of tons of smuggled cadmium waste at a factory in the province, Thai PBS reported.",
      "Residents near the area were later found to have usually high levels of the poisonous metal in their urine, according to the report. Exposure to cadmium can cause flu-like symptoms, including chills, fever and muscle pain, according to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Long-term exposure can lead to cancer, kidney, bone and lung disease.",
      "In January, the Customs Department said it seized 256 tons of illegally imported electronic waste from Japan and Hong Kong at a port in eastern Thailand.",

      "Maikelys Espinoza arrived at an airport outside the capital, Caracas, along with more than 220 deported migrants.",
      "Footage aired by state television showed Venezuela's first lady Cilia Flores carrying Maikelys at the airport. Later, Flores was shown handing the girl over to her mother, who had been waiting for her arrival at the presidential palace along with President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "The U.S. government had claimed the family separation last month was justified because the girl's parents allegedly have ties to the Venezuelan-based Tren de Aragua gang, which President Trump designated a terrorist organization earlier this year.",

      "The girl's mother was deported to Venezuela on April 25. Meanwhile, U.S. authorities sent her father to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador in March under Mr. Trump's invocation of an 18th-century wartime law to deport hundreds of immigrants.",
      "For years, the government of Maduro had mostly refused the entry of immigrants deported from the U.S. But since Mr. Trump took office this year, hundreds of Venezuelan migrants, including some 180 who spent up to 16 days at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have been deported to their home country.",
      "Maduro on Wednesday thanked Mr. Trump for the return of the toddler, Agence France-Presse reported. Receiving the little girl at the presidential palace in Caracas, Maduro thanked Mr. Trump for a \"profoundly humane act.\"",
      "The Trump administration has said the Venezuelans sent to Guantanamo and El Salvador are members of the Tren de Aragua, but has offered little evidence to back up the allegation.",
      "\"There have been and will be differences, but it is possible, with God's blessing, to move forward and resolve many issues,\" Maduro said, alluding to the deep divisions between his and Mr. Trump's governments. \"I hope and aspire that very soon we can also rescue Maikelys' father and the 253 Venezuelans who are in El Salvador.\"",

Eight years later, as the administration has made a goal of expanding the agreement, Leavitt said Mr. Trump is returning to the region to \"re-emphasize his continued vision for a proud, prosperous and successful Middle East, where the United States and Middle Eastern nations are in cooperative relationships, and where extremism is defeated in place of commerce and cultural exchanges.\"",
      "\"This trip ultimately highlights how we stand on the brink of the golden age for both America and the Middle East, united by a shared vision of stability, opportunity and mutual respect,\" Leavitt added.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to accompany the president in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, the State Department said, where they will \"look to strengthen ties between the United States and Gulf partners.\" Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will also join the president on the Middle East trip, a Pentagon spokesperson said. And Mr. Trump is expected to visit with U.S. military personnel at the U.S. airbase in Qatar, Leavitt said.",
      "Mr. Trump is not expected to visit Israel during the trip, in a change from his first term.",
      "Meanwhile, the royal family of Qatar is donating a jumbo jet for President Trump's exclusive use as a presidential plane, sources told CBS News. The plane will be donated to the future Trump presidential library shortly before he leaves office.",

    "published": "Fri, 09 May 2025 07:36:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The pope's name helps indicate what direction he wants to take the church.",
    "story": [
      "Cardinal Robert Prevost has been announced as the new pontiff\u00a0and has chosen the name Pope Leo XIV.",
      "There are no written rules or official criteria for a pope's name, but they choose names that have meaning in the Catholic tradition.",
      "The significance of a pope's name",
      "The name a new pope chooses will \"indicate a certain spirit and direction and vision of the new pope,\" said Dennis Doyle, a theologian and professor emeritus of religious studies at the University of Dayton.",
      "\"The first thing that you would look for would be, which popes had that name before?\" he said. \"That would signify something about the direction that the pope wants to take.\"",
      "Leo has been chosen 13 times before.",
      "\"The name Leo harkens back to Pope Leo the Great,\" the first pope with the name Leo, CBS News papal contributor Candida Moss said Thursday.",
      "Also known as Pope Leo I, his papacy was from 440 to 461. He's famous for meeting with Attila the Hun and dissuading him from attacking Rome.",
      "\"What does this mean for our new pope? Well, it might mean that he too is going to stand up to oppressive political forces in the world,\" Moss said.",
      "Leo I is also known as \"a great intellectual and theological reformer,\" Moss said. He wrote Leo's Tome, a document that influenced the official doctrine defining Jesus Christ as both fully human and fully divine.",
      "\"Our new pope has a doctorate in canon law, so we might expect that he too is going to clarify the church's teachings on central issues,\" Moss said.",
      "Doyle also pointed to the last pope to use the name Leo, Pope Leo XIII, who was the head of the Catholic Church between 1878 and 1903.",
      "\"He is perhaps most famous for writing the Rerum Novarum,\" Doyle said, which translates to \"On New Things,\" but the Latin meaning is also \"On Revolutionary Changes.\"",
      "The Rerum Novarum addressed workers' rights and capitalism at the dawn of the industrial age and is considered the first Catholic social encyclical, laying the foundation for modern Catholic social thought.",
      "This could indicate that Pope Leo XIV is interested \"in promoting Catholic social teaching in today's world,\" Doyle said. \"Maybe Catholic social teaching, if taken seriously, could be something to help overcome polarization.\"",
      "Bishop Robert Barron, of the Diocese of Winona-Rochester, also saw the connection to Leo XIII and said he thinks the name is \"very significant.\"",
      "Leo XIII was a \"great 19th century pope,\" Barron told CBS News. \"When the revolutions in the 18th century happened, and the philosophical revolutions of the 19th century, the church initially said 'no' to much of that. Leo represents a very nuanced, intelligent engagement with modernity \u2014 not caving into it, not saying yes completely, but not saying no \u2014 using the resources of our own traditions to engage modernity creatively. That makes him a bridge figure.\"",
      "The name Leo \"is a deep sign of commitment to social issues,\" Natalia Imperatori-Lee, the chair of religious studies at Manhattan University, told The Associated Press.",
      "Because of that, Pope Leo XIV's choice of name also suggests a continuation of much of Pope Francis' ministry.",
      "Pope Francis, whose birth name was Jorge Mario Bergoglio, chose a papal name that hadn't been chosen by a pope before, so in his case, \"you have to ask, well, are there any biblical figures or people in the tradition who have had that name?\" Doyle said.",
      "For Francis, it was St. Francis of Assisi, known for his charity and simplicity.",
      "What are the most common papal names?",
      "The names most used by popes have been:",
      "John: 23 timesBenedict: 16 timesGregory: 16 timesClement: 14 timesLeo: 14 timesInnocent: 13 timesPius: 12 times",
      "John: 23 times",
      "Benedict: 16 times",
      "Gregory: 16 times",
      "Clement: 14 times",
      "Leo: 14 times",
      "Innocent: 13 times",
      "Pius: 12 times",
      "As with the name Leo, \"there could be more than one reference in the name that the pope chooses,\" Doyle explained.",
      "Pope Benedict XVI paid homage to Benedict XV, who led the church during World War I, but also to St. Benedict of Nursia, who founded the Benedictine Order and influenced the spread of Christianity throughout Europe.",
      "The name John, the most popular, could refer back to the Gospel of John, which is one of \"the most loved of the gospels,\" Doyle said. It can also refer to St. John the Baptist, the prophet who baptized Jesus.",
      "Have popes always changed their names?",
      "Not every pope in history has changed his name. Out of 266 popes before Pope Leo XIV, 129 have chosen new names, according to Vatican News.",
      "The practice became more ingrained around the 11th century, a period of German popes who chose names of early church bishops out of \"a desire to signify continuity,\" Rev. Roberto Regoli, a historian at Rome's Pontifical Gregorian University, told the AP.",
      "For many centuries, new popes tended to choose the name of the pope who had elevated them to cardinal.",
      "Only starting in the mid-20th century did new popes begin to choose names signaling the aim of their papacy, Regoli said.",
      "Names never chosen by a pope",
      "Some biblical names that haven't been used by a pope are Joseph, James and Andrew.",
      "Popes also have not chosen the name Peter, out of respect for St. Peter, a disciple of Jesus who is recognized as the first pope, experts say.",

      "Emerging evidence also suggests that GLP-1 RAs may have direct anti-tumor effects, Reierson noted \u2014 \"potentially through modulation of immune responses and epigenetic changes (changes that occur to gene expression and are passed down to future generations).\"",
      "FIRST GLP-1 PILL FOR WEIGHT LOSS, DIABETES SHOWS SUCCESS IN LATE-PHASE TRIAL",
      "Research suggests that GLP-1 medications help reduce inflammation not just through weight loss, but also in other organs of the body, such as the heart, according to Dr. Susan Savery, MD, a board-certified obesity medicine and primary care physician with PlushCare, a virtual health platform offering primary care, therapy and weight management services.",
      "\"Over time, chronic inflammation can be a risk factor for cancer development, as it may damage cell DNA,\" San Francisco-based Savery, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"The metabolic regulation and improvement in metabolic health from these medications, including lowering blood glucose levels and decreasing insulin resistance, can reduce cancer risk.\" (iStock)",
      "\"Our fat cells (adipose tissue) naturally produce inflammatory cells, and GLP-1 medications, similar to bariatric surgery, help reduce this inflammation by decreasing the amount of adipose tissue through weight loss.\"",
      "Potential limitations",
      "The study did have some limitations, the researchers acknowledged.",
      "\"First, it is an observational study. It means that our comparison groups (persons who had surgery versus those who received GLP1-RAs) may still have some residual differences, despite our methodological efforts,\" Sagy told Fox News Digital.",

      "\"However, only this type of real-life observational study can provide the long follow-up period that is necessary to evaluate the risk of developing cancer, which often has very long latency periods.\"",
      "Another limitation is that the primary drug included in the study was liraglutide (Saxenda, Victoza), with smaller numbers of people taking exenatide (Byetta) and dulaglutide (Trulicity).",
      "While GLP-1 RAs are \"wonderful tools\" that can support people on weight-loss journeys, Savery pointed out that maintaining a healthy lifestyle through nutritious eating and regular physical activity is \"the foundation for cancer prevention and better overall health.\" (iStock)",
      "\"It will be important to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of the newer GLP1-RA drugs, which are expected to have a larger effect,\" Sagy said.",

      "President Donald Trump expresses disappointment in Boeing for taking 'so long' in building a new Air Force One when asked about the $400 million luxury plane gifted by Qatar.",
      "Both Democrats and Republicans have criticized President Donald Trump after he announced the Department of Defense plans to accept a jumbo jet from the government of Qatar, arguing the gift is riddled with both espionage concerns and constitutional questions. But as one expert tells Fox, the latter concern is likely overblown.",
      "Trump ally Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, for example, said during an interview on Tuesday that the acquisition of the plane poses \"significant espionage and surveillance problems,\" while Democrats such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., declared, \"Trump cannot accept a $400 million flying palace from the royal family of Qatar. Not only is this farcically corrupt, it is blatantly unconstitutional.\"",
      "Reports spread Sunday morning that the Trump administration was expected to accept a $400 million Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from Qatar's royal family, setting off concerns that Trump would personally take ownership of the plane and violate the emoluments clause of the Constitution. ABC News reported that Trump would use the jet until the end of his term, when it would be given to his presidential library.",

      "\"So the fact that the Defense Department is getting a GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE, of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40 year old Air Force One, temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction, so bothers the Crooked Democrats that they insist we pay, TOP DOLLAR, for the plane,\" Trump wrote. \"Anybody can do that! The Dems are World Class Losers!!! MAGA.\"",
      "At the heart of Democrats' concern over the matter is the emoluments clause in the Constitution, which states: \"No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.\"",

The Emoluments Clause wasn\u2019t a suggestion. It\u2019s the LAW,\" Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, said Monday morning following the announcement.",
      "Hans von Spakovsky, senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation's Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, told Fox News Digital on Wednesday that it's questionable if the emoluments clause even applies to the president, as the Constitution typically stipulates when a clause specifically affects a president and cites the title, such as in the impeachment clause.",
      "Boeing has had production issues delivering the next generation of the Air Force One fleet on time. (Getty Images)",
      "\"The clause was specifically inserted because of concerns by the Founders at the Constitutional Convention over corruption of our foreign diplomats, especially by the French government.\u00a0It is questionable whether the emoluments clause even applies to the president since he is not named and the Constitution usually names the president when a provision applies to him.\u00a0That is why the impeachment clause specifically provides that it applies to the \u2018president, vice president and all civil officers of the United States.\u2019 If \u2018officers\u2019 of the U.S. included the president, there would be no need for him to be separately listed,\" von Spakovsky explained.",
      "He added that the president is the individual \"who\u00a0appoints\u00a0the \u2018officers\u2019 who\u00a0are\u00a0subject to the emoluments clause.\"",
      "\"Antonin Scalia, when he worked at the Justice Department, certainly agreed since he issued an opinion in 1974 pointing out that when the Constitution refers to an \u2018officer,\u2019 \u2018it invariably refers to someone other than the President or Vice President,\u2019\" he continued.",

      "\"We're very disappointed that it's taking Boeing so long to build a new Air Force One,\" Trump said during a press conference on drug prices Monday morning. \"You know, we have an Air Force One that's 40 years old.

      "\"When I first came in, I signed an order to get (the new Air Force One fleet) built,\" he continued. \"I took it over from the Obama administration, they had originally agreed. I got the price down much lower. And then, when the election didn't exactly work out the way that it should have, a lot of work was not done on the plane because a lot of people didn't know they made change orders. That was so stupid, so ridiculous. And it ended up being a total mess, a real mess.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also brushed off concern over the Qatari royal family donating a Boeing jumbo jet to the U.S. Department of Defense, arguing on Monday there will be no quid pro quo arrangement and that the donation is under legal review to ensure full compliance with the law.",
      "Von Spakovsky said that if the plane is in fact a government-to-government gift \u2013 and not a personal gift to the president \u2013 the Trump administration is likely in the legal clear to accept the gift.",
      "\"If this gift is being considered as a gift to the government of the U.S., there is no legal issue to consider, since there is no constitutional or legal problem with such a gift.\u00a0If this is a personal gift to the president, the Justice Department would be weighing the constitutional issue I have raised \u2013 whether the emoluments clause even applies to the president,\" he said.",

      "Allies of the president, such as Cruz, said espionage concerns weigh heavily over the planned deal, citing Qatar's ties to terrorist groups.",
      "\"I\u2019m not a fan of Qatar. I think they have a really disturbing pattern of funding theocratic lunatics who want to murder us, funding Hamas and Hezbollah. And that\u2019s a real problem,\" Cruz said during an interview Tuesday on CNBC.",

      "Hackers are most likely to use people search sites, though; they are easily accessible, eminently searchable, relatively cheap (with trial offers for as little as a dollar) and do not ask any questions.

The good news is, there are tools and services out there that can help you clean up your digital footprint and protect your privacy.

A warning popped up saying 'software updating \u2013 do not turn off PC,' and I could see my entire file system being scanned.

      "Fake PayPal scam email (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How this scam works",
      "This type of scam is known as a remote access scam. It often begins with a fake email that appears to come from a trusted company like PayPal. The message claims there is an issue, such as an unauthorized charge, and urges the victim to call a phone number or click a link.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Once the scammer makes contact, they guide the victim to enter a code into their browser or install a program, claiming it will fix the problem. In reality, this grants the scammer full control of the victim\u2019s computer.",
      "Once inside, scammers often search for sensitive files, access banking websites, steal login credentials or install malware to maintain long-term access. Even if the immediate scam is stopped, hidden malware can allow scammers to reenter the system later.",

      "John\u2019s close call highlights several important lessons.",
      "Fake emails are harder to spot than ever: Scammers create emails that look almost identical to real ones from trusted companies like PayPal. They copy logos, formatting and even fake customer support numbers. Always double-check the sender\u2019s email address and verify communications by visiting the official website or app directly instead of clicking links inside emails.",
      "Remote access scams can escalate fast: Once scammers gain control of your device, they can steal sensitive data, move funds between accounts and install hidden malware that stays behind even after the scammer disconnects. It often takes only minutes for serious damage to be done, making fast recognition critical.",
      "Psychological pressure plays a big role: Scammers rely on creating a sense of urgency and fear. By keeping you on the phone and urging secrecy, they isolate you from help and rush you into making bad decisions. Recognizing when you are being pressured is key to breaking the scammer\u2019s control.",
      "Fast action can make all the difference: By quickly disconnecting his computer and contacting his bank, John limited the scammer\u2019s access to his accounts. Acting within minutes rather than hours can stop further theft, block fraudulent transactions and protect your sensitive information from being fully compromised.",

Always find verified contact information through a company's official website or app, not links/numbers provided in suspicious messages.",
      "2. Be skeptical of unusual instructions: No legitimate company will ask you to install software or enter strange codes to protect your account. If anything seems unusual, trust your instincts and stop the communication immediately.",
      "3. Install strong antivirus software on all devices:\u00a0Antivirus programs can detect suspicious downloads, block remote access attempts and help prevent hackers from taking over your system. Having strong antivirus protection installed across all your devices is the best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware and attempt to access your private information. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Use identity theft protection: These services monitor financial accounts, credit reports and online activity for signs of fraud, alerting you to suspicious transactions.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "5. React immediately if you suspect a scam: Disconnect your device from the internet, contact your bank or credit card company immediately and change your passwords, especially for banking and email accounts. Monitor your accounts closely for unauthorized activity and report the scam to the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission as well as the company that was impersonated. Acting quickly can prevent further access and limit the damage scammers can cause.",
      "6. Use multifactor authentication (MFA):\u00a0MFA adds a critical layer of security beyond passwords, blocking unauthorized logins even if credentials are stolen. Enable MFA on all accounts, especially banking, email and payment platforms, to stop scammers from bypassing stolen passwords.",
      "7. Update devices and software immediately:\u00a0Regular updates patch security flaws that scammers exploit to install malware or hijack systems. Turn on automatic updates wherever possible to ensure you\u2019re always protected against newly discovered vulnerabilities.",
      "8. Employ a password manager with strong, unique passwords: Avoid password reuse and use complex passphrases to minimize credential-stuffing attacks. A\u00a0password manager generates and stores uncrackable passwords, eliminating the risk of weak or repeated credentials. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "9. Never share screen access or grant remote control: Scammers exploit screen-sharing tools to steal passwords and manipulate transactions in real time. Legitimate tech support will never demand unsolicited screen access; terminate the call immediately if pressured.",
      "10. Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0These services automate requests to delete your personal information from data brokers and people-search sites, reducing publicly available details scammers could exploit for phishing or impersonation. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson says hackers are using CAPTCHAs to infect your PC with malware.",
      "Ransomware gangs once thrived on infected email attachments and bogus invoices, but security-savvy users and hardened mail gateways have weakened those tactics. Attackers are now focusing on a subtler trick that targets the small checkbox labeled \"I'm not a robot\" that most people click without thinking.",
      "A widespread campaign known as MacReaper has compromised more than 2,800 legitimate websites and redirects visitors to an infection process designed specifically for Apple computers. The operation relies on visual trust signals, including a convincing fake of Google\u2019s reCAPTCHA, along with hidden clipboard code that ends with the installation of Atomic macOS Stealer malware, a data-harvesting infostealer distributed through Telegram.",

      "A woman working on her laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How does the attack unfold?",
      "When a Mac user visits one of the compromised websites, they don't see the page they were expecting. Instead, the site displays a full-screen imitation of Google's familiar reCAPTCHA box.",
      "This fake reCAPTCHA appears harmless, simply asking the user to click \"I'm not a robot.\" However, when the user clicks the box, a hidden command is silently copied to their clipboard. Immediately afterward, the page displays a friendly message, complete with familiar macOS keyboard shortcut visuals, explicitly instructing the user to open Terminal and paste what they've just copied. If the user follows these instructions, the command downloads and runs the malicious file known as Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS).",
      "This trick is specifically targeted at Mac users. The website checks the visitor's operating system and only activates the attack if it detects macOS. For Windows or Linux users, the site behaves normally. Researchers have dubbed this infection method \"ClickFix,\" referencing the single click that initiates the attack chain.",
      "At the center of this campaign is AMOS, a sophisticated piece of malware that has become notorious in cybercrime circles. AMOS is available for rent on Telegram, with some versions costing attackers up to $3,000 per month. Once installed, AMOS can steal a wide array of sensitive data: it can extract Wi-Fi and app passwords stored in Keychain, collect browser cookies and autofill data, list system information and scan through personal folders such as Desktop and Documents. It is also capable of identifying and targeting more than 50 types of cryptocurrency wallets.",
      "Fake reCAPTCHA (Cyber Security News) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Domains and sites compromised in the MacReaper campaign",
      "Several cybersecurity reports have identified specific domains involved in the attack infrastructure. Notably, domains such as\u00a0technavix.cloud and\u00a0salorttactical.top have been highlighted as part of the malicious network distributing AMOS. The campaign's initial discovery traced back to a compromised Brazilian news site,\u00a0agencia2.jornalfloripa.com.br, which served as an early infection vector before the operation expanded to more than 2,800 legitimate websites worldwide.",
      "Macs aren't as secure as Apple wants you to believe",
      "MacReaper challenges two widely held beliefs. The first is that everyday CAPTCHA checks are just harmless speed bumps. The second is that macOS provides a level of built-in security that keeps most attackers at bay. In reality, a single click can expose Keychain credentials, active browser sessions and cryptocurrency wallets.",
      "These are exactly the kinds of targets that attract credential-stuffing groups and profit-driven cybercriminals. Because the attack is triggered by the user, many network monitoring tools treat the traffic as normal, leaving security teams with little to investigate. In environments where Macs and Windows machines share identity systems, one compromised Mac can open access to single sign-on portals, cloud storage and even production codebases.",

      "To protect yourself from the evolving threat of the MacReaper attack, which continues to target users through sophisticated social engineering tactics, consider implementing these six essential security measures.",
      "1) Be skeptical of CAPTCHA prompts: Legitimate CAPTCHA tests never require you to copy commands or paste anything into Terminal. If a website instructs you to do this, it's likely a scam. Close the page immediately and avoid interacting with it.",
      "2) Don't click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many MacReaper attacks start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company's official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "4) Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",
      "5) Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you've interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets or financial transactions that you don't recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "6) Invest in a personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from MacReaper or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "MacReaper makes it clear that the most durable exploits aren't zero-days but borrowed moments of trust, an authentic-looking CAPTCHA, a helpful-sounding fix, a clipboard that does what it's told. As Apple tightens the technical screws with Rapid Security Responses and notarization, expect adversaries to double down on such psychological levers. The counter-strategy is to hard-bake healthy skepticism into user behavior and to instrument Macs with the same telemetry layers enterprises already expect from Windows. Security, in other words, has finally become a platform-agnostic muscle, and complacency is the riskiest operating system of all.",

      "One of the most impressive features of the Ability Hand is its integrated pressure sensors in the fingertips. When you grip something, these sensors detect how much force you're applying and send a gentle vibration to your arm, giving you sensory feedback. This means users can handle delicate objects with greater confidence and precision, something that was previously impossible with traditional prosthetics.",
      "The Ability Hand offers an impressive variety of grip patterns, 32 in total, with 19 ready to use right now. Whether you need a strong power grip for lifting or a delicate pinch for picking up small items, this hand adapts easily. Customized grips are also available for those who want something tailored.",

      "Charging is simple with a USB-C port, taking about an hour to fully charge. The battery lasts 6 to 8 hours, depending on use.

This raises an unsettling concern among many: could someone actually drain your bank account while making it appear as though your balance remains untouched?",
      "As Bruce from Phoenix asks, \"Is it true that hackers can wipe out your bank account but make it look like the money is still there?\"",
      "The short answer is yes, though it\u2019s rare and requires a high level of skill. Still, even the possibility is alarming, especially when you consider how easily people can fall victim to common tactics hackers use to gain access to accounts in the first place.",

      "How do hackers access your bank account?",
      "There\u2019s a long list of methods cybercriminals use to get into people\u2019s financial accounts, and most of them don\u2019t involve \"hacking\" in the Hollywood sense. Instead, they rely on tricking you into handing over sensitive information. Here are some of the most common techniques.",
      "Fake banking apps and mobile trojans: Some apps are designed to look exactly like your bank\u2019s official app, but they\u2019re actually fakes. If you enter your login info, it goes straight to the scammer. Even more advanced are\u00a0mobile banking trojans, which hide inside seemingly unrelated apps. Once installed, the trojan watches for when you open your real banking app and then quickly overlays a fake login screen. If you type in your credentials, the trojan grabs them and sends them off to the attacker.",
      "Phishing scams: Scammers\u00a0send emails or texts that appear to be from your bank, asking you to verify a transaction or log in to resolve an issue. These messages often include links to websites that look identical to your bank\u2019s site but are actually fakes. The giveaway is often a small detail, like a misspelled URL. For example, \"captial0ne.com\" instead of \"capitalone.com.\"",

      "Man-in-the-middle attacks:\u00a0These attacks happen when hackers intercept the data being transmitted between you and your bank\u2019s website. This is especially risky if you\u2019re on\u00a0public Wi-Fi. You may think you're logging in securely, but a hacker could be watching everything or even redirecting you to a fake version of your bank's site.",
      "SIM swapping:\u00a0SIM swapping is where a scammer contacts your phone provider, pretends to be you and asks to transfer your number to a new SIM card. If successful, they receive your text messages, including any verification codes sent by your bank. This gives them access to your account, even if two-factor authentication is turned on.",

By targeting the display layer of your banking app or web interface. If malware is installed on your device, it can manipulate what shows up on the screen. That means your balance might look normal, while your actual funds are long gone. This type of attack is extremely rare and usually requires access to a compromised or jailbroken device, but it\u2019s technically possible and just sophisticated enough to delay you from realizing what happened.",

      "1) Use official apps only: Cybercriminals will try to trick you with fake banking apps and mobile trojans that overlay fake login screens, so it\u2019s critical to download banking apps exclusively from the Apple App Store or Google Play. Never install apps from links in emails or texts.",
      "2) Turn on two-factor authentication (2FA): SIM-swapping attacks can hijack your phone number and intercept SMS codes, so enable app-based\u00a02FA to block unauthorized logins even if hackers obtain your password.",
      "3) Get text or app alerts: Hackers can manipulate your account\u2019s display to hide stolen funds, so set up real-time transaction alerts to expose unauthorized withdrawals immediately, especially for microtransactions used to test your account.",
      "4) Use strong, unique passwords: Phishing scams and keyloggers often harvest weak or reused credentials, so use a password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5) Avoid clicking suspicious links and install strong antivirus software: Scammers impersonate banks with phishing emails/texts containing misspelled URLs (e.g., \"captial0ne.com\"), so always navigate directly to your bank\u2019s official website or app instead of clicking embedded links. Strong antivirus software helps protect your devices from fake apps, keyloggers and other threats. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Check your accounts regularly: Don\u2019t just glance at your balance. Review recent transactions at least once a week to catch any suspicious activity.",
      "7) Avoid public Wi-Fi for banking: Hackers exploit unsecured networks to launch man-in-the-middle attacks and spoof banking sites, so use a VPN to encrypt your connection if you must bank on public Wi-Fi. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "8) Use a personal data removal service: Data brokers sell your contact details and personal information, which hackers can use for targeted phishing attacks or SIM swap scams. These services automatically remove your data from broker databases, reducing the risk of social engineering attempts that could compromise your bank account.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "GOT A BANK TRANSFER ALERT TEXT? IT MIGHT BE A SCAM. HERE'S WHAT TO DO",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Hackers don\u2019t need to break into your bank\u2019s system; they just need to trick you. Whether it\u2019s phishing, malware or SIM swaps, the goal is always the same: get access to your login and verification codes. Fortunately, you can make it much harder for them by using secure habits and staying alert. Your money belongs with you, not in the hands of a scammer.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says AT\u00b2 Aerospace\u2019s Z1 hybrid airship uses helium lift, low fuel, no runways.",
      "The tragic Hindenburg disaster of 1937, which resulted in the death of 36 people and effectively ended passenger airship travel, cast a long-lasting shadow over lighter-than-air technology. For many decades, airships were largely confined to niche roles such as advertising and surveillance.",
      "However, a groundbreaking spin-off from Lockheed Martin to AT\u00b2 Aerospace is now reviving the airship concept with a modern twist: hybrid airships designed specifically for eco-friendly cargo transport. Most recently, AT\u00b2 Aerospace announced two purchase orders for their airships, one from Straightline Aviation and one from Arctic Airships.",

      "Z1 hybrid airship (AT\u00b2 Aerospace) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The Z1 hybrid airship",
      "At the center of this revival is the Z1 hybrid airship, a massive vessel capable of carrying up to 23.5 tons (21 metric tons) of cargo while minimizing environmental impacts and significantly reducing fuel consumption compared to traditional aircraft. Unlike the hydrogen-filled Hindenburg, which was highly flammable, the Z1 relies on helium for lift, a nonflammable gas, providing buoyancy for the majority of the airship's weight, combined with aerodynamic design and advanced propulsion systems.",
      "Z1 hybrid airship (AT\u00b2 Aerospace) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "MASSIVE AIRSHIP COULD SHAKE UP CARGO TRANSPORT",
      "How the Z1 hybrid airship works",
      "The Z1 combines lighter-than-air buoyancy with advanced engineering innovations. Notably, the aircraft features a tri-lobe hull design, a hallmark of Lockheed Martin's earlier airship projects. This design includes a raised central lobe flanked by two side lobes, which enhances lift efficiency and stability. Its Air Cushion Landing System allows it to take off and land on virtually any flat surface, including sand, ice, water or uneven terrain, eliminating the need for traditional runways.",
      "The Z1 uses vectored thrust propulsion and advanced onboard systems for weather prediction and route planning, enabling it to travel more than 1,400 nautical miles at speeds of up to 60 knots. The hybrid lift system merges helium's natural buoyancy with vectored thrust from the engines, optimizing both efficiency and control. This innovative design reduces fuel consumption to just one-fifth of what a heavy-lift helicopter would use, making the Z1 especially suited for transporting goods to remote and difficult-to-access areas such as the Arctic or the Amazon rainforest.",
      "Z1 hybrid airship (AT\u00b2 Aerospace) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "ZERO EMISSIONS HYDROGEN ELECTRIC JET DISRUPTS CONVENTIONAL FLIGHTS",
      "Why it matters",
      "The Z1 addresses two pressing challenges in modern transportation. First, it offers a practical solution for accessing remote regions where traditional cargo planes and helicopters face high costs and infrastructure limitations. Its ability to land without airstrips unlocks affordable transport options for industries like mining, disaster relief and medical supply delivery in isolated communities.",
      "Second, the Z1 contributes to the urgent global need to reduce carbon emissions. Transports such as cars, trucks, trains, ships and airplanes currently account for over 40% of worldwide carbon emissions, and the Z1's low fuel consumption and ability to overfly environmentally sensitive areas quietly present a scalable alternative for freight transport with minimized environmental impact.",

      "The recent $50 million order from Straightline Aviation demonstrates strong confidence in the Z1's commercial potential, with the first delivery expected by 2028. Arctic Airships has also placed orders for two airships, targeting operations in Alaska's challenging terrain.",
      "\"Our hybrid airships will transform cargo transport by providing an environmentally responsible solution while maintaining operational efficiency,\" said Dr. Bob Boyd, CEO of AT\u00b2 Aerospace. He went on to say,\u00a0\"Our aircraft not only optimizes cargo movement in challenging terrains but also aligns with the industry's increasing focus on environmental responsibility and cost efficiency.\"",

      "Knowing the basics: SMS vs. MMS vs. RCS",
      "Before you can figure out which phone carrier fits your messaging needs, it helps to understand the differences between the three main types of mobile messaging \u2014 SMS, MMS and RCS. Each has its own capabilities, limitations and impact on your experience.",
      "Join The FREE CyberGuy Report: Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals \u2014 plus instant access to my\u00a0free Ultimate Scam Survival Guide when you sign up!",
      "SMS (Short Message Service) is the most basic form of text messaging and has been around since the early days of mobile phones. It allows users to send plain text messages with a strict character limit of 160 characters. SMS messages are sent over the cellular network, which means they work even if you don\u2019t have a data plan or access to Wi-Fi. This makes SMS one of the most reliable messaging options available, especially for simple communication. It works for all phones, even older models, which makes it universal.",
      "MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service)\u00a0builds upon SMS by allowing the transmission of multimedia content. With MMS, users can send images, videos, audio files and even GIFs. The character limit is significantly higher, typically up to 1,600 characters, although this can vary depending on the carrier. MMS messages also travel over the cellular network but require mobile data to send and receive. They do not require Wi-Fi, but because media files are larger, the reliability can vary. Some carriers compress MMS files or fail to send them if they exceed certain size limits, which means your carefully chosen vacation photo might arrive as a pixelated blur.",
      "RCS (Rich Communication Services) represents the next generation of mobile messaging. It is designed to upgrade the SMS and MMS experience by providing features that rival popular messaging apps like iMessage and WhatsApp. With RCS, users can send high-resolution photos and videos, audio clips, emoji, stickers and even read receipts and typing indicators. There is no character limit, and the service works over Wi-Fi or mobile data instead of over standard cellular channels.",
      "While RCS allows larger files, some messaging platforms or carriers may still apply soft limits or compress images/videos to ensure consistent performance. However, for RCS to work, both the sender and the recipient need to have RCS enabled on a supported messaging app and carrier. Google Messages is the most reliable app for accessing these RCS features, especially on Android devices. However, it should be noted that Apple devices do not support RCS natively because Apple relies on iMessage for similar functionality.",
      "HOW TO STOP SPAM TEXT MESSAGES ON YOUR PHONE",
      "Why it matters when choosing a wireless carrier",
      "Now that you know what SMS, MMS and RCS are, it\u2019s important to understand how your phone carrier influences your messaging experience. From hidden fees to message delivery issues, the provider you choose can make a big difference in how well these technologies work.",
      "Not all carriers treat these messaging types the same. While SMS is often free and unlimited on many plans, MMS messages may incur additional charges, especially on prepaid or international plans. RCS messages, on the other hand, use mobile data or Wi-Fi and typically do not incur per-message fees, making them a cost-effective option if supported.",
      "For example, carrier A might offer unlimited SMS but charge for every MMS sent. Carrier B might include MMS in the plan but cap the number of SMS messages. Carrier C could fully support RCS, letting users send messages over Wi-Fi for free. Choosing the right carrier based on how you communicate can help avoid surprise charges.",
      "While SMS and MMS are universally supported, RCS still depends on carrier infrastructure and the messaging app being used. Some carriers support RCS only through their proprietary apps, which may not be compatible with all devices. Others support \"universal RCS\", which works across multiple platforms but still requires the right app, most reliably\u00a0Google Messages.",
      "If you\u2019re hoping to use RCS features like high-resolution image sharing, read receipts and typing indicators, it\u2019s important to ensure your carrier not only supports RCS but also supports it universally across devices and apps. Otherwise, your message may silently fall back to SMS or MMS if the recipient\u2019s carrier or device does not support RCS.",

      "As of May 2025, all major U.S. wireless carriers and most of their sub-brands and MVNOs (mobile virtual network operators) fully support SMS, MMS and RCS messaging. This includes both Android and iPhone users (with iOS 18.4 or newer for RCS on iPhone).",
      "You can expect full support for SMS, MMS and RCS on the following carriers:\u00a0AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, US Cellular, C Spire, Consumer Cellular, Cricket, Family Mobile, FirstNet, H2O Wireless, Metro by T-Mobile, Mint Mobile, Boost Mobile, Google Fi, PureTalk, RedPocket Mobile, Spectrum Mobile, Straight Talk, TracFone, Ultra Mobile, US Mobile, Visible and Xfinity Mobile.",

RCS is even less predictable outside your home country, as it relies on mobile data or Wi-Fi and often does not function while roaming unless your carrier specifically enables it for international use.",

      "To enhance your mobile messaging security, follow these best practices:",
      "1. Avoid clicking on unknown links or messages and install strong antivirus software: Be cautious with links or attachments from unknown sources because they can lead to\u00a0phishing or malware attacks. Also, install strong antivirus software on your device to protect against malware and viruses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Enable Multi-factor Authentication (MFA):\u00a0Use MFA to add an extra layer of security for your messaging apps and accounts. This can include methods like authentication apps, physical security keys, or SMS codes, which help prevent unauthorized access even if your password is compromised. By activating MFA, you significantly reduce the risk of your accounts being hacked, providing an essential safeguard against cyber threats.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Keep your device and apps updated: Regularly\u00a0update your operating system and apps to ensure you have the latest security patches.",
      "4. Use end-to-end encrypted messaging apps: Consider using apps with end-to-end encryption for secure communication. This ensures that only you and the intended recipient can read the messages, keeping them safe from hackers or third-party interception. Popular options include Signal, WhatsApp and iMessage, which prioritize privacy and protect sensitive conversations from unauthorized access.",
      "5. Be mindful of public Wi-Fi and use a Virtual Private Network (VPN):\u00a0Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive communications, as it can be insecure and expose your data to potential eavesdropping or hacking. Consider using a VPN for secure browsing on public networks because it encrypts your internet traffic and masks your IP address, providing a safer experience even on unsecured networks. By using a VPN, you can significantly reduce the risks associated with public Wi-Fi and protect your personal data from unauthorized access. For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "6. Delete sensitive messages:\u00a0Regularly delete sensitive messages to minimize data exposure. This practice helps protect your privacy by ensuring that confidential information isn't stored indefinitely on your device or in the cloud, where it could potentially be accessed by unauthorized parties. Additionally, consider using messaging apps that offer features like automatic message deletion or self-destructing messages to further enhance your privacy",

      "A neurosurgical microrobot. (Robeaut\u00e9)",
      "The challenges of brain surgery today",
      "Brain surgery is incredibly complex. The tools surgeons use today are often rigid and can only move in straight lines. This limits where they can safely operate. Many tumors or problematic areas in the brain are simply too risky to reach because they lie near regions responsible for critical functions like movement or speech.",
      "In some cases, surgeons have no choice but to leave tumors untreated because the risk of damage is too high. On top of that, many drugs cannot even reach certain parts of the brain because of the blood-brain barrier, leaving patients with limited treatment options.",
      "A neurosurgical microrobot. (Robeaut\u00e9)",
      "TEEN GOES FROM 10 NIGHTLY SEIZURES TO ZERO WITH BRAIN IMPLANT",
      "How the microrobot works",
      "Robeaut\u00e9\u2019s microrobot is designed to overcome these challenges. It is incredibly small, about three millimeters long, roughly the size of a grain of rice, and it enters the brain through a tiny incision just a millimeter wide. Unlike traditional tools, this robot does not move in straight lines. Instead, it can follow curved paths, gently pushing aside brain tissue as it goes. It uses rotating silicone rings at its tip to carefully shift tissue without causing damage. This movement is inspired by how tiny insects walk on water, using adhesion forces that dominate at such small scales.",
      "Inside the robot, there is a small compartment that holds miniature surgical tools. For example, when performing a biopsy, the microrobot uses a flexible needle and tiny forceps to collect tissue samples. These samples can be stored inside the device or pulled back through a cable connected to the robot. Beyond biopsies, the robot can also implant electrodes for conditions like Parkinson\u2019s disease or deliver drugs directly to tumors. It even has sensors that send real-time information back to the surgeons, helping them monitor the procedure closely.",
      "What is really impressive is how the robot\u2019s path is planned. Using MRI scans combined with artificial intelligence, surgeons can map out safe routes that avoid sensitive brain areas. During surgery, they can adjust the robot\u2019s position in real time using ultrasound imaging mounted on the skull, achieving sub-millimeter precision.",

      "AI ENABLES PARALYZED MAN TO CONTROL ROBOTIC ARM WITH BRAIN SIGNALS",
      "Looking ahead: Trials and future plans",
      "So far, the microrobot has been tested in preclinical trials, mainly on sheep, with very promising results. There were no major complications like bleeding, which suggests the device can safely navigate brain tissue. Robeaut\u00e9 plans to begin human clinical trials in 2026, focusing on microbiopsies of brain tumors. They also aim to expand into the U.S. market and seek FDA approval, with hopes of launching internationally by 2030.",

      "The potential impact of this microrobot is huge. It could allow doctors to diagnose brain tumors earlier and treat them more effectively while reducing the risks associated with traditional surgery. Because it is minimally invasive, patients could experience faster recoveries and fewer side effects. Additionally, the ability to collect live data from inside the brain could accelerate research and drug development for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s.",

It tackles one of the most difficult challenges in healthcare: how to safely access and treat the brain. While there are still hurdles to overcome, such as regulatory approvals and manufacturing at scale, this tiny device has the potential to turn previously \"inoperable\" brain tumors into treatable conditions. As one of the company\u2019s founders describes it, the microrobot acts like a \"brain gardener,\" delicately tending to damaged tissue from within.

      "When sending photos from an iPhone to an Android phone, images often appear blurry or compressed due to differences in messaging protocols and compression methods. This issue arises because Apple uses SMS/MMS to send messages to Android devices, which compresses images due to size limitations. Additionally, iPhones often use the HEIC format, which may not be fully supported on Android devices, leading to compatibility issues and reduced quality.",

      "Kseniia Petrova, a researcher at Harvard Medical School, was charged in a criminal complaint with one count of smuggling goods into the U.S., according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Massachusetts. Petrova was originally detained on Feb. 16, 2025 after a law enforcement canine alerted its handler to her luggage.",
      "The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office said on Wednesday that Petrova allegedly denied having the biological material at first but later admitted to carrying it.",
      "Prosecutors also claim that Petrova\u2019s text messages show that she was aware that she needed a permit to bring in the clawed frog embryos and embryonic samples that were allegedly found in her luggage. In one text message exchange cited by the office, Petrova was asked whether she had a plan to get the biological material into the U.S., and she allegedly responded by saying, \"No plan yet. I won\u2019t be able to swallow them.\"",

      "However, Gregory Romanovsky, the attorney representing Petrova, said on Thursday that customs experts confirmed that his client \"did not need a permit to bring her non-living scientific samples that are not considered biological material under U.S. Customs law.\"",

This is not a coincidence,\" Romanovsky said.",

The government confirmed in court yesterday its intent to deport Kseniia to Russia, where it knows she will face grave danger for opposing the Putin regime.\"",
      "Petrova said in a recent New York Times op-ed that she was returning to the U.S. after vacationing in Paris when she was detained by ICE in February. She also expressed her fear of being arrested in Russia if deported, as she has been a critic of the war in Ukraine.",

      "While she admitted in the op-ed to not filling out a customs form regarding the frog embryos in her luggage, she believed it would result in a fine or warning, not an arrest.",
      "\"At Logan International Airport, I did not complete a customs declaration for frog embryos (for use in our lab\u2019s research) in my luggage. I\u2019m told this would normally result in a warning or a fine. Instead, my visa was revoked, and I was sent to a detention center in Louisiana,\" Petrova wrote.",

      "The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division on Wednesday afternoon announced that Hill, 57, is facing two counts of misconduct and obstruction of justice charges in Colleton County while her perjury charge is filed in Richland County.",
      "Murdaugh's attorney, Dick Harpootlian, said on \"The Story with Martha MacCallum\" that he believes the charges will lead to a new trial.",
      "Charging documents state that the crimes stem from a January 2024 hearing in the South Carolina Supreme Court, when Justice Jean Toal ruled that a new trial was not necessary for Murdaugh, who was convicted in the June 2021 murders of his wife, Maggie, and son, Paul, on his family hunting estate. Murdaugh had requested the new hearing based on allegations of jury tampering surrounding Hill, which Murdaugh's defense team had argued warranted a new trial.",

      "\"We are aware of the charges filed against Becky Hill, and while these developments are serious, they are not surprising,\" Dick Harpootlian and Jim Griffin, Murdaugh's defense attorneys, told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"We have long raised our concerns about her conduct during and after the trial and this arrest further underscores the need to protect the integrity of the judicial process. Every defendant is entitled to a fair and impartial trial and we look forward to Alex Murdaugh finally getting that fair treatment.\"",
      "Hill was previously accused of sending herself nearly $10,000 in federal bonuses in the form of child support payments, according to a notice of hearing. She used federal funds to give food and gifts to court employees, including \"Easter Goodies,\" Mother's and Father's Day gifts, and Valentine's Day gifts; paint supplies; flowers and decor; various meals for herself; office furniture; dog food, dog bones and a dog bed, among other items.",

      "\"I thought that if he was to get any relief, it would come after he exhausted his state court appeals and it would be on the federal level,\" Bland said in a Wednesday post on X. \"According to the State Paper, the perjury charge arises out of her testimony that she gave in the February 2024 hearing in front of Justice Toal. I think this further complicates the situation and increases the chances that he will get a reversal and a new trial.

One where they don't have a tainted verdict. I would think that [the] 6th Amendment being upheld would be more important than protecting a verdict. It remains to be seen as to what will happen but I am praying that I can have a justice system that I can believe in again rather than a corrupt good ol boy system.\"",

      "Jose Mujica, a one-time guerrilla and later president of Uruguay who drove a beat-up VW Beetle and enacted progressive reforms that carried his reputation well beyond South America, has died aged 89.",
      "The straight-talking Mujica, known to many Uruguayans by his nickname \"Pepe,\" led the small farming country's leftist government from 2010 to 2015 after convincing voters his radical past was a closed chapter.",
      "FORMER URUGUAYAN PRESIDENT JOSE MUJICA ANNOUNCES ESOPHAGEAL CANCER DIAGNOSIS",
      "\"It is with deep sorrow that we announce the death of our comrade Pepe Mujica,\" President Yamandu Orsi said in a post on X. \"Thank you for everything you gave us and for your deep love for your people.\"",
      "As president, Mujica adopted what was then a pioneering liberal stance on issues related to civil liberties. He signed a law allowing gay marriage and abortions in early pregnancy, and backed a proposal to legalize marijuana sales. The gay marriage and abortion measures were a big shift for Catholic Latin America, and the move on marijuana was at the time almost unprecedented worldwide.",
      "Regional leaders, including leftist presidents in Brazil, Chile and Mexico, mourned Mujica's passing and praised his example.",
      "\"He defended democracy like few others. And he never stopped advocating for social justice and the end of all inequalities,\" said Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Mujica's \"greatness transcended the borders of Uruguay and his presidential term,\" he added.",
      "During his term in office, Mujica refused to move to the presidential residence, choosing to stay in his modest home where he kept a small flower farm in a suburb of Montevideo, the capital.",
      "Shunning a formal suit and tie, it was common to see him driving around in his Beetle or eating at downtown restaurants where office workers had lunch.",

      "In a May 2024 interview with Reuters in the tin-roofed house that Mujica shared with his wife, former Senator Lucia Topolansky, he said he had kept the old Beetle and that it was still in \"phenomenal\" condition.",
      "But, he added, he preferred a turn on the tractor, saying it was \"more entertaining\" than a car and was a place where \"you have time to think.\"",
      "Critics questioned Mujica's tendency to break with protocol, while his blunt and occasionally uncouth statements sometimes forced him to explain himself, under pressure from opponents and political allies alike.",
      "But it was his down-to-earth style and progressive musings that endeared him to many Uruguayans.",
      "\"The problem is that the world is run by old people, who forget what they were like when they were young,\" Mujica said during the 2024 interview.",
      "Mujica himself was 74 when he became president. He was elected with 52% of the vote, despite some voters' concerns about his age and his past as one of the leaders of the Tupamaros rebel group in the 1960s and 1970s.",
      "Lucia Topolansky was Mujica's long-term partner, dating back to their days in the Tupamaros. The couple married in 2005, and she served as vice president from 2017-2020.",
      "After leaving office, they remained politically active, regularly attending inaugurations of Latin American presidents and giving crucial backing to candidates in Uruguay, including Orsi, who took office in March 2025. They stopped growing flowers on their small holding but continued to cultivate vegetables, including tomatoes that Topolansky pickled each season.",
      "BEHIND BARS",
      "Jose Mujica's birth certificate recorded him as born in 1935, although he claimed there was an error and that he was actually born a year earlier. He once described his upbringing as \"dignified poverty.\"",
      "Mujica's father died when he was 9 or 10 years old, and as a boy he helped his mother maintain the farm where they grew flowers and kept chickens and a few cows.",
      "At the time Mujica became interested in politics, Uruguay's left was weak and fractured and he began his political career in a progressive wing of the center-right National Party.",
      "In the late 1960s, he joined the Marxist Tupamaros guerrilla movement, which sought to weaken Uruguay's conservative government through robberies, political kidnappings and bombings.",
      "Mujica later said that he had never killed anyone but was involved in several violent clashes with police and soldiers and was once shot six times.",
      "Uruguay's security forces gained the upper hand over the Tupamaros by the time the military swept to power in a 1973 coup, marking the start of a 12-year dictatorship in which about 200 people were kidnapped and killed. Thousands more were jailed and tortured.",
      "Mujica spent almost 15 years behind bars, many in solitary confinement, lying at the bottom of an old horse trough with only ants for company. He managed to escape twice, once by tunneling into a nearby house. His biggest \"vice\" as he approached 90, he later said, was talking to himself, alluding to his time in isolation.",
      "When democracy was restored to the farming country of roughly 3 million people in 1985, Mujica was released and returned to politics, gradually becoming a prominent figure on the left.",
      "He served as agriculture minister in the center-left coalition of his predecessor, President Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez, who would go on to succeed him from 2015 to 2020.",
      "Mujica's support base was on the left, but he maintained a fluid dialogue with opponents within the center-right, inviting them to traditional barbecues at his home.",
      "\"We can't pretend to agree on everything. We have to agree with what there is, not with what we like,\" he said.",
      "He believed drugs should be decriminalized \"under strict state control\" and addiction addressed.",
      "\"I do not defend drug use. But I can't defend (a ban) because now we have two problems: drug addiction, which is a disease, and narcotrafficking, which is worse,\" he said.",

      "In retirement, he remained resolutely optimistic.",
      "\"I want to convey to all the young people that life is beautiful, but it wears out and you fall,\" he said following a cancer diagnosis.",

      "Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff and hostage envoy Adam Boehler will travel from Israel to Doha, Qatar, on Tuesday for further negotiations for the release of not only the 24 hostages still believed to be alive, but also the bodies of at least 34 individuals who have been held by the terrorist group including four Americans: Itay Chen, Omer Neutra, and Gadi Haggai and Judi Weinstein Haggai.",
      "In a nearly\u00a0two-hour meeting with Witkoff, Boehler and the Hostages Families Forum, both officials emphasized that they remain committed to returning all hostages and confirmed they would not be traveling to Doha if they did not believe there was a real chance in advancing negotiations.",

      "While Alexander's return has been championed as a major success story, and both President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were reported to have spoken with the Israeli American from a hospital in Tel Aviv, immense concern remains over the hostages still held in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Though Israel ceased its military operations in the Gaza Strip to secure the safe transport of Alexander on Monday, it has not committed to any continued cessation of strikes.",
      "In Witkoff\u2019s comments to the families of the hostages, he said President Trump would not \"tolerate anything other than everybody coming home, and he will be relentless in that pursuit.\" He continued, \"you saw what happened with the Houthis. You saw what happened when people don't do well with the United States, we don't do so well with them. So it's a message of do what we ask you to do. And you know then things will be better.\"",
      "Israeli reports also suggested the envoy may be feeling frustrated with his Israeli counterparts.",
      "\"We want to bring the hostages home, but Israel is not willing to end the war. Israel is prolonging it despite the fact that we don\u2019t see where else we can go and that an agreement must be reached,\" Witkoff reportedly said during the meeting with the\u00a0hostage families.",
      "\"There is currently a window of opportunity that we hope Israel and all the mediators will take advantage of,\" he was reported to have added. \"We are putting pressure on all the mediators and doing everything we can to bring the hostages home.\"",
      "The comments reportedly come following reports that Trump has also grown increasingly frustrated with his Israeli counterpart.",

      "Israel said last week that Trump\u2019s visit to the Middle East would be \"the window of opportunity\" to secure a ceasefire otherwise it would continue with its newly announced plans to capture all of Gaza, despite immense international pushback and concerns over human rights abuses and violations of U.N.-established borders.",
      "The comments came after Netanyahu prompted immense outcry after he said his number one priority was destroying Hamas, not returning the hostages, despite opposition to the plan by the majority of Israelis.",
      "On Monday, Netanyahu reiterated his intent to \"destroy\" Hamas while speaking with injured reservists and confirmed that even if Hamas agrees to return the hostages, Israel will continue with its military operations.",

But there will not be a situation in which we stop the war. There may be a temporary ceasefire, but we\u2019re going all the way,\" he confirmed.",

For Syria\u2019s new government, this will be their opportunity to persuade the new administration to do business with a country coming out of a devastating 13-year civil war and mend ties with a leader who was once aligned with the Islamic State and al Qaeda.",

      "Ford does not believe al-Sharaa will pursue terrorism as he did in the past, but while there have been some promising developments since taking power, the U.S. must keep its expectations relatively low.",

      "In al-Sharaa\u2019s eyes, the deal of the century would bring peace to Syria and its neighbors, including Israel. Moustafa added the deal would keep China, Russia and Iran out and allow U.S. troops to go home in the right way.",

      "He said Iran would commit to never making nuclear weapons, getting rid of its stockpiles of highly enriched uranium which can be weaponized, agree to enrich uranium only to the lower levels needed for civilian use, and allow international inspectors to supervise the process, in exchange for the immediate lifting of all economic sanctions on Iran.",
      "Asked if Iran would agree to sign an agreement today if those conditions were met, Shamkhani said, \u201cYes.\u201d",
      "His comments appear to be the clearest public statement yet on Iran\u2019s expectations and willingness to reach a deal from the supreme leader\u2019s inner circle. Iran\u2019s supreme leader has the final say on all matters of national security.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still possible. If the Americans act as they say, for sure we can have better relations,\u201d\u00a0Shamkhani said, adding, \u201cit can lead to a better situation in the near future.\u201d",
      "Shamkhani sat down with NBC News just hours after Trump offered Iran \u201can olive branch\u201d that was combined with threats of crippling economic sanctions should Iran not accept an agreement to limit its nuclear program.",
      "Trump\u2019s remarks were criticized by Iranian\u00a0President\u00a0Masoud Pezeshkian.",
      "\u201cHe thinks he can come here, chant slogans, and scare us. For us, martyrdom is far sweeter than dying in bed,\u201d he said Wednesday in comments broadcast live on state television, according to Reuters. \u201cYou came to frighten us? We will not bow to any bully.\u201d",
      "Shamkhani also expressed frustration at Trump\u2019s tone and continued threats.",
      "\u201cHe talks about the olive branch, which we have not seen. It\u2019s all barbed wire,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump has repeatedly said Iran cannot be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon.",
      "While Iran has always denied that it is seeking to do so, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.\u2019s nuclear watchdog, says that it has enriched enough uranium close to weapons-grade quality to make six nuclear bombs.",
      "The U.S. and Iran have been holding talks over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program for weeks, with Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, calling the last round in Muscat, the capital of Oman, \u201cencouraging.\u201d",
      "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas\u00a0Araghchi, meanwhile, called the negotiations \u201cdifficult but useful.\u201d",
      "\u201cEnrichment is an issue that Iran will not give up, and there is no room for compromise on it,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, its dimensions, levels or amounts might change for a period to allow confidence-building.\u201d",
      "In Wednesday\u2019s interview, Shamkhani expressed concern that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, often known by the nickname Bibi, could try to derail the process through backchannel lobbying in Washington.",
      "\u201cIf the Americans remove the Bibi effect, they can easily sign the deal,\u201d Shamkhani said.",
      "There are signs, however, that Trump may be distancing himself from Netanyahu. NBC News previously reported that, according to two U.S. officials, two Middle Eastern diplomats and two other people with knowledge of the tensions, the two leaders are increasingly at odds over a strategy for tackling challenges in the region, including Iran.",
      "While Netanyahu has supported military action against Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, Trump has begun to see an opportunity to remove the threat of Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon by making a deal with the government, the sources said."

      "On Wednesday, Trump told reporters on Air Force One that he didn\u2019t know how an Emirati-backed firm had struck a deal with the Trump family company\u2019s digital coin for $2 billion.",
      "\u201cI really don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d Trump said, adding that he is a big cryptocurrency fan and if the U.S. doesn\u2019t lead in crypto and AI, China will. Zach Witkoff, a co-founder of the World Liberty Financial crypto venture and the son of the president\u2019s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, announced the investment at a conference in Dubai earlier this month.",
      "Asked if the Saudi-financed and Trump-linked LIV Golf tour came up during his conversations with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman over the last two days, Trump said it had not. \u201cWe didn\u2019t discuss that,\u201d he added. He also sidestepped Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s threat to block his nominees until there are more answers on a high-priced jet that Qatar has offered as a gift and instead mused that there was \u201cjust something wrong\u201d with Schumer, a New York Democrat.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "The Trump Organization, led by the president\u2019s two oldest sons, has also significantly expanded its Middle East footprint, with new ventures in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Oman. These include a Trump International Hotel & Tower in Dubai, a golf resort in Doha with Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund\u2019s real estate arm,\u00a0a Trump Tower in Jeddah, and a hotel under construction in Muscat. The projects are partnered with Dar Global, a developer linked to the Saudi government. It's unclear how long the projects will take to complete.",
      "The Trump-branded projects have drawn scrutiny in Washington from the president's political opponents and even some allies, who point out that the president has not divested from the Trump Organization and continues to profit from \u2014 and personally promote \u2014 these business ventures in his second term. The company has said that Trump handed over management of his assets to his family before returning to office and has no day-to-day role.",
      "\"The Trump Organization developments in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates raise serious conflict of interest questions, as President\u00a0Trump meets with top officials of all three countries this week,\u201d said Meghan Faulkner, communications director for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an advocacy group and watchdog focused on issues of public integrity and affiliated with Democrats. \u201cThe American people should not have to wonder if Donald Trump is prioritizing their interests or his own bottom line while he is making foreign policy decisions, but his business ties make that an unavoidable question.\u201d",
      "The White House did not return a request for comment.",
      "Trump\u2019s affinity for the Middle East is well known, with the president finding fertile ground in the region as he works to carve out an image as a global peacemaker and the leader of a country that is open for business. On Tuesday in Riyadh, he announced plans to lift U.S. sanctions on Syria and offered Iran \u201ca new, hopeful path\u201d toward a better future.",
      "During a state visit with Qatar\u2019s emir on Wednesday, Trump praised the warming Qatar-Saudi Arabia relationship, lavishing flattery on his host. \u201cWe just came from Saudi Arabia, where we have another great man over there that's a friend of yours,\u201d he said. \u201cYou guys get along so well and like each other. You sort of remind me a little bit of each other, if you want to know the truth. They're both tall, handsome guys who happen to be very smart.\u201d",
      "This marks a shift from his first term, when a Saudi-led coalition blockaded Qatar over alleged terrorism support.",
      "And Trump has defended as \u201ca great gesture\u201d the Qatari jet gift, saying before leaving Washington that turning it down would be foolish. \u201cI could be a stupid person and say, \u2018No, we don\u2019t want a free, very expensive airplane,\u2019\u201d Trump said, adding that it would go to his presidential library foundation once he leaves office. Qatar, however, appeared to temper the announcement. Ali Al-Ansari, Qatar\u2019s media attach\u00e9 to the U.S., clarified that the transfer is \u201cunder consideration\u201d by Qatar\u2019s Ministry of Defense and the U.S. Department of Defense, with no final decision having been made.",

      "At a news conference Wednesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., dismissed concerns about the Trump family\u2019s foreign business dealings, claiming he did not have expertise on the matter and stressing that Trump has been transparent.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has nothing to hide,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHe\u2019s very upfront.\u201d He stressed that ethics oversight is in place and emphasized that his focus is on leading the House. And he said Qatar\u2019s gift of the plane was \u201cto the country,\u201d not Trump personally.",
      "Refitting the plane could cost $1 billion and take years to complete, more than twice the plane\u2019s reported value, NBC News reported. The cost, likely to come at taxpayers\u2019 expense, raises questions about the practical implications of a gift to a president who may no longer be in office at the time it's ready to use."

    "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 09:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "South Africa has a dark history of racism, including confiscating land from Black residents, before and during the anguish of apartheid.",
    "story": [
      "A day after 59 white South Africans were welcomed to America as refugees, more than 86,000 South African farmers \u2014 who are mostly white \u2014 are gathering this week at the NAMPO Harvest Day trade fair, an annual agricultural exhibition considered the largest in the Southern Hemisphere.",
      "Over four days, the attendees will discuss innovations in technology, collaborations and various other elements of an industry that last year generated nearly $14 billion in revenue.",
      "Notably, according to one participant, there is no planned discussion of violence against white farmers or \u201cAfrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored, race-based discrimination, including racially discriminatory property confiscation\u201d without compensation, as President Donald Trump wrote in a Feb. 7 executive order that opened the way for the 59 South Africans to come to U.S., despite a ban on refugees from other nations.",
      "The executive order referenced South Africa\u2019s Expropriation Act enacted last year, which in some cases allows the government to seize unused land without compensation, something Cyril Ramaphosa, the country\u2019s president, said has not happened.",
      "The act awakened a profoundly troubling argument over land rights. South Africa's dark history of racism includes the confiscation of land from Black residents, both before and during the apartheid. Afrikaners, the minority white descendants of Dutch and French settlers who arrived in South Africa in the 1600s, were leaders of the apartheid regime that ended in 1994.",
      "The purported goal of the Expropriation Act is to shrink the vast land ownership disparity that came with the oppressive rule. According to the organization Action for Southern Africa, 72% of farms and agricultural holdings are owned by whites, who make up 7.3% of the population. Black Africans, representing 81.4%, own only 4% of the land.",
      "Trump asserted on Monday, ahead of the refugees\u2019 arrival in the U.S., that \u201cwhite farmers are being brutally killed and the land is being confiscated in South Africa.\u201d",
      "Yet Wandile Sihlobo, chief economist of the Agricultural Business Chamber of South Africa, said that the spirit of NAMPO this week reaffirms that \u201cgenocide\u201d of white South African farmers \u201cwas imaginary and not happening in our country.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all disturbed that the U.S. side is alleging that there\u2019s genocide and mistreatment of white farmers in South Africa. It is incorrect,\u201d said Sihlobo, who is also co-author of the book \u201cThe Uncomfortable Truth About South Africa\u2019s Agriculture.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf anything, the sector continues to flourish. [Trump's] comments are misinformed and not mirroring the reality on the ground in the country,\u201d\u00a0he said.",
      "The New York Times reported 225 people were killed on South African farms over a four-year period ending in 2024. Of those deaths, 101 were Black current or former workers living on farms, and 53 were farmers, who are usually white.",
      "Nico Harris, a farmer of Afrikaans heritage, told Daily Maverick South African newspaper that the problems he sees can be overcome and stem from the government not being \u201cpro-farmer.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think the refugees that have gone [to the U.S.] are not well-established family farming businesses like we are,\u201d Harris told the paper. \u201cI think they don\u2019t have an opportunity in the country and they might think that, \u2018This is an opportunity for us.\u2019 I don\u2019t think they\u2019re really fleeing because they are scared or worried, I think they see it as an opportunity.\u201d",
      "Harris added, \u201cI think there are racially discriminating laws against white farmers, and I think they have problems and haven\u2019t got sympathy from the government. But there are no real land grabs, and I don\u2019t think there are real threats. There are individual farm attacks, but it\u2019s more related to criminal activity. We just hope our government is going to wake up and realize that they need the farmers, Black and white.\u201d",
      "One of the South Africans who arrived in the U.S. on Monday told The Washington Post that she had been advised not to speak with the media and said it had been a \u201cvery emotional, very rough couple of weeks.\u201d",
      "Theo Boshoff, CEO of AgBiz, which represents companies across the agricultural value chain, including South African and multinational companies, said crime in rural farming areas is high but \u201cnot targeted against any racial or ethnic group.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is no genocide in South Africa,\u201d Boshoff added. \u201cPeople who live in rural areas, who are often farmers, are simply more vulnerable to crime and violent crime because they live in remote areas.\u201d",
      "And because they are remote, law enforcement often is not nearby to protect them. \u201cThere is no cultural or racial bias at play. White farmers, Black farmers, white farmworkers, Black farmworkers are\u00a0all equally at risk and united in combatting this challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cI also don\u2019t agree with insinuations that rural crime is motivated by politics or in any way related to South Africa\u2019s affirmative action efforts to remedy our checkered past.\u201d",
      "Solidarity, a South African trade union that represents 600,000 Afrikaner families, said in a statement in February that it does not agree with the African National Congress, which wants to close the farmland disparity gap. \u201cBut we love our country. As in any community, there are individuals who wish to immigrate, but repatriation of Afrikaners as refugees is not a solution for us,\u201c the group wrote.",
      "President Ramaphosa said on X that the country\u2019s laws \u201cbalance the need for public usage of land and the protection of rights of property owners.\u201d He said that a meeting with President Trump about the country\u2019s land reform policy would result in them sharing \u201ca better and common understanding over these matters.\u201d",
      "Trump adviser Elon Musk, who was born in South Africa, has talked of his home country having \u201cracist ownership laws\u201d in a genocidal effort against white farmers.",
      "Fadial Adams, a member of the National Assembly of South Africa, a political body that passes legislation and analyzes executive action, warned of Musk\u2019s influence on the president. \u201cLet us not forget that Elon Musk is a beneficiary of our suffering and our slavery in South Africa, and it is not something that he hides. He was raised on a system which benefited white South Africans exclusively,\u201d\u00a0Adams said. \u201cElon Musk should stop acting like the minister for foreign affairs for South Africa. He\u2019s not.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration and Musk representative did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Afriforum, a nongovernmental South African agency that supports the interests of white citizens, have called for farm murders to be classified as priority crimes requiring special attention, like gender-based violence or rhino-poaching. It does not support the Expropriation Act.",
      "\u201cMany laws identified by the Afrikaner lobby groups as racist are viewed by the African National Congress as being necessary, intentional measures to redress past wrongs,\u201d said Thula Simpson, an associate professor of history at the University of Pretoria in South Africa. \u201cSo the present developments strike at the heart of the post-apartheid consensus.\u201d",
      "As for the farmers in South Africa as a whole, Sihlobo, the economist from the Agricultural Business Chamber, pointed at how the country's earnings from exporting produce have grown from $2 billion in the year 2000 to nearly $14 billion in 2024.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re self-sufficient,\u201d Sihlobo said. \u201cThat speaks to the progress the sector has been making. You can\u2019t see numbers like that where there\u2019s a genocide.\u201d",
      "Jaco Minnaar, the chairman of AGRI SA, the largest agriculture organization in South Africa, says the larger problem is South Africa\u2019s crime rate.",
      "\u201cWe can see that farm murders in South Africa have a slightly higher rate per capita than murders in general, but it\u2019s farmers and farmworkers, which is not all necessarily white,\u201d Minnaar said.",
      "\u201cOur murder rate is one of the highest per capita in the world, even higher than some of the war-torn countries. That\u2019s something that we need to address,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t specifically see from the statistics that white people or any other demographic group are targeted. Or that there\u2019s a genocide.\u201d"

      "Bombas founder David Heath is stepping down from his role as CEO as the socks and apparel company looks to expand beyond its direct-to-consumer roots.",
      "Bombas President Jason LaRose, a former\u00a0Under Armour\u00a0and Equinox executive, will take over as the company\u2019s next CEO effective Thursday. Heath said he realized it was necessary for a retail veteran to lead the company through its next phase of growth.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve reached a size and scale that is beyond my expertise. I didn\u2019t come from a big apparel company before \u2026 I found myself more so over the last 18 months saying, \u2018I don\u2019t know what to do next,\u2019\u201d Heath, who is staying at Bombas as its executive chair, told CNBC in an interview. \u201cSo then, when I looked at someone with Jason\u2019s background \u2026 having that tried and true experience is what will set Bombas up to succeed for the next chapter and I think I feel more comfortable having someone with Jason\u2019s experience in the driver\u2019s seat.\u201d",
      "LaRose, who spent six years at Under Armour and oversaw its North America business, takes the helm at a critical point in Bombas\u2019 growth story.",
      "Bombas\u2019 revenue has grown 22% in its current fiscal year through April, it\u2019s reached more than $2 billion in lifetime sales and its EBITDA is at a \u201csuper healthy, double digit\u201d margin, LaRose told CNBC. The company\u2019s footwear segment, such as its ultra-popular Sunday Slipper, is expanding the fastest. The company expects footwear revenue will soar more than 70% this year, but socks are still growing steadily, with sales up 17% in April compared to the prior year.",
      "But in order to reach its goal of growing from a \u201cShark Tank\u201d startup into a multibillion dollar company over the next five-to-10 years, Bombas needs to expand its wholesale presence. Retailers that primarily sell online like Bombas tend to reach a growth ceiling and need to turn to other channels to keep scaling profitably.",
      "Under LaRose\u2019s direction, Bombas is looking to grow its wholesale revenue from around 7% of sales to between 10% and 20%. The company also wants to test out physical stores.",
      "\u201cMore than 60% of socks in this country are sold in physical locations, you know, whether that\u2019s stores we could open, or stores that we fill with our partners \u2026 the wholesale opportunity is big for us,\u201d said LaRose. \u201cIt\u2019s also a billboard for us, right? It\u2019s a chance to tell our story. When the customer walks by, we have a chance to tell them about the mission every time, why we\u2019re here, let them touch and feel the product, which is always important when you\u2019re introducing somebody to a new apparel brand.\u201d",
      "Bombas currently sells in\u00a0Nordstrom, Scheels and\u00a0Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, and unlike\u00a0some of its peers, it isn\u2019t considering\u00a0Amazon\u00a0as a wholesale channel. Instead, it\u2019s looking to expand its assortment offered by its current partners, try out its own stores and perhaps bring on some new wholesalers \u2014 if they\u2019re the right fit.",
      "Digitally native brands that have long enjoyed the benefits of a direct model, such as customer data and the ability to stay close to customers, are often wary about expanding too deeply into wholesale because it\u2019s less profitable and it\u2019s harder for brands to tell their stories. For a company like Bombas, which spent years developing what it calls\u00a0the \u201cmost comfortable socks, underwear, and T-shirts\u201d on the market, that storytelling is extremely important \u2014 especially at a price point of around $15 per pair of socks.",
      "However, it\u2019s that very attitude that has led some to\u00a0criticize the direct selling model\u00a0because of how it can stymie growth and lead to unsustainable business models. Many of the early direct-to-consumer darlings have seen their valuations shrivel up as they chase profitability years after they were founded.\u00a0E-commerce has become harder to do profitably, and at a certain point, stores and wholesale are a more effective and profitable customer acquisition tool for some companies than marketing online. Selling goods through wholesale channels allows brands to scale and acquire customers more profitably than just selling online.",
      "Brands like Bombas that were early to move to wholesale \u2014 Heath joked that the company \u201cfocused on profitability before it was cool\u201d \u2014 understand the need for expansion but have looked to be strategic about who they partner with. Growth is important, but so is maintaining a brand, which is critical to staying ahead of rivals.",
      "\u201cAs a DTC brand, we care so much about our brand and our story, it has to be somebody who\u2019s going to do an excellent job taking care of our brand. We\u2019re not out there to be out there,\u201d said LaRose. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at some other partners. We\u2019ll continue to always look for people who we think strategically give us access to the right customer, you know, nothing to announce yet on that front, but we\u2019ll keep looking.\u201d",

      "Thieves recently stole Coinbase customers\u2019 personal information and tried to extort it for $20 million, the company announced Thursday.",
      "Coinbase, the United States\u2019 largest cryptocurrency exchange, said that instead of paying, it is offering a $20 million bounty for information leading to the arrest of those responsible.",
      "In a Wednesday evening filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Coinbase said that it received an extortion email on Sunday from criminals who had obtained some users\u2019 names, addresses, contact information, government identification, transaction history and the last four digits of their Social Security numbers.",
      "The criminals gained the information by paying overseas contractors and support workers to hand it over, Coinbase said.",

      "It\u2019s unclear how much money the criminals stole from users, but the SEC filing said the company\u2019s combined losses from remediation and reimbursements would be $180 million to $400 million.",
      "In an email sent Thursday morning to customers who were affected, a copy of which was obtained by NBC News, Coinbase said it would never directly ask customers for their login information or call them and instruct them to transfer assets.",

    "story": [
      "The 2025 WNBA season tips off Friday, about seven months after the New York Liberty won their first championship in franchise history.",
      "There was a constant stream of roster and coaching upheaval in the offseason, as seven teams changed coaches and multiple All-Stars switched teams. And on top of that, a 13th franchise was added to the league, as the Golden State Valkyries will make their WNBA debut this season.",
      "As the new year gets underway, here are five storylines to keep an eye on before a champion is crowned this fall.",
      "Are the Indiana Fever title contenders?",
      "Thanks in large part to a stellar rookie campaign by Caitlin Clark, the Fever made the playoffs for the first time since 2016. And this winter, the front office wasted no time in trying to build a more experienced team around Clark in her second season.",
      "The team first parted ways with head coach Christie Sides in the offseason, replacing her with 2023 WNBA Coach of the Year Stephanie White.",
      "Then a roster overhaul began, with guard Sydney Colson and guard/forward DeWanna Bonner signing deals with Indiana in free agency, while guard Sophie Cunningham was acquired via trade. Both Colson and Bonner are two-time champions, and they should help relieve some of the pressure on Clark, who was the target of some physical defense in her first season.",
      "If Clark takes another leap \u2014 plus Aliyah Boston continues her All-Star play in the front court \u2014 the Fever should be a tough out.",
      "Former champs are loading up",
      "The Las Vegas Aces won back-to-back titles in 2022 and 2023, but were bumped in the second round of the playoffs in 2024 by the eventual champion Liberty. With center A\u2019ja Wilson coming off her best season as a pro (and her third MVP), the Aces made a big splash this winter and acquired a new running mate for Wilson \u2014 trading for two-time champ and six-time All-Star Jewell Loyd.",
      "Las Vegas had to part ways with franchise stalwart Kelsey Plum (who was sent to the Los Angeles Sparks) in the deal, but Loyd should be able to form her own potent partnership with Wilson.",
      "Meanwhile, New York didn\u2019t rest after winning its first ring. With a big three of Breanna Stewart, Sabrina Ionescu and Jonquel Jones already in tow, the Liberty traded two first-round picks for guard Natasha Cloud, who led the league in assists in 2022.",
      "Napheesa Collier is out for revenge",
      "Collier is coming off a historic playoff run in which she became the first player in WNBA history to lead the entire postseason field in points, rebounds, steals and blocks. Collier also broke Diana Taurasi\u2019s record for most points in a single playoffs.",
      "Collier\u2019s efforts ended in heartbreak, however, as the Lynx fell in a tightly contested five-game series to the Liberty. Collier also wasn\u2019t shy about expressing her disappointment with the officiating in that series, posting an Instagram with photos of missed calls after the final game.",
      "While much of the league underwent change, Minnesota kept its roster largely intact headed into this season. Collier was already playing at an MVP level, but now she\u2019ll be playing with the added motivation of last season\u2019s bitter finish.",

      "The Dallas Wings took former Connecticut Huskies star Paige Bueckers with the first overall pick in April\u2019s draft, and Bueckers will now be tasked with turning around the Wings less than two months after leading the Huskies to a national championship.",
      "Since moving to Dallas in 2016, the Wings have won only one playoff series and zero second-round games.",
      "Bueckers won\u2019t be flying solo, though, as Dallas added solid role players in Dijonai Carrington and NaLyssa Smith in the offseason, and All-Star Arike Ogunbowale is coming off arguably her best year as a pro.",
      "Business is booming",
      "All of this season\u2019s action will take place under looming changes for a league that continues to explode in popularity. While the Valkyries will lace up this year, two more expansion teams will join the W in 2026, the Toronto Tempo and the yet-to-be-named Portland team.",
      "The collective bargaining agreement between the players union and the league is also set to expire next year \u2014 as are many star players\u2019 contracts. Expect the players to look for a bigger (and more fair) piece of the growing pie next year, and for stars to be looking to cash in on the upcoming transformation."

    "story": [
      "When Judy Blume\u2019s \u201cForever\u201d first hit shelves in 1975, it sparked controversy \u2014 and connection. The novel\u2019s candid exploration of teenage love and sex was revolutionary, giving young readers permission to feel deeply, make mistakes and move on.",
      "Nearly five decades later, Netflix\u2019s adaptation of \u201cForever,\u201d developed by Mara Brock Akil, brings Blume\u2019s themes into a modern context, reminding a new generation that love, especially first love, doesn\u2019t always last, but it always leaves a mark.",
      "\u201cI think Judy was ahead of her time,\u201d actor Michael Cooper, who plays Justin, says. \u201cEspecially with \u2018Forever\u2019 as a book \u2014 it\u2019s brilliant. And then Mara\u2019s adaptation is just so current. It\u2019s such a beautiful interpretation.\u201d",
      "The eight-episode series centers on Keisha and Justin, two high school seniors whose whirlwind romance mirrors the intensity of Blume\u2019s original couple, Katherine and Michael.",
      "But instead of prom and campfires, Keisha and Justin face contemporary challenges \u2014digital privacy, racial identity and the pressure of making decisions that could impact their adult lives.",
      "There are other changes between the book and show, like the setting \u2014 the show takes place in California rather than the book\u2019s New Jersey setting.",
      "Actress Lovie Simone, who portrays Keisha, read the novel while auditioning. \u201cI needed to be Keisha after reading it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s such a well-written book.",
      "The couple\u2019s connection is immediate, unfolding at a chaotic party where both characters seek familiarity. \u201cThere was a lot going on,\u201d Simone recalled. \u201cBoth of them are shy at first, so I think they were just looking for someone. They didn\u2019t expect to find each other\u2014but it was a pleasant surprise.\u201d",
      "That sense of surprise quickly deepens into commitment. Throughout the series, Keisha and Justin repeatedly promise each other: \u201cIt\u2019s forever.\u201d It\u2019s a phrase they cling to as their lives begin to change.",
      "\u201cIn high school, everything feels so big,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cI remember thinking one little thing could make the world crumble. That\u2019s how their relationship feels \u2014 high-stakes.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re younger, and you don\u2019t have many years to look back on, everything feels more intense. It feels like the end of the world,\u201d Simone says.",
      "But as in Blume\u2019s novel, that promise is tested.",
      "In \u201cForever\u2019s\u201d final chapters, Katherine realizes she\u2019s grown apart from Michael after her grandfather dies. It\u2019s a quiet heartbreak \u2014 no scandal, no villain, Just two people choosing to be honest.",
      "The Netflix version similarly grounds Keisha\u2019s evolution in loss. When an old sex tape filmed without her full consent resurfaces, it fractures her sense of safety and identity. Justin is a student with ADHD who is passionate about music but struggles in school and with direction in life.",
      "Simone says Keisha\u2019s ability to love Justin was shaped by her need for self-love. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t able to love him fully until she checked in with herself,\u201d she says. \u201cShe wanted to love him so badly that she had to do something for herself first.\u201d",
      "For Justin, the journey is equally internal.",
      "\u201cThere was this line Mara wrote: \u2018He had one foot in confidence and the other in insecurity,\u2019\u201d Cooper says. \u201cKeisha gave him the space to be his authentic self. He could be vulnerable with her. And although sometimes I\u2019d be like, \u2018Bro, what are you saying?\u2019 He just let it out. She allowed him that space.\u201d",
      "In the show\u2019s final episodes, Keisha earns a scholarship to Howard University. Justin, meanwhile, is torn between following his parents\u2019 preferred path \u2014 attending Northwestern \u2014 or taking a gap year to pursue music. When Keisha encourages him to choose himself, it\u2019s no longer a breakup rooted in pain, but a conscious step toward individual growth.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to fight for us,\u201d she tells him, \u201cthen fight for Justin.\u201d",
      "That sentiment echoes Blume\u2019s original message. Her characters don\u2019t reunite in the end. There\u2019s no grand romantic gesture \u2014 just a phone call from a friend, a reminder that life goes on.",
      "Blume didn\u2019t write \u201cForever \u201cto make readers feel better about breakups. She wrote it to validate their feelings \u2014 that first love is real, even if it isn\u2019t permanent. Akil\u2019s adaptation honors that truth while layering in modern realities like race, class, and digital trauma.",
      "\u201cWhat I hope audiences take away,\u201d said Cooper, \u201cis that love can teach you who you are \u2014 but it can\u2019t always carry you into who you\u2019re becoming.\u201d",
      "In the end, the title \u201cForever\u201d isn\u2019t a promise. It\u2019s a question. And the answer, as both Blume and Netflix remind us, is that growing up is the point.",

      "\u201cThere is a lot of fat in there!\u201d the\u00a0dad of four\u00a0said of his body at the time, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s kind of embarrassing seeing your body broken down like this.\u201d",
      "The test showed that the retired athlete, whose weight was just under 277 at the time, had 207 pounds of muscle mass on his frame and 58.7 pounds of fat, which, he noted, is \u201cexactly 21% body fat.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of fat,\u201d said Jason Kelce as Travis Kelce laughed.",
      "The former football pro first opened up about his weight loss journey during an interview with\u00a0GQ\u00a0published in June 2024.",
      "He revealed at the time that he\u2019d already dropped 18 pounds \u2014\u00a0from 295 pounds down to 277 pounds \u2014 since retiring months before.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to get\u00a0too\u00a0small,\u201d he told the publication at the time. \u201cI I think a lot of guys, especially offensive linemen, they lose too much weight, and then they look like bobbleheads because their neck gets so small, but their head stays the same size.\u201d",
      "Jason Kelce said his goal was to get down to 260 or 250 pounds.",
      "\u201cFor me, I feel like for some reason, 250 to 260 feels like I\u2019ll be still big and be happy with the way I look without having a six-pack. But I\u2019ll still be able to have that stature a little bit,\u201d he explained.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine another nearly 20 pounds coming off, being honest with you,\u201d he added. \u201cBut my back already feels better. My knees already feel better. So another 20 pounds hopefully will make that much more adept at playing with my children.\u201d"

But in the final minutes of the fourth quarter, Tatum fell to the ground in pain and had to be helped off the court.",
      "On Tuesday, the Boston Celtics shared a\u00a0statement\u00a0on their official X account confirming that the 27-year-old athlete tore his Achilles.",
      "\u201cJayson Tatum today underwent successful surgery to repair a ruptured right Achilles tendon,\u201d the team said. \u201cNo timetable is currently available for his return, but he is expected to make a full recovery.\u201d",

      "Tatum, a two-time Olympic gold medalist and NBA champion, scored 42 points in the close Game 4 showdown with the Knicks and hoped to add more with three minutes left in the game. But after lunging for the ball, he suddenly grabbed his right leg and writhed in pain before calling for a timeout.",

In April, Milwaukee Bucks guard Damian Lillard exited his team\u2019s game against the Indiana Pacers early after he attempted to secure a rebound but instead fell on his back and clutched his left foot. He was also helped off the court and taken to the locker room.",
      "On April 28, the Bucks' official X account\u00a0posted\u00a0that Lillard tore his left Achilles and would not play the rest of the season.",
      "\u201cDamian Lillard underwent an MRI today that revealed a torn left Achilles tendon. Lillard will miss the remainder of the 2025 playoffs and undergo surgery to repair the injury,\u201d the tweet said.",
      "The same day, Lillard uploaded\u00a0a series of photos from the playoffs\u00a0and addressed his injury in the caption. He said, \u201cAppreciate all the prayers and well wishes. This one really hurt\u2026 HIS way not MY way.\u201d",
      "Achilles tears occur across professional sports, with NFL player Aaron Rodgers suffering the same injury in 2023. At the time, Dr. John Vasudevan, a sports medicine physician with Penn Medicine,\u00a0spoke to TODAY.com\u00a0about how it feels to experience an Achilles tear.",
      "He said that when the tendon is completely torn, it\u2019s \u201cnot as painful as you think. ... Patients almost always describe a distinct pop that they can feel and sometimes even hear. What people will describe more often than not is that they feel like someone kicked them really hard in the heel.\u201d",
      "The Achilles tendon refers to thick tissue that connects the calf muscle to the heel bone, according to the\u00a0Cleveland Clinic.",
      "An Achilles rupture is a common and sudden injury that \u201coccurs when the tendon stretches to its breaking point,\u201d the Cleveland Clinic explains. The recovery time usually takes about four to six months."

      "Ever since the epic run on housing in the first years of the pandemic, fueled by record-low mortgage rates, the market has been plagued by low supply and high prices.",
      "Prices in March were 39% higher nationally than they were in March 2019, pre-pandemic, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index. While prices continue to gain, the supply crunch is finally starting to ease \u2014 but not at the right price points.",
      "Demand for housing is strong overall, but strongest on the lower, more-affordable end of the market. That segment is still desperately undersupplied. As a result, home sales in the lower and middle price tiers continue to underperform the high-end market.",
      "A new report from the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com breaks down affordability and supply, shedding light on exactly where the pain points are in the market. Affordability was determined by using standard underwriting guidelines for buyers using a 30-year fixed mortgage, where 30% of income is used for the monthly payment (mortgage, property tax and insurance).",
      "For those earning between $75,000 and $100,000 annually, considered middle- to upper-middle-income buyers, the supply of homes for sale that they could afford increased the most of any income group this year from a year ago. In March 2024, 20.8% of listings were within reach for these households, and by March of this year that rose to 21.2%. But in March 2019, those same buyers could afford nearly half, or 48.8%, of all active listings.",
      "In a so-called balanced market between buyer and seller, that group should be able to afford 48% of all listings, according to the report. Based on current inventory levels, the market would need roughly 416,000 more listings priced at or below $255,000 in order to be balanced, the study found.",
      "For those earning below $75,000 annually, the market has become even less supplied. A homebuyer with a salary of $50,000 could afford just 8.7% of available listings in March, compared with 9.4% in March 2024 and 27.8% in March 2019.",
      "Higher-income households have near-total access to the housing market. Homebuyers earning $250,000 or more can afford at least 80% of home listings.",
      "\u201cShoppers see more homes for sale today than one year ago, and encouragingly, many of these homes have been added at moderate-income price points,\u201d said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. \u201cBut as this report shows, we still don\u2019t have an abundance of homes that are affordable to low- and moderate-income households.\u201d",
      "Hale added that progress in inventory hasn\u2019t been uniform across the country, saying gains have been concentrated in the Midwest and the South.",
      "While the report is a national snapshot, all real estate is local.",
      "Markets in the Midwest, like Akron, Ohio; St. Louis; and Pittsburgh, are considered balanced, with enough supply to meet demand. Others have made significant strides, adding more affordable listings but still shy of meeting demand. These include Raleigh, North Carolina; Des Moines, Iowa; and Grand Rapids, Michigan.",
      "More than 40% of the nation\u2019s 100 largest metropolitan markets, however, are still struggling. These include Seattle and Washington, D.C. While the supply of affordable homes has increased in both markets, households still need to earn more than $150,000 a year in order to afford even half of the homes available.",
      "Other markets that had been overheated are finally cooling off. Austin, Texas; San Francisco; and Denver have seen a substantial increase in the supply of affordable homes. They now surpass pre-pandemic levels.",
      "\u201cIt tells us that with the right mix of new construction, market shifts, and local policy efforts, even some of the most challenging markets can start to bend toward balance,\u201d according to the report\u2019s authors.",
      "And then there are markets that are just getting worse. Many of these are in Southern California, including Los Angeles and San Diego. New York City also falls into that category. The report cites several factors for this, including decades of underbuilding, a limited supply of buildable land, high construction costs, restrictive zoning laws and fast in-migration.",
      "Homebuilders are trying to put up more affordable homes, but their costs are high and could go even higher amid tariffs and new immigration policies. Single-family housing starts in March were nearly 10% lower than the same month a year prior.",

      "The justices faulted a lower court for focusing solely on the moment force was used and not the moments leading up to it.",
      "\"Today we reject that approach,\" Justice Elena Kagan wrote for a unanimous court. \"To assess whether an officer acted reasonably in using force, a court must consider all the relevant circumstances, including facts and events leading up to the climactic moment.\"",
      "Ashtian Barnes, 24, was killed in April 2016 when the vehicle he was driving started moving forward while he was speaking to the officer.",
      "Roberto Felix Jr., a traffic enforcement officer with the Harris County Precinct 5 Constable\u2019s Office, jumped on the car door sill when the vehicle moved and then shot Barnes twice. Barnes died at the scene.",
      "The ruling means that a civil rights lawsuit filed by Barnes\u2019 mother, Janice Hughes, can move forward for now. She claims Felix used excessive force in violation of the Constitution\u2019s Fourth Amendment.",
      "In ruling for Hughes, the court rejected what has been called the \"moment of the threat doctrine,\" making it clear to courts around the country that events leading up to an officer's use of deadly force have to be considered when assessing a claim.",
      "The court reaffirmed existing precedent that says the \"totality of the circumstances\" have to be taken into account.",
      "The ruling removes one barrier for bringing such claims, but Hughes still potentially faces an uphill battle.",
      "Even if lower courts ultimately allow her case to move forward, it would not affect Felix\u2019s ability to invoke the qualified immunity defense, which protects cops if it was not \u201cclearly established\u201d at the time of the incident that their actions were unlawful.",
      "In\u00a0a January interview with NBC News, Hughes said she was pursuing the case because she wants people to know that \u201cmy son was a victim.\u201d",
      "Five years after the death of George Floyd, another Black man killed by a police officer, \u201cnobody\u2019s policing the police,\u201d she added.",

    "story": [
      "On Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to weaken limits on some harmful \u201cforever chemicals\u201d in drinking water roughly a year after the Biden administration finalized the first-ever national standards.",
      "The Biden administration said last year the rules\u00a0could reduce PFAS exposure for millions of people. It was part of a broader push by officials then to address drinking water quality by writing rules to require the removal of toxic lead pipes and, after years of activist concern, address the threat of forever chemicals.",
      "President Donald Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has carried out that agenda\u00a0by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks.",
      "Now, we know the EPA plans to rescind limits for certain PFAS and lengthen deadlines for two of the most common types. Here are some of the essential things to know about PFAS chemicals and what the EPA decided to do:",
      "Please explain what PFAS are to me",
      "PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the nation\u2019s air, water and soil.",
      "They were manufactured by companies such as 3M, Chemours and others because they were incredibly useful. They helped eggs slide across nonstick frying pans, ensured that firefighting foam suffocates flames and helped clothes withstand the rain and keep people dry.",
      "The chemicals resist breaking down, however, which means they stay around in the environment.",
      "And why are they bad for humans?",
      "Environmental activists say that PFAS manufacturers knew about the health harms of PFAS long before they were made public. The same attributes that make the chemicals so valuable \u2014 resistance to breakdown \u2014 make them hazardous to people.",
      "PFAS accumulates in the body, which is why the Biden administration set limits for two common types, often called PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion that are phased out of manufacturing but still present in the environment.",
      "There is a wide range of health harms now associated with exposure to certain PFAS. Cases of kidney disease, low-birth weight and high cholesterol in addition to certain cancers can be prevented by removing PFAS from water, according to the EPA.",
      "The guidance on PFOA and PFOS has changed dramatically in recent years as scientific understanding has advanced. The EPA in 2016, for example, said the combined amount of the two substances should not exceed 70 parts per trillion. The Biden administration later said no amount is safe.",
      "There is nuance in what the EPA did",
      "The EPA plans to scrap limits on three types of PFAS, some of which are less well known. They include GenX substances commonly found in North Carolina as well as substances called PFHxS and PFNA. There is also a limit on a mixture of PFAS, which the agency is also planning to rescind.",
      "It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for these types of PFAS. So far,\u00a0sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water\u00a0utilities are above the Biden administration\u2019s limits. But most utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.",
      "For the two commonly found types, PFOA and PFOS, the EPA will keep the current limits in place but give utilities two more years \u2014 until 2031 \u2014 to meet them.",
      "Announcement is met with mixed reaction",
      "Some environmental groups argue that the EPA can\u2019t legally weaken the regulations. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.",
      "\u201cThe law is very clear that the EPA can\u2019t repeal or weaken the drinking water standard,\u201d said Erik Olson, a senior strategist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "Environmental activists have generally slammed the EPA for not keeping the Biden-era rules in place, saying it will worsen public health.",

For me, experiencing that already with my other two, this one has been excruciating and been really hard. To make that decision for myself, because I knew the pain that was coming with it, made it a lot harder to let go of us being together.\u201d",

The film was among the first of its kind to feature an all-Asian cast, and traces the intergenerational stories of a group of Chinese woman through a series of flashbacks between the past and the present.",
      "Chronicling the lives of June (Ming-Na Wen), Waverly (Tamlyn Tomita), Rose (Rosalind Chao) and Lena (Lauren Tom), \u201cThe Joy Luck Club\u201d spotlights the characters often-complicated relationships with their mothers (played by Kieu Chinh, Tsai Chin, Lisa Lu and France Nuyen) and the various challenges they each face.",
      "Modestly successful at the box office, \u201cThe Joy Luck Club\u201d received critical acclaim for its revealing look at Asian American women, their connection and unspoken hardships.",
      "In the decades since the movie was released, its cultural significance has only grown, earning \u201cThe Joy Luck Club\u201d a place in the history books, as well as an induction into the National Film Registry in 2020.",
      "In recognition of its groundbreaking accomplishments, Wen, Tomita, Chao and Tom, sat down with NBC News\u2019 Richard Lui to reflect on how \u201cThe Joy Luck Club\u201d changed not only their lives, but helped paved the way for the next generation of Asian American films and actors.",
      "Amid laughter and tears, they also talk about their sisterhood and the close bond that\u2019s kept them together for more than 30 years.",
      "This interview has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "Rosalind Chao: At the time we shot it, I had no clue of the ramifications of doing this movie. This movie is shown in public high schools. The book \u201cThe Joy Luck Club\u201d is a required reading for my kids\u2019 school. But I don\u2019t think we had a clue.",
      "Ming-Na Wen: Generation after generation gets to see this film. But also, I think they still react the same as they did 30 years ago. A lot of the young Asian Americans and non-Asian Americans, they still feel the value of the immigrant story and the familial story between the mothers and the daughters. They all have such amazing stories of how it impacted them, and I think that\u2019s a real testament of Amy Tan\u2019s storytelling, that it transcends time.",
      "Lauren Tom: I think one of the beautiful contributions that this film has made to just people at large is that it provides a portal to start conversations. So, when you can see something objectively apart from you on the screen, you might be brave enough to have that conversation with your mom.",
      "Tamlyn Tomita: Complementing what Ming said, people will react the same way in seeing this collection of stories by Amy Tan. But also, they do react with it differently because they grow older, they have children, and they\u2019re watching it with their children, when they were children at the first time they were watching it. So, there is that constant shift, but it\u2019s also the connectivity between the generations. It\u2019s a portal. It\u2019s an impetus to ask your mother, \u2018What happened to you? What were you like when you were younger?\u2019",
      "Lauren Tom: One of the joys for me was watching my kids watch the movie for the first time, and they were laughing all the way through it, even though it has much sadness. So, I had forgotten how funny it is, too. I think that\u2019s also why it touched so many people.",
      "Rosalind Chao: And not just Asian Americans.",
      "Tamlyn Tomita: Anybody who has a mom.",
      "Lauren Tom: It was thrilling to be able to just be a part of (that). Even the crew, everyone involved, there was so much diversity. And that was 30 years ago, so, even more impressive.",
      "Tamlyn Tomita: In our lifetimes, previous to that, there was never a film, there were episodic television shows.",
      "Ming-Na Wen: I remember because I was the only New Yorker hired for the main parts. I hadn't come out to LA, I met them in San Francisco, and as almost a lone wolf at the time, where you\u2019re the one token Asian in an audition room with many, many Caucasian actresses, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, that was the time back then. But to come into a room with the incredible Asian female cast. I almost felt like I was in a foreign land.",
      "Rosalind Chao: I remember sitting outside. I had a newborn, and I was breastfeeding outside the room where they were waiting to do our first table read. I heard them all talking about their individual experiences, and when they met each other in audition rooms, and I remember feeding him and just started crying. The three of them, that comradery, hearing that in the next room, it was just so moving.",

      "Ming-Na Wen: But in the most loving way. It\u2019s quite extraordinary to have four actresses, that are around the same age and all vying for the same roles \u2026 to never feel like we\u2019re in competition with each other. It\u2019s like, if you\u2019re supposed to get the role, you get the role and we\u2019re always so supportive and so happy for each other.",
      "All: No, no, no, no \u2026",
      "Ming-Na Wen: (But) the fact that it was not even nominated for a screenplay ...",
      "(The others interject)",
      "Ming-Na Wen: (It's been) 30 years, it needs to be addressed. It needs to be addressed.",
      "Rosalind Chao: Not only were we not nominated, but we were asked to present at the Oscars and one of us was at the phone and heard, \u201cOh, we\u2019ve just been un-asked.\u201d",
      "Tamlyn Tomita: We want to acknowledge our own mothers in our own lives, but also Kieu Chinh, Lisa Lu, France Nuyen, and the fantastic Tsai Chin.",
      "We became better women because of those women, because knowing their legacy, their history through Hollywood and their careers and what they still continue to pass down along. The three of us were lucky to join Ming when she received her Hollywood Star of Fame and we will be all there for Lisa Lu\u2019s reception of receiving the star.",
      "So, yes. Becoming better women, becoming better actors, becoming better community people, becoming better moms and, ultimately, becoming better daughters, because we\u2019re lucky that we have our mother-actors still with us. Some of us have our mothers still with us and we just treasure them with their quirks and personalities. So, it\u2019s a test of time and it\u2019s a testament to the lesson that we still learn from them.",
      "Rosalind Chao: After that experience, I kind of buried myself because I felt like a wayward mom. But I did think more was going to open.",
      "Ming-Na Wen: I think it opened, I think it did help. That\u2019s why I call it my \u201cGreen Card\u201d (to Hollywood) because it was like, \u201cOh, we know you,\u201d because a lot of casting people saw the film. So, whether it was a success or not in the box office, it didn\u2019t matter. It really elevated our name.",
      "Lauren Tom: Being part of this film means that you have some class and you\u2019re a good actor, because our reviews were so wonderful, that it was an automatic, \u201cYou\u2019re alright.\u201d",
      "Tamlyn Tomita: I think it did open the doors for the nine of us. But in terms of more Asian American stories, it did not happen, because if we\u2019re waiting 20 years until \u201cCrazy, Rich Asians,\u201d and they\u2019re pinpointing it to the touchstone of \u201cThe Joy Luck Club,\u201d nope, it goes farther than that. It goes to \u201cFlower Drum Song,\u201d \u201cThe World of Suzie Wong.\u201d",
      "We need to keep reminding our community, as well as the nation and the world of movies, that our stories have been box office hits, they\u2019re classics and they\u2019re timeless. They should be stolen and told all the way along because they\u2019re universal. It\u2019s about mothers, it\u2019s about families. It\u2019s about falling in love. It\u2019s about celebrity.",
      "Rosalind Chao: And being American.",
      "Ming-Na Wen: It\u2019s about being seen. When I read Amy Tan\u2019s book, that was the first time I was struck at feeling like someone sees me. That I was not living this life, the adventure, these experiences alone.",
      "Rosalind Chao: Like Kieu Chinh says to you in the movie, \u201cI see you,\u201d that\u2019s exactly how we felt when we read Amy Tan\u2019s book and that we belong.",
      "Rosalind Chao: It\u2019s so exciting. The first time seeing Bowen, I was a fangirl, because you could see right away he had that extra thing. And Ronny Chieng \u2026 we are breaking. That\u2019s my dream for us, that we break into the tapestry that we\u2019re not considered \u2018exotic\u2019 anymore. That we\u2019re just part of America.",
      "Lauren Tom: I\u2019ve gotten to this certain age now where everyone feels like my kid. I\u2019m proud of them. Sometimes I don\u2019t even know them and I\u2019m like, \u201cI am so proud of you.\u201d"

Liman \u2014 who is presiding over the trial set for\u00a0March 9, 2026, in New York.",
      "In the May 14 letter, Freedman wrote that the purpose of the subpoena is to access discovery regarding \u201cwitness tampering and evidence spoliation.\u201d",
      "He said that the counsel for Wayfarer Parties, which includes Baldoni, received \u201cinformation from a source who is highly likely to have reliable information\u201d alleging that Lively asked Swift to delete their text messages. Freedman then claimed that Michael Gottlieb, Lively\u2019s lawyer, contacted Swift\u2019s attorney and \u201cdemanded that Ms. Swift release a statement of support for Ms. Lively, intimating that, if Ms. Swift refused to do so, private text messages of a personal nature in Ms. Lively\u2019s possession would be released.\u201d",

It is worth stating for the record, however, that each of the allegations in the Freedman Letter is unequivocally and demonstrably false. As a legal matter, the Freedman Letter is improper. It does not seek any form of relief, is irrelevant to any motion currently pending before the Court, and serves no legitimate purpose. It is not useful to the Court in any respect,\u201d Lively's lawyers wrote.",
      "They also said that Freedman\u2019s letter appeared intended to \u201claunder scandalous and defamatory allegations about Ms. Lively and opposing counsel into the press.\u201d",

      "Swift\u2019s spokesperson previously issued a statement regarding the subpoena, asserting that the musician has no connection to the movie adaptation besides her song \u201cMy Tears Ricochet\u201d being featured on the soundtrack. Her rep said that the witness summons was a way to generate \u201ctabloid clickbait.\u201d",

      "Her rep continued, \u201cThe connection Taylor had to this film was permitting the use of one song, \u2018My Tears Ricochet.\u2019 Given that her involvement was licensing a song for the film, which 19 other artists also did, this document subpoena is designed to use Taylor Swift\u2019s name to draw public interest by creating tabloid clickbait instead of focusing on the facts of the case.\u201d",
      "Lively and Baldoni\u2019s legal case began on Dec. 20 when Lively filed an 80-page sexual harassment complaint alleging that Baldoni created a hostile workplace environment on the set of \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d and that he later launched a smear campaign to \u201cdestroy\u201d her reputation. She also alleged that he crossed the line while they filmed intimate scenes and that he harassed her on set.",
      "Freedman reacted to the accusations in a statement to TODAY.com at the time, calling them \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d",
      "Lively then filed a federal lawsuit against Baldoni, his production company, Wayfarer Studios, producer Jamey Heath, crisis communications representative Melissa Nathan and publicist Jennifer Abel on Dec. 31. Her attorney alleged there was a \u201cretaliatory campaign Wayfarer launched against her for reporting sexual harassment and workplace safety concerns.\u201d",
      "Following an article about Lively\u2019s accusations, Baldoni sued The New York Times for libel. He also filed a lawsuit against Lively, her husband, Ryan Reynolds, Lively\u2019s rep Leslie Sloane and Sloane\u2019s PR firm on Jan. 16, accusing them of defamation and disregarding contractual claims.",
      "Swift became linked to the case when Baldoni filed his suit, which included alleged text messages exchanged between him and Lively. In the documents, a \u201cTaylor\u201d is referenced and described as a \u201cmegacelebrity friend.\u201d",
      "Baldoni\u2019s team confirmed to NBC News at the time that the \u201cTaylor\u201d in the suit was the pop singer, who has been friends with Lively for years.",
      "According to NBC News, one alleged text from Lively read, \u201cIf you ever get around to watching Game of Thrones, you\u2019ll appreciate that I\u2019m Khaleesi, and like her, I happen to have a few dragons. For better or worse, but usually better. Because my dragons also protect those I fight for. So really we all benefit from those gorgeous monsters of mine. You will too, I can promise you.\u201d"

      "Fortunately, according to Rob Lowe, they may not have to wait much longer.",

    "summary": "Here's how Judy Blume's Forever compares to the new show and what the show changes.",
    "story": [
      "When Judy Blume\u2019s \"Forever\" first hit shelves in 1975, it sparked controversy \u2014 and connection. The novel\u2019s candid exploration of teenage love and sex was revolutionary, giving young readers permission to feel deeply, make mistakes and move on.",
      "Nearly five decades later, Netflix\u2019s adaptation of \u201cForever,\u201d developed by Mara Brock Akil, brings Blume\u2019s themes into a modern context, reminding a new generation that love, especially first love, doesn\u2019t always last, but it always leaves a mark.",
      "\u201cI think Judy was ahead of her time,\u201d actor Michael Cooper, who plays Justin, says. \u201cEspecially with \u2018Forever\u2019 as a book \u2014 it\u2019s brilliant. And then Mara\u2019s adaptation is just so current. It\u2019s such a beautiful interpretation.\u201d",
      "The eight-episode series centers on Keisha and Justin, two high school seniors whose whirlwind romance mirrors the intensity of Blume\u2019s original couple, Katherine and Michael.",
      "But instead of prom and campfires, Keisha and Justin face contemporary challenges \u2014digital privacy, racial identity and the pressure of making decisions that could impact their adult lives.",
      "There are other changes between the book and show, like the setting \u2014 the show takes place in California rather than the book's New Jersey setting.",
      "Actress Lovie Simone, who portrays Keisha, read the novel while auditioning. \u201cI needed to be Keisha after reading it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s such a well-written book.",
      "The couple\u2019s connection is immediate, unfolding at a chaotic party where both characters seek familiarity. \u201cThere was a lot going on,\u201d Simone recalled. \u201cBoth of them are shy at first, so I think they were just looking for someone. They didn\u2019t expect to find each other\u2014but it was a pleasant surprise.\u201d",
      "That sense of surprise quickly deepens into commitment. Throughout the series, Keisha and Justin repeatedly promise each other: \u201cIt\u2019s forever.\u201d It\u2019s a phrase they cling to as their lives begin to change.",
      "\u201cIn high school, everything feels so big,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cI remember thinking one little thing could make the world crumble. That\u2019s how their relationship feels \u2014 high-stakes.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re younger, and you don\u2019t have many years to look back on, everything feels more intense. It feels like the end of the world,\u201d Simone says.",
      "But as in Blume\u2019s novel, that promise is tested.",
      "In \u201cForever\u2019s\u201d final chapters, Katherine realizes she\u2019s grown apart from Michael after her grandfather dies. It\u2019s a quiet heartbreak \u2014 no scandal, no villain, Just two people choosing to be honest.",
      "The Netflix version similarly grounds Keisha\u2019s evolution in loss. When an old sex tape filmed without her full consent resurfaces, it fractures her sense of safety and identity. Justin is a student with ADHD who is passionate about music but struggles in school and with direction in life.",
      "Simone says Keisha\u2019s ability to love Justin was shaped by her need for self-love. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t able to love him fully until she checked in with herself,\u201d she says. \u201cShe wanted to love him so badly that she had to do something for herself first.\u201d",
      "For Justin, the journey is equally internal.",
      "\u201cThere was this line Mara wrote: \u2018He had one foot in confidence and the other in insecurity,\u2019\u201d Cooper says. \u201cKeisha gave him the space to be his authentic self. He could be vulnerable with her. And although sometimes I\u2019d be like, \u2018Bro, what are you saying?\u2019 He just let it out. She allowed him that space.\u201d",
      "In the show\u2019s final episodes, Keisha earns a scholarship to Howard University. Justin, meanwhile, is torn between following his parents\u2019 preferred path \u2014 attending Northwestern \u2014 or taking a gap year to pursue music. When Keisha encourages him to choose himself, it\u2019s no longer a breakup rooted in pain, but a conscious step toward individual growth.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to fight for us,\u201d she tells him, \u201cthen fight for Justin.\u201d",
      "That sentiment echoes Blume\u2019s original message. Her characters don\u2019t reunite in the end. There\u2019s no grand romantic gesture \u2014 just a phone call from a friend, a reminder that life goes on.",
      "Blume didn\u2019t write \u201cForever \u201cto make readers feel better about breakups. She wrote it to validate their feelings \u2014 that first love is real, even if it isn\u2019t permanent. Akil\u2019s adaptation honors that truth while layering in modern realities like race, class, and digital trauma.",
      "\u201cWhat I hope audiences take away,\u201d said Cooper, \u201cis that love can teach you who you are \u2014 but it can\u2019t always carry you into who you\u2019re becoming.\u201d",
      "In the end, the title \u201cForever\u201d isn\u2019t a promise. It\u2019s a question. And the answer, as both Blume and Netflix remind us, is that growing up is the point.",

      "I think Buck has been trying to hold himself together because he feels like he\u2019s been charged with this task by Bobby. And that\u2019s why it was really nice to me this past episode, the confessional scene, to let that facade go.",
      "I think it\u2019s the idea that everybody\u2019s experience is their own. We\u2019re all looking at things from our own point of view. So Buck doesn\u2019t necessarily know that Eddie has gone to Hen\u2019s house to have these conversations. All Buck knows is something feels different. He says we\u2019re not eating together, which is obviously something that Bobby instituted into the 118. So it doesn\u2019t have to be true for everybody. It just has to be true for Buck, that\u2019s the way he is seeing things.",
      "And I think probably because of what Bobby left him with, he\u2019s trying to take more control than is necessary, which is not working for him. And because of that, the juxtaposition between what he thinks it should be and what it actually is is so far apart that it must make things feel worse.",
      "Just, everybody\u2019s hurt. And everybody deals with grief differently. And I don\u2019t know if Buck necessarily lashed out in the scene, as much as was a bit already defeated, maybe. He\u2019s not getting back in Eddie's face until the very end. He\u2019s not actually being loud or complaining about Eddie going.",
      "To me, it just kind of feels like a piece is missing from Buck, and it\u2019s left him a bit empty. And I think Eddie, obviously, having not been there for the death, has all this emotion and needs somewhere to put it.",
      "Actually, no, I don\u2019t think it was fair in that particular instance. But I think it\u2019s fair in a sense that \u2014\u00a0so when we were shooting the scene, I was actually given the note of, \u201cI don\u2019t think you are making it about you. I think you need to be a bit more bratty or whatever.\u201d",
      "And I said, \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s right.\u201d I think for Eddie to say that, it\u2019s actually just a culmination of past things that Buck has done that in the past. And so even though Buck is not actively making it about himself in this moment, it\u2019s almost PTSD of Buck having done that so many times, so that\u2019s what conjures up for Eddie. So it\u2019s fair in the sense of, as I say, it\u2019s just what he\u2019s used to experiencing from Buck.",
      "But I think because everybody\u2019s just going through such a tough time, like emotions are just all over the place, and something that doesn\u2019t go the way you expected it to can trigger something completely different. And it\u2019s just all up in the air, and everything is clashing and butting heads.",
      "I\u2019ll argue with Ryan all day, that's no problem. (Laughs). No, I mean, the whole cast, we have such a truly great relationship. Everybody is really close, and there\u2019s so much trust that it\u2019s easy to go to places with each other, because you feel safe as a performer and as a friend.",
      "Some people love to go to work, and everybody\u2019s process is different. Some people want to feel that in real life, right? Like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not going to talk to you between takes. We\u2019re going to let this really build.\u201d But I think what has been the theme for our cast is, no, let\u2019s have as much fun as we can, so that then when we go into these darker scenes, we can really go at each other, and we still know that afterwards, we\u2019re friends. And it\u2019s a safe environment.",
      "I think in the early seasons, it was clear that Buck was always trying to, whether it be prove himself, or there was just an uncertainty in everything he did, an insecurity \u2014 and sometimes you combat insecurity by going too far in the opposite direction. And I think Buck had a case of that, and so when the question of the bisexuality was brought to me, it\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, that could be the thing.\u201d And I think post that, there\u2019s been a more \u2014\u00a0for the most part, obviously, it\u2019s not black and white \u2014\u00a0but there\u2019s been a more settled and grounded Buck. And then something can come in like Eddie leaving, and that can unsettle him again. But he\u2019s from a more grounded place.",
      "So yeah, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s looking for himself in quite the same way. But, I mean, I assume Buck is my age, so early to mid-30s, and still figuring some stuff out about his life and what he wants to do and be. There will always be similar questions, but I think they\u2019re coming from a calmer, more settled place.",
      "The finale of \u201c9-1-1\u201d Season Eight will air on ABC May 15 at 8 p.m. ET and stream the next day on Hulu."

His sister, Maddie Han (Jennifer Love Hewitt), is then kidnapped (again), and his beloved captain and father figure, Bobby Nash (Peter Krause), is killed by a gruesome virus after being trapped in a lab.",
      "Fans of the long-running procedural may remember that after Buck, played by Oliver Stark, was struck by lightning in Season Six, an entire episode was dedicated to his coma dream. The episode, titled \"In Another Life,\" questioned what would happen if Buck never became a firefighter. The result? Eddie lost custody of son Christopher (Gavin McHugh), Maddie remained married to the abusive husband responsible for her first kidnapping and Bobby was long dead.",
      "Asked if Season Eight is essentially Buck's nightmare, Stark answers literally.",
      "\"I would say it's a strong coincidence. I don't think that's an intentional choice, but it's funny how things work out sometimes,\" he tells TODAY.com. \"If it is, I have yet to find that out.\"",
      "Bobby's death sent shock waves through the \"9-1-1\" fan base. In a major change from the show's typical formula, the 118 didn't all make it out alive from an emergency.",
      "Over the course of Episodes 14 and 15, the 118 responded to a fire at a lab that studied viruses. An explosion rocked the facility with the team inside, triggering an emergency quarantine door, locking Bobby, Henrietta \"Hen\" Wilson (Aisha Hinds), Howard \"Chimney\"\u00a0Han (Kenneth Choi) and Ravi Panikkar (Anirudh Pisharody) inside \u2014 and Buck out.",
      "Buck teamed up with Los Angeles Police Department Sgt. Athena Grant (Angela Bassett) \u2014\u00a0also Bobby's wife \u2014 to try and free them as an aerosolized version of a modified, dangerous virus infected Chimney and Bobby.",
      "Buck and Athena tracked down the one antidote for the virus and administered it to Chimney as he actively experienced organ failure. After the rest of the 118 finally left the lab, Bobby locked himself in again and removed his mask, revealing the virus had already set in.",
      "Below, Stark unpacks the impact of Bobby's death, how his character is handling his grief after the funeral and where \"9-1-1\" goes from here.",
      "This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.",
      "Well, it sounds like I was making a good guess. I think the thread of a family falling apart. You know, you take out one key element, and you just watch as the whole thing starts to kind of disintegrate, I suppose. And that\u2019s obviously what we saw with Bobby\u2019s passing, and how the 118 lost its patriarchal figure, and the struggles and the fallout of that and the crumbling world without its foundation and structure.",
      "So the first time I watched it \u2014 on occasion, I'll watch an episode before it airs, but it tends to be before the (visual effects) and before the final sound mix. So this was an earlier version, and I didn\u2019t think it would make me emotional, because I knew it was coming. I\u2019m inside the machine as it were, and the first time \u2014 when it gets to the part, and he says, \"Love you, kid.\" I didn\u2019t just like cry, it burst out of me, and I was so surprised by that.",
      "But I think it\u2019s obviously a personal connection to him, as well, and that particular line has big meaning for us. And yeah, I really, like sobbed when it happened. But that was pre-VFX, so he didn\u2019t look as sickly. A lot of the blood is added in post(production).",
      "And so then when I did watch it live on television, I said, \"Oh yeah, he really looks like he\u2019s about to die.\" And it just took it to a whole nother level. So very emotional, very moving.",
      "Often the moments of advice that he gives me are not when I\u2019ve asked for something specific. It\u2019s just in watching how he behaves, watching how he conducts himself, how he treats people, how he approaches the job.",
      "One of the things he did say to me that always sticks out in my mind is way back, Season One. The beginning of the show really gives Buck a lot to do. And then I remember we came across the first episode where I didn\u2019t have so much to do, and I went to him, and I said, \"Do you think I messed up? Like they were giving me all this story. Now there\u2019s this episode, and I don\u2019t really say much in it.\" And I was 26 at the time, and he said to me, \"I get it. You\u2019re 26. You always want to be thrown the ball.\" He said, \"I\u2019m 52. Sometimes it\u2019s nice to sit on the bench.\" And I always remember that.",
      "I would never be so bold as to assume myself unkillable. The most honest answer to that is, I probably would have assumed everybody else was unkillable, but in my own head, I\u2019d be like, \"But me, they could take me out at any moment.\"",
      "But that has been, obviously, the culture of the show, is to say we can put them into these situations, and we\u2019re going to make you think, and then at the last second, no, they\u2019re going to make it. And (showrunner) Tim (Minear) decided it was time to take a big swing and a big creative choice. And I say to him, credit to him. I think it\u2019s important to not just exist in the gray. And he wanted to move in a really strong direction. And I understand the idea that at some point you\u2019ve got to do that because of fear of the audience going, \"Well, I don\u2019t care about this emergency, because I know that they can make it out.\" And now that counter has almost reset to zero, and you have to build that back up again.",
      "I don\u2019t think it changes the tone of the show in the sense that the show is one that is always switching between genres. We have super light episodes, and then we\u2019ll have a really dark arc. I think that\u2019s been one of the strengths of the show, is that it really does offer tonal changes, sometimes not even episode to episode, but scene to scene.",
      "So obviously, post death, the tone has been darker. But it\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t gone into a darker tone for three, four, five episodes at a time before. It doesn\u2019t mean that that is now the tone of the show. I absolutely look forward to the lighter episodes as well, once we are through that first stage of grieving.",
      "The tone on set is, you know, he\u2019s obviously missed. He\u2019s loved by all of us. But you have to remember, we have to remember, Peter is fine. Peter is not dead. Peter is not Bobby. And as with anything, nothing is set in stone any one way, like you can be sad in one moment, and you can be laughing in the next. That\u2019s the human experience, and that\u2019s how you deal with heavy things, as you often do make light of them.",
      "There are absolutely moments, many moments where he\u2019s missed. But we also find the lighter moments day to day as well. And we still have to have a good time. And we can\u2019t be in mourning forever. We have to, and want to, have a great time doing the job that we love.",
      "I said to Tim that one thing I was excited about moving forward from this is I wanted to use it as a chance to help mature Buck. We've seen a lot of growth in Buck over the years \u2014 subtle in some senses.",
      "But if I was to watch the pilot today, and then if I was to watch the most recent episode, I'd go, \"Oh, that\u2019s a lot of growth.\" But I think there was something still lacking in terms of taking him to the next level. And I was excited that maybe this could be the thing that helps Buck mature or grow into a different place at a different stage. So I think that\u2019s, from my point of view, anyway, what the fallout or the repercussions for Buck will be.",
      "I think Athena said this in the show once, \"You were being Buck,\" or something. He will go through whatever he has to to help the people that he loves, as we\u2019ve seen. Even through the lab episodes, trying to get the cure when it was Chimney on the line.",
      "I think having that moment of Bobby shutting that door, and there is nothing Buck could do. There are variations when we shot it of trying to get into the room, to no success, and what could you do, but it\u2019s more just me shouldering the door and trying to smash my way through it. But it\u2019s just hopeless.",
      "There\u2019s a sense of being defeated. And I think he learns from that that you change the things that you can and you have to accept the things that you can\u2019t. And that\u2019s what Buck has had to do. If the change is there to be made, we\u2019ll see him go to the ends of the earth for it. And now he\u2019s learning that he has to accept the things when there is nothing to be done.",
      "The finale of \"9-1-1\" Season Eight will air on ABC May 15 at 8 p.m. ET and stream the next day on Hulu."

      "In the Canadian comedy, which aired for six seasons from 2015 to 2020, Murphy\u2019s character, Alexis, was a member of the eclectic and beloved Rose family. During a tiff with her brother (Dan Levy), Alexis was known to yell \u201cEw, David!\u201d in a memorable Valley girl accent. She only said the line three times throughout the entire series, but her delivery was enough to cement it in fan lore.",

O\u2019Brien\u2019s stint, though, was short-lived, marred by low ratings and NBC\u2019s ultimate decision to bring back Leno as host.",
      "O\u2019Brien\u2019s final episode as \u201cTonight Show\u201d host took place Jan. 22, 2010. He remained gracious and eloquent while signing off.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s still possible. If the Americans act as they say, for sure we can have better relations,\u201d\u00a0Shamkhani said, adding, \u201cit can lead to a better situation in the near future.\u201d",
      "Shamkhani sat down with NBC News just hours after Trump offered Iran \u201can olive branch\u201d that was combined with threats of crippling economic sanctions should Iran not accept an agreement to limit its nuclear program.",

      "\u201cHe thinks he can come here, chant slogans, and scare us. For us, martyrdom is far sweeter than dying in bed,\u201d he said Wednesday in comments broadcast live on state television, according to Reuters. \u201cYou came to frighten us? We will not bow to any bully.\u201d",

      "Trump has repeatedly said Iran cannot be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon.",
      "While Iran has always denied that it is seeking to do so, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.\u2019s nuclear watchdog, says that it has enriched enough uranium close to weapons-grade quality to make six nuclear bombs.",

    "story": [
      "ISTANBUL \u2014 High-stakes peace talks Thursday between Russia and Ukraine that were called for by Vladimir Putin hit speed bumps as the Kremlin confirmed he would be skipping the negotiations and President Donald Trump added that \"nothing\" would happen unless he and his Russian counterpart attended.",
      "Uncertainty over the start date, location and whether either side would even participate made for chaotic scenes in the Turkish capital, Ankara, as well as in Antalya and Istanbul \u2014 where some 200 journalists and crew were massed outside the Ottoman-era Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace with no clear idea of when talks would get underway.",
      "A back and forth between Kyiv, Moscow and the Trump administration hinted at the possibility of a three-way meeting involving Trump, Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. That did not ultimately materialize.",
      "While speaking to reporters on Air Force One en route to the United Arab Emirates, Trump was asked about the level of the delegation Russia sent to Turkey.",
      "\u201cLook, nothing\u2019s going to happen until Putin and I get together, OK?\u201d he said, adding that Putin did not lead the delegation because Trump had chosen not to attend. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t going if I wasn\u2019t there.\u201d",
      "Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov had earlier told CNN \u201cno,\u201d when asked Thursday whether Putin would be attending talks in Turkey. He added on a later media call that there are \u201cno preparations\u201d for talks between Putin and Trump in the coming days.",
      "Putin made the suggestion for negotiations \u201cwithout any preconditions\u201d after Ukrainian allies, including Germany, France and Britain presented an ultimatum to Moscow to either accept the ceasefire proposal or face additional sanctions.",
      "The Russian leader's no-show is expected to further antagonize the White House, which has markedly changed its tone over the war in the past weeks. After his historic Oval Office shouting match with Zelenskyy, Vice President JD Vance has shifted to accusing Moscow of \u201casking for too much\u201d in the bilateral peace talks senior Trump administration officials have held with Russia in recent weeks.",
      "That is partly because Trump\u2019s major gripe with Ukraine \u2014 that American taxpayers have mostly funded its defense \u2014 was soothed after the two nations struck a minerals deal that would go some way to repaying American military aid.",
      "Zelenskyy has also presented himself as compliant, backing Trump\u2019s calls for an immediate 30-day ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia.",
      "Trump has said he is \u201calways considering\u201d additional sanctions against Russia if he believes Moscow is blocking the peace process, with officials also suggesting secondary sanctions on the buyers of Russian oil.",
      "After heeding Trump\u2019s calls to accept Putin\u2019s initial suggestion of talks Sunday, Zelenskyy landed Thursday in Ankara.",
      "Before a planned meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Zelenskyy said he would meet with a broader Turkish delegation, as well as American diplomats.",
      "\u201cThe level of the Russian delegation is not officially known to me yet, but from what we see \u2014 it looks like not a serious level,\u201d Zelenskyy said, using a Ukrainian word meaning \"sham\" or \"theatrical.\"",
      "\u201cWe must understand the level of the Russian delegation and what mandate they have \u2014 whether they are even capable of making any decisions on their own,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause we all know who actually makes decisions in Russia.\u201d",
      "That was instead of joining the talks initially planned for Istanbul, after the Kremlin indicated late Wednesday that rather than Putin, or even Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, it was instead sending a relatively junior team headed by Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky and Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin.",
      "\u201cThis week really may change a lot \u2014 but only may,\u201d Zelenskyy said Wednesday in an X post, adding, \u201cI am waiting to see who will come from Russia, and then I will decide which steps Ukraine should take.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo far, the signals from them in the media are unconvincing,\u201d he added.",
      "While the Kremlin's last-minute naming of a junior team will do little to dispel Ukrainian and European allegations that Putin is not taking Trump's peace-brokering attempts seriously, the Russian delegation that arrived Thursday in Istanbul was \u201cready for serious work,\u201d the Russian Foreign Ministry's Maria Zakharova said at a news briefing the same day.",
      "As well as uncertainty over whether Ukraine would even send a delegation to the scaled-down talks in Istanbul, Kyiv and Moscow appeared to disagree over the start time of talks.",
      "While Russian media initially reported a 10 a.m. local time start (3 a.m. ET) at the Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace, that shifted to midday and then after 5 p.m.",
      "The confusion looked set to continue in Istanbul late Thursday morning, with American personnel appearing to be preparing a venue for a U.S. delegation to use as a base, with officials huddled in urgent meetings and two security staff arriving with a German shepherd dog.",
      "State-run broadcaster Russia 1 TV, meanwhile, said that 89 Russian journalists have been accredited to cover the negotiations with the station's reporters suggesting to NBC News that they were told the negotiations would conclude Thursday.",
      "Keir Simmons and Natasha Lebedeva reported from Istanbul, and Mithil Aggarwal from Hong Kong."

Trump met Wednesday with Assad\u2019s successor, interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former leader of an al-Qaeda offshoot group, in Saudi Arabia\u00a0after urging him\u00a0late Tuesday to \u201cshow us something special.\u201d",

It gave us hope for a better life.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a chance at relief after a grim 14 years in a country that until now has been one of the world\u2019s most sanctioned.",
      "\u201cFor years, sanctions have caused severe damage to the Syrian economy, directly impacting citizens\u2019 lives and hindering development and production,\u201d said Syrian economy minister spokesperson Hassan Al-Ahmad in a statement sent to NBC News.",

      "Assad\u2019s 2011 crackdown morphed into one of the most devastating and complex civil wars of modern times. Iran, Russia and Hezbollah lined up behind Assad, and the U.S., Turkey and others supported different rebel groups. Amid all of that, the Islamic State terroist organization thrived.",
      "Assad stayed in power by killing his own people, deploying chemical weapons and Russian bombs, and torturing and murdering them in an underground network of gulags. The U.N. estimates more than 300,000 people were killed; another 13 million were forced to flee their homes.",
      "In recent years, however, most international aid has flown into places like Ukraine and Gaza. Now it will be far easier for cash to enter Syria, Lund said. He called Trump\u2019s move \u201ca big, good thing for Syria\u2019s chances of recovering and stabilizing as a functioning nation state.\u201d",
      "Such a development would be welcomed by Syria\u2019s neighbors in the Gulf and Middle East. And indeed, Trump said his decision to lift sanctions came at the behest of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Mohammed bin Salman and Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. They want to see a stable Syria, one that does not disseminate refugees, instability and terrorism, and acts as an ally against Iran.",
      "\u201cI hope to see Syria like the UAE, Qatar or Saudi Arabia,\u201d said Nasser Eido, 49, a lawyer who fled to Norway during the war but has since returned to Damascus since Assad fell. \u201cI\u2019m confident we can achieve this. The old regime stole the country\u2019s resources, kept the people poor and left them hungry.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s move does not come without risk, however.",
      "Questions still hang over al-Sharaa, who led Assad\u2019s overthrow and says he has reformed since his days as the leader of the Islamist insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which spearheaded the offensive against Assad in early December.",
      "He has given some moderate signals, appointing women and minorities to government positions and saying Sharia, the strict interpretation of Islamic law, will not be imposed. Yet some groups remain uneasy about their place in the new Syria, where there have already been mass killings of Alawites, Assad\u2019s minority Muslim sect.",
      "\u201cThere is the risk that the Syrian government, which is pretty hardcore Islamist, ends up doing horrible things: more massacres, or Christians getting killed, or something else that would not play well in Washington,\u201d Lund said. The White House could be in the position of having to defend itself \u201cagainst the charges that it maybe enabled that,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not a risk free decision.\u201d",
      "In 1979, the country was blacklisted on the State Department\u2019s first list of state sponsors of terror, alongside Iraq, Libya and former South Yemen. Today, Syria is the only one left, the others being replaced by North Korea, Cuba and Iran. This classification imposes financial restrictions, as well as banning any American military-related imports or exports.",
      "More U.S. sanctions came in 2004, followed by the first measures from the United Nations and European Union a year later. In 2011, when Assad began brutally suppressing demonstrations, the U.S., U.N. and E.U. imposed further import and export controls.",
      "After rebels toppled Assad in just 11 days with little fightback, the U.S. eased some of these restrictions, granting a six-month license that allowed humanitarian aid to enter the country.",
      "Since then, the Trump administration had shown few signs of offering easy progress. It demanded that Syria fulfill a list of conditions that included protecting minorities before any sanctions could be shifted \u2014 hence the surprise at Trump's announcement.",
      "It could be a game changer for millions.",
      "Jumana Hayek, 23, risked imprisonment and torture for receiving 100 euros (around $115) every month from her brother, who had fled to Germany.",
      "\u201cIt was hard and dangerous because sending money to Syria wasn\u2019t allowed due to American and international sanctions,\u201d said Hayek, a university student from Aleppo studying electrical engineering. \u201cMy brother took risks sending the money, and we took risks receiving it,\u201d she added.",

      "A day after 59 white South Africans were welcomed to America as refugees, more than 86,000 South African farmers \u2014 who are mostly white \u2014 are gathering this week at the NAMPO Harvest Day trade fair, an annual agricultural exhibition considered the largest in the Southern Hemisphere.",
      "Over four days, the attendees will discuss innovations in technology, collaborations and various other elements of an industry that last year generated nearly $14 billion in revenue.",
      "Notably, according to one participant, there is no planned discussion of violence against white farmers or \u201cAfrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored, race-based discrimination, including racially discriminatory property confiscation\u201d without compensation, as President Donald Trump wrote in a Feb. 7 executive order that opened the way for the 59 South Africans to come to U.S., despite a ban on refugees from other nations.",
      "The executive order referenced South Africa\u2019s Expropriation Act enacted last year, which in some cases allows the government to seize unused land without compensation, something Cyril Ramaphosa, the country\u2019s president, said has not happened.",
      "The act awakened a profoundly troubling argument over land rights. South Africa's dark history of racism includes the confiscation of land from Black residents, both before and during the apartheid. Afrikaners, the minority white descendants of Dutch and French settlers who arrived in South Africa in the 1600s, were leaders of the apartheid regime that ended in 1994.",
      "The purported goal of the Expropriation Act is to shrink the vast land ownership disparity that came with the oppressive rule. According to the organization Action for Southern Africa, 72% of farms and agricultural holdings are owned by whites, who make up 7.3% of the population. Black Africans, representing 81.4%, own only 4% of the land.",
      "Trump asserted on Monday, ahead of the refugees\u2019 arrival in the U.S., that \u201cwhite farmers are being brutally killed and the land is being confiscated in South Africa.\u201d",
      "Yet Wandile Sihlobo, chief economist of the Agricultural Business Chamber of South Africa, said that the spirit of NAMPO this week reaffirms that \u201cgenocide\u201d of white South African farmers \u201cwas imaginary and not happening in our country.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all disturbed that the U.S. side is alleging that there\u2019s genocide and mistreatment of white farmers in South Africa. It is incorrect,\u201d said Sihlobo, who is also co-author of the book \u201cThe Uncomfortable Truth About South Africa\u2019s Agriculture.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf anything, the sector continues to flourish. [Trump's] comments are misinformed and not mirroring the reality on the ground in the country,\u201d\u00a0he said.",
      "The New York Times reported 225 people were killed on South African farms over a four-year period ending in 2024. Of those deaths, 101 were Black current or former workers living on farms, and 53 were farmers, who are usually white.",
      "Nico Harris, a farmer of Afrikaans heritage, told Daily Maverick South African newspaper that the problems he sees can be overcome and stem from the government not being \u201cpro-farmer.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think the refugees that have gone [to the U.S.] are not well-established family farming businesses like we are,\u201d Harris told the paper. \u201cI think they don\u2019t have an opportunity in the country and they might think that, \u2018This is an opportunity for us.\u2019 I don\u2019t think they\u2019re really fleeing because they are scared or worried, I think they see it as an opportunity.\u201d",
      "Harris added, \u201cI think there are racially discriminating laws against white farmers, and I think they have problems and haven\u2019t got sympathy from the government. But there are no real land grabs, and I don\u2019t think there are real threats. There are individual farm attacks, but it\u2019s more related to criminal activity. We just hope our government is going to wake up and realize that they need the farmers, Black and white.\u201d",
      "One of the South Africans who arrived in the U.S. on Monday told The Washington Post that she had been advised not to speak with the media and said it had been a \u201cvery emotional, very rough couple of weeks.\u201d",
      "Theo Boshoff, CEO of AgBiz, which represents companies across the agricultural value chain, including South African and multinational companies, said crime in rural farming areas is high but \u201cnot targeted against any racial or ethnic group.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is no genocide in South Africa,\u201d Boshoff added. \u201cPeople who live in rural areas, who are often farmers, are simply more vulnerable to crime and violent crime because they live in remote areas.\u201d",
      "And because they are remote, law enforcement often is not nearby to protect them. \u201cThere is no cultural or racial bias at play. White farmers, Black farmers, white farmworkers, Black farmworkers are\u00a0all equally at risk and united in combatting this challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cI also don\u2019t agree with insinuations that rural crime is motivated by politics or in any way related to South Africa\u2019s affirmative action efforts to remedy our checkered past.\u201d",
      "Solidarity, a South African trade union that represents 600,000 Afrikaner families, said in a statement in February that it does not agree with the African National Congress, which wants to close the farmland disparity gap. \u201cBut we love our country. As in any community, there are individuals who wish to immigrate, but repatriation of Afrikaners as refugees is not a solution for us,\u201c the group wrote.",
      "President Ramaphosa said on X that the country\u2019s laws \u201cbalance the need for public usage of land and the protection of rights of property owners.\u201d He said that a meeting with President Trump about the country\u2019s land reform policy would result in them sharing \u201ca better and common understanding over these matters.\u201d",
      "Trump adviser Elon Musk, who was born in South Africa, has talked of his home country having \u201cracist ownership laws\u201d in a genocidal effort against white farmers.",
      "Fadial Adams, a member of the National Assembly of South Africa, a political body that passes legislation and analyzes executive action, warned of Musk\u2019s influence on the president. \u201cLet us not forget that Elon Musk is a beneficiary of our suffering and our slavery in South Africa, and it is not something that he hides. He was raised on a system which benefited white South Africans exclusively,\u201d\u00a0Adams said. \u201cElon Musk should stop acting like the minister for foreign affairs for South Africa. He\u2019s not.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration and Musk representative did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Afriforum, a nongovernmental South African agency that supports the interests of white citizens, have called for farm murders to be classified as priority crimes requiring special attention, like gender-based violence or rhino-poaching. It does not support the Expropriation Act.",
      "\u201cMany laws identified by the Afrikaner lobby groups as racist are viewed by the African National Congress as being necessary, intentional measures to redress past wrongs,\u201d said Thula Simpson, an associate professor of history at the University of Pretoria in South Africa. \u201cSo the present developments strike at the heart of the post-apartheid consensus.\u201d",
      "As for the farmers in South Africa as a whole, Sihlobo, the economist from the Agricultural Business Chamber, pointed at how the country's earnings from exporting produce have grown from $2 billion in the year 2000 to nearly $14 billion in 2024.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re self-sufficient,\u201d Sihlobo said. \u201cThat speaks to the progress the sector has been making. You can\u2019t see numbers like that where there\u2019s a genocide.\u201d",
      "Jaco Minnaar, the chairman of AGRI SA, the largest agriculture organization in South Africa, says the larger problem is South Africa\u2019s crime rate.",
      "\u201cWe can see that farm murders in South Africa have a slightly higher rate per capita than murders in general, but it\u2019s farmers and farmworkers, which is not all necessarily white,\u201d Minnaar said.",
      "\u201cOur murder rate is one of the highest per capita in the world, even higher than some of the war-torn countries. That\u2019s something that we need to address,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t specifically see from the statistics that white people or any other demographic group are targeted.

      "\u201cNobody does drama like the one Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church,\u201d said Cardinal Timothy Dolan, archbishop of New York, shortly after emerging from the conclave that elected Pope Leo XIV on Thursday.",
      "The quick decision, made some 33 hours after the Sistine Chapel\u2019s doors closed and the cardinals went into sequestration, was a sign that they likely entered the conclave with enough unity around the decision to continue Francis\u2019 legacy that they did not have to spend days tussling over a new direction for the Vatican.",
      "In the weeks ahead of the conclave, Cardinal Joseph Tobin, archbishop of Newark, said in a joint press conference with five other American cardinals on Friday. \u201cWe listened to each other. What does the church need? What does the world need? What are we hoping for? What are we dreaming about?\u201d",
      "Leo, previously Cardinal Robert Prevost, a U.S. native with Peruvian citizenship and deep ties to Latin America, is described by the Vatican as the \u201csecond pope from the Americas,\u201d to Francis\u2019 first. He is known to have been close to the late pontiff, both in their daily dealings at the Vatican and ideologically.Like Francis, Leo is known for his concern for the poor and marginalized, and in his first Sunday blessing as pope, quoted Francis and called for ceasefires in Ukraine and Gaza, the subjects of Francis\u2019 final message to the world.",
      "The conclave is shrouded in secrecy, and many of the dealings that lead up to it remain in the shadows, but since the end of the conclave some cardinals have offered glimpses into what happened in the hours that led up to Leo\u2019s election.",
      "Once the Sistine Chapel\u2019s doors close, the cardinals swear an oath of \u201cabsolute and perpetual secrecy,\u201d as do all\u00a0Vatican\u00a0staff assisting them, including cooks, cleaners and drivers. Mobile phones are confiscated, an ancient reason for a digital detox that at least one cardinal, Vincent Nichols, the archbishop of Westminster, appreciated for giving him \u201cmore time on my hands just to be prayerful, just to reflect, just to be still, rather than being constantly agitated,\u201d he told the BBC.",
      "On the first evening, the cardinals cast their first-round votes, but black smoke billowed from the chimney, meaning no pope was chosen.",
      "The cardinals adjourned for the night to Casa Santa Marta, the guesthouse were most of them were staying \u2014 and eating. Cardinal Wilton Gregory said that \u201ca lot of dialogue occurred at mealtime, coffee breaks, those moments when you can engage in smaller groups.\u201d\u201cThe only method is the human method, to get to talk to another, the dialogue, to listen to one another,\u201d Cardinal Robert McElroy, archbishop of Washington, said about the conversations that eventually lead to the two-thirds majority required to elect a pope.",
      "The next morning, the cardinals returned to the Sistine Chapel and two more ballots were cast, but black smoke emerged once again.",
      "\u201cVoting is like watching a glacier move, but sometimes glaciers under stress move a lot faster,\u201d Tobin said.",
      "Despite wide speculation on papabili in the wake of Francis\u2019 death, once the conclave began, we don\u2019t know who the other front-runners were, or why they fell behind. But Dolan told CNN that Prevost\u2019s name had begun to emerge from relative obscurity even before the conclave began. And he continued to confer with his brother cardinals into the conclave.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that he stood up and made this overwhelmingly convincing speech that just wowed,\u201d said Gregory. \u201cI don\u2019t remember any particular intervention, but I do believe he engaged quite effectively in the smaller group conversations.\u201d",
      "And while conclaves in centuries past could stretch for weeks, Prevost\u2019s election began to take shape on the second day.",
      "Or as Gregory framed it: \u201cThere was a great movement on the second day, a great movement within the body that was there and there could be nothing other than the grace of God moving us toward this consensus.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat I experience is that everything begins in politics and finishes mystic,\u201d added McElroy.",
      "Tobin recalled the moment after casting his vote. \u201cI walked back and I took a look at Bob, and because his name had been floating around, and he had his head in his hands,\u201d he said. \u201cI was praying for him, because I couldn\u2019t imagine what happens to a human being when you\u2019re facing something like that.\u201d",
      "During a press conference on Saturday, Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of the Philippines, himself considered one of the leading candidates for pope, said he was seated next to Prevost.",
      "In the minutes after his election, when the new pope was gasping for air as the weight of his new role descended on him, Tagle said he asked him if he wanted a piece of candy. Prevost accepted and Tagle pulled one from a pocket beneath his cardinal\u2019s robe. \u201cThat\u2019s my first act of charity,\u201d he said he told Prevost jokingly, \u201cfor our new Holy Father.\u201d",
      "Soon after, Prevost emerged on the balcony of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica as Pope Leo XIV, proof of an efficient and successful conclave.",
      "\u201cThis wasn\u2019t our first rodeo,\u201d Dolan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through this 268 times.\u201d"

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand \u2014 A New Zealand parliamentary committee has recommended the unprecedented suspensions of three M\u0101ori lawmakers for performing a protest haka in the debating chamber last year.",
      "The haka is a chanting dance of challenge of great cultural importance in New Zealand, and the three lawmakers from Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori, the M\u0101ori party, performed one to oppose a controversial bill that would have redefined the country\u2019s founding document.",
      "On Wednesday a committee recommended record suspensions and severe censure \u2014 the harshest penalties ever assigned to New Zealand parliamentarians \u2014 after finding the trio in contempt of Parliament.",
      "Government bloc lawmakers, who hold the majority, are expected to endorse the penalties in a vote Tuesday. But Parliament\u2019s Speaker Gerry Brownlee took the unusual step Thursday of saying he would first allow unlimited debate before the vote due to the severity of the proposed punishments.",
      "The recommendations were the latest twist in the fraught saga over the bill, now defeated, that opponents said would have provoked constitutional havoc and reversed decades of progress for M\u0101ori, New Zealand\u2019s Indigenous people.",
      "Video of the legislators in full cry drew global attention last November. The bill they opposed was vanquished at a second vote in April.",
      "However, some lawmakers from the center-right government objected to the M\u0101ori Party legislators\u2019 protest during the first vote and complained to parliament\u2019s speaker. At issue was the way the trio walked across the floor of the debating chamber toward their opponents while they performed the haka.",
      "\u201cIt is not acceptable to physically approach another member on the floor of the debating chamber,\u201d Wednesday\u2019s report said, adding that the behavior could be considered intimidating. The committee denied the legislators were being punished for the haka, which is a beloved and sacred cultural institution in New Zealand life, but \u201cthe time at and manner in which it was performed\u201d during a vote, according to the findings.",
      "The committee deciding the fate of the lawmakers has members from all political parties. The government\u2019s opponents disagreed with parts or all of the decision but were overruled.",
      "\u201cThis was a very serious incident, and the likes of which I have never seen before in my 23 years in the debating chamber,\u201d said the committee\u2019s chair, Judith Collins.",
      "The three legislators did not appear before the committee when summoned in April because they said Parliament does not respect M\u0101ori cultural protocol and they would not get a fair hearing.",
      "\u201cThe process was grossly unjust, unfair, and unwarranted, resulting in an extreme sanction,\u201d M\u0101ori party spokesperson and lawmaker Mariameno Kapa-Kingi said in a statement. \u201cThis was not about process, this became personal.\u201d",
      "The report recommended that Hana-R\u0101whiti Maipi-Clarke, who at 22 is New Zealand\u2019s youngest lawmaker, be suspended from Parliament for seven days. The co-leaders of her political party, Rawiri Waititi and Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, face 21-day bans.",
      "Three days is the longest a lawmaker has been barred from the House before. Suspended legislators are not paid during their bans.",
      "Waititi and Ngarewa-Packer, the leaders of the party that advocates M\u0101ori rights and holds six of Parliament\u2019s 123 seats, have lambasted the committee\u2019s process as intolerant of M\u0101ori principles and identity.",
      "The pair received more severe sanctions than Maipi-Clarke because the younger lawmaker had written a letter of \u201ccontrition\u201d to the committee, the report said.",
      "The Principles of the Treaty of Waitangi Bill sought to redefine New Zealand\u2019s founding document, the 1840 pact between the British Crown and M\u0101ori leaders signed during New Zealand\u2019s colonization.",
      "The English and M\u0101ori language versions of the treaty differed, and the Crown immediately began to breach both, resulting in mass land thefts and generations of disenfranchisement for M\u0101ori, who remain disadvantaged on almost every metric. But in recent decades, M\u0101ori protest movements have wrought growing recognition of the Treaty\u2019s promises in New Zealand\u2019s law, politics and public life.",
      "That produced billion-dollar land settlements with tribes and strategies to advance Indigenous language and culture. Such policies were the target of the bill, drawn up by a minor libertarian party that denounced what it said was special treatment for M\u0101ori as they tried to rewrite the treaty\u2019s promises."

      "\u201cIf you start to remove the history of our state and our country because of activists, then you\u2019re actually giving in to those that are campaigning against it,\u201d Battin added.",

      "Jolly said a local branch of the Captain Cook Society, an international group that celebrates the explorer, has offered to preserve the bronze plaques.",
      "Melbourne-based society member Bill Lang said discussions were underway to find a short-term home for the monument, such as a museum.",
      "Lang said the council\u2019s decision not to repair the monument was disheartening.",

      "\u201cThin crust, because that\u2019s what I like too,\u201d he said.",

Zach Witkoff, a co-founder of the World Liberty Financial crypto venture and the son of the president\u2019s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, announced the investment at a conference in Dubai earlier this month.",

      "The Trump Organization, led by the president\u2019s two oldest sons, has also significantly expanded its Middle East footprint, with new ventures in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Oman. These include a Trump International Hotel & Tower in Dubai, a golf resort in Doha with Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund\u2019s real estate arm,\u00a0a Trump Tower in Jeddah, and a hotel under construction in Muscat. The projects are partnered with Dar Global, a developer linked to the Saudi government. It's unclear how long the projects will take to complete.",

The company has said that Trump handed over management of his assets to his family before returning to office and has no day-to-day role.",
      "\"The Trump Organization developments in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates raise serious conflict of interest questions, as President\u00a0Trump meets with top officials of all three countries this week,\u201d said Meghan Faulkner, communications director for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an advocacy group and watchdog focused on issues of public integrity and affiliated with Democrats. \u201cThe American people should not have to wonder if Donald Trump is prioritizing their interests or his own bottom line while he is making foreign policy decisions, but his business ties make that an unavoidable question.\u201d",
      "The White House did not return a request for comment.",
      "Trump\u2019s affinity for the Middle East is well known, with the president finding fertile ground in the region as he works to carve out an image as a global peacemaker and the leader of a country that is open for business. On Tuesday in Riyadh, he announced plans to lift U.S. sanctions on Syria and offered Iran \u201ca new, hopeful path\u201d toward a better future.",
      "During a state visit with Qatar\u2019s emir on Wednesday, Trump praised the warming Qatar-Saudi Arabia relationship, lavishing flattery on his host. \u201cWe just came from Saudi Arabia, where we have another great man over there that's a friend of yours,\u201d he said. \u201cYou guys get along so well and like each other. You sort of remind me a little bit of each other, if you want to know the truth. They're both tall, handsome guys who happen to be very smart.\u201d",
      "This marks a shift from his first term, when a Saudi-led coalition blockaded Qatar over alleged terrorism support.",

Qatar, however, appeared to temper the announcement. Ali Al-Ansari, Qatar\u2019s media attach\u00e9 to the U.S., clarified that the transfer is \u201cunder consideration\u201d by Qatar\u2019s Ministry of Defense and the U.S. Department of Defense, with no final decision having been made.",

      "Refitting the plane could cost $1 billion and take years to complete, more than twice the plane\u2019s reported value, NBC News reported. The cost, likely to come at taxpayers\u2019 expense, raises questions about the practical implications of a gift to a president who may no longer be in office at the time it's ready to use."

      "The money from their construction jobs paid for the two-story white home where Vail now lives \u2014 and where his children, who are in the U.S. illegally, would also reside if they ever get deported. Vail, 53, invested some of the money in opening a local food shop, which he uses to keep his family afloat.",

      "\u201cPeople here, they don\u2019t live luxuriously, but they live off remittances,\u201d Vail said.",
      "House Republicans have included in President Donald Trump\u2019s big priority bill a 5% excise tax on remittance transfers that would cover more than 40 million people, including green card holders and nonimmigrant visa holders, such as people on H-1B, H-2A and H-2B visas. U.S. citizens would be exempt.",
      "Trump also recently announced that he is finalizing a presidential memorandum to \u201cshut down remittances\u201d sent by people in the U.S. illegally. White House and Treasury officials have not responded to requests for comment from The Associated Press on specifics of the presidential memorandum that Trump previewed in an April 25 Truth Social post and how it would work.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum shot back on the measure and called on Republican lawmakers to reconsider it, saying it \u201cwould damage the economy of both nations and is also contrary to the spirit of economic freedom that the U.S. government claims to defend.\u201d",
      "\u201cRemittances are the fruit of the efforts of those who, through their honest work, strengthen not only the Mexican economy but also the United States\u2019, which is why we consider this measure to be arbitrary and unjust,\u201d she said in a morning press briefing.",
      "Remittance experts, local leaders and former migrants say that banning, limiting or adding a tax on certain remittances could damage communities that rely on them, prove burdensome to American citizens and firms and, paradoxically, end up causing even more illegal migration to the U.S.",
      "The influx of money provides an important economic lifeline to residents of poorer towns that often have little access to jobs or income. Remittances provide opportunities for people in their home country, making it less likely they would take the risk of migrating to the United States, the experts say.",
      "\u201cAny measure to reduce remittances will have a negative impact on the U.S. national interest,\u201d said Manuel Orozco, director of the Migration, Remittances, and Development Program at the Inter-American Dialogue. \u201cIt will have an effect on the homeland.\u201d",
      "Proponents of efforts to target remittances say they are an effective tax on people in the U.S. illegally and could be a revenue generator for the U.S. government.",
      "Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for less immigration, acknowledges that limiting, banning or taxing remittances would make it more difficult for immigrants in the U.S. illegally.",
      "\u201cOne of the main reasons people come here is to work and send money home,\u201d Krikorian said. \u201cIf that\u2019s much more difficult to do, it becomes less appealing to come here.\u201d",
      "Legislation to control remittances \u2014 through taxes on money transfers, both internationally and domestically \u2014 has been proposed in 18 states in the past few years. Almost all of those efforts have been voted down.",
      "The exception is Oklahoma, which in 2009 passed a tax on remittances: a $5 fee on any wire transfer under $500 and 1% on any amount in excess of $500.",
      "Steven Yates, who is now a senior research fellow at the Heritage Institute, wrote for the America First Policy Institute that every state should adopt this policy as a way to combat the impact of illegal immigration.",
      "Other high-ranking Trump administration officials have also supported efforts to tighten controls on remittances. Vice President JD Vance, as an Ohio senator in 2023, co-sponsored the WIRED Act, which would have imposed a 10% fee on remittances out of the U.S.",
      "The intention of the bill \u2014 which would allow people who could prove their citizenship to get the fee back as a refundable tax credit \u2014 was \u201cpenalizing illicit activity, such as drug and human smuggling.\u201d The bill did not make it out of committee.",
      "\u201cThis legislation is a common sense solution to disincentivize illegal immigration and reduce the cartels\u2019 financial power,\u201d Vance said at the time of the bill\u2019s introduction.",
      "According to the World Bank, remittances sent to home countries in 2023 totaled about $656 billion \u2014 equivalent to the gross domestic product of Belgium. The money that Mexican migrants send home to their relatives grew by 7.6% in 2023 to reach a record $63.3 billion for the year.",
      "Remittances are also a major factor in the global economy, often sent from American wire services rather than banks and credit unions. India, Mexico and China are the biggest recipients of those funds, according to the World Bank.",
      "In response to the proposal to tax remittances in the new Republican House bill, Orozco said, \u201cSome senders would find ways to send money differently, through unauthorized channels. Others would send less.\u201d",
      "\u201cSending less would have an impact on the receiving households, limiting the capacity to save, and in turn may increase the intention to migrate,\u201d said Orozco, who also serves as a senior fellow at Harvard University\u2019s Center for International Development.",
      "In Cajol\u00e1, local leaders say the remittance flow has stopped young people from migrating because they see economic opportunities they otherwise wouldn\u2019t have. Vail said losing that lifeline would deal a devastating blow to families like his and even cause his small business to fold.",

      "The reduction in tariffs on low-value packages shipped to the U.S. from China could therefore result in the easing of some prices, said Coresight\u2019s Kumar.",
      "In anticipation of changes to the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption, Shein has also expanded its supply chains, building manufacturing operations in countries such as\u00a0Turkey, Mexico and Brazil. It also reportedly plans to shift production to Vietnam.",
      "Shein and Temu did not immediately respond to CNBC requests for comment.",
      "On May 2, Trump ended the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption policy, which analysts had criticized as hurting local businesses and disguising illicit fentanyl trade.",
      "The small-package tariff exemption had helped Temu and Shein maintain budget prices on the merchandise they shipped directly from China.",
      "The U.S. government had briefly suspended the exemption in February before reinstating the provision days later, as customs officials struggled to process and collect tariffs on a spate of low-value packages.",
      "U.S. rivals like Amazon, on whose platform many third-party sellers offload products sourced or assembled by Chinese manufacturers, are also expected to ramp up shipments during the 90-day window, trade experts said.",

    "story": [
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark\u00a0Carney\u00a0has criticized Britain\u2019s invitation to Donald Trump for a\u00a0second state visit, saying it undermined his government\u2019s effort to project a united front against the U.S. president\u2019s talk of annexing Canada.",
      "Since taking office in January, Trump has repeatedly said he wants Canada to become the 51st U.S. state, a suggestion that has angered Canadians and left Britain trying to tread a fine line between the two North American countries.",
      "Britain\u2019s King Charles is also head of state of Canada, a former British colony, and the monarch has made a number of symbolic gestures in recent months, wearing Canadian medals, planting a maple tree and referring to himself as the king of Canada.",
      "Charles, who is still undergoing cancer treatment, is also due to attend Canada\u2019s state opening of parliament on May 27, the first time a British monarch has attended the event in Ottawa since 1977.",
      "Carney, in an interview with Sky News, was asked about British Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s move in February to use his visit to the Oval Office to hand Trump\u00a0an invitation\u00a0from the monarch for an unprecedented second state visit to London.",
      "\u201cI think, to be frank, they (Canadians) weren\u2019t impressed by that gesture... given the circumstance. It was at a time when we were being quite clear about the issues around sovereignty,\u201d he said.",
      "Carney, who won a party race to become prime minister in March before he\u00a0secured victory\u00a0in Canada\u2019s election last month by vowing to stand up Trump, said Charles\u2019s presence in Canada later this month was by design.",
      "\u201cAll issues around Canada\u2019s sovereignty have been accentuated by the president. So no, it\u2019s not coincidental, but it is also a reaffirming moment for Canadians,\u201d he said.",
      "Starmer, who is trying to improve trading ties with the U.S. after Britain left the European Union, has sought to play to its strengths when dealing with Trump, talking up its security expertise, pledging higher defense spending, and offering the pomp and pageantry that comes with a state visit.",
      "Trump, whose mother was born in Britain and who has repeatedly praised the British royal family, agreed a limited\u00a0bilateral trade\u00a0agreement with London this month.",
      "Asked about\u00a0Carney\u2019s criticism, senior British minister Pat McFadden told Sky News that every country had to decide how to conduct its relations with other countries."

      "NEW DELHI \u2014 The Indian government on Tuesday disputed President Donald Trump\u2019s claim that the U.S.-mediated ceasefire between India and Pakistan came about in part because he had offered possible trade concessions.",
      "Addressing a weekly news conference, Randhir Jaiswal, the spokesman for India\u2019s foreign ministry, said top leaders in New Delhi and Washington were in touch last week following the Indian military\u2019s intense standoff with Pakistan, but that there was no conversation on trade.",
      "\u201cThe issue of trade didn\u2019t come up in any of these discussions,\u201d Jaiswal said, referring to the conversations held between Vice President JD Vance and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as well as between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Indian counterpart, S. Jaishankar.",
      "Following Saturday\u2019s understanding between India and Pakistan to stop military action on land, in the air and at sea, Trump told reporters on Monday that he had offered to help both nations with trade if they agreed to de-escalate.",
      "\u201cI said, come on, we\u2019re going to do a lot of trade with you guys. Let\u2019s stop it. Let\u2019s stop it. If you stop it, we\u2019ll do a trade. If you don\u2019t stop it, we\u2019re not going to do any trade,\u2019\u201d Trump said.",
      "\u201cAnd all of a sudden, they said, I think we\u2019re going to stop,\u201d Trump said, crediting trade leverage for influencing both the nations\u2019 decision. \u201cFor a lot of reasons, but trade is a big one,\u201d he said.",
      "The militaries of India and Pakistan had been engaged in one of their most serious confrontations in decades since last Wednesday, when India struck targets inside Pakistan it said were affiliated with militants responsible for the massacre of 26 tourists last month in Indian-controlled Kashmir. Pakistan has denied any links to the attackers.",
      "After India\u2019s strikes in Pakistan, the two sides exchanged heavy fire along their de facto borders, followed by missile and drone strikes into each other\u2019s territories, mainly targeting military installations and airbases.",
      "The escalating hostilities between the nuclear-armed rivals threatened regional peace, leading to calls by world leaders to cool down tempers.",
      "Trump said he not only helped mediate the ceasefire, but also offered mediation over the simmering dispute in Kashmir, a Himalayan region that both India and Pakistan claim in its entirety but administer in parts. The two nations have fought two wars over Kashmir, which has long been described as the regional nuclear flashpoint.",
      "New Delhi also declined Trump\u2019s offer for mediation on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWe have a longstanding national position that any issues related to the federally controlled union territory of Jammu and Kashmir must be addressed by India and Pakistan bilaterally. There has been no change to the stated policy,\u201d Jaiswal said.",
      "Pakistan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said late Tuesday that Pakistan was expelling a staff member of the Indian High Commission in Islamabad, accusing him of unspecified inappropriate activity and giving him 24 hours to leave the country.",
      "In a tit-for-tat move last month, India and Pakistan reduced each other\u2019s diplomatic presence in Islamabad and New Delhi. So far, none of the expelled diplomats have returned. Pakistan and India routinely expel each other\u2019s diplomats over allegations of espionage."

      "Trump will meet with Syria's new president in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, an announcement confirmed by the White House shortly before the president began speaking.",
      "In his speech, Trump presented Middle Eastern leaders with a vision of a future steeped in prosperity, business deals and technological advances, which the president treated as an antidote to historic divisions.",
      "His rhetoric stood in contrast to the words of former President Joe Biden, who deemed the kingdom \u201ca pariah\u201d before taking office. Biden struggled to regain diplomatic footing with Saudi leaders during his presidency after confronting bin Salman about the 2018 death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi government. During Trump's first term, he maintained friendly relations with the Saudis despite international outrage over Khashoggi's death, which U.S. intelligence officials have said bin Salman approved.",
      "Trump on Tuesday offered an image of rising regional powers steeped in homegrown economic self-development, while holding up his host as a model.",
      "\u201cI stood here envisioning a Middle East that would eradicate terrorism and extremism, rising as one of the world\u2019s proudest, most prosperous and successful regions,\u201d Trump declared to a gathering of the world\u2019s business elite and Saudi leaders at the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum. The event, which was held at King Abdulaziz International Conference Center in Riyadh, included members of his Cabinet and adviser Elon Musk, as well as executives from Palantir, Uber, Google, Amazon and more.",
      "Addressing the crown prince directly, Trump asked, \u201cMohammed, do you sleep at night? Or are you up, restless, thinking, \u2018How do I make it even better?\u2019\u201d Earlier, the two leaders signed a landmark $600 billion investment agreement, marking a high point of the day\u2019s ceremonial events.",
      "As Trump offered heavy flattery to his host, he also took aim at his predecessors in Washington, jabbing at listless leaders whom he called \u201cthe ones that don\u2019t toss and turn,\u201d and \u201cthat will never take you to the promised land.\u201d",
      "He said too many American presidents found themselves afflicted by the notion \u201cthat it\u2019s our job to look into the souls of foreign leaders and use U.S. policy to dispense justice for their sins.\u201d He rejected the idea that U.S. policy should judge foreign leaders\u2019 morals, advocating instead for pragmatic cooperation to drive progress.",
      "And Trump swiped at destructive forces in the region, citing Iran\u2019s leadership as the most damaging of all, causing \u201cunthinkable suffering in Syria, Lebanon, Gaza, Iraq, Yemen and beyond\u201d \u2014 even as his administration seeks to strike a deal with Iranian leaders over their nuclear programs.",
      "Applause followed Trump's promise to withdraw sanctions on Syria. But in announcing his \u201cfervent wish\u201d that Saudi Arabia would \u201csoon be joining the Abraham Accords\" \u2014 the diplomatic agreements Trump's first administration made between Israel and several Arab nations \u2014 the president drew silence from the room.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ll do it in your own time, and that\u2019s what I want and that\u2019s what you want,\u201d\u00a0he added.",
      "Saudi Arabia has been an elusive target of Washington\u2019s diplomatic ambitions to expand the accords, with Israel\u2019s war in Gaza looming over Biden\u2019s unsuccessful efforts to bring about the normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel. The ongoing conflict with Hamas remains a sticking point for Saudi Arabia, which reaffirmed its support for a Palestinian state in recent months.",
      "Trump showcased his transactional approach to diplomacy even before departing Washington by defending a proposed gift from Qatar of a luxury airplane. He described it as a \u201ccontribution\u201d that the U.S. should accept, stating, \u201cI would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer. I mean, I could be a stupid person and say, \u2018No, we don\u2019t want a free, very expensive airplane.\u2019 But it was, I thought it was a great gesture.\u201d",
      "It was not just Trump seeking opportunities for deals on his royal tour of the Middle East. American business leaders are also looking to broker ties with wealthy Saudi Arabian investors. One conference attendee characterized the mood as a hub of excitement and positive engagement.",
      "This dynamic was on display during ceremonial events at the opulent Royal Court on Tuesday as the crown prince and Trump greeted, with handshakes and small talk, everyone from Alex Karp, the CEO of Palantir, and Sam Altman of OpenAI, to billionaire Blackrock co-founder Larry Fink and the leaders of bluechip companies like as Amazon and Coca Cola.",
      "The executives were in Riyadh to pitch deep-pocketed Saudi investors as the kingdom promises to spend on technology, infrastructure and more. Financed through sovereign wealth, the kingdom\u2019s Public Investment Fund offers a major kickstart for businesses expanding in the region. It was also an opportunity to engage with Trump directly as CEOs wrestle with the outcome of the president's sweeping tariffs.",
      "Also in attendance was Musk \u2014who, in addition to advising Trump on how to slash the federal government\u2019s spending, runs Tesla, SpaceX and an AI company \u2014 along with his businessman brother, Kimbal, according to the event program.",
      "During an earlier meeting with MBS, Trump emphasized the opportunity for the long line of American business leaders to walk away with a lot of checks. \u201cI like visiting with you,\u201d Trump added. \u201cI really believe we like each other a lot.\u201d",
      "And he joked about how Saudi Arabia's promised investments weighed on the decision of which country to visit for his first multistate overseas trip. \u201c$600 billion, knowing you, will be a trillion dollars,\u201d he said, repeating his ask to the kingdom\u00a0to increase its investment in the U.S. by rounding up a promised $600 billion.",
      "Trump secured the $600 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia to invest in the U.S., including a multibillion-dollar defense partnership, the White House said in a statement. As part of the arrangement, the White House said, the Saudi Arabian company DataVolt\u00a0plans to invest $20 billion\u00a0in artificial intelligence data centers and other technology, while companies like Google, Salesforce, Uber and Oracle will invest $80 billion in projects across both countries. Shamekh IV Solutions, a Saudi Arabian health care firm, promised to invest $5.8 billion, including through a plant in Michigan, to launch a high-capacity IV fluid facility, the White House said.",
      "The White House called the deal historic and said it ushers in \u201ca new golden era of partnership.\u201d",
      "The Trump family has also expanded its business ventures across the Gulf region, building golf courses and luxury properties, and touting a $2 billion investment in its cryptocurrency by an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm. There was little in the way of crossover between the Trump family and its business on display \u2014 Omeed Malik, an investor and business partner of the president\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., greeted Trump and the crown prince.",
      "Kushner, whose private equity firm received a $2 billion investment from a fund led by the Saudi crown prince, did not join Trump on the trip and has been largely out of the frame since the president\u2019s return to office.",
      "A former White House adviser, Kushner played a key role in helping broker Trump\u2019s signature Abraham Accords during the president\u2019s first term, and his close relationship with MBS is well known."

      "MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay \u2014 Former Uruguayan President\u00a0Jos\u00e9 Mujica, a onetime Marxist guerilla and flower farmer whose radical brand of democracy, plain-spoken philosophy and simple lifestyle fascinated people around the world, has died. He was 89.",
      "Uruguay\u2019s left-wing president, Yamand\u00fa Orsi, announced his death, which came four months after Mujica\u00a0decided to forgo further medical treatment\u00a0for esophageal cancer and enter hospice care at his three-room ranch house on the outskirts of Montevideo, Uruguay\u2019s capital.",
      "\u201cPresident, activist, guide and leader,\u201d Orsi wrote of his longtime political mentor on social media. \u201cWe will miss you greatly, dear old man. Thank you for everything you gave us and for your profound love for your people.\u201d",
      "Mujica had been under treatment for cancer of the esophagus since spring 2024,\u00a0when the affliction was diagnosed. His doctor reported that radiation had succeeded in eliminating much of the tumor, but Mujica\u2019s autoimmune disease complicated his recovery. In January, Mujica\u2019s doctor announced that the cancer in his esophagus had returned and spread to his liver.",
      "A colorful history and simple philosophy",
      "As leader of a violent leftist guerrilla group in the 1960s known as the Tupamaros, Mujica robbed banks, planted bombs and abducted businessmen and politicians on Montevideo\u2019s streets in hopes of provoking a popular uprising that would lead to a Cuban-style socialist Uruguay.",
      "A brutal counterinsurgency and ensuing right-wing military dictatorship that ruled Uruguay between 1973 and 1985 sent him to prison for nearly 15 years, 10 of which he spent in solitary confinement.",
      "During his\u00a02010-2015 presidency, Mujica, widely known as \u201cPepe,\u201d oversaw the transformation of his small South American nation into one of the world\u2019s healthiest and most socially liberal democracies. He earned admiration at home and cult status abroad for\u00a0legalizing marijuana\u00a0and same-sex marriage, enacting the region\u2019s first sweeping abortion rights law and establishing Uruguay as a leader in alternative energy.",
      "Through his remarkable political journey, Mujica captivated audiences with his humble tone, austere lifestyle and ideological earnestness.",
      "Shunning the pomp and circumstance of the presidency, he drove a beat-up 1987 Volkswagen Beetle, wore rumpled cardigan sweaters and leather sandals with black socks and lived in a tiny tin-roof house outside Montevideo, where for decades he tended to chrysanthemums for sale in local markets.",
      "\u201cThis is the tragedy of life, on the one hand it\u2019s beautiful, but it ends,\u201d Mujica\u00a0told The Associated Press from his farmhouse in an October 2023 interview. \u201cTherefore, paradise is here. As is hell.\u201d",
      "Tributes poured in from presidents, world leaders and ordinary people from around the world. The first to share remembrances were allied leaders who recalled not only Mujica\u2019s accomplishments but also his hallowed status as one of the last surviving lions of the now-receding Latin American left that peaked when he assumed office two decades ago.",
      "Colombian\u00a0President Gustavo Petro\u00a0praised Mujica as a \u201cgreat revolutionary.\u201d Bolivia\u2019s former socialist president, Evo Morales, said that he \u201cand all of Latin America\u201d are in mourning. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum called Mujica \u201can example for Latin America and the entire world.\u201d",
      "From robbing banks to running Uruguay",
      "Mujica never attended university and didn\u2019t finish high school. But politics piqued his interest as early as adolescence, when the young flower farmer joined the progressive wing of the conservative National Party, one of the two main parties in Uruguay. His dramatic pivot to urban guerrilla warfare came in the 1960s, as leftist struggles swept the region in the wake of the Cuban Revolution.",
      "He and other student and labor radicals launched the Tupamaros National Liberation Movement, which quickly gained notoriety for its brazen Robin Hood-style exploits aimed at installing a revolutionary government.",
      "By 1970 the government cracked down, and the Tupamaros responded with violence, planting bombs in well-heeled districts and attacking casinos and other targets, ultimately killing more than 30 people.",
      "Mujica was shot six times in a firefight with police in a bar. He helped stage a legendary prison break and twice escaped custody. But in 1973 the military seized power, unleashing a reign of state terror upon the population that resulted in the forced disappearance of some 200 Uruguayans and the imprisonment of thousands.",
      "During his time in prison, he endured torture and long stretches in solitary confinement, often in a hole in the ground.",
      "After power returned to civilians in 1985, Mujica emerged from prison under an amnesty that covered the crimes of the dictators and their guerrilla opponents. He entered mainstream politics with the Broad Front, a coalition of radical leftists and more centrist social democrats.",
      "Elected to Parliament in 1995, he astonished parking attendants and the general public by arriving to work on a moped with ragged jeans and an unkempt beard.",
      "Rapidly rising through the party ranks, Mujica charmed the country with his low-key way of living and penchant for speaking his mind.",
      "In 2005 he was named Minister of Livestock, Agriculture, and Fisheries. He held that post until 2008, when the Broad Front chose him as their presidential candidate. A year later, he was elected Uruguay\u2019s 40th president with 52% of the vote, capping an extraordinary political transformation.",
      "His wife,\u00a0Luc\u00eda Topolansky, a former co-revolutionary guerrilla member who was also imprisoned before becoming a prominent politician, bestowed the presidential sash on Mujica at his inauguration \u2014 as is custom for the senator who had received the most votes. They married in 2005 and had no children.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been with him for over 40 years, and I\u2019ll be with him until the end,\u201d she told a local radio station Sunday as Mujica\u2019s condition worsened.",
      "A folksy president who fascinated the world",
      "Pepe\u2019s bracingly modest and spontaneous style \u2014 delivering presidential announcements in sandals, distributing pamphlets in the streets against machismo culture, lunching in Montevideo bars \u2014 made him a populist folk hero and token of global fascination.",
      "\u201cThey made me look like a poor president, but they are the poor ones ... if you have to live in that government house with four floors just to have tea,\u201d he told the AP.",
      "As president, he presided over a period of comfortable economic growth, rising wages and falling poverty. In speeches, he pushed Uruguayans to reject consumerism and embrace their nation\u2019s tradition of simplicity.",
      "Under his watch, the small nation became known worldwide for the strength of its institutions and the civility of its politics \u2014 rare features most recently on display\u00a0during Uruguay\u2019s 2024 presidential vote\u00a0that vaulted\u00a0Orsi, Mujica\u2019s moderate prot\u00e9g\u00e9, to power\u00a0over the conservative incumbent.",
      "Mujica\u2019s greatest innovations came on social issues. During his tenure, Uruguay became the first country in South America to legalize abortion for the first trimester and the first in the world to legalize the production, distribution and sale of marijuana. His government also legalized same-sex marriage, burnishing Uruguay\u2019s progressive image in the predominantly Catholic region.",
      "Mujica\u2019s government also powered a green energy revolution in Uruguay. Today Uruguay is considered among the world\u2019s most environmentally friendly nations, generating 98% of its electricity from biomass, solar and wind energy.",
      "His tenure was also not without controversy. The opposition complained of rising crime and a\u00a0swollen fiscal deficit\u00a0on his watch that forced his successor to raise taxes.",
      "Some world leaders disapproved of his disdain for the established order. Conservative Uruguayans voiced outrage over his progressive policies.",
      "Still, Mujica ended his tenure with a 60% approval rating. Ineligible to seek re-election because of the constitution\u2019s ban on consecutive terms, he continued to wield considerable influence as an elected senator.",
      "Despite his stardom as regional trailblazer and global sage, his humility defined him until the end.",
      "\u201cThey ask you: \u2018How do you want to be remembered?\u2019 Vanity of vanities!\u201d he exclaimed in his interview with the AP. \u201cMemory is a historical thing. ... Years go by. Not even the dust remains.\u201d"
