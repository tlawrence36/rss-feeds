      "Inside the Thomas & Mack Center, just as the league wrapped up Sunday, a different kind of crowd formed. Hollywood execs, producers and curious power players were slipping away from the basketball action to catch a slate of 34 film projects created by NBA stars past and present.",
      "More than just film screenings, it\u2019s an emerging playground where sports and the art of storytelling collide. From baseline to backlot, the Summer League Film Festival is generating off-court buzz \u2014 with the likes of Hall of Famer Kevin Garnett, actor-producer Mark Wahlberg and filmmaker Deon Taylor joining the mix. Conversations are building on turning this three-day showcase into a launchpad for athlete-filmmakers, backed by film industry veterans who understand both the creative and business sides of shaping ideas and grooming projects for the screen.",

After the screening, the producers and cast discussed the film\u2019s origins, drawing a standing ovation from the crowd.",
      "The documentary remains in development, but Augmon says the film festival is already proving its worth.",
      "\u201cThis gives us another great avenue,\u201d said Augmon, who played on the Runnin' Rebels team that won the 1990 NCAA championship before his 15-season NBA career. His college teammate, Anderson Hunt, said sharing their authentic, real-life stories offer a major advantage like never before, unlocking new pathways to getting their projects financed and sold.",
      "\u201cWe have control of what's coming out,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cPeople might know about our stories through the internet. But stuff like this takes our platform to the next level. This is great for us, and Deon is like a golden child.\u201d",
      "The festival spotlighted stories produced by NBA stars past and present including Nikola Jokic, Luguentz Dort, Tony Allen, Nate Robinson, Kyle Anderson, Cole Anthony, Keyon Dooling and Udonis Haslem.",
      "Deon and Roxanne Avent Taylor of Hidden Empire Film Group were tapped to infuse the festival with seasoned filmmaking expertise, helping bridge the worlds of sports and entertainment. He played a key role in encouraging Hollywood insiders to show up, especially during the NBA Summer League's final stretch to keep the closing days as enticing as opening week.",
      "Taylor credited NBA Summer League co-founder Albert Hall for having the foresight to spark the collaboration.",
      "\u201cThis is all invaluable,\u201d said Hall, who cofounded the league with Warren LeGarie in 2004. \u201cThe players make money, no doubt about it. They invest in these projects. But they don\u2019t really know what the system can provide or how to approach it. Kind of like a young executive getting into the sport or a young player trying to be seen and get exposure. It\u2019s the same way. They have to be coached up.\u201d",
      "Hall said the partnership with Hidden Empire was a natural next step following their successful collaboration with the NFL and Skydance Sports, where they led film training sessions in March for more than 20 current and former NFL players.

      "TIFF laid out the selections to its galas and special presentations programs, which make up the bulk of the red carpet premieres to North America's largest film festival. Films making their world premieres include Ansari's \u201cGood Fortune,\u201d starring Keanu Reeves as an angel trying to teach a struggling man (Ansari) a lesson; David Mich\u00f4d\u2019s \u201cChristy,\u201d with Sweeney playing the boxer Christy Martin; and Alice Winocour's \u201cCouture,\u201d starring Jolie as an American filmmaker attending Paris Fashion Week.",
      "Those films join previously announced TIFF world premieres including Rian Johnson's \u201cWake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery.\" All three of Johnson's \u201cKnives Out\u201d films have premiered in Toronto.",
      "Also debuting in Toronto will be Derek Cianfrance's \u201cRoofman,\u201d starring Channing Tatum as a struggling father turned thief; Nia DaCosta's Ibsen adaptation \u201cHedda,\u201d starring Tessa Thompson; Nicholas Hytner's WWI drama \u201cThe Choral,\u201d with Ralph Fiennes; Steven Soderbergh's third 2025 release, \u201cThe Christophers\u201d; Hikari's \u201cRental Family,\u201d starring Brendan Fraser as an American actor in Japan; and Paul Greengrass' \u201cThe Lost Bus,\u201d with Matthew McConaughey as a bus driver navigating California's 2018 Camp Fire.",
      "The Toronto International Film Festival will kick off Sept. 4 with the debut of the documentary \u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d from director Colin Hanks and producer Ryan Reynolds. The festival runs through Sept. 14.",
      "Toronto has long been one of the prized launching pads to the fall movie season, though many of the top films often first go to the Venice or Telluride film festivals. This year, that includes TIFF selections like Chloe Zhao's \u201cHamnet,\u201d Guillermo del Toro's \u201cFrankenstein\u201d and Edward Berger's \u201cBallad of a Smaller Player.\u201d The designation of those premieres suggests \u201cFrankenstein\u201d will first play Venice, while the other two will likely play both Venice and Telluride.",

      "John Oliver brought his quirky humor to minor league baseball with the debut of the Erie Moon Mammoths",
      "ERIE, Pa. -- Besides being a fan, John Oliver has had a certain affinity for minor league baseball.",
      "On Saturday night, the comedian and host of HBO's \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d saw his latest crazy creation set out into the world as the Erie Moon Mammoths made their debut in front of a record crowd of 7,070 at UPMC Park.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re sending our furry child out into the world and you are the custodian of it. Now, please be careful with our child,\u201d Oliver said a couple of hours before the Moon Mammoths took the field against the Chesapeake Oyster Catchers.",
      "Oliver spotlighted Minor League Baseball promotions and alternate nicknames during \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d on May 4. At the end of the segment, Oliver invited teams to send in proposals on why they should get rebranded by the show's staff.",
      "Forty-seven teams sent in pitches, including the Erie SeaWolves, the Double-A affiliate of the Detroit Tigers.",
      "Erie president Greg Coleman sent a list of 11 reasons why they were the perfect candidate, including: \u201cThe SeaWolves play baseball nowhere near the sea.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo have so many teams expressing interest was really edifying. I think it kind of validates the fact that we thought there was something special about minor league baseball. We thought this would be a group of people that would respond to the ludicrous idea that we had,\u201d Oliver said.",
      "Erie was announced as the winner on May 18. After six weeks of research by Oliver and his staff, the Moon Mammoths were unveiled on June 29. That included the mascot named Fuzz, a purple woolly mammoth wearing a space helmet.",
      "\u201cErie did stand out to us as being, you know, uniquely eccentric. And I say that as both a compliment and an insult, which is the biggest compliment there is,\" Oliver said. \u201cThere was something about the Moon Mammoth that spoke to us for being particularly odd. It felt like it could make a baseball team's theme. You could almost see the logo in your head and it felt like something to be extra surprising.\u201d",
      "That this came together in less than three months is a minor miracle. It usually takes 16 months for a team to have an alternate identity approved and then take the field.",
      "\u201cI thought we had a good chance when I sent it in. And then when we were selected it was a little surreal,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cAnd since then working with the \u2018Last Week Tonight\u2019 team, they've been wonderful and detail oriented.\u201d",
      "The Moon Mammoths name was inspired by George Moon, who found the bone of a prehistoric mammoth while scuba diving in 1991. The remains are housed at the State Museum of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg.",
      "Moon has become a regional celebrity since the rebranding was announced. He was at the game and caught the ceremonial first pitch from Oliver.",

      "Coleman said that since the Moon Mammoths were unveiled, the team has done the equivalent of four years' of online sales in three weeks. The line of people waiting to get into the team store, which was located in left field, stretched out to near home plate in the concourse area.",
      "Karyn Drombosky and Sean Mizerski drove from Pittsburgh and were wearing homemade tusks as they waited to get into the team store.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just great. We\u2019re big baseball fans. We see the Pirates all the time, and minor league games are fun. There\u2019s so much silliness,\u201d Drombosky said. \u201cWe watch John Oliver pretty regularly. We were like surprised but excited when we saw he picked the Erie team to take over.\u201d",
      "In addition to throwing out the first pitch, Oliver was a batboy during one inning and led the crowd in \u201cTake Me Out to the Ball Game\u201d during the seventh inning stretch. The cap and jersey that Oliver wore for the first pitch are going to the Baseball Hall of Fame.",
      "Erie trailed 6-3 going into the bottom of the ninth but got within one run on Kevin McGonigle's two-run double. Chesapeake's Yaqui Rivera struck out Josue Brice\u00f1o with the bases loaded to end the game.",
      "\u201cThe atmosphere was great. Everything worked smoothly. It doesn\u2019t happen very often in minor league baseball to be able to have an event like that. It was a fun night for everyone,\u201d Erie manager Andrew Graham said.",
      "The Moon Mammoths will be back on Aug. 19 as well as Sept. 12 and 13. Coleman said there will be at least four Moon Mammoths games next season.",
      "\u201cI love minor league baseball. There is a special eccentricity to it,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cIt felt like a nice fit with our show because minor league baseball, as you know, is willing to try anything. That was proven by the fact that over half the league was willing to sight unseen, rebrand and put their trust in the hands of a group of people who are objectively untrustworthy. That\u2019s a bad decision, and it\u2019s that kind of bad decision making that I love about minor league baseball.\u201d",

      "Roger Norrington, a conductor acclaimed for historically informed performances during more than a half-century leading orchestras in Europe and the United States, has died. He was 91.",
      "Norrington died Friday at his home, his son Tom said Saturday. Norrington lived outside Exeter, England.",
      "Norrington conducted both period-instruments and modern orchestras, asking both types to play without vibrato and usually at faster tempi than modern practice.",
      "\u201cHe was an extraordinary dramatist. He made things happen emotionally,\u201d Myron Lutzke, an Orchestra of St. Luke\u2019s cellist who helped persuade Norrington to become music director, said Saturday. \u201cHe had his detractors, certainly, and some of them were some of my best friends. But for me, he got the music off the page. He made the concert experience transformative.\u201d",
      "Born on March 16, 1934, Norrington was the son of Arthur, president of Trinity College, Oxford, and the former Edith Carver. A violinist and boy soprano in his youth, Roger attended The Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto, Dragon School, Westminster School, Cambridge and the Royal College of Music, where he studied under conductor Adrian Boult.",
      "In 1962, Norrington founded the Sch\u00fctz Choir, originally dedicated to the works of Heinrich Sch\u00fctz. He became music director of Kent Opera from 1969-84, the Bournemouth Sinfonietta from 1985-89 and New York's Orchestra of St. Luke's from 1990-94.",

Smoking is now going, so maybe vibrato will too. ... I have discovered, all the way from Monteverdi to Mahler, is that when music is played as it should be, the sound is wonderful, the expression is wonderful and the instruments match together.\u201d",
      "Norrington was nominated for four Grammy Awards and won in 2001 for a recording of Nicholas Maw's Violin Concerto with Joshua Bell and the London Philharmonic. Norrington retired after conducting the Royal Northern Sinfonia in an all-Hadyn concert on Nov. 18, 2021.",
      "\u201cI have enjoyed every minute of over 50 years of making music with some of the most wonderful and talented musicians in the world,\" he said in a statement. \u201cThe time has come to step off the podium.\u201d",
      "His first marriage, to Susan McLean May, ended in a divorce in 1982. He married the choreographer Kay Lawrence in the mid-1980s; she died last year.",

      "At a concert at Gillette Stadium in Massachusetts on Wednesday, a man wearing a birthday sash was up first. Two people in banana costumes were highlighted.",
      "But in between, something else ensued. For several seconds, a couple was shown on the big screen. They were cuddling and smiling, his arms wrapped around her, as she leaned back into him. When they saw themselves on the big screen, her jaw dropped, her hands flew to her face and she spun away from the camera. He ducked out of the frame, as did she.",
      "\u201cEither they\u2019re having an affair or they\u2019re just very shy,\u201d Martin joked.",
      "But it didn't end there. The video went viral, and the internet got to work.",
      "The Associated Press could not immediately confirm the couple's identity.",
      "But internet sleuths allege he is the chief executive officer of a U.S.-based company, while she is the chief people officer \u2014 in other words, the head of human resources.",
      "A spokesman for the company did not respond when asked to confirm the identities of the people shown on camera. But he said in an email that a statement circulating online that was attributed to the chief executive was a \u201cfake from a clearly labeled parody account.\u201d The company later released a statement saying it had opened an investigation into the incident, but did not directly identify the employees.",
      "The woman didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on LinkedIn. The man's LinkedIn page appeared to be deactivated, and no other way of contacting him could be immediately found. A phone call to a number listed in an online directory under his name went straight to voicemail. Attempts to reach him through other numbers associated with his name in the directory were not successful.",
      "A representative for Coldplay said the band had no comment.",
      "It\u2019s easy to miss, but most concert venues have signs informing the audience that they could be filmed during the event. Look for them on the walls when you arrive and around the bar areas or toilets. It\u2019s common practice especially when bands like to use performances for music videos or concert films.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- With two out of five of its members North Korean defectors, the K-pop group 1VERSE is breaking new ground as it debuts its single album Friday.",
      "The band represents an unusual convergence of backgrounds: North Korea-born rapper Hyuk and singer Seok join Nathan from Arkansas, Kenny from Los Angeles, and Aito from Japan.",
      "While not the first K-pop act to include North Korean defectors \u2014 BE BOYS\u2019 Hak Seong debuted earlier this year \u2014 the diversity of the group's members add a rare dimension to the genre\u2019s growing global diversity.",
      "The group debuts Friday with their single album \u201cThe 1st Verse\u201d under Seoul-based label Singing Beetle. Their title track \u201cShattered\u201d features lyrics co-written by Hyuk and Kenny.",

      "Hyuk, who lived in North Korea\u2019s North Hamgyong Province until age 12, defected to the South in 2013. His journey to K-pop stardom began while working in a factory in South Korea, where a chance encounter with the CEO of a music label eventually led to weekend rap lessons in Seoul.",
      "\u201cI went to university but then things went bad. It was when COVID was pretty severe, and a bad incident happened, so I had no choice but to work at a factory,\u201d he said.",
      "Initially skeptical, Hyuk thought the invitation to become a pop star might be a scam. He recalled thinking: \u201cI really have nothing right now, even if you rob me, not even dust would come out.\"",
      "After a year of meetings where the music executive consistently bought him meals and encouraged his training, Hyuk joined the agency in late 2021.",
      "Seok\u2019s path was similarly unconventional. A former soccer player who started playing at 8 years old in North Korea, he defected in 2019. He declined to provide additional details, citing safety concerns.",

      "\u201cI was starting music for the first time, right? So I started with the mindset that if it doesn\u2019t work out, I can just stop and try something else,\u201d Seok said.",

      "In Alaska, a public radio station general manager took a moment from a busy day warning her community about a possible tsunami for a special task \u2014 sending a text message to Sen. Lisa Murkowski urging her to vote against a measure to strip federal fund...",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- Lauren Adams, general manager for KUCB public radio in Unalaska, Alaska, didn't have much time to reflect on Congress, 4,000 miles away, stripping federal funding for public media this week. She's been too busy working.",
      "Sirens blared in the Aleutian Islands community Wednesday warning of a potential tsunami, with a voice over public loudspeakers urging the community's 4,100 residents to seek higher ground immediately and tune into the radio \u2014 to Adams' station.",
      "At the same time in Washington, the Senate was voting on a measure that would eliminate nearly $1.1 billion that had already been appropriated for NPR and PBS \u2014 a process that didn't end until early Thursday morning. The House completed the process in time for President Donald Trump to sign it before a Friday deadline.",
      "Trump had called for the cuts, saying public media's news programming was biased against him and fellow Republicans, and threatened GOP members of Congress with primary challenges if they didn't fall in line.",
      "Adams, her news director, a reporter and an intern kept broadcasting and updating KUCB's social media feed until the danger passed. Then she made time for one more task \u2014 texting U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski and urging her to vote against the bill. Murkowski was one of two Republican senators, along with Susan Collins of Maine, to publicly dissent.",
      "\u201cI thought that it was such a telling story of why her constituents have a different relationship to public radio than maybe some other regions of the United States,\u201d Adams said.",
      "The federal money is appropriated to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which distributes it to NPR and PBS. Roughly 70% of the money goes directly to the 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations across the country, although that's only a shorthand way to describe its potential impact.",
      "The cuts are expected to weigh most heavily on smaller public media outlets away from big cities, and it's likely some won't survive. Katherine Maher, NPR's president and CEO, estimated as many as 80 NPR stations may face closure in the next year. Some stations are already fielding offers from commercial entities to buy their broadcast licenses, she said.",
      "\u201cMany of our stations which provide access to free unique local programming and emergency alerts will now be forced to make hard decisions in the weeks and months ahead,\u201d said Paula Kerger, PBS president and CEO. \u201cThere is nothing more American than PBS. Despite today's setback, we are determined to keep fighting to preserve the essential services we provide to the American public.\u201d",
      "The measure will cost PBS and NPR stations in Mississippi roughly $2 million, about 15% of the budget, said Royal Aills, executive director of Mississippi Public Broadcasting.",
      "Already, Mississippi Public Broadcasting has decided to eliminate a streaming channel that airs children's programming like \u201cCaillou\u201d and \u201cDaniel Tiger's Neighborhood\u201d to the state's youngsters 24 hours a day, said Taiwo Gaynor, the system's chief content officer.",
      "\u201cThis is important for families, to have access to content that they don't have to pay for,\u201d Gaynor said. \u201cThat is a sad thought, to think that we ... might not be able to provide that for a generation of children.\u201d",
      "Maine\u2019s public media system is looking at a hit of $2.5 million, or about 12% of its budget, for the next fiscal year, said Rick Schneider, president and chief executive officer of Maine Public. He said he\u2019s not ready to identify specific cuts, but the system is preparing to reinvent itself to make certain it continues serving the state\u2019s residents.",
      "Maine\u2019s rural residents rely heavily on public media for weather updates and disaster alerts, said Molly Curren Rowles, executive director of ACLU of Maine. Rowles said public media was a \u201clifeline\u201d to her growing up off the grid.",
      "NPR's Maher fears what the cuts might mean for the system's journalism, not just in rural areas where local news can be hard to come by, but in telling the rest of the country what is going on there. Less funding will also mean less support for popular television and radio programming, although it's too soon to tell which programs will be affected.",
      "NPR stations also use millions of dollars in federal money to pay music licensing fees. Now many will have to renegotiate these deals, which could mean less music, or a more limited variety of music, on outlets where music discovery is a big part of their identity. For example, Maher estimates that some 96% of all classical music broadcast in the United States is on NPR stations. \u201cThat is essentially taking an entire art form out of public access,\u201d she said.",

The public media leaders have already turned to lobbying Congress to restore some of the funding through the appropriations process for next year's budget.

Longtime guitarist Neal Schon sued longtime keyboardist Jonathan Cain in 2022, saying Cain was refusing to let him use the band's American Express card. A counterclaim came from Cain, who said that Schon was running up enormous personal charges on the band's account.",

McCartney above all wanted to get rid of manager Allen Klein, whom John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr wanted to keep as overseer of their business. \u201cThe only way for me to save The Beatles and Apple,\u201d McCartney told British GQ in 2020, \u201cwas to sue the band.\u201d",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: The court ruled in McCartney's favor and appointed a receiver to oversee their ventures in 1971. But negotiations and wrangling continued until a long-term solution that would become known as \u201cThe Beatles Agreement\u201d was signed by all four members in 1974.",

      "The 1950s and \u201960s pop singer Connie Francis died Thursday at 87",
      "Connie Francis was a giant of 1950s and '60s sugary-sweet pop, notching more than a dozen hits. In the months leading up to her death, announced Thursday, she experienced one more in \u201cPretty Little Baby,\u201d which has become a viral hit on TikTok six decades after its release.",
      "As of Thursday, more than 22.5 million TikTok videos have been created using the sound, often partnering videos of baby animals, toddlers, makeup tutorials and retro fashions. According to TikTok, those videos have amassed more than 45.5 billion views, globally. Celebrities like Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian and North West have used it, too, with West lip-syncing along to the track.",
      "Hooky, feel-good pop songs tend to do well on TikTok, and 1962's \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d is an exemplar of that phenomenon. Users gravitated toward the song's wholesome simplicity, sweet vocals, delicate organ and upstroke riffs. \u201cYou can ask the flowers / I sit for hours / Telling all the bluebirds / The bill and coo birds / Pretty little baby, I\u2019m so in love with you,\u201d Francis swoons on the verse that has picked up steam on the platform.",
      "And all of this has transpired in mere months: According to Luminate, an industry data and analytics company, \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d was earning just over 17,000 on-demand audio streams in the U.S. during the week ending April 10. A month later, that number had climbed to 2.4 million. That\u2019s a growth of over 7,000%. The song has earned over 29 million streams this year so far.",
      "In one popular video, which garnered over 56 million views, a user posted about baby teething hacks for first-time moms. Another user, Amari Goins, posted a video, with over 112 million views, of her 2-year-old daughter singing along to the lyrics, noting that her toddler picked up the song because of how often they heard it on TikTok.",
      "Most recently, TikTok users have begun posting covers of \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d as part of a singing challenge, where they exaggerate Francis' performance with their own stylized vocal runs. Francis, who died at 87, herself joined TikTok as a result of her song's popularity, and her first two videos \u2014 which earned 16.3 million and 31.2 million views, respectively \u2014 furthered engagement. In her first video, posted in early June, she said she was \u201cflabbergasted and amazed\u201d at the song's resurgence.",
      "\u201cTo think that a song I recorded 63 years ago is captivating new generations of audiences is truly overwhelming for me,\u201d Francis said in that first post, which she followed with a clip of herself lip-syncing to the song.",
      "For decades, the song lived in relative obscurity \u2014 written by Don Stirling and Bill Nauman for Francis, it was never a single and was originally released in the U.K. as the B-side of her 1962 single \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Be Warm This Winter.\u201d It appears on her album \u201cConnie Francis Sings \u2018Second Hand Love,\u2019\u201d released the same year. More than 60 years later, the song reached No. 20 on Billboard's Digital Song Sales chart in June 2025 and hit both the Hot 100\u2019s Bubbling Under chart and the Billboard Global 200.",
      "In Francis' last TikTok video, posted late last month, she thanked the \u201cmany wonderful artists\u201d who paid tribute to her, and all the users who sang along with her.",

The donation will come from Miranda, the Miranda Family and Miranda Family Fund, and the \u201cHamilton\u201d cast.",
      "It seemed like a fitting tribute to \u201cHamilton\u201d and its inspiration, Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, Miranda told The Associated Press, though he recognizes that Hamilton wouldn\u2019t have called himself an immigrant.",
      "\u201cHis narrative in our country kind of mirrors that of an immigrant story,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cHe did not grow up here. He didn\u2019t come from England. He came from the Caribbean, escaping harsh circumstances. And he really helped shape this country.\u201d",

      "\u201cOne of America\u2019s greatest exports -- at least for me growing up -- was the immigration narrative,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cSo many people I know\u2026 came to this country from somewhere else seeking a better life and then helped make this country better by being here. And I believe that\u2019s one of the greatest promises, one of greatest things about the American experiment, and I\u2019ll continue to fight for that and support organizations that are helping that cause.\u201d",

      "Hispanic Federation has already lost millions in federal funding, as the Trump administration cuts support for workplace development initiatives and environmental justice work, Frankie Miranda said.

      "The Farrells said that Navarro and Avery actually assaulted them.",

      "And he said his bandmates defamed him by publicly saying after the fight that he had mental health problems.",
      "Jane's Addiction was an essential part of the Los Angeles music scene in the late 1980s with their combination of elements of punk, goth and psychedelic sounds and culture.

      "But Farrell's lawsuit says the \u201cvideo evidence is clear that the first altercation onstage during the Boston show was hardly one-sided.\u201d It says Navarro was deliberately playing loud to drown out the singer, and \"what followed was an inappropriate violent escalation by Navarro and Avery that was disproportionate to Farrell\u2019s minor body check of Navarro.\"",
      "Farrell alleges that when he was being restrained by a crew member, Avery punched him in the kidneys, and that both Avery and Navarro assaulted him and his wife backstage.",
      "Shortly after the fight, Farrell in a statement apologized to his bandmates, especially Navarro, for \u201cinexcusable behavior.\u201d",
      "Both lawsuits allege assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress and breach of contract, among other claims.",
      "\u201cNow,\u201d Navarro, Perkins and Avery's lawsuit says, \u201cthe Band will never have their revival Tour, to celebrate a new album and 40+ years of deep, complex, chart-topping recordings. Instead, history will remember the Band as suffering a swift and painful death at the hands of Farrell\u2019s unprovoked anger and complete lack of self-control.\"",

      "Data from the Education Department shows the pace at which it resolves civil rights complaints has slowed as the Trump administration dismantles the agency",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration insists it hasn\u2019t wavered in its duty to protect the civil rights of America\u2019s children even as it dismantles the Education Department. Yet its own data shows the agency has resolved far fewer civil rights cases than in past years despite families filing more complaints.",
      "The Education Department\u2019s civil rights branch lost nearly half its staff amid mass layoffs in March, raising questions about its ability to address a deep backlog of complaints from students alleging discrimination based on disability, sex or race. Pressed on the issue in June, Education Secretary Linda McMahon denied a slowdown.",
      "\u201cNot only are we reducing the backlog, but we are keeping up with the current amount with a reduced staff because we are doing it efficiently,\u201d McMahon said at a Senate budget hearing.",
      "By several measures, however, the output of the Office for Civil Rights appears to have fallen sharply in comparison with previous years. A public database of the office\u2019s resolution agreements \u2014 cases in which schools or universities voluntarily agreed to address civil rights concerns \u2014 suggests the office\u2019s work has slowed.",
      "The database lists just 65 resolutions so far this year, on pace to fall far below previous years\u2019 totals. Last year the office logged 380 resolutions in total, following 561 in 2023. During President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, the office averaged more than 800 resolutions a year, including 1,300 during his first year in office.",
      "Other internal data obtained by The Associated Press show a similar trend. Since Trump took office, the total number of resolved cases is down about 40% from the same time frame last year \u2014 including cases that were dismissed, mediated or reached a voluntary resolution. Compared with last year, there also has been a 70% decrease in the number of cases resolved through resolution agreements or action taken by a school to comply with federal law, the internal data shows.",
      "Meanwhile, new complaints have increased 9%. The total number of cases has now climbed beyond 25,000.",
      "An Education Department spokesperson said the Trump administration is fixing a broken system.",
      "\u201cWhen staff levels were at their peak, OCR\u2019s processes still proved to be ineffective, as evidenced by the chronic backlog of tens of thousands of cases that left students\u2019 discrimination claims languishing over many presidential administrations,\u201d spokesperson Julie Hartman said.",
      "Parents and advocates say they\u2019ve noticed a difference.",
      "Adrienne Hazel filed a complaint in April after her 20-year-old son Ricky, who has autism, was placed in a public school program without a certified teacher and was not given an individual learning plan. Hazel, of Southfield, Michigan, has not heard from the federal office after receiving an automatic reply when she filed the complaint.",
      "Things moved faster last year when Hazel filed a separate complaint for her son. The office notified Ricky\u2019s school, which Hazel says spurred the district to reach an agreement with her within about three months. This time, she said, it feels like she\u2019s on her own.",
      "\u201cThere has been zero response to this,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s basically going into a babysitting situation. He\u2019s not getting the things that he needs to grow into independence. And he\u2019ll just be aging without getting an education.\u201d",
      "Marcie Lipsitt, a special education advocate in Michigan who worked with Hazel, said such stories are common. She helps families file complaints but warns it could take at least a year before an investigation opens. Some schools have backtracked on previous agreements, she said, yet parents can\u2019t get a response from the federal office.",

      "The fate of the Education Department itself is in question as the Trump administration moves ahead with a plan to wind down the agency. A Supreme Court decision Monday cleared the way for the agency to continue mass layoffs and outsource some functions to other agencies. McMahon previously suggested the civil rights work could be managed by the Justice Department.",
      "Still, McMahon said in June that the office was making headway after inheriting a backlog of 20,000 cases from the Biden administration. She told senators the office was catching up on the backlog and keeping up with new complaints.",
      "With half the staff, many question how that\u2019s possible. In a June court order pausing the termination of Office for Civil Rights employees, a federal judge in Boston said the branch is \u201ccurrently incapable of addressing the vast majority\u201d of complaints. More than 200 of the office\u2019s employees remain on leave while that case is decided.",
      "The Office for Civil Rights is responsible for enforcing civil rights laws across the nation\u2019s schools and is often a last resort for parents and students facing discrimination from schools. The office reviews complaints and, for those that meet certain criteria, opens investigations. Others are dismissed or move to a mediation process.",
      "Of the 65 resolution agreements reported this year, 57 were signed after Trump took office. Of those, the vast majority involve complaints of discrimination based on disability, with smaller numbers based on sex or race. Most of the sex discrimination findings deal with keeping transgender athletes out of women\u2019s sports, one of Trump\u2019s campaign promises.",

      "\u201cWhat were they going to do with these children?\u201d said Deborah Wald, a lawyer in San Francisco whose expertise includes surrogacy law.",
      "Surrogacy is an agreement between parties to have a woman become pregnant, typically through an embryo transfer, and deliver a baby. The intended parent or parents might struggle with infertility. They also could be same-sex couples.",

      "She acknowledged that California is considered a \u201csurrogacy-friendly state\" because it has clear laws around the process.",
      "Both sides are required to have lawyers, and there must be a written, notarized contract before an embryo transfer, Wald said.",
      "\u201cThe legitimate surrogacy community in California is very distressed when things like this happen,\u201d Wald said of surrogates feeling deceived. \u201dWe\u2019ve worked very hard on legal and ethical standards. It hurts everyone when something like this happens.\u201d",
      "There are businesses that act as matchmakers, connecting surrogates to people who want to have children. State business records show a company called Mark Surrogacy Investment LLC had been registered at the Arcadia address of Zhang and Xuan.",
      "It\u2019s not clear if Zhang and Xuan set up the business solely to find surrogates for themselves. State records show the company terminated its business license in June.",
      "Wald said there are no special licensing requirements in California for businesses that match surrogates with intended parents.",
      "Wald said there should have been plenty of checks and balances in the process, noting the role of fertility clinics in handling embryos.",

      "Swollen legs led to President Donald Trump being diagnosed with what\u2019s called chronic venous insufficiency",
      "Swollen legs led to President Donald Trump being diagnosed with what's called chronic venous insufficiency. It's a fairly common condition among older adults but requires a thorough checkup to rule out more serious causes of swelling in the legs. Here are some things to know.",
      "Chronic venous insufficiency, or CVI, happens when veins in the legs can't properly carry blood back to the heart. That can lead to blood pooling in the lower legs. In addition to swelling, usually around the feet and ankles, symptoms can include legs that are achy, heavy feeling or tingly, and varicose veins. Severe cases could trigger leg sores known as ulcers.",
      "Overcoming gravity to pump blood from the feet all the way up to the heart is a challenge, especially when someone is standing or sitting for long periods. So legs veins are lined with one-way valves that keep blood from sliding backward on that journey. Anything that damages those valves can lead to chronic venous insufficiency. Risk factors can include blood clots, vein inflammation known as phlebitis or being overweight.",
      "Doctors must rule out serious causes of leg swelling, such as heart problems, kidney disease or blood clots. Ultrasound exams of the leg veins can help confirm chronic venous insufficiency. According to the Cleveland Clinic, treatment can include wearing compression stockings, elevating the legs and achieving a healthy weight. Also exercise, especially walking, is recommended \u2014 because strong leg muscles can squeeze veins in a way that helps them pump blood. Medications and medical procedures are available for more advanced cases.",

      "Researchers report that eight healthy babies were born with the help of an experimental technique that uses DNA from three people to help mothers avoid passing rare diseases to their children",
      "LONDON -- Eight healthy babies were born in Britain with the help of an experimental technique that uses DNA from three people to help mothers avoid passing devastating rare diseases to their children, researchers reported Wednesday.",
      "Most DNA is found in the nucleus of our cells, and it's that genetic material \u2014 some inherited from mom, some from dad \u2014 that makes us who we are. But there's also some DNA outside of the cell's nucleus, in structures called mitochondria. Dangerous mutations there can cause a range of diseases in children that can lead to muscle weakness, seizures, developmental delays, major organ failure and death.",
      "Testing during the in vitro fertilization process can usually identify whether these mutations are present. But in rare cases, it's not clear.",
      "Researchers have been developing a technique that tries to avoid the problem by using the healthy mitochondria from a donor egg. They reported in 2023 that the first babies had been born using this method, where scientists take genetic material from the mother's egg or embryo, which is then transferred into a donor egg or embryo that has healthy mitochondria but the rest of its key DNA removed.",
      "The latest research \u201cmarks an important milestone,\u201d said Dr. Zev Williams, who directs the Columbia University Fertility Center and was not involved in the work. \u201cExpanding the range of reproductive options \u2026 will empower more couples to pursue safe and healthy pregnancies.\u201d",
      "Using this method means the embryo has DNA from three people \u2014 from the mother's egg, the father's sperm and the donor's mitochondria \u2014 and it required a 2016 U.K. law change to approve it. It is also allowed in Australia but not in many other countries, including the U.S.",
      "Experts at Britain\u2019s Newcastle University and Monash University in Australia reported in the New England Journal of Medicine Wednesday that they performed the new technique in fertilized embryos from 22 patients, which resulted in eight babies that appear to be free of mitochondrial diseases. One woman is still pregnant.",
      "One of the eight babies born had slightly higher than expected levels of abnormal mitochondria, said Robin Lovell-Badge, a stem cell and developmental genetics scientist at the Francis Crick Institute who was not involved in the research. He said it was still not considered a high enough level to cause disease, but should be monitored as the baby develops.",
      "Dr. Andy Greenfield, a reproductive health expert at the University of Oxford, called the work \u201ca triumph of scientific innovation,\u201d and said the method of exchanging mitochondria would only be used for a small number of women for whom other ways of avoiding passing on genetic diseases, like testing embryos at an early stage, was not effective.",
      "Lovell-Badge said the amount of DNA from the donor is insignificant, noting that any resulting child would have no traits from the woman who donated the healthy mitochondria. The genetic material from the donated egg makes up less than 1% of the baby born after this technique.",
      "\u201cIf you had a bone marrow transplant from a donor \u2026 you will have much more DNA from another person,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cThese DCD hearts work just as well as hearts from brain-dead donors,\u201d said Vanderbilt lead author Dr. Aaron M. Williams.",
      "Most transplanted hearts come from donors who are brain dead. In those situations, the body is left on a ventilator that keeps the heart beating until the organs are removed.",
      "Circulatory death occurs when someone has a nonsurvivable brain injury but because all brain function hasn\u2019t ceased, the family decides to withdraw life support and the heart stops. That means organs can spend a while without oxygen before being recovered, a time lag usually doable for kidneys and other organs but that can raise questions about the quality of hearts.",
      "To counter damage and determine whether DCD organs are usable, surgeons can pump blood and oxygen to the deceased donor\u2019s abdominal and chest organs \u2014 after clamping off access to the brain. But it\u2019s ethically controversial to artificially restore circulation even temporarily and some hospitals prohibit that technique, called normothermic regional perfusion, or NRP.",
      "Another option is to \u201creanimate\u201d DCD organs in a machine that pumps blood and nutrients on the way to the transplant hospital. The machines are expensive and complex, and Duke\u2019s Dr. Joseph Turek said the devices can\u2019t be used for young children\u2019s small hearts \u2014 the age group with the most dire need.",
      "Turek\u2019s team found a middle ground: Remove the heart and attach some tubes of oxygen and blood to briefly assess its ability to function \u2014 not in a machine but on a sterile table in the operating room.",
      "They practiced with piglets. Then came the real test. At another hospital, life support was about to be withdrawn from a 1-month-old whose family wanted to donate \u2014 and who would be a good match for a 3-month-old Duke patient in desperate need of a new heart. The other hospital didn\u2019t allow the controversial NRP recovery technique but let Turek\u2019s team test the experimental alternative.",
      "It took just five minutes to tell \u201cthe coronary arteries are filling well, it\u2019s pink, it\u2019s beating,\u201d Turek said. The team promptly put the little heart on ice and raced it back to Duke.",

      "Health Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- For decades, proponents of psychedelic drugs have come to Washington with a provocative message: Illegal, mind-altering substances like LSD and ecstasy should be approved for Americans grappling with depression, trauma and other hard-to-treat conditions.",
      "A presidential administration finally seems to agree.",
      "\u201cThis line of therapeutics has tremendous advantage if given in a clinical setting and we are working very hard to make sure that happens within 12 months,\u201d Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently told members of Congress.",
      "His suggested timeline for green-lighting psychedelic therapy surprised even the most bullish supporters of the drugs. And it comes as psychedelics are making inroads in deep red states like Texas, where former Trump cabinet secretary and ex-governor Rick Perry has thrown his full support behind the effort.",
      "The administration's embrace of psychedelics has sparked both excitement as well as concern from those in the field, who worry the drugs might be discredited if they appear to be rushed onto the market or are too closely linked with Kennedy, who is known for controversial views on vaccines, antidepressants and fluoride.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m quite optimistic,\u201d says Rick Doblin, whose organization has pursed the medical use of MDMA (or ecstasy) since the 1980s. \u201cBut I\u2019m also worried that the message the public might get is \u2018Well, RFK likes psychedelics and now it\u2019s approved.\u2019\u201d",
      "Under President Joe Biden, the FDA rejected MDMA as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, citing flawed data and questionable research. Regulators called for a new study, likely taking several years. It was a major setback for Doblin and other advocates hoping to see the first U.S. approval of a psychedelic for medical use.",
      "But the agency appears ready to reconsider. FDA chief Marty Makary, who reports to Kennedy, has called the evaluation of MDMA and other psychedelics \u201ca top priority,\u201d announcing a slate of initiatives that could be used to accelerate their approval.",
      "One new program promises to expedite drugs that serve \u201cthe health interests of Americans,\u201d by slashing their review time from six months or more to as little as one month. Makary has also suggested greater flexibility on requirements for certain drugs, potentially waiving rigorous controlled studies that compare patients to a placebo group.",
      "That approach, considered essential for high-quality research, has long been a stumbling point for psychedelic studies, in which patients can almost always correctly guess whether they\u2019ve received the drug or a dummy pill.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and FDA also recently hired several new staffers with ties to the psychedelic movement.",
      "\u201cThese are all very promising signs that the administration is aware of the potential of psychedelics and is trying to make overtures that they\u2019re ready to approve them,\u201d said Greg Ferenstein, a fellow at the libertarian Reason Foundation, who also consults for psychedelic companies. \u201cWe didn\u2019t hear anything about that in the Biden administration\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for HHS did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "As a presidential candidate, Kennedy discussed how his son and several close friends benefited from using psychedelics to deal with grief and other issues.",
      "A number of veterans lobbying for psychedelic access have already met with Trump's Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Doug Collins.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing so far is positive,\u201d Collins told House lawmakers in May.",
      "But some experts worry the hope and hype surrounding psychedelics has gotten ahead of the science.",

      "As officials in Washington weigh the future of psychedelics, some states are moving ahead with their own projects in hopes of nudging the federal government. Oregon and Colorado have legalized psychedelic therapy.",
      "And last month, Texas approved $50 million to study ibogaine, a potent psychedelic made from a shrub that's native to West Africa, as a treatment for opioid addiction, PTSD and other conditions. The research grant \u2014 the largest of its kind by any government \u2014 passed with support from the state's former GOP governor, Perry, and combat veterans, some who have traveled to clinics in Mexico that offer ibogaine.",
      "Ibogaine is on the U.S. government\u2019s ultra-restrictive list of illegal, Schedule 1 drugs, which also includes heroin. So advocates in Texas are hoping to build a national movement to ease restrictions on researching its use.",
      "\u201cGovernmental systems move slowly and inefficiently,\u201d said Bryan Hubbard of Americans for Ibogaine, a group formed with Perry. \u201cSometimes you find yourself constrained in terms of the progress you can make from within.\u201d",
      "Ibogaine is unique among psychedelics in both its purported benefits and risks. Small studies and anecdotal reports suggest the drug may be able to dramatically ease addiction and trauma. It was sold for medical use in France for several decades starting in the 1930s, but the drug can also cause dangerous irregular heart rhythms, which can be fatal if left untreated.",
      "Some veterans who have taken the drug say the risks can be managed and ibogaine\u2019s healing properties go far beyond antidepressants, mood stabilizers, counseling and other standard treatments.",
      "Marcus Capone struggled with anger, insomnia and mood swings after 13 years as a Navy Seal. In 2017, at the urging of his wife Amber, he agreed to try ibogaine as a last resort. He described his first ibogaine session as \u201ca complete purge of everything.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut afterward I felt the weight just completely off my shoulders,\u201d he said. \u201cNo more anxiety, no more depression, life made sense all of a sudden.\u201d",
      "A nonprofit founded by the Capones, Veterans Exploring Treatment Solutions, or VETS, has helped over 1,000 veterans travel abroad to receive ibogaine and other psychedelics.",
      "But federal scientists have looked at the drug before \u2014 three decades ago, when the National Institute on Drug Abuse funded preliminary studies on using it as an addiction treatment. The research was discontinued after it identified \u201ccardiovascular toxicity.\"",
      "\u201cIt would be dead in the water,\u201d in terms of winning FDA approval, longtime NIDA director Nora Volkow said.",
      "But Volkow said her agency remains interested in psychedelics, including ibogaine, and is funding an American drugmaker that's working to develop a safer, synthetic version of the drug.",
      "\u201cI am very intrigued by their pharmacological properties and how they are influencing the brain,\u201d Volkow said. \u201cBut you also have to be very mindful not to fall into the hype and to be objective and rigorous in evaluating them.\u201d",

The deal began to unravel in 2018, when the United States pulled out of it and began to reimpose certain sanctions.

      "The long-range Russian drones come in swarms each night, buzzing for hours over Ukraine by the hundreds, terrorizing the population and attacking targets from the industrial east to areas near its western border with Poland.",
      "Russia now often batters Ukraine with more drones in a single night than it did during some entire months in 2024, and analysts say the barrages are likely to escalate. On July 8, Russia unleashed more than 700 drones \u2014 a record.",
      "Some experts say that number could soon top 1,000 a day.",
      "The spike comes as U.S. President Donald Trump has given Russia until early September to reach a ceasefire or face new sanctions -\u2013 a timeframe Moscow is likely to use to inflict as much damage as possible on Ukraine.",
      "Russia has sharply increased its drone output and appears to keep ramping it up. Initially importing Shahed drones from Iran early in the 3 1/2-year-old war, Russia has boosted its domestic production and upgraded the original design.",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry says it's turning its drone force into a separate military branch. It also has established a dedicated center for improving drone tactics and better training for those flying them.",
      "Russian engineers have changed the original Iranian Shahed to increase its altitude and make it harder to intercept, according to Russian military bloggers and Western analysts. Other modifications include making it more jamming-resistant and able to carry powerful thermobaric warheads. Some use artificial intelligence to operate autonomously.",
      "The original Shahed and its Russian replica \u2014 called \u201cGeran,\u201d or \u201cgeranium\u201d \u2014 have an engine to propel it at 180 kph (just over 110 mph). A faster jet version is reportedly in the works.",
      "The Washington-based Institute for the Study of War noted that cooperation with China has allowed Russia to bypass Western sanctions on imports of electronics for drone production. Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence estimates that Russia receives up to 65% of components for its Geran drones from China. Beijing rejects the claims.",
      "Russia initially launched its production of the Iranian drones at factory in Alabuga, located in Tatarstan. An Associated Press investigation found employees at the Alabuga plant included young African women who said they were duped into taking jobs there. Geran production later began at a plant in Udmurtia, west of the Ural Mountains. Ukraine has launched drone attacks on both factories but failed to derail production.",
      "A report Sunday by state-run Zvezda TV described the Alabuga factory as the world's biggest attack drone plant.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a war of drones. We are ready for it,\u201d said plant director Timur Shagivaleyev, adding it produces all components, including engines and electronics, and has its own training school.",
      "The report showed hundreds of black Geran drones stacked in an assembly shop decorated with Soviet-style posters. One featured images of the father of the Soviet nuclear bomb, Igor Kurchatov, legendary Soviet space program chief, Sergei Korolyov, and dictator Josef Stalin, with the words: \u201cKurchatov, Korolyov and Stalin live in your DNA.\u201d",
      "The Russian military has improved its tactics, increasingly using decoy drones named \u201cGerbera\u201d for a type of daisy. They closely resemble the attack drones and are intended to confuse Ukrainian defenses and distract attention from their more deadly twins.",
      "By using large numbers of drones in one attack, Russia seeks to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses and keep them from targeting more expensive cruise and ballistic missiles that Moscow often uses alongside the drones to hit targets like key infrastructure facilities, air defense batteries and air bases.",
      "Former Russian Defense Ministry press officer Mikhail Zvinchuk, who runs a popular war blog, noted the Russian military has learned to focus on a few targets to maximize the impact. The drones can roam Ukraine's skies for hours, zigzagging past defenses, he wrote.",

      "Some 120 miners and police were hurt when officers clashed with miners trying to stop trucks entering the Orgreave Coking Plant in northern England on June 18, 1984. It came three months into a nationwide strike over plans to close two dozen coal pits and lay of 20,000 miners.",
      "The bitter dispute between the National Union of Mineworkers and the government was a decisive moment in Thatcher\u2019s bid to break the power of trade unions and remake the U.K. economy along free-market lines. The strike ended in defeat for the miners after a year and hastened the end of British coal mining, which employed 180,000 people at the start of the strike. Today, no coal mines remain.",
      "Campaigners have long called for an inquiry into why police from across the country were sent to Orgreave and what their orders were. Images of mounted police in riot gear charging stone-throwing miners with truncheons and dogs shocked and divided the nation.",

      "The initial results of an investigation into December\u2019s devastating Jeju Air crash in South Korea show that the plane\u2019s both engines suffered bird strikes but its pilots turned off a less-damaged one just before its crash-landing",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- The initial results of an investigation into December\u2019s devastating Jeju Air crash in South Korea showed that, while the plane\u2019s both engines sustained bird strikes, its pilots turned off the less-damaged one just before its crash-landing. The finding, which implied human errors, drew quick, vehement protests from bereaved families and fellow pilots who accuse authorities of trying to shift responsibility for the disaster to the dead pilots.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board initially planned to publicize the results of an investigation of the plane\u2019s engines on Saturday. But it was forced to cancel its press briefing in the face of strong protests by relatives of crash victims who were informed of the findings earlier in the day, according to government officials and bereaved families.",
      "\u201cIf they want to say their investigation was done in a reliable, independent manner, they should have come up with evidence that backs up their explanation,\u201d said Kim Yu-jin, head of an association of bereaved families. \u201cNone of us resent the pilots.\u201d",
      "The Boeing 737-800 operated by Jeju Air landed on its belly without its land gear deployed at South Korea\u2019s southern Muan International Airport on Dec. 29. It overshoot a runaway, slammed into a concrete structure and burst into flames. It was the deadliest disaster in South Korea\u2019s aviation history in decades, killing all but two of the 181 people on board.",
      "According to a copy of an unpublished briefing report obtained by The Associated Press, a South Korean-led multilateral investigation team said it found no defects in the plane\u2019s engines built by France\u2019s Safran and GE.",
      "The report said thorough examinations of the engines found the plane\u2019s right engine suffered more serious internal damage following bird strikes as it was engulfed with big fires and black smoke. But the pilots switched off the plane\u2019s left engine, the report said citing probes on the cockpit voice recorder, the flight data recorder and the engines examinations.",
      "Officials earlier said the black boxes of the Boeing jetliner stopped recording about four minutes before the accident, complicating investigations into the cause of the disaster. The cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder cited in the briefing report refers to data stored before the recording stopped.",
      "The report didn\u2019t say why the pilots shut off the less-damaged engine and stopped short of saying whether it was an error by the pilots.",
      "Bereaved families and pilots at Jeju Air and other airlines lambasted the investigation findings, saying authorities must disclose the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder.",
      "\u201cWe, the 6,500 pilots at civilian airlines, can\u2019t contain our seething anger against the preposterous argument by the Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board that lost neutrality,\u201d the Korean Pilot Unions Alliance said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "Unionized pilots at Jeju Air also issued a statement urging authorities to present scientific evidence to show the plane should have landed normally if it flew with the less-damaged engine.",

It housed a set of antennas called localizers designed to guide aircraft safely during landings, and many analysts say it should have been made with more easily breakable materials. Some pilots say they suspect the government wouldn\u2019t want to mainly and prominently blame the localizers or bird strikes for mass deaths as the Muan airport is under direct management of the Transport Ministry.",
      "The Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board and the Transport Ministry have offered no public response to the criticism. They said they also won't publicly discuss the engine investigations to respect demands by bereaved families.",
      "A person familiar with the investigation told the AP that authorities are looking at the localizers and other issues like whether air traffic controllers relayed the danger of bird strikes to the pilots swiftly enough and what emergency training Jeju Air offered to pilots. The person, who requested anonymity citing the sensitive nature of the investigation, said authorities earlier planned to publicize the results of probes after reviewing various issues, but changed the plan and tried to release the outcome of engine investigations at the request of bereaved families. He said authorities don\u2019t intend to lay the responsibility for the disaster to the pilots.",
      "Authorities aim to publish the investigation\u2019s final results by next June, the person said.",

He said it only irritated \u201cemotional parts of us that the investigation puts the whole blame on dead people.\u201d",
      "A former Transport Ministry-turned-university professor reached by the AP said the engine investigation report must be \u201creliable\u201d as it\u2019s based on an analysis of cockpit voice and flight data recorders that \u201cdon't lie.\u201d He spoke on condition of anonymity citing the delicate nature of the issue.",

      "PORT VILA, Vanuatu -- When John Warmington first began diving the reefs outside his home in Vanuatu\u2019s Havannah Harbor a decade ago, the coral rose like a sunken forest \u2014 tall stands of staghorns branched into yellow antlers, plate corals layered like canopies, and clouds of darting fish wove through the labyrinth.",
      "\u201cWe used to know every inch of that reef,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like a friend.\u201d",
      "Now, it\u2019s unrecognizable. After Cyclone Pam battered the reef in 2015, sediment from inland rivers smothered the coral beds. Crown-of-thorns starfish swept in and devoured the recovering polyps. Back-to-back cyclones in 2023 crushed what was left. Then, in December 2024, a 7.3 magnitude earthquake shook the seabed.",
      "What remains is a coral graveyard \u2014 bleached rubble scattered across the seafloor, habitats collapsed, life vanished. \u201cWe\u2019ve come out of the water in tears,\u201d said Warmington, who has logged thousands of dives on this single reef. \u201cWe just see heartbreak.\u201d",
      "That heartbreak is becoming more common across this Pacific island nation, where intensifying cyclones, rising seas and saltwater intrusion are reshaping coastlines and threatening daily life. Since 1993, sea levels around Vanuatu\u2019s shores have risen by about 6 millimeters (.24 inches) per year \u2014 significantly faster than the global average \u2014 and in some areas, tectonic activity has doubled that rate.",
      "On Wednesday, Vanuatu will get its day in the world\u2019s highest court. The International Court of Justice will issue an advisory opinion on what legal obligations nations have to address climate change and what consequences they may face if they don\u2019t. The case, led by Vanuatu and backed by more than 130 countries, is seen as a potential turning point in international climate law.",
      "\u201cSeeing large, polluting countries just continue business as usual and not take the climate crisis seriously can get really sad and disappointing,\u201d said 16-year-old climate activist Vepaiamele Trief. \u201cIf they rule in our favor, that could change everything.\u201d",
      "The opinion won't be legally binding, but could help shape future efforts to hold major emitters accountable and secure the funding and action small island nations need to adapt or survive.",
      "It comes after decades of frustration for Pacific nations who\u2019ve watched their homelands disappear. In Tuvalu, where the average elevation is just 2 meters (6.6 feet), more than a third of the population has applied for a climate migration visa to Australia. By 2100, much of the country is projected to be under water at high tide. In Nauru, the government has begun selling passports to wealthy foreigners \u2014 offering visa-free access to dozens of countries \u2014 in a bid to generate revenue for possible relocation efforts.",
      "\u201cThe agreements being made at an international level between states are not moving fast enough,\u201d said Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu\u2019s minister for climate change. \u201cThey're definitely not being met according to what the science tells us needs to happen.\u201d",
      "Vanuatu has already sought opinions from other international courts and is pushing for the recognition of ecocide \u2014 the destruction of the environment \u2014 as a crime under the International Criminal Court. \u201cWe have to keep fighting till the last bit,\u201d Regenvanu said.",
      "For children in Vanuatu, climate change isn\u2019t a theory \u2014 it\u2019s a classroom, or the lack of one.",
      "At Sainte Jeanne D\u2019Arc school on Efate Island, elementary school teacher Noellina Tavi has spent two of the last three years teaching her students in tents \u2014 first after the 2023 cyclones and again following the 2024 earthquake.",
      "With a shortage of emergency tents, her class was combined with another. Students fidget and lose focus. \u201cIt\u2019s too crowded,\u201d Tavi said. \u201cWe can\u2019t work peacefully.\u201d",
      "When it rains, the tents turn cold and muddy. Tavi often sends students home so they don\u2019t get sick. Anytime a storm approaches, the tents must be dismantled, the furniture carried to shelter and the children sent home. \u201cThat disrupts their education for a whole week,\u201d she said.",
      "In rural areas, extreme weather hits something even more basic: food security. On Nguna Island, farmer Kaltang Laban has watched cyclones wipe out the banana, cassava and taro crops that feed his community.",

Some homes and gardens have already been moved inland, and saltwater intrusion has tainted the community\u2019s primary drinking water source.

      "The therapy was already under FDA scrutiny after two teenage boys died earlier this year from acute liver injury, a known side effect of the treatment. Then the company last week disclosed a third death with a different therapy: a 51-year-old patient who was enrolled in a company trial for another form of muscular dystrophy.",

      "Sanseito added 14 seats in Sunday\u2019s vote to the one seat already held by its leader in the 248-member upper house, the less powerful of Japan's two-chamber parliament.",

      "An electrical engineer in rural Vermont is reviving old pay phones to give people a free option for making calls in areas where cell service is unreliable or nonexistent",
      "TUNBRIDGE, Vt. -- An electrical engineer by trade, Patrick Schlott has spent countless hours tinkering with new and old technology. But it wasn\u2019t until he found himself living in rural Vermont that he realized his penchant for repairing old pay phones could provide a public service.",
      "\u201cI realized, wow, there\u2019s no cell service for 10 miles (16 kilometers) in either direction,\u201d he said. \u201cThe community could really benefit from something like this.\u201d",
      "Schlott, a full-time engineer at electric airplane manufacturing company BETA Technologies, decided to approach the owners of his local general store with the idea to install old pay phones around town and make them free for public use. After he explained that there would be no cost to the host, North Tunbridge General Store owners Mike and Lois Gross let Schlott install his first phone outside the store.",
      "\u201cEveryone\u2019s pretty surprised, and they\u2019re like, \u2018Is that a real payphone? Does that really work?\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Yeah, but it doesn\u2019t cost any money now,\u2019\" said store owner Mike Gross. \"We\u2019ve had people use it that broke down. It\u2019s a great thing because service is so spotty in Vermont.\u201d",
      "The first free public phone installation was Schlott\u2019s idea, but he says the two other locations, the Latham Library in Thetford and inside an informational booth in Randolph off Interstate 89, came from community members requesting the service.",
      "\u201cAll the other phones so far have been people reaching out, which is pretty cool,\u201d he said.",
      "Schlott buys the old pay phones, which can range in cost from $100-$500, at flea markets, from internet listings or at auction and fixes them up in his basement workshop. All that\u2019s needed to install one of his phones is an internet connection \u2014 no coins necessary.",

If a user dials zero, the phone will ring Schlott's personal cellphone, though he uses an app to keep his number private.",
      "So far, the phone at the Latham Library location has seen the most use. According to Schlott, 370 calls have been made since the phone was installed five months ago, filling a need for students without cellphones to call their parents for after-school pickups.",
      "Hannah McClain is a regular at the North Tunbridge General Store and says she finds comfort in knowing the phone is there whenever her 16-year-old daughters might need it.",
      "\u201cIt does make me feel safer if the kids are out and about, that if they had an emergency up this way that they could stop and use this. I think these are a great service,\u201d she said.",
      "Schlott is seeing increased interest in the service, with another free phone install in the works at the Brownell Library in Essex. For now, he plans to continue covering the costs associated with each phone, but noted that may change as the project scales.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s cool to see something retro that has that old-school appeal but also works. To actually hear it ring, to pick it up and have a dial tone, I think there\u2019s real power in that,\" he said. \"And I don\u2019t think they should end up in a landfill.

      "Nonprofits in the Bronx are facing severe challenges as federal grant cuts disrupt essential services",
      "NEW YORK -- On a sweltering summer day, children leap between rocks along the Bronx River while cyclists pedal on newly paved paths. Kayaks rest on what was once an industrial dumping ground, now transformed into a bustling promenade along the city\u2019s only freshwater river.",
      "The Bronx River Greenway, a series of stitched-together waterfront parks built atop once largely abandoned and polluted wasteland, is a hard-fought victory for the country\u2019s poorest congressional district \u2014 one that locals call a \u201cbeacon of environmental justice\u201d built by federal dollars and water-pollution settlements from the borough\u2019s wealthier neighbors.",
      "Now, like thousands of nonprofits around the country, this organization\u2019s future is in jeopardy. The Trump administration\u2019s sweeping federal grant cuts have left nonprofits nationwide and the communities they serve in precarious straits. But few places face as stark a reckoning as the Bronx, where federal funding has proved indispensable for revitalizing green spaces, protecting survivors of domestic violence, and preventing youth violence.",
      "Over 84% of the 342 nonprofits based in the Bronx rely on federal grants now at risk, according to an analysis by the Urban Institute. It\u2019s a significant increase from the 70% of groups vulnerable to government defunding statewide.",
      "In all but two of the country\u2019s 437 congressional districts, the typical nonprofit could not cover its expenses without government grants. Nonprofits have increasingly served as contractors for government services \u2014 like operating homeless shelters \u2014 since the 1960s.",
      "In the Bronx, if such grants were to disappear entirely, the borough\u2019s nonprofits could face a collective deficit of nearly 30% \u2014 cuts that have begun to force layoffs and austerity on dozens of groups connecting Bronxites to low-cost health care, food assistance, and preschool slots.",
      "\u201cWhen America sneezes, the Bronx gets the flu,\u201d said U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres, the Democrat who represents the district. \u201cI think we in the Bronx feel we have been and will continue to be the hardest hit by the impact of a Trump presidency.\u201d",
      "Nestled in a corner of parkland atop the site of an abandoned amusement park, the headquarters of the Bronx River Alliance is among the borough\u2019s greenest buildings, boasting nature classrooms, samples of the river\u2019s flora and fauna, and a storage space teeming with kayaks and canoes.",
      "In March, the group received formal notice that it would lose $1.5 million in federal grants promised under the Inflation Reduction Act last year for improving water quality and climate-resilience projects. After years of rising momentum, cubicles now sit empty. Leaders held off on hiring in anticipation of cuts, and now they don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll be able to fill those roles.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve met some of the folks who were pulling cars out of the river in the \u201970s and \u201980s,\u201d said Daniel Ranells, the group\u2019s deputy director of programs. Back then, the area was a \u201cdumping ground\u201d so inundated with industrial waste, tires, abandoned cars, ovens, and microwaves that \u201cfolks didn\u2019t really understand there was a river there.\u201d",
      "That has shifted dramatically in recent years thanks in part to decades of federal investment. Just south of its headquarters, the organization restored salt marshes along the riverbanks of a shuttered concrete plant.",
      "In 2007, the first beaver appeared on the Bronx River in over 200 years \u2014 named \u201cJos\u00e9 the Beaver\u201d in honor of former Congressman Jos\u00e9 E. Serrano, who helped direct millions in federal funds to groups dedicated to the river\u2019s restoration.",
      "\u201cThe Bronx River is a shining light of environmental justice,\u201d Ranells said, and millions in federal funding over the years has helped \u201cmake it a destination\u201d after years of neglect.",
      "Now staffers at the Bronx River Alliance describe a sense of \u201cwhiplash\u201d in seeing hard-fought funds dry up and grant language scrubbed of any allusions to racial or environmental justice.",
      "The Bronx River Alliance has joined other nonprofits in suing the Trump administration to unfreeze funds, but the uncertainty has already disrupted years of planning, a reality that has rippled across the neighborhood, leaving few organizations untouched.",
      "Up the street from the Alliance, the office of the Osborne Association, a group that has worked to prevent youth violence for nearly a century, has grown quieter. In April, an email from the Bureau of Justice Assistance stated the remaining $666,000 of a $2 million grant \u201cno longer effectuates department priorities.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lifeline for young people, and it\u2019s no longer there for 25 more of them,\u201d Monsalve said. \u201cWithout another alternative, it\u2019s 25 young people that will see prison or jail time, and that\u2019s incredibly frustrating.\u201d",
      "The Department of Justice has canceled over $810 million in similar grants to nonprofits working in violence prevention. The Environmental Protection Agency attempted to cancel $2 billion in grants for environmental justice work.",
      "Nonprofit leaders say the cuts hit hardest in the places that can afford them the least. In the Bronx, almost 30 percent of residents live in poverty, the vast majority of whom are Black or Latino, and nearly one in six schoolchildren experience homelessness every year.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had decades of disinvestment in these communities, and we had been starting to see some meaningful investment and community-based solutions that were actually working,\u201d said Monsalve. \u201cAnd then all of a sudden that support just gets yanked away.\u201d",

      "For decades, a million-dollar federal grant allowed the victim-service organization Safe Horizon to operate a program that stationed domestic violence advocates in the borough\u2019s criminal court.",

      "It was an agonizing decision given the volume of domestic violence in the Bronx, Roberts said.",
      "It means that hundreds of survivors \u201cmay not have the opportunity to talk to an advocate about their options, about their rights, or about their safety,\u201d she said.",
      "Roberts said she\u2019s bracing for more cuts \u2014 federal funds make up about 24% of the group\u2019s budget \u2014 that could force the closure of shelters or reductions to a citywide hotline.",
      "As nonprofits nationwide grapple with similar losses, Roberts said private philanthropy and local governments will need to \u201cmake some smart and thoughtful and principled decisions about where they can help to fill those gaps.\u201d",
      "In places like the Bronx, finding alternative funding is especially challenging. \u201cThe not-for-profit sector is often fragile, and nowhere more so than the Bronx,\u201d Torres said of the district he represents, where organizations tend to be more dependent on government funding than wealthier enclaves.",
      "\u201cOrganizations spent hundreds of thousands of dollars simply to apply for a contract and hired staff and made all these plans only to see the written contract disappear,\u201d Torres said. \u201cIt\u2019s deeply destabilizing.\u201d",

      "Nonprofits in McDowell County, West Virginia, face severe challenges due to federal funding cuts",
      "For nonprofits in McDowell County, West Virginia, the federal cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act threaten a lifeline.",
      "Many of McDowell\u2019s 17,000 residents rely on federal programs and the nonprofits they fund to get by. The county\u2019s tax base and population have significantly declined since 1950, when McDowell was the top coal-producing county in the nation and had about 100,000 residents.",
      "Now, more than half the children in the county receive federal Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program benefits, and about one-third of seniors are on Medicaid, the federal health insurance program for the poor. Decades after the Kennedy administration made the county a first test of food stamps, nearly half the county\u2019s residents receive supplemental nutrition assistance, or SNAP, the Food Stamp Program\u2019s successor.",
      "The strains created by new eligibility restrictions on SNAP as a result of the passage of President Trump\u2019s domestic policy bill will be especially dire in places like McDowell County, where more than one-third of the population lives below the federal poverty line, said Rosemary Ketchum, executive director of the West Virginia Nonprofit Association.",
      "\u201cThese federal cuts are starving people,\u201d she said.",
      "Since the interruption in federal support tied to President Trump\u2019s January executive orders barring grants related to \u201cgender ideology\u201d; diversity, equity, and inclusion; and environmental justice, Ketchum said many of the 9,000 or so nonprofits in her state have laid off staff. Others, she said, are dipping into whatever reserves they have to pay their employees.",
      "Those reserves are slim, if they exist at all. Taken together, the seven nonprofits that receive federal grants in McDowell County run on a 3 percent operating margin, according to data tabulated by the Urban Institute\u2019s National Center for Charitable Statistics. If all federal support disappeared, the center found, all the county\u2019s nonprofits would be at risk of going under unless other funding was provided.",
      "In a poor state like West Virginia, which is already facing a budget deficit and lacks the legions of philanthropic donors who got rich on Wall Street or in Silicon Valley, nonprofits don\u2019t have a plan B, said Kathy Gentry, executive director of Safe Housing and Economic Development, or SHED, a McDowell nonprofit housing provider.",
      "The nonprofit\u2019s clients, many of whom are elderly or disabled, rely on U.S. Housing and Urban Development support to cover the rent at the 94 housing units SHED manages.",
      "Gentry\u2019s pay was temporarily cut for six weeks this spring because part of her salary comes from a HUD capacity-building grant that the administration deemed at cross-purposes with Trump\u2019s anti-DEI policy agenda. Her full paycheck resumed, but Gentry worries further cuts will force her to lay off staff.",
      "Already the nonprofit operates at a loss. In its 2023 tax filing, the most recent available, SHED\u2019s $663,000 in expenses outstripped its revenue by nearly $200,000.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a quandary here \u2014 all nonprofits are,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cAre we going to exist? Will we have to dissolve?\u201d",
      "Since 2015, Heidi Binko and her team at the Just Transition Fund have worked with economic development agencies and nonprofits in areas where the coal industry once flourished. That can mean helping a local organization identify or write a grant or provide a matching grant.",
      "The fund was created by the Rockefeller Family Foundation and Appalachian Funders Network to help coal towns capture some of the dollars provided in the 2015 Clean Power Plan, or POWER Act, passed during the Obama administration. Since then, the fund says it has helped coal communities in West Virginia and throughout the nation secure more than $2 billion in federal grants.",
      "Binko hopes the fund can continue to attract federal resources to towns with high poverty rates.",
      "\u201cThere are still federal dollars available,\u201d she said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t all been zeroed out.\u201d",

According to DigDeep, a nonprofit that assists with clean water access and wastewater systems and is primarily funded by private institutions, corporate partners and grassroots donations, there may be hundreds of people in the county without a dependable water supply.

      "DigDeep works with the McDowell Public Service District utility provider to identify residents who need a water hookup and helps secure grants from the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s rural development program to extend water trunk lines to hard-to-reach areas. In some cases, the nonprofit helps pay to connect the federally supported water lines directly to people\u2019s homes. It is also helping to install wastewater treatment facilities to more than 400 residents who either have inadequate systems or flush waste into nearby creeks.",
      "The water supply throughout the county is unreliable because of the area\u2019s close historical ties to the rise and fall of the coal economy, said George McGraw, DigDeep\u2019s chief executive.",
      "When coal operations came to McDowell, businesses operated in a \u201cclosed loop\u201d environment. Coal companies paid workers to build and work in the mines, they owned the houses where miners lived, and they built the water lines that served those houses, McGraw said.",
      "When the coal industry began to peter out, companies exited the county, leaving behind an aging system of pipes and drains.",
      "To secure water in the county today, hundreds of people fill plastic jugs from roadside springs or mine shafts, McGraw said. To get drinking water, they may use the bathroom in a store, a neighbor\u2019s house, or a school.",
      "DigDeep has several projects in the planning stages in McDowell. But the Trump USDA budget proposal would chop the rural water program by two-thirds, meaning some public works projects may never get completed. Someone else will have to foot the bill or the system will continue to crumble, leaving many people in McDowell County without a basic necessity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like the burden goes away,\u201d McGraw said. \u201cThe burden just shifts, and utilities are forced to raise rates on customers, many of whom are below the poverty line.\u201d",

      "In his second term, President Donald Trump has cut a huge range of federal grants that fund social services",
      "Dawn Price signs rent checks worth about $160,000 every month for 79 people that her nonprofit helps house in Laguna Beach, California.",
      "Usually, she logs into an online portal to withdraw enough from an account funded by a grant from the federal housing agency. But in February, she couldn't. Access had been temporarily cut off for many housing organizations as part of the Trump administration\u2019s cuts and funding freezes.",
      "\u201cThat was just a sea change for us for those dollars to be so immediately at risk,\u201d said Price, the executive director of Friendship Shelter, which started in 1987 as a community organization. Access was eventually restored but the episode took a toll.",
      "\u201cGovernment moves slowly usually, and I think what was so disorienting early on was government was moving really fast,\u201d she said.",
      "In the early days of his second term, President Donald Trump froze, cut or threatened to cut a huge range of social services programs from public safety to early childhood education to food assistance and services for refugee resettlement. Staffing cuts to federal agencies have also contributed to delays and uncertainty around future grant funds. Altogether, his policies are poised to upend decades of partnerships the federal government has built with nonprofits to help people in their communities.",
      "This vast and interconnected set of programs funded by taxpayers has been significantly dismantled in just months, nonprofit leaders, researchers and funders say. And even deeper, permanent cuts are still possible. That uncertainty is also taking a toll on their staff and communities, the leaders said.",
      "In response to questions about the cuts to grant funding, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said, \u201cInstead of government largesse that\u2019s often riddled with corruption, waste, fraud, and abuse, the Trump administration is focused on unleashing America\u2019s economic resurgence to fuel Americans\u2019 individual generosity.\u201d",
      "He pointed to a new deduction for charitable giving included in the recently passed tax and spending law that he said encourages Americans\u2019 \u201cinnate altruism.\u201d",
      "But experts say private donations will not be enough to meet the needs.",
      "In 2021, $267 billion was granted to nonprofits from all levels of government, according to an analysis by the Urban Institute published in February. While the data includes tax-exempt organizations like local food pantries as well as universities and nonprofit hospitals, it underestimates the total funding that nonprofits receive from the government. It includes grants, but not contracts for services nor reimbursements from programs like Medicare. It also excludes the smallest nonprofits, which file a different, abbreviated tax form.",
      "However, the figure does give a sense of the scale of the historic \u2014 and, until now, solid \u2014 relationship between the public sector and nonprofits over the last 50 years. Now, this system is at risk and leaders like Price say the cost of undoing it will be \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d",
      "The Urban Institute\u2019s analysis shows more than half of nonprofits in every state received government grants in 2021.",
      "In the vast majority of the country, the typical nonprofit would run a deficit without government funding. Only in two Congressional districts \u2014 one including parts of Orange County, California, and another in the suburbs west of Atlanta \u2014 would a typical nonprofit not be in the red if they lost all of their public grant funding, the analysis found.",
      "But in Orange County, famous for its stunning beaches, mansions and extraordinary wealth, funders, nonprofits and researchers said that finding surprised them. In part, that's because of major economic inequalities in the county and its high cost of living.",
      "Taryn Palumbo, executive director of Orange County Grantmakers, said nonprofits are not as optimistic about their resiliency.",
      "\u201cThey are seeing their budgets getting slashed by 50% or 40%,\u201d she said. \u201cOr they\u2019re having to look to restructure programs that they are running or how they\u2019re serving or the number of people that they\u2019re serving.\u201d",
      "Last year, the local Samueli Foundation commissioned a study of nonprofit needs in part because they were significantly increasing their grantmaking from $18.8 million in 2022 to an estimated $125 million in 2025. They found local nonprofits reported problems maintaining staff, a deep lack of investment in their operations and a dearth of flexible reserve funds.",

      "The foundation responded by opening applications for both unrestricted grants and to support investments in buildings or land. Against this $10 million in potential awards, they received 1,242 applications for more than $250 million, said Lindsey Spindle, the foundation\u2019s president.",
      "\u201cIt tells a really stark picture of how unbelievably deep and broad the need is,\u201d Spindle said. \u201cThere is not a single part of the nonprofit sector that has not responded to these funds. Every topic you can think of: poverty, animal welfare, arts and culture, civil rights, domestic abuse... They\u2019re telling us loud and clear that they are struggling to stay alive.\u201d",
      "One of the founding stories of the United States is the importance of the voluntary sector, of neighbors helping neighbors and of individuals solving social problems. While other liberal democracies built strong welfare states, the U.S. has preferred to look to the charitable sector to provide a substantial part of social services.",
      "Since the 1960s, the federal government has largely funded those social services by giving money to nonprofits, universities, hospitals and companies. Several new policies converged at that time to create this system, including the expansion of the federal income tax during World War II and the codification of tax-exempt charitable organizations in 1954. Then, the Kennedy and Johnson administrations started to fund nonprofits directly with federal money as part of urban renewal and Great Society programs.",
      "\u201cIt was a key approach of midcentury liberalism of addressing issues of poverty, sort of making a reference to civil rights and racial inequality, but not growing the size of government,\u201d said Claire Dunning, an assistant professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, College Park. Conservatives also tended to support working through local, private, nonprofit organizations, though for different reasons than liberals, she said.",
      "With various expansions and cuts during different presidencies, the federal government has continued to fund nonprofits at significant levels, essentially hiding the government in plain sight, Dunning said. The size and importance of the nonprofit apparatus became suddenly visible in January when the Trump administration sought to freeze federal grants and loans.",
      "Dunning said the speed, hostility and scale of the proposed cuts broke with the long legacy of bipartisan support for nonprofits.",
      "\u201cPeople had no idea that the public health information or services they are receiving, their Meals on Wheels program, their afterschool tutoring program, the local park cleanup were actually enabled by public government dollars,\u201d she said.",
      "A coalition of nonprofits challenged the freeze in court in a case that is ongoing, but in the six months since, the administration has cut, paused or discontinued a vast array of programs and grants. The impacts of some of those policy changes have been felt immediately, but many will not hit the ground until current grant funding runs out, which could be in months or years depending on the programs.",
      "Friendship Shelter in Laguna Beach has an annual budget of about $15 million, $11.5 million of which comes from government sources. Price said the government funding is \u201cbraided\u201d in complex ways to house and support 330 people. They've already lost a rental reimbursement grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. But the Samueli Foundation stepped in to backfill those lost funds for three years.",
      "That kind of support is extremely unusual, she said.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know of any large-scale private philanthropy response to keeping people housed because it\u2019s a forever commitment,\u201d Price said. \u201cThat person is in housing and is going to need the subsidy for the rest of their lives. These are seriously disabled people with multiple issues that they\u2019re facing that they need help with.\u201d",
      "She also believes that even in a wealthy place like Orange County, private donors are not prepared to give five, six or eight times as much as they do currently. Donors already subsidize their government grants, which she said pay for 69% of the actual program costs.",
      "\u201cWe are providing this service to our government at a loss, at a business loss, and then making up that loss with these Medicaid dollars and also the private fundraising,\u201d she said.",
      "She said her organization has discussed having to put people out of housing back on to the streets if the government funding is cut further.",
      "\u201cThat would be, I think, a signal to me that something is deeply, deeply wrong with how we\u2019re looking at these issues,\u201d said Price, adding, \u201cIf I was placing a bet, I would bet that we have enough good still in government to prevent that.\u201d",

      "When the KissCam at a Coldplay concert last week landed on a couple who suspiciously escaped their embrace and tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work",
      "NEW YORK -- When the \u201cKissCam\u201d at a Coldplay concert landed on a couple who tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work.",
      "In hours, the clip was just about everywhere. Endless memes, parody videos and photos of the pair's shocked faces filled social media feeds. Online sleuths rushed to identify who was on camera. Artificial intelligence and software company Astronomer eventually confirmed that its CEO and chief people officer were in fact the couple in the video \u2014 and announced the CEO's resignation over the weekend.",
      "The incident's fallout has, of course, generated conversations about business ethics, corporate accountability and the repercussions that conflicts of interest among leadership can cause. But there are also broader implications at play in our increasingly online world \u2014 about the state of potentially being visible everywhere you go or tracked through \u201csocial media surveillance.\" Experts say it's more and more common for moments that may have been intended to be private, or at least reserved to a single physical venue, to make their way online and even go global today.",
      "So in the era of lightning-fast social sharing and when cameras are practically inescapable, does being in public hold any expectation of privacy anymore? Is every experience simply fodder for the world to see?",
      "It's no secret that cameras are filming much of our lives these days.",
      "From CCTV security systems to Ring doorbells, businesses, schools and neighborhoods use ample video surveillance around the clock. Sporting and concert venues have also filmed fans for years, often projecting playful bits of audience participation to the rest of the crowd. In short, the on-scene viewer becomes part of the product \u2014 and the center of attention.",
      "And of course, consumers can record just about anything if they have a smartphone in their pocket \u2014 and, if it's enticing to other social media users, that footage can quickly spread through cyberspace.",
      "Ellis Cashmore, author of the book \u201cCelebrity Culture,\u201d proposes that the rapid fame of last week\u2019s KissCam moment probably answers a question many have been asking for years: \u201cIs the private life still what it was? And the answer is, of course, there\u2019s no such thing as the private life anymore,\u201d he notes. \u201cCertainly not in the traditional sense of the term.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure that we can assume privacy at a concert with hundreds of other people,\u201d adds Mary Angela Bock, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s School of Journalism and Media. \u201cWe can\u2019t assume privacy on the street anymore.\u201d",
      "Some version of the KissCam has long been a staple at big events \u2014 from timeouts during sports games to romantic songs played by artists at their concerts. It\u2019s easy to miss, but most venues have signs to inform the audience that they could be filmed during the event. What\u2019s been different in more recent years, experts note, is how quickly those moments can travel beyond the physical space where they actually unfold.",
      "That isn\u2019t only limited to what shows up on a jumbotron. Sometimes it only takes one person in the crowd to capture any interaction on their phone and post the video online \u2014 where it can zip around the world.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just the camera,\" Bock says. \u201cIt\u2019s the distribution system that is wild and new.\u201d",

The LinkedIn pages belonging both to Astronomer\u2019s now-former CEO and chief people officer remained disabled on Monday, and The Associated Press could not reach either for comment.",
      "But it isn't limited to company executives. Beyond someone simply spotting a familiar face and spreading the word, technological advances \u2014 including AI \u2014 have made it easier and faster overall to find just about anyone in an online post. This can happen with videos and photos shared on social media each day, even if it doesn't go viral, experts warn.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit unsettling how easily we can be identified with biometrics, how our faces are online, how social media can track us \u2014 and how the internet has gone from being a place of interaction, to a gigantic surveillance system,\" Bock says. \u201cWhen you think about it, we are being surveilled by our social media. They\u2019re tracking us in exchange for entertaining us.\u201d",
      "And of course, such moments can also impact people who were not actually on camera. As easy as it can be to be identified online today, the internet is notorious for cutting a broad swath or not always getting it right. That sometimes produces harassment of individuals not actually involved.",
      "At last week's Coldplay concert, for example, many social media users speculated that a third person seen near the two caught on camera was another Astronomer employee \u2014 leading to swarms of posts targeting her. But the company later confirmed that she was not at the event and said no other employees were in the video circulating online.",

Still, it\u2019s a \u201cvery frightening thing to get a lot of abuse and harassment online,\u201d Taylor notes. \u201cThere are real human beings behind this.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s hard to think that that these kind of viral moments will ever go away \u2014 and there are few legal restrictions to stop users from sharing clips of interactions recorded from anything from a concert to the street widely online. But on an individual level, Bock says it can be helpful to \u201cthink before you share\u201d and question whether something\u2019s really accurate.",
      "\u201cSocial media has changed so much,\u201d Bock says. \u201cBut we really have not, as a society, caught up with the technology in terms of our ethics and our etiquette.\u201d",

      "\"People are at very great risk of dying on the job already,\u201d Rebecca Reindel, the AFL-CIO union's occupational safety and health director, said. \u201cThis is something that is only going to make the problem worse.\u201d",
      "The proposed changes have several stages to get through before they can take effect, including a public comment period for each one.",
      "Here's a look at some of the rollbacks under consideration:",
      "Home health care workers help elderly or medically fragile people by preparing meals, administering medications, assisting with toilet use, accompanying clients to doctor appointments and performing other tasks. Under one of the Labor Department's proposals, an estimated 3.7 million workers employed by home care agencies could be paid below the federal minimum wage \u2014 currently $7.25 per hour \u2014 and made ineligible for overtime pay if they aren't covered by corresponding state laws.",
      "The proposed rule would reverse changes made in 2013 under former President Barack Obama and revert to a regulatory framework from 1975. The Labor Department says that by lowering labor and compliance costs, its revisions might expand the home care market and help keep frail individuals in their homes for longer.",
      "Judy Conti, director of government affairs at the National Employment Law Project, said her organization plans to work hard to defeat the proposal. Home health workers are subject to injuries from lifting clients, and \"before those (2013) regulations, it was very common for home care workers to work 50, 60 and maybe even more hours a week, without getting any overtime pay,\u201d Conti said.",
      "Others endorse the proposal, including the Independent Women\u2019s Forum, a conservative nonprofit based in Virginia. Women often bear the brunt of family caregiving responsibilities, so making home care more affordable would help women balance work and personal responsibilities, the group's president, Carrie Lukas, said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re pleased to see the Trump administration moving forward on rolling back some of what we saw as counterproductive micromanaging of relationships that were making it hard for people to get the care they need,\u201d Lukas said.",
      "Samantha Sanders, director of government affairs and advocacy at the nonprofit Economic Policy Institute, said the repeal would not constitute a win for women.",
      "\u201cSaying we actually don\u2019t think they need those protections would be pretty devastating to a workforce that performs really essential work and is very heavily dominated by women, and women of color in particular,\u201d Sanders said.",
      "Last year, the Labor Department finalized rules that provided protections to migrant farmworkers who held H-2A visas. The current administration says most of those rules placed unnecessary and costly requirements on employers.",

      "Debbie Berkowitz, who served as OSHA chief of staff during the Obama administration, said she thinks limiting the agency's enforcement authority would be a mistake.",

      "The parents of a man who died alone in a Colorado jail cell after an ulcer burned a hole in his digestive tract and left him in what they said was excruciating pain for about 15 hours have filed a federal lawsuit",
      "DENVER -- The parents of a man who died alone in a Colorado jail cell after an ulcer burned a hole in his digestive tract and left him in what they said was excruciating pain for about 15 hours filed a federal lawsuit Monday, accusing the jail's nurses and sheriff's deputes of ignoring his cries for help.",
      "The lawsuit blames them, local government officials and Southern Health Partners for failing to stop the death of Daniel Foard in 2023 by taking him to the hospital. Foard, 32, was a cook at a brewpub and user of fentanyl who was arrested for failing to appear in court. After being segregated and monitored for withdrawal from the synthetic opioid, he began vomiting and complained of stomach pain after being put in a regular jail cell, it said.",
      "The lawsuit alleges Southern Health Partners \u2014 the Tennessee-based company they contracted with to provide health care at the La Plata County jail \u2014 has tried to maximize its profits at the jail by only having one nurse on duty at a time, leaving it to medically untrained deputies to monitor sick inmates. The company holds hundred of contracts at jails around the country and the lawsuit alleges that is has been involved in lawsuits related to the deaths of at least five other jail inmates nationally.",
      "The company's lawyer, Shira Crittendon, said she had not seen the lawsuit and declined to comment on it.",
      "The sheriff's office referred questions about the the lawsuit to a county spokesperson. In a statement, the county said it had not analyzed the allegations in the lawsuit and does not comment publicly on active litigation.",
      "Foard was found dead in the jail on Aug. 17, 2023, six days after he was arrested.",
      "An autopsy found Foard died as a result of a hole created by an ulcer in his small intestine, which caused inflammation of the tissue lining his abdomen. Such ulcers can let food and digestive juices leak out of the body's digestive tract.",
      "Fentanyl was found in Foard's blood but the autopsy report did not name that as a cause of his death. Dr. Michael Arnall ruled Foard's death was due to natural causes.",
      "On Aug. 15, 2023, even though Foard had collapsed several times and had trouble standing, he was moved out of an area where he could be more easily observed for problems with his withdrawal and put into a regular jail cell, staggering as we went, the lawsuit said. The day nurse ignored a deputy's concern that he was very unstable, according to the lawsuit brought by lawyers Dan Weiss, Anna Holland Edwards, John Holland and Erica Grossman.",

She recorded that Foard reported he had sharp, shooting pain that was a \u201c10\u201d on a scale of one to 10, but she did not call for a doctor or send him to the hospital, it said.",
      "The nurse moved Foard to an empty cell where he could be monitored but didn't tell deputies what he was being monitored for and didn't order any follow up care or check on him, it said. He vomited all day and was moved to another cell and then a third because they had all become so messy with vomit, it said. Surveillance video showed him crawling to the final cell, where it said he continuously called out for help and yelled that he needed to go to a hospital, saying he was vomiting blood. The lawsuit claims that no one responded to his pleas but one deputy could be heard on surveillance video telling him to \u201ctry to hit that drain\u201d with his vomit to keep the cell from becoming dirty.",
      "Another nurse, working the evening shift, only walked by his cell and glanced inside, but did not assess him or provide care as he was pleading for help, the lawsuit said. When she did enter his cell around 10 p.m., Foard was dead, it said. She told state investigators that vomiting was normal for people withdrawing from fentanyl.",
      "The day shift nurse later told a state investigator that it was not unusual that Foard would not have had his vital signs checked for 12 hours because of the number of inmates the jail's nurses need to provide care, according to a report from an investigation by the Colorado Bureau of Investigations. She also said she didn't think there was anything different she could have done based on Foard's symptoms.",
      "The bureau's findings were forwarded to the 6th District Attorney's Office, which would decide whether any criminal charges were warranted in connection with Foard's death. It's not known whether the office decided to pursue any charges. A telephone message and email sent to District Attorney Sean Murray were not immediately returned.",

      "It has been five years since a $60 million bribery scheme funded by FirstEnergy Corp. came to light in Ohio with the stunning arrests ofa powerful Republican state lawmaker and four associates in July 2020",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Five years after a $60 million bribery scheme funded by FirstEnergy Corp. came to light in Ohio, expert observers say the resulting prosecutions, lawsuits, penalties and legislation haven't led to enough change and accountability to prevent politicians and corporate executives from cutting similar deals in the future.",
      "The scheme \u2014 whose prospective $2 billion-plus pricetag to consumers makes it the largest infrastructure scandal in U.S. history \u2014 surfaced with the stunning arrests of a powerful Republican state lawmaker and four associates on July 21, 2020.",
      "That lawmaker, former House Speaker Larry Householder, is serving 20 years in federal prison for masterminding the racketeering operation at the center of the scandal.",
      "Jurors agreed with prosecutors that money that changed hands wasn\u2019t everyday political giving, but an elaborate secret scheme orchestrated by Householder to elect political allies, become the House speaker, pass a $1 billion nuclear bailout law in House Bill 6 and crush a repeal effort. One of the dark money groups Householder used also pleaded guilty to racketeering.",
      "Householder and a former lobbyist have unsuccessfully challenged their convictions. Two of the arrested associates pleaded guilty, and the other died by suicide.",
      "Any hope that the convictions would have clarified federal law around 501(c)4 nonprofit \u201cdark money\u201d groups or prompted new restrictions on those hasn\u2019t materialized, said former U.S. Attorney David DeVillers, who led the initial investigation.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s actually worse than it was before,\u201d he said. \u201cNationally, you have both Democrats and Republicans using these, so there\u2019s no political will to do anything about it.\u201d",
      "Indeed, a study released in May by the Brennan Center for Justice found that dark money unleashed by the 2010 Citizens United decision hit a record high of $1.9 billion in 2024 federal races, nearly double the $1 billion spent in 2020. The vast majority of money from undisclosed donors raised into dark money accounts now goes to super PACs, providing them a way to skirt a requirement that they make their donors public, the study found.",
      "DeVillers said one positive result of the scandal is that Ohio lawmakers appear genuinely concerned about avoiding quid pro quos, real or perceived, between them and their political contributors.",
      "Anti-corruption legislation perennially introduced by Ohio Democrats since the scandal broke has gone nowhere in the GOP-dominated Legislature. Republican legislative leaders have said it is outside their authority to amend federal campaign finance law.",
      "The U.S. Attorney\u2019s office declined to discuss the investigation because prosecutions remain ongoing. Two fired FirstEnergy executives have pleaded not guilty on related state and federal charges and await trial.",

Shareholders won some accountability measures as part of a $180 million settlement in 2022, but they continue to fight in court for release of the investigation. Willis does, too.",

      "The portion of HB 6 that bailed out two FirstEnergy-affiliated nuclear plants was repealed in 2021, and $26 million was refunded to customers.",

It wasn\u2019t until April that a law was passed repealing those subsidies.",
      "Until that takes effect Aug. 14, the charges cost Ohio ratepayers $445,679 a day \u2014 and it\u2019s unclear if or when they\u2019ll get that money back. A ticker on Willis\u2019 website puts the total they\u2019ve paid at more than $500 million and counting.",

      "The recall covers a range of Bestway, Intex Recreation and Polygroup pools that were sold by major retailers as far back as 2002. According to Monday notices published by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and Health Canada, these pools have compression straps running along the outside of the product \u2014 which \u201cmay create a foothold\u201d for small children and allow them to access the water unattended.",

      "Consumers in possession of these pools are urged to immediately contact Bestway, Intex and/or Polygroup to receive a free repair kit \u2014 which will consist of a rope to replace the compression strap. Owners of these pools should otherwise ensure that small children cannot access the pool without supervision, regulators note \u2014 and could alternatively drain the pool until the repair is made.",

      "The play went down as an error for Narvaez, his sixth of the season, second-most among catchers in the majors. Narvaez also had a passed ball, his fifth, in the fourth inning that moved Nick Castellanos into scoring position after he drove in the Phillies\u2019 first run. Castellanos scored on J.T.

      "It\u2019s the Phillies\u2019 third walk-off win of the season. The first, against Washington on April 29, came on a wild pitch that allowed Bryson Stott to score. A walk-off on June 6 over the Chicago Cubs came via a Marsh single in the 11th.",

      "WASHINGTON -- NFLPA chief strategy officer JC Tretter is resigning from his position, three days after Lloyd Howell stepped down as executive director of the players\u2019 union.",
      "Tretter told CBS Sports on Sunday that he doesn\u2019t want to be considered for the NFLPA\u2019s interim executive director position and denied he played any role in undermining Howell\u2019s position.",

I have no interest in being considered. I\u2019ve let the executive committee know that. I\u2019m also going to leave the NFLPA in the coming days because I don\u2019t have anything left to give the organization.\u201d",
      "The 34-year-old Tretter, who played center for eight seasons with Green Bay and Cleveland through 2021, was the player president from 2020 to 2024. He served in his new role since October 2024.",
      "Howell resigned Thursday after two years because his leadership had become a distraction. Howell has come under scrutiny since ESPN reported he has maintained a part-time consulting job with the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm that holds league approval to seek minority ownership in NFL franchises.",
      "That followed the revelation that the NFLPA and the league had a confidentiality agreement to keep quiet an arbitrator\u2019s ruling about possible collusion by owners over quarterback salaries.",
      "The latest issue was an ESPN report Thursday that revealed two player representatives who voted for Howell were not aware that he was sued in 2011 for sexual discrimination and retaliation while he was a senior executive at Booz Allen.",
      "In 2023, a year after the NFLPA sued the owners for collusion, the NFL sued the union after Tretter suggested in an interview that running backs who were unhappy with their contracts could fake injuries, which would be a violation of the collective bargaining agreement.",

And I felt like I\u2019ve been kind of left in the wind taking shots for the best of the organization. ... And in the end, what\u2019s the organization done for me? Like, nothing.\u201d",

      "Chicago\u2019s Matt Shaw and Carson Kelly went deep off Noah Cameron (4-4) in the second, but the rookie lefthander was in control for most of the first six innings. He allowed all four Cubs runs and seven hits while striking out six to help the Royals win their second straight.",
      "Ben Brown (4-7), recalled earlier in the day from Triple-A Iowa, replaced opener Ryan Brasier in the second and gave up six earned runs and seven hits while striking out four over the next four innings. Caglianone had a solo shot off Brown in the second and Perez added a two-run homer in the fourth.",
      "Kansas City got RBI hits from Jonathan India and Bobby Witt Jr. to start a four-run fifth. The two scored on a throwing error and wild pitch, respectively.",
      "Rave homered in the seventh off Chris Flexen, who gave up Perez\u2019s two-run shot in a four-run eighth that ensured the Cubs\u2019 second straight loss. Relievers John Schreiber and Andrew Hoffman kept Chicago scoreless, and Witt and Rave each finished with a pair of RBIs.",
      "Shaw drove in three runs for the Cubs, who gave All-Star centerfielder Pete Crow-Armstrong the night off due to knee soreness.",
      "Witt made the most of his at-bat in the fifth inning. He drove in Kyle Isbel with a single to put the Royals in front for good, stole second and went to third on Kelly\u2019s errant pickoff throw, then scored on Brown\u2019s wild pitch for the final run of the inning.",

      "Venus Williams has competed at a tournament for the first time in more than a year \u2014 and in doubles for the first time in nearly three \u2014 and has come out with a victory",
      "WASHINGTON -- Competing at a tournament for the first time in more than a year, and in doubles for the first time in nearly three, Venus Williams hit a big serve on her initial delivery at the DC Open on Monday and, curiously, it was wiped out by a foot-fault call.",
      "The 45-year-old Williams, an owner of 21 Grand Slam titles across singles and doubles, smiled incredulously, as did the other three players involved in the match in front of a full crowd that eventually included NBA star Kevin Durant. And then Williams carried on, displaying her trademark power on some strokes while teaming with Hailey Baptiste for a 6-3, 6-1 victory against 2014 Wimbledon runner-up Eugenie Bouchard and Clervie Ngounoue.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just nice to be able to play. Where I am at this year is so much different where I was at last year. It\u2019s night and day, being able to be here and prepare for the tournament as opposed to preparing for surgery a year ago,\u201d said Williams, who spoke in an interview with NBC earlier this month about having a procedure to remove fibroids from her uterus. \u201cAt the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t really matter if your health is not there. So it definitely put it in perspective for me and maybe made it easier to make the decision to maybe come back out here and maybe play even freer.\u201d",
      "Her most recent match had been at the Miami Open in March 2024, and she said Sunday she had two goals in Washington: to have fun and to win.",
      "She did both \u2014 winning, yes, and contributing plenty to the cause, but also having a good time, high-fiving or fist-bumping Baptiste after some of their best points, laughing after others and waving to an appreciative group of fans that roared over and over for Williams. She and Baptiste hugged when it ended.",
      "\u201cThe crowd was insane. From the moment we stepped out of the players area, you could kind of feel the buzz. Walking onto the court, just felt all the love for the both of us,\u201d said Baptiste, a 23-year-old from Washington. \u201cI was obviously very nervous to play with her. I didn\u2019t want to let her down, first match back and everything.\"",
      "It was full at 3,000-seat John Harris Court, where Durant showed up late in the first set, while across the way at the 7,500-capacity main stadium, only a few dozen spectators were scattered in the stands for an all-American singles match in which Reilly Opelka defeated Murphy Cassone.",
      "Asked to comment about the court assignments, tournament director Daniel Vallverd\u00fa said: \u201cThe tournament works to balance full singles and doubles ATP and WTA schedules, while coordinating with broadcaster requests for court assignments.\u201d",
      "When Williams, wearing a white visor as she so often has, was introduced before participating in doubles for the first time since the 2022 U.S. Open \u2014 when her partner was younger sister Serena \u2014 the stadium announcer mentioned that Venus has \u201cone of the best serves in the history of the game,\u201d that she \u201cturned pro in the last century\u201d and \u201chas won everything.\u201d",

      "The more Scottie Scheffler keeps winning, the more comparisons there are to Tiger Woods",
      "PORTRUSH, Northern Ireland -- Another comparison between Tiger Woods and Scottie Scheffler surfaced during the final round of the British Open. This one wasn't about numbers or trophies, but a fist pump.",
      "And it was for par.",
      "Scheffler only needed one hour to expand his four-shot lead to seven shots with a steady diet of fairways and greens at Royal Portrush on Sunday, along with three birdie putts. But he missed his tee shot on the par-3 sixth and his chip was weak, leaving him a 15-foot par putt.",
      "Scheffler fiercely pumped his fist when it dropped, evoking memories of Woods and his 15-shot win at Pebble Beach in the 2000 U.S. Open.",
      "Woods had a 12-foot par putt on the 16th hole of that final round, and it was the most emotion he showed all day when he made it. He wanted a clean card and wound up going his final 26 holes bogey-free. Woods was so utterly dominant his only competition came from himself.",
      "That's how it felt with Scheffler when he won the claret jug for the third leg of the career Grand Slam at Royal Portrush.",
      "Scheffler went 32 holes without a bogey until he took two shots to get out of a fairway bunker on No. 8 and made double bogey. What stood out to Scheffler in his four-shot victory was the lack of bogeys, the DNA of his dominance.",
      "\u201cTo only have one double \u2014 really one one over-par hole in the last 36 holes of a major championship \u2014 that's how you're able to win these tournaments,\u201d he said.",
      "He won the British Open by four shots. He won the PGA Championship in May by five shots. He won by four in the 2024 Masters. Scheffler was five shots ahead on the final hole in his first Masters win in 2022 when he four-putted while simply trying to finish.",
      "There are plenty of numbers to consider, starting with his position at No. 1 in the world. No one has held it longer since Woods.",
      "Scheffler and Woods are the only players in the last 50 years to win two majors in the same year by at least four shots. Researchers with time on their hands at the PGA Tour discovered Scheffler and Woods each went 1,197 days between winning their first and fourth majors.",
      "Enough of the comparisons, Scheffler said.",
      "\u201cI still think they're a bit silly,\u201d he said. \u201cTiger won, what, 15 majors? This is my fourth. I just got one-fourth of the way there. I think Tiger stands alone in the game of golf. He was inspirational for me growing up. He was a very, very talented guy, and he was a special person to be able to be as good as he was at the game of golf.\u201d",
      "For majors alone, a better comparison would be with Rory McIlroy. He also won four majors in three years, including two of them in 2014. McIlroy won a U.S. Open and a PGA Championship by eight shots, the latter a record margin.",
      "And then he went 11 years without a major. Greatness in golf is also about longevity.",
      "Scheffler won for the fourth time this year and now has 20 victories worldwide. He has won 11 straight times with the 54-hole lead.",

He\u2019s just been killing it for over two years now.\u201d",
      "Any hesitation about comparisons \u2014 besides the 15-4 tally in majors, as Scheffler is quick to point out \u2014 is their style of play. Woods was as dynamic as he was relentless, especially with recovery shots. Scheffler doesn't have that many because he's rarely out of position.",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t focus on that kind of stuff,\u201d Scheffler said of the comparisons. \"That\u2019s not what motivates me. I\u2019m not motivated by winning championships. I don\u2019t look at the beginning of the year and just say, \u2018I want to win X amount of tournaments.\u2019 I don\u2019t do that.",
      "\u201cWhen I wake up to practice, what motivates me is getting to live out my dream,\u201d he said. \u201cI get to play professional golf, and I feel like I\u2019m called to do it to the best of my ability.\u201d",

      "The financial world is buzzing about tokenization, a process using blockchain to turn real-world assets like stocks or real estate into digital tokens",
      "As cryptocurrencies become more intertwined with the traditional financial system, industry heavyweights are racing for a long-sought goal of turning real-world assets into digital tokens.",
      "\u201cTokenization is going to open the door to a massive trading revolution,\u201d said Vlad Tenev, the CEO of the trading platform Robinhood at a recent James Bond-themed tokenization launch event in the south of France.",
      "Advocates say tokenization is the next leap forward in crypto and can help break down walls that have advantaged the wealthy and make trading cheaper, more transparent and more accessible for everyday investors.",
      "But critics say tokenization threatens to undermine a century\u2019s worth of securities law and investor protections that have made the U.S. financial system the envy of the world. And Robinhood\u2019s push into tokenizing shares of private companies quickly faced pushback from one of the world\u2019s most popular startups.",
      "The basic idea behind tokenization: Use blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrencies to create digital tokens as stand-ins for things like bonds, real estate or even fractional ownership of a piece of art and that can be traded like crypto by virtually anyone, anywhere at any time.",
      "The massive growth of stablecoins, which are a type of cryptocurrency typically bought and sold for $1, has helped fuel the appetite to tokenize other financial assets, crypto venture capitalist Katie Haun said on a recent podcast.",
      "She said tokenization will upend investing in ways similar to how streamers radically changed how people watch television.",
      "\u201cYou used to have to sit there on a Thursday night and watch Seinfeld,\u201d Haun said. \u201cYou tune in at a specific time, you don\u2019t get to choose your program, you couldn\u2019t be watching a program like Squid Games from Korea. Netflix was market-expanding. In the same way, I think the tokenization of real-world assets will be market expanding.\u201d",
      "Robinhood began offering tokenized stock trading of major U.S. public companies for its European customers earlier this month and gave away tokens to some customers meant to represent shares in OpenAI and SpaceX, two highly valued private companies.",
      "Several other firms are diving in. Crypto exchange Kraken also allows customers outside the U.S. to trade tokenized stocks while Coinbase has petitioned regulators to open the market to its U.S. customers. Wall Street giants BlackRock and Franklin Templeton currently offer tokenized money market funds. McKinsey projects that tokenized assets could reach $2 trillion by 2030.",
      "The push for tokenization comes at a heady time in crypto, an industry that\u2019s seen enormous growth from the creation and early development of bitcoin more than 15 years ago by libertarian-leaning computer enthusiasts to a growing acceptance in mainstream finance.",
      "The world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency is now regularly setting all-time highs \u2014 more than $123,000 on Monday \u2014 while other forms of crypto like stablecoins are exploding in use and the Trump administration has pledged to usher in what\u2019s been called the \u201cgolden age\u201d for digital assets.",
      "Lee Reiners, a lecturing fellow at Duke University, said the biggest winners in the push for tokenization could be a small handful of exchanges like Robinhood that see their trading volumes and influence spike.",
      "\u201cWhich is kind of ironic given the origins of crypto, which was to bypass intermediaries,\u201d Reiners said.",
      "Interest in tokenization has also gotten a boost thanks to the election of President Donald Trump, who has made enacting more crypto-friendly regulations a top priority of his administration and signed a new law regulating stablecoins on Friday.",
      "\u201cTokenization is an innovation and we at the SEC should be focused on how do we advance innovation at the marketplace,\u201d said Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins.",

    "story": [
      "As global temperatures rise under climate change, the bees responsible for pollinating many crops are under increasing stress and scientists are trying to understand how they are affected",
      "WILLIAMSPORT, Ohio -- Sweat covers Isaac Barnes\u2019s face under his beekeeper\u2019s veil as he hauls boxes of honeycomb from his hives to his truck. It's a workout in what feels like a sauna as the late-morning June temperatures rise.",
      "Though Barnes was hot, his bees were even hotter. Their body temperatures can be up to 27 degrees Fahrenheit (about 15 Celsius) higher than the air around them. As global temperatures rise under climate change, scientists are trying to better understand the effects on managed and wild bees as they pollinate crops, gather nectar, make honey and reproduce.",
      "They noticed flying bees gathering nectar avoided overheating on the hottest days by using fewer but harder wingbeats to keep their body temperature below dangerous levels, according to a study published last year. Scientists also say that bees \u2014 like people \u2014 may also cope by retreating to a cooler environment such as the shade or their nest.",
      "\u201cJust like we go into the shade, or we sweat or we might work less hard, bees actually do the exact same thing so they can avoid the heat,\u201d said Jon Harrison, an environmental physiologist at Arizona State University and one of the study\u2019s authors.",
      "But that means the bees aren't able to do what they normally do, said Kevin McCluney, a biology professor at Bowling Green State University.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not going out and getting more nectar. They\u2019re not mating. They\u2019re not doing the things that bees would otherwise do,\u201d McCluney said.",
      "Generally, most bees are heat-tolerant, but as the climate warms, some experts think their ability to fend off disease and gather food might become harder. And habitat loss, increased use of pesticides, diseases and lack of forage for both managed and wild bees are all listed as potential contributors to the global decline of bees and other pollinators.",
      "\u201cIf you're not well-fed, and your body is intoxicated with pesticides and you have lots of diseases in your body, you're going to be less heat-tolerant than if you were healthy,\u201d said Margarita L\u00f3pez-Uribe, a pollinator health expert at Pennsylvania State University.",
      "Earlier this year, preliminary results from the annual U.S. Beekeeping Survey found that beekeepers lost almost 56% of their managed colonies, the highest loss since the survey started in 2010.",
      "Almost all of the managed honeybee colonies in the U.S. are used to pollinate agricultural crops such as almonds, apples, cherries and blueberries. Fewer pollinators can lead to less pollination and potentially lower yields.",
      "\u201cIt's a very fragile system if you think about it,\u201d L\u00f3pez-Uribe said. \u201cBecause if something goes wrong, you have these super high-value crops that won\u2019t get enough bees for pollination.\u201d",
      "Back at Barnes' hives in Ohio, thousands of honeybees fly around as he gathers boxes to take back to his farm for honey production. Nearby, a couple of his bees land on milkweed flowers, a rare bit of plant diversity in an area dominated by corn and soybean fields.",
      "For Barnes, who operates Honeyrun Farm with his wife, Jayne, one of the challenges heat can pose to his 500 honeybee hives is fending off parasitic mites that threaten the bees. If temperatures get too hot, he can\u2019t apply formic acid, an organic chemical that kills the mites. If it\u2019s applied when it\u2019s too hot, the bees could die.",
      "Last year they lost almost a third of the 400 hives they sent to California to help pollinate commercial almond groves. Barnes thinks those hives may have been in poor health ahead of pollination because they were unable to ward off mites when it was hot months earlier.",

      "Sometimes the heat helps. Here in Ohio, Barnes' hives last summer produced a bumper crop of honey as they feasted on nearby soybean nectar as the plants bloomed in the heat. Still, the lack of diverse plants for bees to forage in an area dominated by corn and soybean fields isn't ideal.",
      "And even the native blooms are appearing erratically, Barnes said. In autumn, his bees search for food on goldenrod, but those blooms are appearing later. And even then, he has supplemented his hive with additional food to keep them healthy into the winter.",
      "\u201cEvery single plant that blooms is something that the bee can use,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cAnd every single plant is affected by climate change.\u201d",
      "It's only in the last decade that people have become aware of the magnitude of the pollinator decline globally, said Harrison, of Arizona State University. Data is limited on how much climate change and heat stress is contributing to pollinator decline.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a relatively new focus for biology,\" he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s super important, but it\u2019s not being studied a ton.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration's proposed budget would eliminate the research program that funds the USGS Bee Lab, which supports the inventory, monitoring and natural history of the nation\u2019s wild bees. Other grants for bee research are also in jeopardy.",
      "U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon said America\u2019s pollinators are in \u201cgrave danger,\u201d and he'll fight for the federal funding. Pollinators contribute to the health of the planet, the crops we grow and the food we eat, he said.",
      "\u201cRather than taking bold action to protect them, the Trump administration has proposed a reckless budget that would zero out funding for critical research aimed at saving important pollinators,\u201d he said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "Harrison said his research on this topic would come to a halt if cuts are made to his federal funding, and it would be more difficult in general for scientists to study the disappearance of bees and other pollinators and improve how they prevent these losses. Not being able to manage these pollinator deaths could cause the price of fruits, vegetables, nuts, coffee and chocolate to jump or become scarce.",
      "\u201cHopefully, even if such research is defunded in the U.S., such research will continue in Europe and China, preventing these extreme scenarios,\u201d said Harrison.",

      "MIAMI -- Elon Musk fought court cases on opposite coasts Monday, raising a question about the billionaire that could either speed his plan to put self-driving Teslas on U.S. roads or throw up a major roadblock: Can this wildly successful man who tends to exaggerate really be trusted?",
      "In Miami, a Tesla driver who has admitted he was wrong to reach for a dropped cell phone moments before a deadly accident, spoke of the danger of putting too much faith in Musk's technology \u2014 in this case his Autopilot program.",
      "\u201cI trusted the technology too much,\u201d said George McGee, who ran off the road and killed a woman out stargazing with her boyfriend. \u201cI believed that if the car saw something in front of it, it would provide a warning and apply the brakes.\u201d",
      "In unusual coincidence, regulators arguing an Oakland, California, case tried to pin exaggerated talk about the same Tesla technology at the center of a request to suspend the carmaker from being able to sell vehicles in the state.",
      "Musk's tendency to talk big \u2014 whether it's his cars, his rockets or his government costing-cutting efforts \u2014 have landed him in trouble with investors, regulators and courts before, but rarely at such a delicate moment.",
      "After his social media spat with President Donald Trump, Musk can no longer count on a light regulatory touch from Washington. Meanwhile, sales of his electric cars have plunged and so a hit to his safety reputation could threaten his next big project: rolling out driverless robotaxis \u2014 hundreds of thousands of them \u2014 in several U.S. cities by the end of next year.",
      "The Miami case holds other dangers, too. Lawyers for the family of the dead woman, Naibel Benavides Leon, recently convinced the judge overseeing the jury trial to allow them to argue for punitive damages. A car crash lawyer not involved in the case, but closely following it, said that could cost Tesla tens of millions of dollars, or possibly more.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen punitive damages go to the hundreds of millions, so that is the floor,\u201d said Miguel Custodio of Los Angeles-based Custodio & Dubey. \u201cIt is also a signal to other plaintiffs that they can also ask for punitive damages, and then the payments could start compounding.\u201d",
      "That Tesla has allowed the Miami case to proceed to trial is surprising. It has settled at least four deadly accidents involving Autopilot, including payments just last week to a Florida family of a Tesla driver. That said, Tesla was victorious in two other jury cases, both in California, that also sought to lay blame on its technology for crashes.",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the Miami case argue that Tesla\u2019s driver-assistance feature, called Autopilot, should have warned the driver and braked when his Model S sedan blew through flashing lights, a stop sign and a T-intersection at 62 miles-an-hour in an April 2019 crash. Tesla said that drivers are warned not to rely on Autopilot, or its more advanced Full Self-Driving system. It says the fault entirely lies with the \"distracted driver\" just like so many other \u201caccidents since cellphones were invented.\u201d",
      "Driver McGee settled a separate suit brought by the family of Benavides and her severely injured boyfriend, Dillon Angulo.",
      "McGee was clearly shaken when shown a dashcam video Monday of his car jumping a Key West, Florida, road and hitting a parked Chevrolet Tahoe which then slammed into Benavides and sent her 75 feet through the air to her death. Asked if he had seen those images before, McGee pinched his lips, shook his head, then squeaked out a response, \u201cNo.\u201d",

      "Tesla's attorney sought to show that McGee was fully to blame, asking if he had ever contacted Tesla for additional instructions about how Autopilot or any other safety features worked. McGee said he had not, though he was heavy user of the features. He said he had driven the same road home from work 30 or 40 times. Under questioning, he also acknowledged he alone was responsible for watching the road and hitting the brakes.",
      "Summarizing the testimony, Tesla said in a statement after the court adjourned that McGee had \"stated the simple truth that we all know: If he had just paid attention to the road instead of searching for his dropped cell phone and pressing the accelerator \u2014which he was doing for over a minute before the crash \u2014 this tragic accident would never have happened.\u201d",
      "But lawyers for the Benavides family had a chance in the courtroom at parrying that line of argument, asking McGee if he would have taken his eyes off the road and reached for his phone had he been driving any car other than a Tesla on Autopilot.",
      "McGee responded, \u201cI don\u2019t believe so.\u201d",
      "The case is expected to continue for two more weeks.",
      "In the California case, the state's Department of Motor Vehicles is arguing before an administrative judge that Tesla has misled drivers by exaggerating the capabilities of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features. A court filing claims even those feature names are misleading because they offer just partial self-driving",
      "Musk has been warned by federal regulators to stop making public comments suggesting Full Self-Driving allows his cars to drive themselves because it could lead to overreliance on the system, resulting in possible crashes and deaths. He also has run into trouble with regulators for Autopilot. In 2023, the company had to recall 2.3 million vehicles for problems with the technology and is now under investigation for saying it fixed the issue though it\u2019s unclear it has, according to regulatory documents.",

      "Players such as star wide receiver Garrett Wilson, cornerback Sauce Gardner and new quarterback Justin Fields reporting for the team's training camp Tuesday were arriving at the Jets' facility in Florham Park, New Jersey, to a fully renovated locker room with some state-of-the-art upgrades.",

      "The upgrades, which the team said had been in the works for a few years, came after a players poll released by the NFL Players Association in February gave the Jets a D-plus for their locker room, ranking 26th in the league. The team moved into its current facility in 2008. Woody Johnson received an F and was the lowest-ranked owner. The team received an overall ranking of 29th.",
      "\u201cWe take pride in having a first-class environment for the players,\" Robert Mastroddi, the Jets\u2019 senior vice president of security and facility operations, told the team\u2019s website. \"These upgrades will certainly provide more comfort, but they also will help with wellness, efficiency and ultimately performance.

      "The Jets, who have the NFL's longest active playoff drought at 14 seasons, have a new general manager in Darren Mougey and head coach in Aaron Glenn.

      "When the KissCam at a Coldplay concert last week landed on a couple who suspiciously escaped their embrace and tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work",
      "NEW YORK -- When the \u201cKissCam\u201d at a Coldplay concert landed on a couple who tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work.",
      "In hours, the clip was just about everywhere. Endless memes, parody videos and photos of the pair's shocked faces filled social media feeds. Online sleuths rushed to identify who was on camera. Artificial intelligence and software company Astronomer eventually confirmed that its CEO and chief people officer were in fact the couple in the video \u2014 and announced the CEO's resignation over the weekend.",
      "The incident's fallout has, of course, generated conversations about business ethics, corporate accountability and the repercussions that conflicts of interest among leadership can cause. But there are also broader implications at play in our increasingly online world \u2014 about the state of potentially being visible everywhere you go or tracked through \u201csocial media surveillance.\" Experts say it's more and more common for moments that may have been intended to be private, or at least reserved to a single physical venue, to make their way online and even go global today.",
      "So in the era of lightning-fast social sharing and when cameras are practically inescapable, does being in public hold any expectation of privacy anymore? Is every experience simply fodder for the world to see?",
      "It's no secret that cameras are filming much of our lives these days.",
      "From CCTV security systems to Ring doorbells, businesses, schools and neighborhoods use ample video surveillance around the clock. Sporting and concert venues have also filmed fans for years, often projecting playful bits of audience participation to the rest of the crowd. In short, the on-scene viewer becomes part of the product \u2014 and the center of attention.",
      "And of course, consumers can record just about anything if they have a smartphone in their pocket \u2014 and, if it's enticing to other social media users, that footage can quickly spread through cyberspace.",
      "Ellis Cashmore, author of the book \u201cCelebrity Culture,\u201d proposes that the rapid fame of last week\u2019s KissCam moment probably answers a question many have been asking for years: \u201cIs the private life still what it was? And the answer is, of course, there\u2019s no such thing as the private life anymore,\u201d he notes. \u201cCertainly not in the traditional sense of the term.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure that we can assume privacy at a concert with hundreds of other people,\u201d adds Mary Angela Bock, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s School of Journalism and Media. \u201cWe can\u2019t assume privacy on the street anymore.\u201d",
      "Some version of the KissCam has long been a staple at big events \u2014 from timeouts during sports games to romantic songs played by artists at their concerts. It\u2019s easy to miss, but most venues have signs to inform the audience that they could be filmed during the event. What\u2019s been different in more recent years, experts note, is how quickly those moments can travel beyond the physical space where they actually unfold.",
      "That isn\u2019t only limited to what shows up on a jumbotron. Sometimes it only takes one person in the crowd to capture any interaction on their phone and post the video online \u2014 where it can zip around the world.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just the camera,\" Bock says. \u201cIt\u2019s the distribution system that is wild and new.\u201d",

      "Then there's the second ring of exposure \u2014 what happens after the video or photos spread.",
      "Experts point to growing instances of social media users rushing to publicly identify, or dox, the people captured on camera \u2014 much like how quickly the internet committed to finding those involved in the Coldplay moment, for example. The LinkedIn pages belonging both to Astronomer\u2019s now-former CEO and chief people officer remained disabled on Monday, and The Associated Press could not reach either for comment.",
      "But it isn't limited to company executives. Beyond someone simply spotting a familiar face and spreading the word, technological advances \u2014 including AI \u2014 have made it easier and faster overall to find just about anyone in an online post. This can happen with videos and photos shared on social media each day, even if it doesn't go viral, experts warn.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit unsettling how easily we can be identified with biometrics, how our faces are online, how social media can track us \u2014 and how the internet has gone from being a place of interaction, to a gigantic surveillance system,\" Bock says. \u201cWhen you think about it, we are being surveilled by our social media. They\u2019re tracking us in exchange for entertaining us.\u201d",
      "And of course, such moments can also impact people who were not actually on camera. As easy as it can be to be identified online today, the internet is notorious for cutting a broad swath or not always getting it right. That sometimes produces harassment of individuals not actually involved.",
      "At last week's Coldplay concert, for example, many social media users speculated that a third person seen near the two caught on camera was another Astronomer employee \u2014 leading to swarms of posts targeting her. But the company later confirmed that she was not at the event and said no other employees were in the video circulating online.",
      "For the now-viral moment, \u201cwe can talk about what\u2019s right and wrong, and whether they deserved it,\u201d says Alison Taylor, a clinical associate professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business. Still, it\u2019s a \u201cvery frightening thing to get a lot of abuse and harassment online,\u201d Taylor notes. \u201cThere are real human beings behind this.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s hard to think that that these kind of viral moments will ever go away \u2014 and there are few legal restrictions to stop users from sharing clips of interactions recorded from anything from a concert to the street widely online. But on an individual level, Bock says it can be helpful to \u201cthink before you share\u201d and question whether something\u2019s really accurate.",
      "\u201cSocial media has changed so much,\u201d Bock says. \u201cBut we really have not, as a society, caught up with the technology in terms of our ethics and our etiquette.\u201d",

      "Cleaning your electronic devices is essential for hygiene and performance",
      "LONDON -- Smartphones, laptops, headphones and other electronic devices are essential for work and play in our daily lives. But all that time spent typing, scrolling or listening also means our devices gradually accumulate grime that needs to be cleaned off.",
      "You might not give much thought to cleaning your devices but there are reasons you should, says Logitech, which makes keyboards, webcams and other computer peripherals.",
      "\u201cRegular cleaning and proper maintenance not only keeps your gadgets looking pristine, and wins you hygiene points, it also helps them perform better and last longer,\u201d the company says. \u201cIn the case of devices like earbuds, the accumulated bacteria and debris may even cause health issues or discomfort.\u201d",
      "Here are some pointers on cleaning your tech:",
      "Always check if the manufacturer has any specific guidelines for cleaning.",
      "Assemble some basic equipment and material for cleaning, which should include a soft and lint-free cleaning cloth, like a microfiber cloth; cotton swabs; a soft-bristled brush like a toothbrush, paintbrush or makeup brush; compressed air and isopropyl alcohol.",
      "Isopropyl, or rubbing alcohol, is a non-toxic cleaning solvent that\u2019s antiseptic and antibacterial. It's popular for cleaning electronics because it doesn\u2019t leave any residue and dries quickly. But you might want to wear gloves to avoid skin irritation. Drip some of it on a cloth instead of pouring it directly onto your device. Also heed some of the more specific warnings below.",
      "Water and mild soap can be useful for cleaning dirty surfaces, but isopropyl alcohol is recommended for cleaning the internals of a device, said Alex Diaz-Kokaisl, senior technical writer at electronics repair company iFixit.",
      "\u201cWhile there isn\u2019t a hard-and-fast rule for cleaning electronics, we generally use high-concentration isopropyl alcohol (more than 90%) because it evaporates quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cThe faster a liquid evaporates, the less likely it is to affect any components that conduct electricity.\u201d",
      "For whatever device you're cleaning, disconnect or power it off first. Remove any cases, plugs, covers and accessories.",
      "When using a computer, the keyboard and mouse are the parts that are touched most often and therefore need the most frequent cleaning. And all those crevices between a keyboard's keys are sure to catch crumbs.",
      "To remove any loose debris, iFixit's official in-house cleaning guide recommends using a can of compressed air. Run the spray back and forth across the keys to blow out any bits. If possible, hold the keyboard upside down so the debris falls out.",
      "If you don\u2019t have compressed air, Logitech suggests using a hair dryer on the cold air setting. Some social media users also recommend a handheld balloon pump.",
      "Next, dampen a cleaning cloth with water and gently wipe down the keyboard and mouse.",
      "Logitech says you can also use rubbing alcohol but recommends you test it first on an inconspicuous spot to make sure it doesn't cause discoloration or scrub the lettering off the keys.",
      "Anti-bacterial baby wipes can also work on devices like a mouse, Diaz-Kokaisl said.",

      "Officials said Thursday they had received no reports of injuries or major damage from the latest event, which triggered a tsunami warning that lasted about an hour before being downgraded and prompted communities along a 700-mile (1,127-km) stretch of Alaska\u2019s southern coast to urge people to move to higher ground. The official maximum wave height at Sand Point, a community 55 miles (88 kilometers) north of the epicenter, was about 3.9 inches (10 centimeters), said Kara Sterling, a lead duty scientist at the National Tsunami Warning Center. It occurred at low tide.",
      "The earthquake struck at 12:37 p.m. local time, prompting the center's tsunami warning.",
      "There are a number of ways people in warning areas can receive notifications, including the sounding of sirens in communities that have them, listening to weather radio or public radio broadcasts, following official accounts on social media, or via push alerts on cellphones. In some places, local officials have relayed warnings door to door, said Jeremy Zidek, a spokesperson with the state's emergency management division.",
      "Public safety departments in King Cove and Unalaska sent alerts urging those in coastal areas or those that could see inundation to seek higher ground.",
      "The warning issued by the center was downgraded to an advisory before being canceled around 2:45 p.m.",
      "Alaska is the most earthquake-prone state in the U.S. and one of the most seismically active regions in the world, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The state experiences a magnitude 7 earthquake almost annually, and the second-largest earthquake ever recorded was centered about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of Anchorage, the agency said. That 1964 magnitude 9.2 earthquake \u2014 and the tsunami it triggered \u2014 killed about 130 people.",
      "The Aleutian arc is no stranger to earthquakes, but the activity in the region where Wednesday's earthquake struck has gotten scientists' attention. The area, within a few hundred miles of the earthquake, has \u201clit up\u201d since 2020, with Wednesday's earthquake marking the fifth exceeding magnitude 7.0 since 2020, said state seismologist Michael West.",

      "\u201cThat area of Alaska, most areas of Alaska, it gets steep real quick,\u201d he said.",
      "Sometimes, the only warning one might have is the shaking ground, Zidek said. \u201cIf it shakes violently for 20 seconds or more, that is your warning sign, and you should head to higher ground if you\u2019re in a coastal area,\u201d he said.",
      "Zidek and West said people should continue to heed warnings. West said he worries about a \u201cburnout effect\u201d among residents in the region, some of whom have evacuated numerous times since 2018 in response to larger earthquakes that have not caused significant damage.",
      "West said he is reminded of a magnitude 8.6 earthquake in 1946 \u2014 west of the location of Wednesday's quake \u2014 that generated a deadly tsunami and led to the creation of a U.S. tsunami warning system. The death toll included more than 150 people in Hawaii, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The Trump administration revoked federal funding for California's high-speed rail project on Wednesday, intensifying uncertainty about how the state will make good on its long-delayed promise of building a bullet train to shuttle riders between San Francisco and Los Angeles.",
      "The U.S. Transportation Department announced it was pulling back $4 billion in funding for the project, weeks after signaling it would do so. Overall, a little less than a quarter of the project's funding has come from the federal government. The rest has come from the state, mainly through a voter-approved bond and money from its cap-and-trade program.",
      "President Donald Trump and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy both have slammed the project as a \u201ctrain to nowhere.\"",
      "\u201cThe Railroad we were promised still does not exist, and never will,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"This project was Severely Overpriced, Overregulated, and NEVER DELIVERED.\u201d",
      "The loss marks the latest blow to California by the Trump administration, which has blocked a first-in-the-nation rule to phase out the sale of new gas-powered cars, launched investigations into university admission policies and threatened to pull funding over transgender girls being allowed to compete in girls sports.",
      "It also comes as rail project leaders are seeking private investment to help pay for its estimated price tag of more than $100 billion.",
      "Voters first approved the project in 2008 and it was supposed to be operating this decade. But cost estimates have consistently grown and its timeline pushed back.",
      "State officials are now focused on building a 119-mile (192-kilometer) stretch connecting the Central Valley cities of Bakersfield and Merced that is set to be operating by 2033. The California High Speed Rail Authority is slated to release a report this summer to state lawmakers with an updated funding plan and timeline for the project.",
      "Authority officials wrote in a letter earlier this month that the Trump administration made up its mind about revoking funding before thoroughly reviewing the project.

      "The program sets a declining limit on the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions large emitters can release. Those polluters can buy allowances from the state needed to pollute, and about 45% of that money goes into what's known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, according to the Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee, a group of experts that reviews the program.",

      "\u201cWe think it\u2019s too important to entrust to any one sector, the private sector or even the government sector,\u201d said Daniel Zingale, the convener of OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit commission and a former adviser to three California governors. \u201cThe nonprofit model allows for what we call a common sector,\u201d that facilitates democratic participation.",
      "The recommendations are not binding on OpenAI, but the advisory commission, which includes the labor organizer Dolores Huerta, offers a framework that may be used to judge OpenAI in the future, whether or not they adopt it.",
      "In the commission's view, communities that are already feeling the impacts of AI technologies should have input on how they are developed, including how data about them is used. But there are currently few avenues for people to influence tech companies who control much of the development of AI.",
      "OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, started in 2015 as a nonprofit research laboratory and has since incorporated a for-profit company with a valuation that has grown to $300 billion. The company has tried to change its structure since the nonprofit board ousted its CEO Sam Altman in Nov. 2023. He was reinstated days later and continues to lead OpenAI.",
      "It has run into hurdles escaping its nonprofit roots, including scrutiny from the attorney generals in California and Delaware, who have oversight of nonprofits, and a lawsuit by Elon Musk, an early donor to and founder of OpenAI.",
      "Most recently, OpenAI has said it will turn its for-profit company into a public benefit corporation, which must balance the interests of shareholders and its mission. Its nonprofit will hold shares in that new corporation, but OpenAI has not said how much.",
      "Zingale said Huerta told the commission their challenge was to help make sure AI is a blessing and not a curse. To grapple with those stakes, they envision a nonprofit with an expansive mandate to help everyone participate in the development and trajectory of AI.",
      "\u201cThe measure of this nonprofit will be in what it builds, who it includes, and how faithfully it endures to mission and impact,\" they wrote.",
      "The commission toured California communities and solicited feedback online. They heard that many were inspired by OpenAI\u2019s mission to create artificial intelligence to benefit humanity and ensure those benefits are felt widely and evenly.",

      "At Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, a half-dozen workers are making what appear to be gray billiard balls",
      "OAK RIDGE, Tenn. -- Near signs that warn of radioactive risk at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a half-dozen workers from the nuclear power company X-energy are making what appear to be gray billiard balls. Inside, they're packed with thousands of tiny black spheres that each contain a speck of uranium enriched beyond what today\u2019s power plants use.",
      "The United States is chasing a new age of nuclear power that banks on domestic production of reactor fuel like X-energy is making, and though the work at Oak Ridge is unfolding across just 3,000 square feet, X-energy and others are already revving up for big production.",
      "President Donald Trump set a goal of quadrupling domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, signing executive orders in May to speed up development. A new wave of advanced nuclear reactors could be operational around 2030.",
      "But just like cars won\u2019t run without gas, those plants won\u2019t run without fuel. To expand nuclear energy long-term, the nation must maximize its nuclear fuel production, according to Trump.",
      "In Oak Ridge, X-energy has broken ground on a massive, nearly $2 billion campus for a new fuel fabrication facility, the first in the United States in over half a century. The nuclear fuel company Standard Nuclear, also in Oak Ridge, aims to produce metric tons of fuel for advanced reactors. A supplier named Orano is likewise looking to build a multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment facility nearby.",
      "\u201cThis is a unique time,\u201d said Tyler Gerczak, Oak Ridge National Laboratory\u2019s principal investigator for the cooperative with X-energy\u2019s subsidiary TRISO-X. \u201cThe momentum is incredible.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press toured the lab where X-energy is making small amounts of fuel for testing. Anyone beyond a magenta-and-yellow chain that warns of radioactivity must wear gowns, two layers of gloves and radiation monitors. When they leave, they're tested for radioactivity.",
      "X-energy, a Maryland-based company, uses uranium to make so-called TRISO fuel \u2014 inside what's known as \u201cpebbles.\u201d Those are the billiard balls. The Energy Department says it's the most robust nuclear fuel on Earth because the particles cannot melt in a reactor.",
      "At the lab, the first step is making a uranium cocktail that resembles dark yellow lemonade.",
      "Uranium powder, in the form of triuranium octoxide, gets added to nitric acid, said Dan Brown, vice president of fuel development for TRISO-X. Then carbon and an organic solution are added. They have two glass containers set up \u2014 one wears a heated jacket, looking almost like a little sweater, that helps the uranium dissolve into the acid solution. The second cools the acid solution while the carbon source is added, which turns the mix near-black, he said.",
      "At another station, in a long clear tube, the cocktail solidifies into small black spheres with a jellybean-like consistency. Those black balls, about the size of poppyseeds, then travel through machines under temperatures as high as 1,800 degrees Celsius to get protective carbon coatings \u2014 like candy dipping \u2014 that make them look like very tiny BBs.",
      "X-energy uses graphite and other cohesive materials to bind 18,000 kernels together into a larger sphere. That gets coated in a final layer of graphite to seal the final pebble. In the end, it\u2019s strong enough to withstand the weight of an SUV.",
      "The pebbles will eventually give up their energy in the high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor X-energy is developing, with about 220,000 pebbles per reactor, like gumballs in a gumball machine. When they exit the bottom, if energy remains, the pebbles will return to the top for another pass. Each one could be used about six times. X-energy also plans to make fuel products for other advanced reactor designs.",
      "The national laboratory lends X-energy its expertise, research and high-tech equipment for analysis and will evaluate samples, as will some universities. Other samples are archived. Idaho National Laboratory received a batch for its advanced test reactor, Brown said.",
      "Critics of building more nuclear reactors say they\u2019re too expensive and riskier than other low-carbon energy sources.",
      "\u201cWithout a substantial decrease in construction costs, it\u2019s not worth the avoided greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d said David Kemp, a Cato Institute policy analyst.",

      "Kemp said Trump's 25-year quadrupling goal is unrealistic because it would mean building nuclear reactors faster than ever. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two, at a Georgia nuclear plant, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget.",
      "Many next-generation reactors will use high-assay low-enriched uranium. It's fuel that's enriched to a higher level than traditional large nuclear reactors use, allowing the newer reactors to run longer and more efficiently, sit on smaller footprints and produce less waste, according to the Department of Energy.",
      "There\u2019s little of it made in the United States right now.",
      "Only Russia and China currently have the infrastructure to make large amounts of high-assay low-enriched uranium. In the United States, Centrus Energy produced the nation\u2019s first 20 kilograms of high-assay low-enriched uranium in more than 70 years in late 2023, to show it can produce limited quantities for commercial reactors.",
      "A big takeaway from Trump's executive orders is the need to \u201camp up\u201d domestic production of nuclear fuel to reduce dependence on foreign sources and enable in the long term expansion of American nuclear energy, according to the Energy Department.",
      "At the Nuclear Energy Institute trade association, Benjamin Holtzman, director of new nuclear, said he thinks the fuel will be ready for a new generation of U.S. nuclear reactors needed to meet the growing demand for electricity \u2014 if the right actions are taken now.",
      "X-energy CEO J. Clay Sell said he hopes to help solve the fuel problem so it doesn\u2019t hold back new reactor development. The Energy Department has awarded funding to X-energy. Amazon invested in X-energy too, and they\u2019re collaborating to bring more than 5 gigawatts of new U.S. power projects online by 2039.",
      "X-energy is the only one with an application before the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to license a new fabrication facility to transform enriched uranium into fuel products for nuclear reactors. Another applicant has asked to amend an existing license to make fuel for advanced reactors, according to the NRC. About five additional companies have told the NRC they are interested in making fuel for advanced reactors.",
      "X-energy's pilot lab at the National Laboratory started in 2016. The company now has 100 acres in Oak Ridge and growing for its nuclear fuel production complex.",
      "The first factory could be operational by late 2027 or early 2028, capable at full operation of assembling enough fuel orbs to power 11 of its new-age reactors; a second by late 2029, with a capacity four times greater, said TRISO-X President Joel Duling.",

The funders believe there are many ideas for how AI technologies could help match people with resources after a disaster or an eviction, for example, or help a parole officer close out more cases for people who have met all of the criteria but are waiting for the paperwork to be processed.",
      "\u201cAs we traded notes on where we were making investments and where we saw broader gaps in the sector, it was readily apparent that there was a real opportunity to come together as a group of cofunders and cofounders to establish a new kind of investment organization,\u201d said Kevin Bromer, who leads the technology and data strategy at Ballmer Group.

      "\"President Trump has told us to release all credible evidence. If Ghislane Maxwell has information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims, the FBI and the DOJ will hear what she has to say,\" Blanche said in the statement posted by Bondi on X.",
      "Blanche also said that the joint statement from the Justice Department and FBI on July 6 -- which stated they would not release any additional files on Epstein and that they determined there was no Epstein \"client list\" -- \"remains as accurate today as it was when it was written.\"",
      "\"Namely, that in the recent thorough review of the files maintained by the FBI in the Epstein case, no evidence was uncovered that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties,\" Blanche said.",
      "He added that up \"until now, no administration on behalf of the Department had inquired about her willingness to meet with the government.\"",
      "The statement comes as a growing chorus of lawmakers have called for Maxwell to testify about her relationship with Epstein, and while the department is actively opposing Maxwell's efforts to appeal her conviction for conspiring with and aiding Epstein in his sexual abuse of underage girls.",
      "David Oscar Markus, the appellate counsel for Maxwell, confirmed to ABC News that they are in talks with the government.",

      "San Francisco is set to ban homeless people from living in RVs with a new citywide parking limit of two hours on large vehicles",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- San Francisco is set to ban homeless people from living in RVs by adopting strict new parking limits the mayor says are necessary to keep sidewalks clear and prevent trash build-up.",
      "The policy, up for final approval by San Francisco supervisors Tuesday, targets at least 400 recreational vehicles in the city of 800,000 people. The RVs serve as shelter for people who can't afford housing, including immigrant families with kids.",
      "Those who live in them say they're a necessary option in an expensive city where affordable apartments are impossible to find. But Mayor Daniel Lurie and other supporters of the policy say motor homes are not suitable for long-term living and the city has a duty to both provide shelter to those in need and clean up the streets.",
      "\u201cWe absolutely want to serve those families, those who are in crisis across San Francisco,\u201d said Kunal Modi, who advises the mayor on health, homelessness and family services. \u201cWe feel the responsibility to help them get to a stable solution. And at the same time, we want to make sure that that stability is somewhere indoors and not exposed in the public roadway.\u201d",
      "Critics of the plan, however, say that it's cruel to force people to give up their only home in exchange for a shot at traditional housing when there is not nearly enough units for all the people who need help; the mayor is only offering additional money to help 65 households.",
      "Jennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness, says city officials are woefully behind on establishing details of an accompanying permit program, which will exempt RV residents from parking limits so long as they are working with homeless outreach staff to find housing.",
      "\u201cI think that there\u2019s going to be people who lose their RVs. I think there\u2019s going to be people who are able to get into shelter, but at the expense\" of people with higher needs, like those sleeping on a sidewalk, she said.",
      "San Francisco, like other U.S. cities, has seen an explosion in recent years of people living out of vehicles and RVs as the cost of living has risen. Banning oversized vehicles is part of Lurie's pledge to clean up San Francisco streets, and part of a growing trend to require homeless people to accept offers of shelter or risk arrest or tows.",
      "The proposal sets a two-hour parking limit citywide for all RVs and oversized vehicles longer than 22 feet (7 meters) or higher than 7 feet (2 meters), regardless of whether they are being used as housing.",
      "Under the accompanying permit program, RV residents registered with the city as of May are exempt from the parking limits. In exchange, they must accept the city's offer of temporary or longer-term housing, and get rid of their RV when it's time to move. The city has budgeted more than half a million dollars to buy RVs from residents at $175 per foot.",
      "The permits will last for six months. People in RVs who arrive after May will not be eligible for the permit program and must abide by the two-hour rule, which makes it impossible for a family in an RV to live within city limits.",
      "It first cleared the Board of Supervisors last week with two of 11 supervisors voting \u201cno.\u201d",
      "Carlos Perez, 55, was among RV residents who told supervisors at a hearing this month that they could not afford the city's high rents. Perez works full-time as a produce deliveryman and supports his brother, who lives with him and is unable to work due to a disability.",

      "Yet, Perez also loves where he lives. The green-colored RV is decorated with a homey houseplant and has a sink and a tiny stove on which Carlos simmered a bean soup on a recent afternoon.",
      "He's lived in San Francisco for more than 30 years, roughly a decade of which has been in the RV in the working-class Bayview neighborhood. He can walk to work and it is close to the hospital where his brother receives dialysis multiple times a week.",
      "Zach, another RV resident who requested being identified by his first name to not jeopardize his ability to get work, started living in the vehicle a dozen years ago after realizing that no matter how hard he worked, he still struggled to pay rent.",
      "Now he works as a ride-hail driver and pursues his love of photography. He parks near Lake Merced in the city near the Pacific Ocean and pays $35 every two to four weeks to properly dispose of waste and fill the vehicle with fresh water.",
      "He says Lurie's plan is short-sighted. There is not enough housing available and many prefer to live in an RV over staying at a shelter, which may have restrictive rules. For Zach, who is able-bodied, maintains a clean space and has no dependents, moving to a shelter would be a step down, he says. Still, he expects to receive a permit.",
      "\u201cIf housing were affordable, there is a very good chance I wouldn\u2019t be out here,\u201d he said.",
      "RV dwellers say San Francisco should open a safe parking lot where residents could empty trash and access electricity. But city officials shuttered an RV lot in April, saying it cost about $4 million a year to service three dozen large vehicles and it failed to transition people to more stable housing.",
      "The mayor's new proposal comes with more money for beefed-up RV parking enforcement \u2014 but also an additional $11 million, largely for a small number of households to move to subsidized housing for a few years.",
      "Officials acknowledge that may not be sufficient to house all RV dwellers, but notes that the city also has hotel vouchers and other housing subsidies.",
      "Erica Kisch, CEO of nonprofit Compass Family Services, which assists homeless families, says they do not support the punitive nature of the proposal but are grateful for the extra resources.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s recognition that households should not be living in vehicles, that we need to do better for families, and for seniors and for anyone else who's living in a vehicle,\" she said. \u201cSan Francisco can do better, certainly.\u201d",

      "Two weeks after deadly floods swept through Texas, officials dropped the number of still-missing people in the hardest-hit area to three \u2014 down from nearly 160 in the days following the July Fourth weekend floods",
      "DALLAS -- Texas officials labored to account for more than 160 people originally reported missing along the Guadalupe River after the deadly July Fourth floods before ultimately concluding that most were safe and only three individuals still haven't been found, the top executive in the hardest-hit county said Monday.",
      "\u201cMost of them were tourists that came into town and left and went back home and didn\u2019t report that they were there,\u201d Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly said at a special meeting of the county commissioner court. He called the process a \u201cHerculean effort.\"",
      "The flash floods killed at least 135 people in Texas, and most of the deaths were in Kerr County, where destructive, fast-moving water rose 26 feet (8 meters) on the Guadalupe River, washing away buildings and vehicles in the area about 60 miles (100 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio.",
      "The sharp revision in the number of missing by Kerr County officials on Saturday followed a familiar pattern in the often chaotic aftermath of large-scale disasters. Hundreds of people were reported missing in the initial days after the floods through a phone hotline and email address, which launched investigators on an \u201cexhaustive effort\u201d to verify the status of each of those individuals, Kerrville police spokesperson Jonathan Lamb said.",
      "\u201cWe understand how critical it is to report this information accurately \u2014 not only for the families affected but for the integrity of our emergency response as a whole,\u201d Lamb said.",
      "Drastic changes in the missing count after a disaster aren\u2019t unusual.",
      "For instance, the death count from the 2023 Maui fire was eventually found to be just over 100 \u2014 far below the 1,100 initially feared missing.",
      "In 2017, a wildfire in Northern California\u2019s wine country killed more than 20 people, but most of the 100 people initially reported missing were located safe.",
      "The 2018 wildfire that largely destroyed the California town of Paradise ended up killing nearly 100 people, though Butte County investigators at one point had the names of more than 3,000 people who were not accounted for in the early days of the disaster. The names were whittled down when the list was published in the local paper, and many people realized for the first time that officials were looking for them.",
      "Texas\u2019 Hill Country is a popular tourist destination, where campers seek out spots along the Guadalupe River amid the rolling landscapes.",

      "The flooding was far more severe than the 100-year event envisioned by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, experts said, and it moved so quickly in the middle of the night that it caught many off guard in Kerr County, which lacked a warning system.",
      "At a July 14 news conference, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott had lowered the number of still-missing in the state to about 100 and suggested that pinning down that number was difficult. In the days after the floods, officials had put the number of missing at about 170 statewide with all but about 10 coming from Kerr County alone.",
      "Campers, residents or people who registered at RV parks or hotels are easier to account for, Abbott said. Others may have been reported missing by a friend, family member or coworker.",
      "In Travis County, which includes Austin, the floods killed at least 10 people. The sheriff\u2019s office has said one person remains on their missing list but may be removed if they can verify sightings of the person.",

      "A New York horse carriage driver has been acquitted of animal cruelty",
      "NEW YORK -- A horse carriage driver was acquitted Monday of animal cruelty in a modern trial about the old-fashioned coaches that meander through New York's Central Park.",
      "A six-person jury found Ian McKeever not guilty of overworking a horse called Ryder, who collapsed en route back to his stable on an 84-degree Fahrenheit (29-degree Celsius) day in August 2022. The horse lay on an avenue near Times Square for nearly an hour as concerned bystanders gathered around and police cooled him with a hose and ice. The animal ultimately got up, to cheers.",
      "McKeever had pleaded not guilty to the misdemeanor charge. His attorney, Raymond Loving, said the horse wasn't overtaxed and simply tripped while changing lanes on a Manhattan street.",
      "\u201cThe verdict was very gratifying. This has been an ordeal for him,\u201d Loving said by phone, adding that \u201cthe evidence just didn\u2019t support the charge.\u201d",
      "Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said in a statement that prosecutors presented \u201ca thorough case based on the facts and evidence.\u201d",
      "Featured in countless movies and TV shows, New York's horse carriages are popular with visitors and people celebrating special occasions. But animal rights advocates have long tried to get the coaches banned, and the issue became a prominent, celebrity-studded local political debate for a time about a decade ago.",
      "Anti-coach activists question the horses' treatment and contend that Manhattan streets are no place for equines, pointing to some collisions and collapses over the years. Enthusiasts say the carriages are a time-honored tourist draw that employs several hundred drivers and creates a role for surplus farm and race horses that might otherwise be slaughtered.",
      "McKeever, an Irish immigrant, has been a carriage driver for decades. His brother owned Ryder.",
      "A horse-carriage-industry veterinarian, Dr. Camilo Sierra, told jurors he estimated Ryder's age at 28 to 30, eventually settling on 26 \u2014 the maximum age at which carriage-pullers can legally work. Police Sgt. Vincent Fontana testified that McKeever told him the horse was 13.",
      "Ryder was outside for over seven hours on Aug. 10, 2022, mostly in Central Park, taking passengers on two trips over the course of the day.",
      "Passerby Caroline Londahl-Smidt testified that she worried after noticing his prominent ribs and seeing him seem to struggle up a hill, with McKeever shaking the reins in an apparent effort to hurry the horse along.",

      "After Ryder left the park and collapsed, bystander video published by the New York Post showed McKeever snapping the reins at him and telling him to get up.",
      "McKeever's lawyer maintained that Ryder wasn't overheated or mistreated, and that the driver acted responsibly. McKeever, 56, testified that he strove to get the animal to stand because prolonged reclining can cause health problems for equines.",
      "Ryder\u2019s temperature was normal and his breathing rate was slightly elevated when Fontana measured it, after the horse had been hosed down for some time. Later that evening at the stable, Sierra found Ryder alert, with normal vital signs, but he noted the underweight horse walked weakly. The veterinarian said he believed the animal had a neurological problem.",
      "Two months after the collapse, an ailing Ryder was euthanized. A necropsy showed he had bone cancer.",
      "Carriage drivers' union shop steward Christina Hansen said Monday that the union has since taken steps, including improving access to a horse hospital. Drivers \"enter this line of work because we love animals,\u201d she said.",
      "Animal rights activists, meanwhile, continued to inveigh against the industry. Edita Birnkrant, who runs an anti-horse-carriage group called NYCLASS, called the verdict \u201cheartbreaking\" and renewed a call for the city to stop issuing new carriage driver licenses.",
      "Another Manhattan carriage driver was charged with animal cruelty in 2013 after authorities said he kept a horse working for days with an injured hoof. That driver pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct, a noncriminal violation, and was sentenced to community service, according to news reports. Court records of his case are sealed.",

      "Families of missing loved ones face a unique and agonizing grief called ambiguous loss",
      "Rachel Ganz's husband might be alive. But he might not be. More than three months after he was last seen near the Eleven Point River in Missouri amid severe flooding and evacuation orders, Jon Ganz is just ... missing.",
      "That leaves Rachel, 45, in a limbo of sorrow and frustration, awakening \u201cevery morning to a reality I don't want to exist in.\u201d She dwells there in a liminal state, she wrote by email July 11, with a stream of questions running through her head: \u201cIs he trapped by debris in the river? Is he in a tangled mass of debris on the riverbank? Did he wander off into the forested area instead?\u201d And one that remains stubbornly unanswered: \u201cAre they ever going to find him?\u201d",
      "\u201cObviously I want my husband returned alive,\u201d she wrote to The Associated Press, \u201cthough I am envious of those who have death certificates.\u201d",
      "Like the families of the missing after the July 4 Texas floods experienced for much of this month, Ganz is suffering from what grief experts call ambiguous loss: the agony of living in the absence of a loved one whose fate is uncertain. Humans across borders, cultures and time unfortunately know it well. Ambiguous loss can be intimate, like Ganz' experience, or global, as in the cases of the missing from the Sept. 11 attacks, tsunamis in the Indian Ocean and Japan, the Turkey-Syria earthquake, the Israel-Hamas war and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.",
      "The distinguishing feature, according to Pauline Boss, the researcher who coined the term in the 1970s, is the absence of ritual \u2014 a wake, a funeral, throwing dirt on a grave \u2014 to help the families left behind accept the loss. The only way forward, experts say, is learning to live with the uncertainty \u2014 a concept not well-tolerated in Western cultures.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a state of mind, a state of the nation, right now where you either win or you lose, it\u2019s either black or its white,\u201d said Boss, a professor emeritus at the University of Minnesota who has researched ambiguous loss globally over a half century. \u201cYou have to let go of the binary to get past it, and some never do. They are frozen. They are stuck.\u201d",
      "Sarah Wayland, a social work professor from Central Queensland University in Sydney, says ambiguous loss is different from mourning because it's about \u201crepetitive trauma exposure,\u201d from the 24-hour news cycle and social media. Then there is a devastating quiet that descends on the people left behind when interest has moved on to something else.",
      "\u201cThey might be living in this space of dreading but also hoping at the same time,\" Wayland said. \"And they are experiencing this loss both publicly and privately.\u201d",
      "Heavy rains drove a wall of water through Texas Hill Country in the middle of the night July 4 , killing at least 132 people and leaving nearly 200 missing as of last week, though that number has dwindled as this week begins. Over just two hours, the Guadalupe River at Comfort, Texas, rose from hip-height to three stories tall, sending water weighing as much as the Empire State building downstream roughly every minute it remained at its crest.",
      "Those without bodies to bury have been frozen in a specific state of numbness and horror \u2014 and uncertainty. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond human imagination to believe that a loved one is dead,\u201d Boss says.",
      "This feeling can come in any global circumstance. Lidiia Rudenko, 39, represents a group of families in Ukraine whose relatives are missing in action. Her husband, Sergey, 41, has been missing since June 24, 2024, when his marine brigade battled the Russian army near Krynky. He's one of tens of thousands of Ukrainians missing since the Russian invasion in 2022. And she is one of thousands in Ukraine left behind.",
      "\u201cSome people fall into grief and can no longer do anything, neither act nor think, while others start to act as quickly as possible and take the situation into their own hands, as I did,\u201d Rudenko said. \u201cThere are days when you can\u2019t get out of bed,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes we call it \u201cgetting sick. And we allow ourselves to get sick a little, cry it out, live through it, and fight again.\u201d",
      "For nearly a decade, Leah Goldin was part of a very small number of people in Israel with the dubious distinction of being the family of of a hostage.",

      "Her son, Hadar Goldin, 23, a second lieutenant in the Israeli army, was killed, then his body taken on August 1, 2014. A blood-soaked shirt, prayer fringes and other evidence found in the tunnel where Goldin's body had been held led the Israeli army to determine he'd been killed, she said. His body has never been returned.",
      "Her family\u2019s journey didn\u2019t dovetail with the regular oscillations of grief. They held what Leah Goldin now calls a \u201cpseudo-funeral' including Goldin's shirt and fringes, at the urging of Israel\u2019s military rabbis. But the lingering uncertainty was like a \u201cknife constantly making new cuts.\".",
      "In the dizzying days after Hamas' attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, the Goldin family threw themselves into attempting to help hundreds of families of the 251 people Hamas had dragged into Gaza. But for a time, the Goldins found themselves shunned as advocacy for the Oct. 7 hostages surged.",
      "\u201cWe were a symbol of failure,\u201d Leah Goldin said. \u201cPeople said, \u2018We aren\u2019t like you. Our kids will come back soon.\u2019\u201d She understood their fear, but Goldin, who had spent a decade pushing for Hamas to release her son\u2019s body, was devastated by the implication. In time, the hostage families brought her more into the fold, learning from her experience.",
      "Hamas still holds 50 Israeli hostages, fewer than half of whom are believed to be alive. In Gaza, Israel\u2019s offensive has killed nearly 59,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which doesn\u2019t say how many militants have been killed but says over half of the dead have been women and children. Thousands of the dead are believed to be buried under rubble throughout the enclave.",
      "Ganz, whose husband went missing in Missouri in April, said the sheriff's department and others searched far and wide at first. She posted fliers around the town where his car was found, and on social media. Then someone accused her of \u201cgrieving without proof,\" a remark that still makes her fume.",
      "\u201cOne of my biggest frustrations has been people stating, \u2018If you need anything, please let me know,\u2019\u201d Ganz said. That puts the burden on her, and follow-through has been hard to come by, she said. \u201cWe already have enough ambiguity.\"",
      "She's thinking about setting up a nonprofit organization in Jon's honor, dedicated to breaking the stigma against men getting therapy, to show \u201cthat it's not weak.\u201d That tracks with Goldin's thinking that taking action can help resolve loss \u2014 and with Rudenko's experience in Ukraine.",
      "Boss recommends separate community meetings for families of the confirmed dead and those of the missing. For the latter, a specific acknowledgement is helpful: \u201cYou have to first say to the people, \u2018What you are experiencing is an ambiguous loss. It\u2019s one of the most difficult kinds of losses there is because there\u2019s no resolution. It\u2019s not your fault,\u2019\u201d Boss said.",
      "In Ukraine, Rudenko said it helps to recognize that families of the missing and everyone else live in \u201ctwo different worlds.\u201d",
      "\u201cSometimes we don\u2019t need words, because people who have not been affected by ambiguous loss will never find the right words,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes we just need to be hugged and left in silence.\u201d",

      "Warner was assisted by people who were at the beach, but he was declared dead by the staff of the Costa Rican Red Cross, the department said.",
      "In a statement Monday, the Costa Rican Red Cross said it was alerted to a water accident on Sunday at 2:10 p.m. local time, and it dispatched three ambulances.",
      "Two adult men were treated on site. One was transferred to a local clinic in critical condition, the Costa Rican Red Cross said. They tried to resuscitate the other man, but he didn't show vital signs and was declared dead. The Costa Rican Red Cross didn't provide an update on the man transferred to a local clinic.",
      "Warner starred as Theo Huxtable on \"The Cosby Show\" from 1984 to 1992. His performance earned him an Emmy nomination for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series in 1986.",
      "In 2023, Warner told CBS Pittsburgh that being part of \"The Cosby Show\" was an \"awesome\" experience.",
      "\"That show had such an impact on the culture here in America but also a global impact on how Black people saw ourselves globally and how the rest of the world saw us,\" he said. \"So I'm proud to have been part of that legacy and it's been a great ride ever since.\"",
      "Warner said in a 2015 interview with The Associated Press that he was saddened that the show's legacy was \"tarnished\" by \"Cosby Show\" patriarch Bill Cosby, who was\u00a0accused of sexual assault by multiple women. Cosby's\u00a0conviction in a Pennsylvania case\u00a0was later overturned.",
      "Warner went on to star in other TV shows, including \"Malcolm & Eddie\" (1996-2000), \"Reed Between the Lines\" (2011-2015) and \"The Resident\" (2018-2023). He also voiced The Producer on \"The Magic School Bus\" (1994-1997). He made his feature film debut in \"Drop Zone\" in 1994.",

      "\"You would have never known he was a major child star,\" Powell said in an interview Monday with CBS News. \"He was never someone who was into the celebrity of it. He knew what he was. He knew, you know, that he was America's son. He literally was America's son as the only male child on that historic show, 'The Cosby Show.'\"",
      "Powell said he was struck by the emotional reactions from fans on social media. \"It's someone you came of age with,\" he said of Warner.",
      "Powell recalled publishing a poem Warner wrote in a special issue of the magazine \"African Voices\" for the 50th anniversary of hip-hop in 2023.",
      "Warner was a lifelong hip-hop fan, Powell said, but he also was \"concerned about a lot of the images that were being put out there.\"",
      "\"So that became kind of his thing in the last few years, like how are we representing ourselves as a community, as a people, with the art that we're creating?\" he said. \"That sticks with me because he was someone who understood he had a huge platform.

      "Cosby shared a memory of Warner with CBS News' Jericka Duncan on Monday, saying, \"He was never afraid to go to his room and study and make sure he followed whatever he had learned in the acting school he went to.\"",

    "summary": "He opened such popular NYC institutions as The Odeon, Balthazar and Pastis. But a 2016 stroke, which caused immobility and affected his speech, led to a suicide attempt two years later. He has now penned an irreverent memoir, \"I Regret Almost Everything.\"",
    "story": [
      "Restaurateur Keith McNally hates New Year's Eve \u2013 he doesn't like being told to have a good time. \"I don't like to be forced to enjoy myself,\" he said.",
      "The \"least hospitable man in hospitality,\" as he calls himself, is not a big smiler, either. \"Inside,\" he explained.",
      "It doesn't seem to have hurt. Over 40 years, he's opened some of New York City's most popular restaurants, among them The Odeon, Balthazar, and Pastis \u2013 institutions almost as well-known as some of the bold-face names that frequent them. But McNally himself has never been much of a publicity hound, even less so after suffering a stroke in 2016. \"Naturally I'm a bit embarrassed to be on TV talking like this\u2014who wouldn't be?\" he said. \"But it's good for me to do it, because it gets me free of my embarrassment. Actually, I'm embarrassed talking about embarrassment!\"",
      "But the British-born McNally has largely overcome his embarrassment in a new memoir, \"I Regret Almost Everything.\" \u00a0\"The drawback for me with most memoirs [is], if you're not embarrassed by what you write, you've probably not spoken the truth,\" he said. \"If you don't cringe over every word, it's not the truth.\"",
      "The hardest part to write, he said, was about his suicide attempt, \"because my kids. I didn't want to leave them at all.\"",
      "That suicide attempt was two years after his stroke. He was found by his younger son, George. \"He was supposed to not find me,\" McNally said. \"Like most teenagers he would sleep until noon. But that day he woke up early, at 8:00 o'clock.\"",
      "\"You expected him to be sleeping later, he woke up early, he saw you?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, the bastard just woke up early and saved my life!\" he laughed.",
      "McNally might joke about it now, but the father of five was suffering with an immobile right arm (he was right-handed), back pain, and aphasia (which causes his slurred speech), and his second marriage was falling apart. But as he writes, some sobering words from a doctor made him reflect: \"He said that children who lose a parent to suicide were far more likely to kill themselves than the children of parents who don't. That stopped me in my tracks.\"",
      "Because he had such trouble communicating verbally after his stroke, McNally began using social media. \"I was so embarrassed by my speech and the way I looked, I didn't go to my restaurants for one year,\" he said. \"I was ashamed. But eventually I realized, nothing to be ashamed about. So, not only did I admit it wasn't a bad thing, but I went in on Instagram.\"",
      "McNally went viral in 2022 with a post criticizing former late-night host James Corden for allegedly being rude to the waitstaff at Balthazar. But now, McNally confesses in his book he isn't so sure calling out Corden was fair. He wrote: \"For someone who's hyperconscious of humiliation since suffering a stroke, it now seems monstrous that I didn't consider the humiliation I was subjecting Corden to. I felt like I'd hit the jackpot of a slot machine and thousands of gold coins were spilling out in front of me. That night I ended up with over 90,000 followers. I was intoxicated with self-righteousness.\"",
      "\"Uh-huh, it's true,\" McNally said. \"But afterwards, I felt really bad.\"",
      "Corden later apologized. But the 73-year-old McNally has continued creating a stir online. Take this recent post he wrote about his friend, ABC News' Diane Sawyer, describing a weeklong affair the two had in the 1970s. The story made news \u2026 except that it was completely made up.",
      "I said, \"Some people say, 'Listen, Keith, you know, it's really not cool for you to be sharing this.' And so, did you enjoy that back-and-forth with them?\"",
      "\"Yes. Yeah, I'm afraid, I did, yeah,\" he laughed.",
      "\"And I wonder, do you think that the stroke \u2013 I don't know, is that, does that \u2026\"",
      "\"Say what you think,\" said McNally.",
      "\"Well, is it that you feel a little trapped inside of yourself?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"I've always been a little like this inside. But since my stroke, and now on the outside.\"",
      "McNally grew up in the East End of London, one of four children born to Jack, a dockworker, and Joyce, a house and office cleaner. The family had little money. \"I got angry inside at my parents,\" he said, \"because we had no books in the house, no pictures on the walls. But they couldn't help it. They were working class who grew up with nothing.\"",
      "McNally says he didn't eat in a restaurant until he was 17. \"Most of the time, when we were on a holiday, we would go to the restaurant, they would look the prices outside, and then she'd go, 'Not for us.'\"",
      "And yet, when McNally moved to New York City in 1975 as an aspiring filmmaker, he made ends meet by working in restaurants. \"I didn't eat asparagus until I came here,\" he said. \"And the next day, I went to the doctor because the smell of my \u2026\"",
      "\"That was so pungent from eating the asparagus?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, I thought I was sick! So, I went to the doctor. He said, 'What'd you eat last night?'\" McNally laughed.",
      "\"You know what? You gotta put that in the paperback,\" I said.",
      "In 1980, McNally opened his own restaurant, The Odeon, in the neighborhood of Tribeca, in what had been a no-man's land. An immediate sensation, it established certain McNally \"musts,\" such as the importance of having a hamburger on the menu. \"I don't like hamburgers much myself,\" he said. \"But it's a sign of snobbery not to have a hamburgers.\"",
      "McNally prides himself on putting his staff above even his diners. Some of his employees have been with him for over 30 years. And ever since returning to work post-stroke, McNally has come to appreciate how they feel about him. \"I had to talk to my staff and was really nervous,\" he said. \"They were really kind. In the end, kindness is really essential.\"",
      "I asked, \"The stroke lifted the veil on what they thought of you?\"",
      "\"Yeah, yeah,\" McNally laughed. \"They made me feel good.\"",

      "British-born restaurateur Keith McNally was responsible for the opening of such popular New York City institutions as The Odeon, Balthazar and Pastis. But a 2016 stroke, which caused immobility and affected his speech, led him to attempt suicide two years later.",
      "He's recounted his story in the irreverent memoir\u00a0\"I Regret Almost Everything: A Memoir\"\u00a0(Simon & Schuster).",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Mo Rocca's interview with Keith McNally on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" July 20!",
      "\"I Regret Almost Everything\" by Keith McNally",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "There was a time when everything worked. ...\u00a0 I'd been happily married and the owner of eight successful Manhattan restaurants, including Balthazar in SoHo. In 2004, the New York Times had called me \"The Restaurateur Who Invented Downtown.\" I had everything going for me. And then on November 26, 2016, the clock stopped.",
      "I was living in London. One Saturday morning I coaxed my youngest children, George and Alice, into seeing a Caravaggio exhibition with me at the National Gallery. George was thirteen, Alice eleven. While looking at a painting of Jesus being betrayed by Judas, The Taking of Christ, I sensed my body beginning to show signs of betraying me: a strange metallic tingling started to pinch my fingertips. It was an odd feeling, but as it stopped after five or six seconds, I didn't give it another thought. Soon afterward, to the relief of my children, we left the museum.",
      "Two hours later, when I was back home by myself, the metallic feeling returned. Only this time it was in earnest. Within seconds the horrific tingling shot up my left arm and, like some malignant jellyfish, clasped itself onto my face. Terrified, I phoned Alina, who rushed back with the kids and instantly called an ambulance. George, fists clenched, was panic-stricken as medics examined my convulsing body. Within minutes I was being hoisted into the waiting ambulance. Alina, George and Alice looked on.",
      "I woke up several hours later in Charing Cross Hospital. The first thing the doctor told me was that I'd had a stroke. The second thing was that my brain would never be the same again. Perhaps his bluntness was necessary for legal reasons, but from where I stood\u2014or lay\u2014it was a brutal awakening.",
      "After the doctor left, I tried wriggling my arms and legs to check that I wasn't paralyzed. I wasn't, thank God. To test my memory, I wrote the alphabet on the back of the nurse's chart. I then tried saying the letters aloud, but here there was a problem. The words wouldn't conform to my efforts. They exited my mouth in such a slurred and disorderly way that I sounded like a stage drunk. But this was a small price to pay for my stroke. My first stroke, that is. Because the next day the artillery arrived and gave me such a hammering that in one fell swoop I lost the use of my right hand, right arm and right leg. And my slurred speech, perhaps in fright, went AWOL. Overnight I was confined to a wheelchair and deprived of language.",
      "So much for The Restaurateur Who Invented Downtown.",
      "* * *",
      "I shared a ward with five other men whose ages ranged from forty to eighty. At night, with words inaccessible to me, I'd listen in awe to them talking. Speech suddenly seemed like a divine accomplishment. Even everyday words had an element of poetry to them.",
      "I dreaded the moment when the men would stop talking and I'd be left with my own thoughts. Sleepless, half-paralyzed and unable to speak, I felt buried alive. More than anything, I wished the stroke had killed me.",
      "Bereft of speech and right side unusable, I wondered how my relationship with Alina might change. And with George and Alice also. All children exaggerate their father's strength. Most sense it ebbing away imperceptibly over twenty or so years. Generally, a father's decline appears natural, tolerable even. It wasn't going to be like that for my children.",
      "My new life seemed ungraspable. It existed, but was outside of me.",
      "On my second day in the hospital, Alina arranged for George and Alice to visit. An hour before they were due, I became so ashamed of them seeing me disabled that I canceled the visit. The next day I could hold out no longer.",
      "Hospitals are a great leveler. Like soldiers at war, patients lose all distinctiveness. As they entered the ward, George and Alice failed to recognize me. I was lying at the end of a row of identical beds, assimilating into the world of the sick and dying. Although it had only been three days since I last saw them, they looked years younger. They stood by the door, small eyes darting from one sick man to the next, searching for some identifiable sign of their father. After a few seconds they rushed to my bed.",
      "Alice seemed happy to see me, but George looked angry and said less than usual. He'd behaved in a similar way a year earlier after watching me lose a match in a squash tournament. Back then, I found his anger confusing. Now it made sense.",
      "Alina put on a brave face but was so shell-shocked she said little. I managed to gurgle out a few words, and in between the long silences the heavy breathing of the man in the next bed entered uncomfortably into our space. Alina told the children I was going to regain my voice and would soon be walking out of the hospital.",
      "Neither responded.",
      "When the three of them left, I wept for the first time in twenty years.",

    "title": "Bridget Everett on how she ended up as \"Somebody Somewhere\"",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bridget-everett-on-how-she-ended-up-as-somebody-somewhere/",
    "published": "Sun, 20 Jul 2025 09:55:11 -0400",
    "summary": "The actress and cabaret star put her hometown of Manhattan, Kansas, on the map with the award-winning HBO series about a Midwestern woman returning home and working through grief. She returned to Manhattan, to talk about her surreal journey.",
    "story": [
      "Bridget Everett will try to tell you she's not a celebrity in Manhattan, Kansas, but don't believe her. She did grow up here, one of six kids, so there's that. \"I just love that it still feels like small-town America,\" she said. \"I come back quite a bit and I visit the same spots.\"",
      "But it was when her HBO show \"Somebody Somewhere\" was set here in Manhattan, that Everett became a bon fide local legend.",
      "The show follows Sam Miller (played by Everett), who moves back to her hometown in her 40s, trying to figure out herself, and life, after the death of her sister. Everett was a writer, producer, and lead actor in the semi-autobiographical series. \"I was like, 'Is anybody going to watch this? This is not a cool show!'\" she said. \"You know, like, it's about friendship. I'm not a top model, you know? I don't want to speak for anybody else in the cast! But I think that's exactly kind of why it works.\"",
      "Unlike her character on the show, who returns home to Manhattan, Kansas, Everett stayed in Manhattan, New York, for years, working mostly as a waitress and using, believe or not, karaoke as her main creative outlet.",
      "\"My way of connecting with people is through singing,\" she said. \"It kind of always has been, and it's easier for me to unlock and kind of be who I really want to be when I'm singing.",
      "Those karaoke performances led to her own, now-legendary cabaret shows at the famed Joe's Pub in New York. Everett's performances are sort of unlike anything you've seen, and so risqu\u00e9 we can't show you much of it here on \"Sunday Morning.\"",
      "Everett said, \"What's interesting to me is, like, learning about people, and why am I up there with no bra and a low-cut thing with everything flying around? It's part of who I am, and I also kind of do it to understand myself, honestly. I like to talk about my family in this way because my family and I don't talk about it. I don't see a mental health care professional!\"",
      "And that's the amazing part: Everett's cabaret shows somehow end up being, in part anyway, a meditation on life and grief, including saying goodbye to her father, as well as the loss of her mother, sister, and her beloved dog, Poppy, whom she called the love of her life. \"For a while I felt a little bit of shame saying that, because romantic love is kind of what most people aspire to,\" Everett said. \"My life is driven in a different way. She just taught me how to love, and she just cracked my heart open in a way that, like, no other person could.\"",
      "In fact, it was this side of Everett that HBO and the show's creators wanted to highlight \u2013 the way we can feel both strong and broken, hopeless and hopeful, all in the same moment.",
      "Everett, who writes and performs multiple original songs on the show, says she got her love of music from her mother, Freddie. She also got her sense of humor from her mom, as well as her siblings, including Brock, Brian and Brad, who had given Bridget a piece of feedback: that her acting was improving. \"I was being honest,\" Brad said. \"Her acting, especially towards the end, I thought, was authentic. I even teared up on some of that, which is difficult to do when you know your sibling [is] acting. So, you need to separate who you know, and then see her in a character. And have it move you? I think it's a great compliment to her.\"",
      "\"Thank you,\" said Bridget. \"You could have just said that in a text.\"",
      "The HBO show features a number of Everett's actual friends and collaborators from New York, including Murray Hill, Mary Catherine Garrison, and, in a star turn, the just Emmy-nominated Jeff Hiller as her best friend, Joel.",
      "Though HBO chose not to renew \"Somebody Somewhere\" for a fourth season, it did win a prestigious Peabody Award, and also picked up an Emmy nomination this season for writing for a comedy series.",
      "Everett says the whole thing feels a little surreal: the journey from being somebody somewhere, to somebody who is right where she's supposed to be.",
      "\"Nothing will ever match this, and it couldn't, but that's okay,\" she said. \"A lot of people don't get the opportunity to have a TV show, to live a life beyond their wildest dreams. And then to get to do it with the people I love? It's why it's taken so long for me to move on and kind of let go. But now I'm just trying to celebrate that I got to do it at all.\"",

      "The summer when Sally Samuelson was eight, her brother Ellis graduated from high school and a few days later, he and his best friends, Heck Stevens and Ben Klosterman, drove up the coast in Heck's '64 Rambler American. They promised to be back in a week. Sally was the only one who went outside to see them off. She waved a dishrag and dabbed at pretend tears, then one or two real ones. \"Bye, little Pips!\" Ellis yelled from the back seat\u2014he called her Pipsqueak, with variations. \"See you in the funny papers!\"",
      "Ellis had thick, curly yellow hair long enough to tuck behind his ears and he wore a baseball cap to keep it there. He'd lately grown incredibly tall and skinny; his pants rode so low on his hip bones, they seemed about to slip off. Sally's sister, Katie, who was fourteen, called him El Greck after they saw El Greco's Christ on the Cross at the Getty; even their parents confirmed the resemblance.",
      "His last two years in high school, Ellis had a girlfriend named Carla, who was also tall and blond and liked to show off her stomach. In front of Ellis, she would say hi to Sally. Sometimes Ellis would come into Sally's room when she was drawing on the floor; he'd sit by her and talk about his last baseball game or his weird calculus teacher, and sometimes he'd wonder how much he liked Carla and if she was even nice. Sally somehow knew not to say what she thought. Anyway, Ellis spent most of his time playing ball with Ben and Heck. For their trip, they packed Heck's old Rambler with sleeping bags, the small smelly tent the Samuelson kids used on camping trips, and a cooler full of sodas. After ten days, when Ellis hadn't come back, Heck showed up at the Samuelsons' front door with the tent. Sally answered his knock.",
      "\"Ellis decided to stay away for a few more days,\" he said.",
      "\"Stay where?\" Sally's mother said from behind her.",
      "\"With some girl he met,\" said Heck. \"Not sure where, exactly.\"",
      "\"Well, where did they meet?\"",
      "\"On a beach around Santa Cruz.\"",
      "That was all her mother could get out of Heck. \"Some girl has snagged Ellis,\" she told Sally's father when he came home from work.",
      "\"Good for her,\" he said.",
      "\"How can you say that, Phil?\" her mother cried. \"El's such an innocent. What if she's trouble?\"",
      "Hinky, their Manchester terrier, cocked her head at one parent, then the other; she followed conversations\u2014they'd tested her by standing in a circle and tossing the conversation back and forth. Hinky shifted her attention to each speaker in turn.",
      "\"What if he doesn't come back in time for his job?\"",
      "Ellis was supposed to be a counselor at the day camp he'd attended since first grade.",
      "\"Let's worry about that when the time comes,\" Sally's father said.",
      "The camp's start date came and went.",

      "Joan Liang's life in America began in Palo Alto, where she lived in the attic of a two-story home on Azalea Street. Joan did chores for the widow who owned the house in exchange for reduced rent; she never could have afforded such a nice neighborhood otherwise. She lived in that attic until she was married, and she was married for only six weeks before she stabbed her husband. Joan was twenty-five and had lived in the United States for two years. The year was 1977.",
      "Joan had not thought she would stab her husband. It had been an accident (sort of). Afterward she was disappointed that marriage had not turned out as she'd imagined. She had thought it would be wonderful. It had been, actually. Until it wasn't.",
      "Though later, Joan would wonder why she'd ever thought marriage would be so special. As a child in Taiwan, most of the married women Joan encountered were melancholy, if not outright miserable; throughout her childhood, Joan's own mother had on occasion risen from the kitchen table without warning to cry with showy force into her hands.",
      "\"You've ruined everything!\" Mei would shriek if any of the children came near, and so they soon learned to keep away, which only worsened Mei's despondency. At least every other Saturday, Joan's father, Wen-Bao, spent the night across town in Shilin, where he kept a two-bedroom apartment for his mistress. Joan's mother was haunted by the two bedrooms; it drove her nuts, Mei said, to think of so much empty space.",
      "\"Can you imagine,\" Mei would remark, legs crossed as she sat before her vanity, \"how much lust a man must carry inside, to furnish such a large place for one woman? When all six of us are crowded in the same square footage? Do you understand the scope of his betrayal?\" At this point Joan's brothers usually wandered off; they were bored by this conversation, which repeated itself every few months. Only Joan would remain at her mother's feet, where she watched Mei sit with perfect posture before her mirror and pluck white strands from her hairline.",
      "After moving to California, Joan established the routine of calling her parents every Sunday evening Taipei time, during which Wen-Bao, if he'd visited his mistress that weekend, would have already returned home. On these calls, Joan's parents performed the same interrogation: how her studies at Stanford were proceeding, if there was any chance to graduate early from her master's program so that she might begin to earn money. Money was key. Joan had three brothers, each of whom by various rights (older, male) should have been sent abroad before her. Two had been disqualified by their academics, whereas the top candidate, Alfred, had been surprised by \"issues\" (his girlfriend was pregnant), and so at the last minute Joan was sent instead.",

      "The morning after Ed Hooley saw a coyote in the supply closet, Bob Alexander declared something smelled rotten inside Terry Tucker's Boxing Gym.",
      "This was at six a.m. on a Tuesday, midway through abs and stretching. Inside the ring, the eleven members of the First Thing crew sprawled out on foam mats as Terry Tucker, fifty-four, led them through an arduous medley of scissor kicks and side-to-sides, knees-to-your-ears and upside-down bicycle. It was August in Austin, the average age inside the ring was forty-nine, and though it would be hours before a single speck of perspiration would appear on Terry's left temple, his charges were sopping.",
      "Sopping except for Bob Alexander. Bob was lanky and spry, a semi-affable curmudgeon. At sixty-eight, he was the oldest of the First Thingers and among the fittest, too, though on this morning he was only going through the motions. Preoccupying Bob was the anonymous note that had been placed under the windshield wiper of his Audi sometime the night before.",
      "It had been a decade since his nephew had disappeared, and things like this still happened on occasion. A lead to nowhere, a tip to nothing. A psychic in New Braunfels who'd experienced a vision. \"Sounds promising,\" Bob had told the detective who'd called with that gem. A few days before, a short article on the tenth anniversary of the disappearance had run in the Statesman, so of course the kooks and grifters were coming out of the woodwork now.",
      "No one had ever shown up at his house before, though, and it was this, combined with the note's puzzling content, which meant that as soon as Bob left the gym, he would take the folded paper, stowed in his glove compartment, to Austin Police headquarters, a time-suck in building form, where, if he had to guess, he'd rehash the story of his missing nephew, Nathaniel Rothstein, without coming any closer to finding him.",

    "summary": "Felix Baumgartner made global headlines in 2012 when he jumped from the stratosphere and parachuted down to a landing in New Mexico.",
    "story": [
      "Felix Baumgartner, the daredevil who made a record-breaking parachute jump from the stratosphere in 2012, died Thursday in a paragliding accident in Italy, a local mayor confirmed. Firefighters who responded to the scene said they found a paraglider that had crashed into the side of a swimming pool in the city of Porto Sant Elpidio, on central Italy's eastern coast.",
      "\"Our community is deeply affected by the tragic disappearance of Felix Baumgartner, a figure of global prominence, a symbol of courage and passion for extreme flight,\" the town's mayor, Massimiliano Ciarpella, said on Facebook. Ciarpella told The Associated Press that the extreme athlete had been in the area on vacation.",
      "Witnesses told The Associated Press they heard a loud boom as the paraglider spun out of control. Mirella Ivanov, 30, told AP she was in the area with her two young children when they saw the paraglider lose control.",
      "\"Everything was normal, then it started to spin like a top,\" Ivanov said Friday. \"It went down and we heard a roar. In fact, I turned around because I thought it crashed on the rocks.\"",
      "Baumgartner, 56, made global headlines in 2012 when he was lifted into the stratosphere, about 24 miles up, in a capsule carried by a helium balloon, and then parachuted down to a landing in New Mexico. During the jump, he broke the record for fastest free fall, descending at about 843.6 mph and becoming the first human to break the sound barrier without the assistance of a vehicle.",
      "Originally from Austria, Baumgartner began skydiving at age 16 and further honed his skills in the Austrian military, according to his personal website. In 1988, he teamed up with Red Bull, which sponsored the stratosphere jump under the Stratos project and many other daring feats.",
      "The training and planning for the 2012 Stratos jump took five years. Among the records Baumgartner would break that day was highest jump, which had been held by Air Force Capt. Joe Kittinger since 1960, when he leapt from an open-air gondola basket that rose to 102,000 feet. Kittinger would go on to train Baumgartner for the record-breaking Stratos jump. (Baumgartner's height record was broken two years later.)",
      "In addition to skydiving, Baumgartner was an accomplished BASE jumper, breaking two records in 1999: highest BASE jump and lowest BASE jump. The low jump, which he took from one of the hands of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, was only 95 feet. The high jump was taken from the 88th floor of the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, although that record has since been broken and is currently held by the late Valery Rozov, who jumped from Cho Oyu in 2016.",
      "Baumgartner was also a helicopter pilot and was part of Red Bull's aerial acrobatics team.",
      "\"Ever since I was a child, I have always wanted to jump out of a plane,\" Baumgartner told Red Bull in an interview after becoming a licensed helicopter pilot.",
      "\"For Red Bull Stratos, we had a very long list of 'what ifs,' in other words eventualities that could happen and how we would deal with them in an emergency. The list kept getting longer and longer. I was only afraid of the things that were not on the list. The things we had not thought of,\" he told Red Bull, adding: \"To this day, I abort missions if the conditions are not right.\"",
      "While Baumgartner's stunts inspired millions, his political views were known to cause controversy. On social media, he mocked climate activists and others who sought to limit the effects of climate change, and voiced opposition to LGBTQ rights, according to the AFP news agency. He also once suggested Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n should receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-immigration policies.",

    "summary": "Connie Francis was a wholesome pop star of the 1950s and '60s whose personal life was filled with heartbreak and tragedy.",
    "story": [
      "Connie Francis, the wholesome pop star of the 1950s and '60s whose hits include \"Pretty Little Baby\" and whose personal life was filled with heartbreak and tragedy, has died, her friend and publicist, Ron Roberts, announced Thursday. She was 87.",
      "\"It is with a heavy heart and extreme sadness that i inform you of the passing of my dear friend Connie Francis last night,\" Roberts said in a statement posted to Facebook at 1:46 a.m. EDT. \"I know that Connie would approve that her fans are among the first to learn of this sad news.\"",
      "In another post Thursday afternoon, Roberts said Francis died Wednesday in a hospital in Pompano Beach, Florida. She had been hospitalized since late June after experiencing hip pain that led to her using a wheelchair and was later determined to be a pelvic fracture. While Francis was being treated in an intensive care unit, it was confirmed on Tuesday that she had pneumonia, Roberts said.",
      "Francis was a top performer of the pre-Beatles era, rarely off the charts from 1957-64. Able to appeal to both young people and adults, she had more than a dozen top 20 hits, starting with \"Who's Sorry Now?\" and including the No. 1 songs \"Don't Break the Heart That Loves You\" and \"The Heart Has a Mind of Its Own.\" Like other teen favorites of her time, she also starred in several films, including \"Where the Boys Are\" and \"Follow the Boys.\"",
      "The dark-haired singer was just 17 when she signed a contract with MGM Records following appearances on several TV variety shows. Her earliest recordings attracted little attention, but then she released her version of \"Who's Sorry Now?\" an old ballad by Ted Snyder, Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby.",
      "It, too, had little success initially until Dick Clark played it on his \"American Bandstand\" show in 1958. Francis followed with such teen hits as \"Stupid Cupid,\" \"Everybody's Somebody's Fool,\" and \"Lipstick on Your Collar.\" Her records became hits worldwide as she re-recorded versions of her original songs in Italian and Spanish among other languages. Her concerts around the country quickly sold out.",
      "Decades after recording \"Pretty Little Baby\" in the 1960s, the song gained popularity on social media in 2025, being featured in videos on TikTok and Instagram. Francis told the New York Times the song went unnoticed when it was originally released.",
      "\"It's a cute song,\" Francis said. \"I couldn't imagine that it has the effect that it has worldwide on people \u2014 it's hard to believe. I wanted something for the B-side of a single and I chose something that wouldn't give my A-side any competition. I don't even know the name of the record that I put it on. But I think it has a ring of innocence in this chaotic time and it connects with people.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a romance bloomed with fellow teen idol Bobby Darin, who had volunteered to write songs for her. But when her father heard rumors that the pair were planning a wedding he stormed into a rehearsal and pulled a gun on Darin, ending their relationship and seeming to set on Francis on a pained and traumatic path.",
      "She chronicled some of it in her autobiography, \"Who's Sorry Now?\"",
      "\"My personal life is a regret from A to Z,\" she told The Associated Press in 1984, the year the book came out. \"I realized I had allowed my father to exert too much influence over me.\"",
      "Her father, George Franconero, was a roofing contractor from New Jersey who played the accordion, and he had his daughter learn the instrument as soon as she began to show an aptitude for music. When she was 4, he began booking singing dates for her, going on to become her manager.",
      "Although her acting career had faded by the mid-1960s, Francis was still popular on the concert circuit when she appeared at the Westbury Music Center in Westbury, New York, in 1974. She had returned to her hotel room and was asleep when a man broke in and raped her at knifepoint. He was never captured.",
      "Francis sued the hotel, alleging its security was faulty, and a jury awarded her $2.5 million in 1976. The two sides then settled out of court for $1,475,000 as an appeal was pending. She said the attack destroyed her marriage and put her through years of emotional turmoil.",
      "She suffered tragedy in 1981 when her brother George was shot to death as he was leaving his New Jersey home. Later in the decade, her father had her committed to a psychiatric hospital, where she was diagnosed as manic-depressive. At one point she attempted suicide by swallowing dozens of sleeping tablets. After three days in a coma, she recovered.",
      "She was married four times and would say that only her third husband, Joseph Garzilli, was worth the trouble. The other marriages each lasted less than a year.",
      "Concetta Rosemarie Franconero was born on Dec. 12, 1937, in Newark, New Jersey. She was just 3 when her father presented her with a child-size accordion. The next year she began singing and playing the instrument at various public events.",
      "At age 9 she began appearing on television programs, including \"Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts\" and \"The Perry Como Show.\" It was Godfrey who suggested she shorten her last name.",
      "Clark featured her repeatedly on \"American Bandstand,\" and she said in later years that without his support she would have abandoned her music career.",

    "summary": "Former airline captain Joseph Emerson, indicted for trying to shut off a plane's engines mid-flight in 2023, speaks to \"CBS Mornings\" about the incident.",
    "story": [
      "An off-duty Alaska Airlines pilot indicted for trying to shut off a passenger jet's engines mid-flight in 2023 recalled the scary moment he slipped out of reality after eating \"magic mushrooms.\"",
      "Former airline captain Joseph Emerson said he takes full responsibility for the night in October 2023 that changed his life.",
      "\"I had no intention of crashing an actual airplane. I wanted to wake up. I was convinced I wasn't going home to my wife and kids,\" he said in an interview that aired on \"CBS Mornings\" on Thursday.",
      "At the time, Emerson said he had been grieving the death of his best friend and first turned to alcohol before experimenting with the psychedelic drug. Two days after trying so-called 'magic mushrooms' for the first time, he boarded Alaska Air Flight 2059 as a passenger from Everett, Washington, to San Francisco. It was a full flight, with 83 other passengers and crew on board, so he was given the cockpit jump seat behind the pilot and first officer.",
      "\"Most consequential three seconds of my life\"",
      "Suddenly, he said he felt a sense of \"all-out panic and fear\" on the plane as the drugs altered his perception of reality.",
      "\"You're not going home. You need to wake up. That's when I acted. I pulled the handles that were in front of my face,\" Emerson recalled thinking as he pulled the handles that cut off fuel to the engines in the event of a fire.",
      "While in the apparent dissociative state, Emerson said he didn't realize the serious consequences of his actions.",
      "\"I mean, in the dream, in that dissociative state, I thought they were going to wake me up. It didn't wake me up, right? I was in reality. I know that now. You know, it's the most consequential three seconds of my life,\" Emerson said.",
      "The flight was diverted and landed safely in Portland, Oregon, where Emerson was arrested. He's set to be arraigned next month on a federal charge of interfering with a flight crew, and faces a host of state charges including 83 misdemeanor counts of recklessly endangering another person and one felony count of first-degree endangering aircraft.",
      "The case reignited the conversation about barriers facing pilots when it comes to their mental health.",
      "Pilots' mental health",
      "Disclosing mental health issues can lead to a pilot being grounded by the Federal Aviation Administration, putting their ability to work at risk for an extended period of time, possibly lasting years. A 2022 study published in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine estimated 56% of pilots avoid seeking medical care due to fear of losing their certification to fly.",
      "\"I came to an understanding, or a misunderstanding, that I needed to be perfect on paper. I needed to show up and appear perfect, no matter what else was going on for me,\" Emerson said.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board has since held a first of its kind pilot mental health forum to review existing pilot mental health rules. The FAA also launched a review of policies \u2013 both calling for changes to address barriers to care.",
      "\"We need to have a system that allows people to be more forthcoming and to have treatment for issues that shouldn't keep you out of the cockpit,\" then-FAA Administrator Michael Whitaker said months after the incident, in December 2023.",
      "The FAA review committee made 24 recommendations.",
      "Illinois Rep. Sean Casten and Minnesota Rep. Pete Stauber are leading an effort in Congress to enact reforms within two years, introducing the bipartisan\u00a0Mental Health in Aviation Act\u00a0to help pilots and air traffic controllers get access to mental health care and hire additional medical examiners.",
      "\"The goal really simply is to make our skies safer and make our pilots safer. That's it,\" Casten told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "The bill would also require the FAA to annually review and update the process related to mental health-related special issuance of medical certificates to pilots and air traffic controllers, set aside 13.74 million dollars a year for the next three years to hire additional certified Aviation Medical Examiners, and authorize a three year $4.5 million dollar public information campaign aimed at destigmatizing mental health care among pilots and air traffic controllers.",
      "\"Our pilots and air traffic controllers are not going to lose their job when they ask for help. We in this country must recognize that that's strength. And they're not to be punished. We're going to help them, process them, and get them back into cockpits,\" Stauber added.",
      "The bill maintains the FAA's rigorous process for determining a pilot is safe to resume flying but aims to cut red tape and increase transparency. It has unanimously passed the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee last month and has the backing of the largest pilot unions. The bill has advanced to the House of Representatives for consideration. The FAA declined to comment on the bill.",
      "Emerson says he's been sober since the incident. He and his wife have started a nonprofit, Clear Skies Ahead, aimed at improving pilot health and wellness.",
      "\"I hope that there are lessons that we can learn from my experience. And that's kind of why I'm talking you today,\" Emerson said.",

    "published": "Tue, 22 Jul 2025 12:03:49 -0400",
    "summary": "More than three-quarters of Americans fear Social Security won't provide enough to live on when they retire, AARP study finds.",
    "story": [
      "Social Security is facing a growing number of challenges that threaten to undermine the retirement program's stability even as more retirees today say they urgently need the monthly payments compared with 20 years ago, according to a new AARP survey.",
      "About two-thirds of retirees said they substantially rely on Social Security for retirement income, or plan to do so, according to the survey, which polled more than 1,200 retirees as well as more than 2,000 younger Americans. When the advocacy group for older Americans asked the same question in 2005, about half of retirees indicated a heavy reliance on their monthly checks.",
      "The surge in retirees who largely rely on Social Security income to make ends meet comes as the program faces key challenges, from recent staffing cuts to a long-term financial crunch that could cause payments to be slashed starting in 2034.",
      "The AARP survey, conducted to mark the 90th anniversary of President Franklin D. Roosevelt signing the Social Security Act on August 14, 1935, underscores both the ever-growing importance of the program as well as its vulnerabilities.",
      "\"More than three-quarters of people in the U.S. \u2014 78% \u2014 are worried that Social Security won't provide enough to live on during retirement,\" AARP CEO Myechia Minter-Jordan said in a conference call to discuss the group's findings. \"That's an increase from five years ago, when 74%\" expressed concern.\"",
      "Confidence in the future of Social Security is also declining, with only 36% of Americans today saying they believe it will continue to pay out reliably and at the same level, a dip of seven percentage points from 2020, the study found. At the same time, 96% of Americans said they believed Social Security is important, with little difference between age groups or political party affiliations, AARP said.",
      "\"We're concerned that faith in the system ... is waning,\" Minter-Jordan added. \"We're concerned about their confidence that they will be able to receive benefits that they have paid into over time.\"",
      "Americans in their 30s are the most pessimistic about the future of Social Security, although confidence in the program's outlook tends to rise as people approach retirement age and get closer to claiming their benefits, the study found.",
      "\"Younger people have always underestimated how important Social Security will be to them in the future,\" noted Bill Sweeney, senior vice president of government affairs at AARP, said on the call.",
      "He added, \"Receiving Social Security changes how people view the program. They realize how important that inflation-adjusted treatment income is.\"",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the survey's findings.",
      "Social Security filings at a record",
      "Meanwhile, Social Security Administration data shows that Americans are filing for benefits at a record rate in 2025. This comes as experts are pointing to rising concerns about the program's reliability and future solvency, given job cuts at the agency and other changes.",
      "Wealth inequality is also a growing issue among retirees, with some white-collar workers heading into their golden years with hefty retirement savings thanks to corporate 401(k) programs with company matches. But about half of all private-sector workers lack access to corporate retirement accounts, creating hurdles for saving for retirement, a recent Pew Charitable Trusts study found.",
      "Last year, a record 68 million retirees, disabled people and survivors of deceased workers relied on Social Security, a 42% jump from two decades ago,\u00a0data shows. The number of Social Security beneficiaries is forecast to swell to 82 million by 2035, AARP said.",
      "Despite the retirement program's importance, many Americans lack a grasp of the basics of Social Security, the new AARP study also found. For instance, only 24% of those surveyed correctly identified 70 years old as the age at which individuals can maximize their Social Security benefits.",
      "And about one-third of respondents said the potential insolvency of the Social Security trust funds would lead to a complete cessation of benefits, which is false. If the trust funds aren't shored up and they run out of money, which is currently forecast to occur in 2034, monthly benefits would be reduced by about 20%.",

    "summary": "Southwest is providing details about its new assigned seating and boarding policy. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Southwest Airline's open seating policy is coming in for its final approach.",
      "The Texas-based carrier said Monday that flights with assigned seats will begin on Jan. 27, 2026, marking the end of an era\u00a0in which the discount carrier for decades bucked industry norms by having passengers choose their seats during boarding.",
      "Southwest, which announced last year that it was abandoning open seating, said customers can start booking flights with assigned seats starting on July 29.",
      "\"Assigned seating unlocks new opportunities for our Customers \u2014 including the ability to select Extra Legroom seats \u2014 and removes the uncertainty of not knowing where they will sit in the cabin,\" Tony Roach, executive vice president of customer & brand at Southwest Airlines, said in a statement.",
      "The new policy will allow travelers to choose from\u00a0different fare bundles and seat options, including those offering more legroom. A Southwest spokesperson said the airline is unable for now to offer details on how its fares will change under the new reservation system.",
      "The airline also recently did away with its \"bags fly free\" policy, signaling a broader shift in its revenue strategy amid mounting financial pressure. People who book flights on or after May 28 must pay $35 for the first checked bag and $45 for the second.",
      "New boarding process",
      "Southwest also announced on Monday that it is overhauling its boarding process.",
      "The new boarding sequence will group passengers based on seat location, with priority given to people who choose seats with extra legroom and to loyalty program members. Southwest customers can also pay for priority boarding if they want to move up in the queue.",
      "While Southwest passengers are currently assigned a group letter (A-C) and number, they will now be assigned a group number, 1-8.",
      "The new approach is intended to \"deliver a smooth and efficient Customer Experience on every flight,\" Southwest said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/labor-department-deregulate-workplaces-rules-changes-repeals/",
    "published": "Tue, 22 Jul 2025 07:06:58 -0400",
    "summary": "The Labor Department is seeking to pull back on the regulation of workplaces by rewriting or repealing more than 60 \"obsolete\" regulations.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Labor is aiming to rewrite or repeal more than 60 \"obsolete\" workplace regulations, ranging from minimum wage requirements for home health care workers and people with disabilities to standards governing exposure to harmful substances.",
      "If approved, the wide-ranging changes unveiled this month also would affect working conditions at constructions sites and in mines, and limit the government's ability to penalize employers if workers are injured or killed while engaging in inherently risky activities such as movie stunts or animal training.",
      "The Labor Department says the goal is to reduce costly, burdensome rules imposed under previous administrations, and to deliver on President Trump's commitment to restore American prosperity through deregulation.",
      "\"The Department of Labor is proud to lead the way by eliminating unnecessary regulations that stifle growth and limit opportunity,\" Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a statement, which boasted the \"most ambitious proposal to slash red tape of any department across the federal government.\"",
      "Critics say the proposals would put workers at greater risk of harm, with women and members of minority groups bearing a disproportionate impact.",
      "\"People are at very great risk of dying on the job already,\" Rebecca Reindel, the AFL-CIO union's occupational safety and health director, said. \"This is something that is only going to make the problem worse.\"",
      "The proposed changes have several stages to get through before they can take effect, including a public comment period for each one.",
      "Some rollbacks under consideration",
      "Home health care workers help elderly or medically fragile people by preparing meals, administering medications, assisting with toilet use, accompanying clients to doctor appointments and performing other tasks. Under one of the Labor Department's proposals, an estimated 3.7 million workers employed by home care agencies could be paid below the federal minimum wage - currently $7.25 per hour - and made ineligible for overtime pay if they aren't covered by corresponding state laws.",
      "The proposed rule would reverse changes made in 2013 under former President Barack Obama and revert to a regulatory framework from 1975. The Labor Department says that by lowering labor and compliance costs, its revisions might expand the home care market and help keep frail individuals in their homes longer.",
      "Judy Conti, director of government affairs at the National Employment Law Project, said her organization plans to work hard to defeat the proposal. Home health workers are subject to injuries from lifting clients, and \"before those (2013) regulations, it was very common for home care workers to work 50, 60 and maybe even more hours a week without getting any overtime pay,\" Conti said.",
      "Others endorse the proposal, including the Independent Women's Forum, a conservative nonprofit based in Virginia. Women often bear the brunt of family caregiving responsibilities, so making home care more affordable would help women balance work and personal responsibilities, the group's president, Carrie Lukas, said.",
      "\"We're pleased to see the Trump administration moving forward on rolling back some of what we saw as counterproductive micromanaging of relationships that were making it hard for people to get the care they need,\" Lukas said.",
      "Samantha Sanders, director of government affairs and advocacy at the nonprofit Economic Policy Institute, said the repeal wouldn't constitute a win for women.",
      "\"Saying we actually don't think they need those protections would be pretty devastating to a workforce that performs really essential work and is very heavily dominated by women, and women of color in particular,\" Sanders said.",
      "Migrant farmworkers",
      "Last year, the Labor Department finalized rules that provided protections to migrant farmworkers who held H-2A visas. The current administration says most of those rules placed unnecessary and costly requirements on employers.",
      "Under the new proposal, the Labor Department would rescind a requirement for most employer-provided transportation to have seat belts for those agriculture workers.",
      "The department is also proposing to reverse a 2024 rule that protected migrant farmworkers from retaliation for activities such as filing a complaint and testifying or participating in an investigation, hearing or proceeding.",
      "\"There's a long history of retaliation against workers who speak up against abuses in farm work. And with H-2A it's even worse because the employer can just not renew your visa,\" said Lori Johnson, senior attorney at Farmworker Justice.",
      "Michael Marsh, president and CEO of the National Council of Agricultural Employers, applauded the deregulation efforts, saying farmers have been hit with thousands of pages of regulations pertaining to migrant farmworkers in recent years.",
      "\"Can you imagine a farmer and his or her spouse trying to navigate 3,000 new pages of regulation in 18 months and then be liable for every one of them?\" he asked.",
      "Construction workers",
      "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, part of the Labor Department, wants to rescind a requirement for employers to provide adequate lighting at construction sites, saying the regulation doesn't substantially reduce a significant risk.",
      "OSHA said if employers fail to correct lighting deficiencies at construction worksites, the agency can issue citations under its \"general duty clause.\" The clause requires employers to provide a place of employment free from recognized hazards that are likely to cause death or serious physical harm.",
      "Worker advocates think getting rid of a specific construction site requirement is a bad idea. \"There have been many fatalities where workers fall through a hole in the floor, where there's not adequate lighting,\" Reindel said. \"It's a very obvious thing that employers should address, but unfortunately it's one of those things where we need a standard, and it's violated all the time.\"",
      "Miners and more",
      "Several proposals could impact safety procedures for mines. For example, employers have to submit plans for ventilation and preventing roof collapses in coal mines for review by the Labor Department's Mine Safety and Health Administration. Currently, MSHA district managers can require mine operators to take additional steps to improve those plans.",
      "The Labor Department wants to end that authority, saying current regulations give the district manager the ability to draft and create laws without soliciting comments or action by Congress.",
      "Similarly, the department is proposing to strip district managers of their ability to require changes to mine health and safety training programs.",
      "The general duty clause allows OSHA to punish employers for unsafe working conditions when there's no specific standard in place to cover a situation.",
      "An OSHA proposal would exclude the agency from applying the clause to prohibit, restrict or penalize employers for \"inherently risky professional activities that are intrinsic to professional, athletic, or entertainment occupations.\"",
      "A preliminary analysis identified athletes, actors, dancers, musicians, other entertainers and journalists as among the types of workers the limitation would apply to.",
      "\"It is simply not plausible to assert that Congress, when passing the Occupational Safety and Health Act, silently intended to authorize the Department of Labor to eliminate familiar sports and entertainment practices, such as punt returns in the NFL, speeding in NASCAR, or the whale show at SeaWorld,\" the proposed rule reads.",
      "Debbie Berkowitz, who served as OSHA chief of staff during the Obama administration, said she thinks limiting the agency's enforcement authority would be a mistake.",
      "\"Once you start taking that threat away, you could return to where they'll throw safety to the wind, because there are other production pressures they have,\" Berkowitz said.",

      "The federal agency said in a recall\u00a0notice\u00a0that the pools, which were manufactured in China and sold by multiple U.S. vendors, have a compression strap along the outside that can allow children to gain access and drown. Children are able to enter the pool even when the ladder is removed, the CPSC said.",

The deaths took place between 2007 and 2002 in California, Texas, Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin and Missouri. The CPSC said it's also aware of three separate instances when children gained access to the recalled pools using the compression strap.",
      "The pools, which are 48 inches high and taller, have been sold by outdoor recreation companies Bestway, Intex and Polygroup since 2002 at retail stores across the U.S., including, Amazon.com, Lowe's, Target and Walmart, among others.

    "story": [
      "Trump Media and Technology Group, the social media company owned by President Trump, said it has bought about $2 billion in bitcoin and related securities as it remodels itself as an investment firm.",
      "Trump Media, which owns the Truth Social app, announced in May that it planned to raise $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin, with the goal of creating a reserve of the cryptocurrency. The $2 billion bitcoin purchase is part of the company's \"bitcoin treasury plan,\" Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said in a news release on Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump, the largest investor in Trump Media, has increasingly focused on cryptocurrencies both through his private businesses and his administration. The company's $2 billion bitcoin purchase comes as Trump Media looks to roll out a range investment products, including a plan to sell exchange-traded funds, or ETFs.",

      "Christine Hunsicker, 48, of Lafayette, New Jersey, was charged with six counts, including fraud, aggravated identity theft and false statement charges in the indictment in Manhattan federal court.",
      "U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton said in a release that Hunsicker forged documents, fabricated audits and made material misrepresentations about her company's financial condition to defraud investors in CaaStle Inc. and P180.",
      "\"As alleged, Christine Hunsicker defrauded investors of hundreds of millions of dollars through document forgery, fabricated audits, and material misrepresentations about her company's financial condition,\" Clayton said in a statement on Friday. \"The promise of pre-IPO technology companies can be fertile ground for fraudsters who play on investor euphoria.\"",
      "The indictment\u00a0said Hunsicker, once portrayed as an on-the-rise fashion entrepreneur, portrayed CaaStle as a high-growth, private company with substantial cash on hand when she knew it faced significant financial distress.",
      "In a statement, defense lawyers Michael Levy and Anna Skotko said prosecutors \"have chosen to present to the public an incomplete and very distorted picture in today's indictment,\" despite Hunsicker's efforts to be \"fully cooperative and transparent\" with prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "\"There is much more to this story, and we look forward to telling it,\" they said.",
      "Hunsicker did not comment as she left the courthouse with Skotko after entering the not-guilty plea and agreeing to the rules of her $1 million bail, which included not having any contact with former or current investors or employees.",
      "According to the indictment, Hunsicker continued her fraudulent scheme even after the CaaStle board of directors removed her and prohibited her from soliciting investments or taking other actions on the company's behalf.",
      "She \"persisted in her scheme\" even after law enforcement agents confronted her over the fraud, the indictment said.",
      "Before the fraud allegations emerged, Hunsicker seemed to be a rising star in the fashion world after she was named to Crain's New York Business \"40 under 40\" lists, was selected as one of Inc.'s \"Most Impressive Women Entrepreneurs\" and was recognized by the National Retail Federation as someone shaping the future of retail, the indictment noted.",
      "At a time when the business was in financial distress with limited cash available and significant expenses, CaaStle was valued by Hunsicker at $1.4 billion, the indictment said.",
      "Hunsicker was lying to investors in February 2019 and continued to do so through this March, prosecutors alleged.",
      "They said she fed investors falsely inflated income statements, fake audited financial statements, fictitious bank account records and sham corporate records.",
      "She allegedly told one investor in August 2023 that CaaStle reported an operating profit of nearly $24 million in the second quarter of 2023 when its operating profit that quarter was actually less than $30,000.",
      "The indictment alleged that she carried out the majority of the fraud by bilking CaaStle investors of $275 million before forming P180 last year to infuse CaaStle with cash before its investors could discover her fraud.",
      "Through misrepresentations and omissions, she cheated P180 investors out of about $30 million, the indictment said.",
      "It said CaaStle filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy last month, leaving hundreds of investors holding now-worthless CaaStle shares. Hunsicker was forced to resign from CaaStle's board in December and formally resigned as chief executive in March.",
      "In a related civil filing, the SEC said Hunsicker's \"fake financials\" supported her narrative that CaaStle was nearing an initial public offering or sale in late 2022 as it enjoyed rapid and steady revenue growth after launching a new monetization model called \"Clothing-as-a-Service.\"",
      "\"In reality, CaaStle's revenues were shrinking, its losses were increasing, and the company was never profitable,\" the lawsuit said. \"Not a single existing or prospective CaaStle investor received accurate monthly, quarterly, or annual CaaStle financial statements from Hunsicker.\"",
      "Before CaaStle, Hunsicker launched Gwynnie Bee, a subscription service renting everyday clothes to women sizes 10 to 32.",
      "\"We want it to be a place where managing a rotating wardrobe is actually the way the majority of people interact with clothing,\" Hunsicker told CBS News in 2016 when discussing the company.",
      "Previously, Hunsicker was also the COO and president of Right Media, an online advertising startup that sold to Yahoo! for $850 million, and then became the COO of Drop.io, an online file sharing service that was purchased by Facebook.",

      "The popular menu item consists of espresso, milk, Pumpkin Spice Syrup and whipped cream, with pumpkin pie spice sprinkled on top. The coffee chain started adding real pumpkin to the drink in 2015.",

      "Starbucks introduced the drink in 2003 after a months-long brainstorming session to create the company's first fall beverage. Led by Peter Dukes, who is credited as the father of the drink, the group's goal was to match the success of the peppermint mocha.",
      "Little did they know it would become their most popular seasonal beverage of all time. Since debuting over 20 years ago, the Pumpkin Spice Latte, also known by its initials PSL, has skyrocketed in popularity, with hundreds of millions of beverages sold.",
      "\"Nobody knew at the beginning what it would grow to be,\" Dukes\u00a0said in a story posted on the Starbucks website for the beverage's 20-year anniversary. \"Twenty years later, it's taken on a life of its own.\"",
      "Starbucks initially considered naming the drink the fall harvest latte, but changed it to the Pumpkin Spice Latte \"because the spices play a really important role in bringing out the flavors of pumpkin,\" Dukes said in a Starbucks post.",

      "The software giant on Saturday said it was aware of \"active attacks\" that exploited vulnerabilities in the program, a product that allows companies and other businesses to create websites.",

      "The attack was a so-called \"zero-day\" exploit, or when hackers take advantage of a previously unknown vulnerability, often to steal sensitive data and passwords. The vulnerability also could allow hackers to access services connected to SharePoint, including OneDrive and Teams.",
      "\"Once inside, they can access all SharePoint content, system files, and configurations and move laterally across the Windows Domain,\" noted Netherlands-based research company Eye Security in a research note about the breach.",

      "Although the scope of the attack is still being assessed, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned that the impact could be widespread and recommended that any servers impacted by the exploit should be disconnected from the internet until they are patched.",

    "summary": "President Trump signed the country's first major legislation aimed at regulating cryptocurrency on Friday, hailing \"the exciting new frontier\" for the technology.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump signed a landmark bill to regulate cryptocurrency on Friday, hailing the \"exciting new frontier\" for the technology one day after the bill passed the House.",
      "The legislation, called the GENIUS Act, is the first major law governing digital currency, and establishes a regulatory framework for the $250 billion stablecoin market. Stablecoins are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency since their value is pegged to other assets, like the dollar. The bill passed the House on Thursday with the support of 206 Republicans and 102 Democrats.",
      "\"We worked hard. It's a very important act, the GENIUS Act. They named it after me,\" the president joked in the East Room of the White House. \"I want to thank you. This is a hell of an act.\"",
      "Members of Congress and top executives from Robinhood, Tether, Gemini and other crypto and financial firms were in attendance for the signing ceremony.",
      "The fate of the GENIUS Act was in question earlier this week when a dozen conservatives stymied a procedural vote. A compromise was ultimately reached, and the holdouts allowed the legislation to proceed. The president on Friday suggested that he spoke to the holdouts individually on the phone to persuade them, after House Speaker Mike Johnson told him there were a dozen Republicans opposing the bill.",
      "\"The good news is, I call up, 'Hello, Jim, how are you?' 'Sir, you have my vote.' Boom. 'Sir, you have my vote.' I really just, they just want a little love,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, it's always the same 12 people.\"",
      "David Sacks, the venture capitalist-turned Mr. Trump's AI and crypto czar, said the president \"stepped in and saved this bill.\" Mr. Trump also said Vice President JD Vance had been on the phone late at night, helping push the legislation through.",
      "What is the GENIUS Act?",
      "The GENIUS Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) establishes guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins. The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "With the GENIUS Act signed into law, banks, nonbanks and credit unions can dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "\"Just as I promised last year, the GENIUS Act creates a clear and simple regulatory framework to establish and unleash the immense promise of dollar-backed stablecoins,\" Mr. Trump said. \"This could be, perhaps, the greatest revolution in financial technology since the birth of the Internet itself. A lot of people are saying that.\"",
      "The president said the GENIUS Act provides banks and other financial institutions a framework for issuing crypto assets backed \"one-for-one\" with real U.S. dollars and Treasury bills, \"strengthening the dollar\" and allowing the entire U.S. financial system to be eligible for a \"21st-century upgrade.\"",
      "Lawmakers also approved two other cryptocurrency bills, capping what Republicans dubbed \"Crypto Week\" in Congress. The Clarity Act will regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act prevents the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans. The legislation is seen by the Trump administration and the crypto community as a way of bringing digital currency into the mainstream financial system.",
      "\"Let me say, the entire crypto community, for years, you were mocked and dismissed and counted out,\" the president said. \"You were counted out as little as a year and a half ago. But this signing is a massive validation.\"",
      "The Trump family's crypto investments have increased their wealth in recent months as the administration alters its regulatory approach to digital currency. The White House has insisted there is no conflict of interest, and the president's assets are in a trust managed by his children. Key crypto figures who were present Friday, including Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, backed Mr. Trump's campaign last year.",
      "The president on Friday also touted his decision to pardon Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the internet marketplace Silk Road who was sentenced to life in prison in 2015.",
      "The GENIUS Act wasn't the only bill that had House Republicans wringing their hands this week. The chamber also approved a request from the president to claw back about $9 billion in funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting in a late-night vote, signing off on changes the Senate made to the bill, known as a rescissions package, earlier this week.",
      "Passage of the funding cuts was held up this week over Democratic efforts to force the release of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Ultimately, the package passed the House along party lines, with two Republicans joining Democrats to vote against it. The bill claws back about $8 billion for foreign assistance efforts, including by the the U.S. Agency for International Development, and about $1 billion for public radio and television stations. The president is expected to sign it soon.",
      "\"REPUBLICANS HAVE TRIED DOING THIS FOR 40 YEARS, AND FAILED\u2026.BUT NO MORE,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, referring to cutting funding to the corporation that oversees federal funds for NPR and PBS. \"THIS IS BIG!!!\"",
      "Friday's signing ceremony for the GENIUS Act took place against the backdrop of increased focus on the Epstein case. On Thursday evening, Mr. Trump ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury material related to Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died in federal custody in 2019. Mr. Trump has faced increasing pressure to disclose more information about the case after the Justice Department said no further documents would be released following a review of the evidence.",
      "\"Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!\"",
      "Bondi said the Justice Department is \"ready to move the court tomorrow to unseal the grand jury transcripts.\" A judge will make the final call on whether the material can be made public, and the process could take weeks or months.",

    "story": [
      "Millions of taxpayers could see a lower tax bill next year due to the so-called \"big, beautiful bill\" that was signed into law on July 4 by President Trump, with a recent analysis finding that every income group will see some savings.",
      "On average, taxpayers will save about $2,900 per household in 2026, according to the analysis from the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank focused on taxes. But higher-income Americans are more likely to see a bigger relative boost than lower-income households, their analysis found.",
      "The new law extends the tax cuts in President Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, with many of those provisions otherwise slated to expire at year-end. But the legislation also adds a bevy of new tax breaks, ranging from eliminating taxes on overtime and tips to lifting the state and local taxes deduction from $10,000 to $40,000.",
      "About $6 of every $10 in tax breaks will go to the top 20% of households, or people who earn incomes of about $217,000 or more, the Tax Policy Center analysis found.",
      "\"Average tax cuts are generally larger as a percentage of after-tax income for higher income households than for lower income households,\" it noted.",
      "For instance, the typical household in the bottom quintile \u2014 those earning up to $34,600 per year \u2014 will save an average of about $150 in tax payments next year, or 0.8% of their income.",
      "But those in the top quintile, or who earn $217,101 or more, will save an average of $12,540 next year, or 2.5% of their incomes, the analysis found.",
      "To be sure, an individual's tax savings next year will depend on a number of variables, such as their number of children, which allows people to claim the Child Tax Credit, or whether they can tap one of the new tax breaks, such as the elimination of taxes on some tipped income.",
      "More than 6 in 10 adults said they believe the new law would do more to help wealthy Americans than other income groups, according to a July 18 poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs. About 60% said they expect the law will hurt low-income people, the survey found.",

    "story": [
      "Hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were easily found with a simple search on TikTok and available to a user under the age of 18, in violation of the platform's own policies, CBS News has found.",
      "CBS News created a TikTok account for a hypothetical 15-year-old female user in the United States and found that, at the very least, hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were searchable and watchable on the platform using the account.",
      "Once the CBS News account interacted with a handful of these videos, similar content was then recommended to the account on TikTok's \"For You\" feed.",
      "Searchable videos ranged from content with captions such as, \"nothing feels better than an empty stomach,\" to \"what I eat in a day\" videos promoting restrictive, 500-calorie-per-day diets. Guidelines published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health suggest that girls between the ages of 14 and 18 ingest between 1,800 and 2,400 calories per day.",
      "Many of the videos promoted thin body types as aspirational targets and included the hashtag \"harsh motivation\" to push extreme weight loss advice.",
      "Some of those videos included messages or slogans such as \"skinny is a status symbol\" and \"every time you say no to food, you say yes to skinny.\"",
      "TikTok's community guidelines say the platform only allows users over the age of 18 to see content promoting restrictive, low-calorie diets, including videos promoting medications for weight loss or idealizing certain body types. The Chinese-owned platform also says it bans users under the age of 18 from viewing videos that promote cosmetic surgery without warning of the risks, such as before-and-after images, videos of surgical procedures, and messages discussing elective cosmetic surgery.",
      "But CBS News found a range of videos by entering basic search terms on the platform, such as \"skinny,\" \"thin,\" and \"low cal,\" that promoted thin bodies as ideal, while also pushing harmful weight management behaviors. One such video showed an image of a scale with a weight of 39.9 kg (88 pounds) alongside a caption saying \"weight loss\" and the hashtag \"ed,\" which is a common abbreviation for \"eating disorder.\"",
      "Another graphic video with the caption \"ana gives you wings\" showed a series of models with protruding collar bones and spines. The term \"ana\" is an abbreviation for the eating disorder anorexia.",
      "Responding to CBS News' research, a TikTok spokesperson said Thursday that it was \"based on a very limited sample size and does not reflect the experience of the vast majority of our community.\"",
      "\"TikTok does not allow content that promotes disordered eating or extreme weight loss behaviours, and we work with health experts to provide in-app support resources where needed,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The spokesperson pointed to a study published in May by the University of Southern California, which found that a majority of the eating disorder content on TikTok is discussion among users about recovery from such conditions.",
      "The same study noted, however, the platform's \"dual role in both challenging harmful cultural norms and potentially perpetuating them,\" regarding body image perceptions and eating disorders.",
      "\"We know that this isn't a one-off error on TikTok's part and that children are coming across this content on a scale,\" said Gareth Hill, a spokesperson for the Molly Russell foundation, a charity in the United Kingdom that works to prevent young people from committing self-harm.",
      "\"The question for TikTok is, if this is not representative, then why has this account [created by CBS News], which is a child's account, been shown this content in the first place, and then why is it continuing to get recommended to it?\"",
      "CBS News also found a wide variety of videos available to the under-18 user promoting the weight loss drug Ozempic and various forms of cosmetic surgery. That included videos that showed up on the recommended \"For You\" feed, which promotes cosmetic surgeries such as rhinoplasty, breast augmentation, and liposuction.",
      "In one case, a user talking about their waist reduction surgery included a voiceover saying: \"I would rather die hot than live ugly.\"",
      "A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment specifically on CBS News' findings regarding cosmetic surgeries being promoted to underage users.",
      "TikTok says it has taken a range of measures over the past several months to address criticism regarding the availability of extreme weight loss content on the platform. In early June, the platform suspended search results for the viral hashtag #SkinnyTok, after drawing criticism from health experts and European regulators. The hashtag had been associated primarily with videos promoting extreme weight loss, calorie restriction and negative body talk, often presented as wellness advice.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson also told CBS News on Thursday that searches for words or phrases such as #Anorexia would lead users to relevant assistance, including localized eating disorder helplines, where they can access further information and support.",
      "\"I think we're understanding more and more about how this content shows up and so even when you ban a particular hashtag, for example, it's not long until something similar jumps up in its place,\" Doreen Marshall, who leads the American nonprofit National Eating Disorders Association [NEDA], told CBS News.",
      "\"This is going to be an evolving landscape both for creating content guidelines, but also for the platforms themselves and, you know, while some progress has been made, there's clearly more that can be done,\" Marshall said.",
      "TikTok is not the only social media platform that has faced criticism for the accessibility of extreme weight loss content.",
      "In 2022, 60 Minutes reported on a leaked internal document from Meta that showed the company was aware, through its own research, of content on its Instagram platform promoting extreme weight loss and fueling eating disorders in young people.",
      "At the time, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, declined 60 Minutes' request for an interview but its global head of safety, Antigone Davis, said, \"We want teens to be safe online\" and that Instagram doesn't \"allow content promoting self-harm or eating disorders.\"",
      "Last year, 60 Minutes reported that the Google-owned YouTube video platform, which is hugely popular among teenagers, was also serving up extreme weight loss and eating disorder content to children.",

      "Older Americans are kicking the can down the road on retirement over concerns about the economy and their own financial readiness to step back from work.",
      "That's according to a new survey from F&G Annuities & Life, which polled 2,000 U.S. adults over 50 years old. The life insurance and annuities company found that 23% of those polled have already decided to delay their retirement as they grapple with questions about their financial readiness, up from 14% in 2024.",
      "The findings come at a time when the median savings of 55-year-olds is just $50,000, far from enough to fund a secure old age, according to\u00a0another recent study\u00a0by Prudential Financial.",
      "The F&G survey provides a snapshot into the thinking of Gen X, ages 45 to 60, whose oldest members are now entering their pre-retirement years. The\u00a0average retirement age\u00a0in the United States is 62, which is also the earliest age at which people can start claiming Social Security benefits.",
      "The longer a person waits to claim Social Security, the higher benefit they'll receive from the program. The full retirement age for people born in 1960 or later is 67, at which point workers can receive their full benefits. Those who delay claiming until age 70, however, can get another 24% boost to their monthly checks.",
      "Among the 23% in the F&G study who plan to delay claims on their Social Security benefits, half cited financial uncertainties or economic volatility as the reason for their decision to delay retirement \u2014 a 10% increase from last year. Forty-four percent said they are worried about inflation, while 34% indicated they are worried about a recession or stock market downturn.",
      "They're not the only ones, according to David John, a senior policy adviser at AARP.\u00a0 The majority of Americans nearing retirement age are unsure of whether they will have enough money to make it through retirement as they fret over inflation and general economy uncertainty, he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Along those lines, Johns said he's also observed that people are cutting back on their retirement savings or pulling money out of retirement savings to deal with unexpected costs or inflationary pressures.",
      "\"Of course, that helps in the short run, but that means that you have even more people who have worries once they start to get to retirement,\" he said.",
      "Unlike 401(k)s and other retirement accounts, Social Security benefits are protected from inflation because the agency institutes a cost-of-living adjustment each year, John pointed out. To guard against disruptions to retirement plans, John suggests that people consistently put away money \u2014 even if it's just a small amount each month.",
      "\"Save and continue to save,\" he said. \"Because any amount of retirement savings is going to be better than no retirement savings.\"",

      "The back-to-school season may seem at least a month away on the calendar, but for a majority of American families, it's already begun.",
      "Two-thirds of back-to-school shoppers have already started buying clothing and supplies ahead of the new school year \u2014 a 55% increase on the level of early purchases last year.",
      "That's according to a new\u00a0survey from the National Retail Federation (NRF), which indicates that students and their parents are getting an early start on shopping this year, hunting for deals as they navigate\u00a0economic uncertainty. More than half of consumers surveyed, 51%, cited concerns over tariffs as the reason why they were starting school shopping earlier this year.",
      "\"Consumers are being mindful of the potential impacts of tariffs and inflation on back-to-school items, and have turned to early shopping, discount stores and summer sales for savings on school essentials,\" Katherine Cullen, NRF vice president of industry and consumer insights, said in a statement.",
      "The price of school supplies and books has already reached an all-time high, data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis\u00a0shows. However, consumers worry that the cost of items could go up even more once the full brunt of President Trump's tariffs take effect.",
      "Mr. Trump recently announced on Truth Social that he would\u00a0place steep tariffs\u00a0on over 20 countries, starting on Aug. 1. The levies could directly impact the cost of apparel and other\u00a0back-to-school items\u00a0like electronics that are imported from abroad.",
      "In its report, the NRF predicts families will spend a total of $128.2 billion on supplies this year, up from $125.4 billion last year. The increase, however, reflects an increase in the number of consumers shopping for back-to-school supplies, and not individual spending, which is expected to be lower this year.",
      "Families with students in kindergarten through high school plan to spend an average of $858.07 on school-related items this year, down from $874.68 in 2024, according to the study. College students and their parents also plan to spend less this year \u2014 an average of $1,325.85, down from $1,364.75 in 2024.",
      "Four in five shoppers said they were planning their shopping around July back-to-school sales to maximize their budgets, the NRF report found.",

      "With inflation and tariffs top of mind for many consumers, stores are already promoting back-to-school discounts to lure shoppers.",
      "\"As shoppers look for the best deals on clothes, notebooks and other school-related items, retailers are highly focused on affordability and making the shopping experience as seamless as possible,\" NRF's Cullen said.",
      "Amazon, Target and Walmart\u00a0are each offering back-to-school summer sales to entice customers. Amazon last week completed its four-day Prime Day event, which offered thousands of\u00a0deals on everything from backpacks to dorm furnishings to laptops.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge has blocked a rule issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in January that would have removed unpaid medical debt from the credit reports of about 15 million consumers.",
      "The ruling, issued Friday by Judge Sean Jordan of the U.S. District Court of Texas' Eastern District, orders that the rule be vacated because of the court's finding that the CFPB exceeded its authority under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. After the CFPB issued the rule in January, the Cornerstone Credit Union League and the Consumer Data Industry Association, a trade group for the credit reporting industry, had filed a lawsuit to halt it.",
      "The court's decision could impact the roughly 15 million people who carry a total of about $49 billion in medical debt on their credit reports, a burden that can influence whether lenders decide whether to extend loans like mortgages or auto loans to consumers. At the time when the CFPB issued the rule, the agency noted that medical debt is a poor predictor of whether a consumer will make good on other types of loans.",
      "\"It doesn't show whether they are likely to pay their mortgage or other debts because there are a lot of inaccuracies and they have a lot of disputes,\" Julie Margetta Morgan, former associate director of research, monitoring and regulations at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The CFPB's rule had been hailed by consumer advocates for helping to protect consumers who can get tangled up in complicated issues around medical debt, such as problems with insurance reimbursements, denials and other snafus.",
      "\"By pulling back on this rule, the court has eliminated the CFPB's ability to provide that kind of relief to people and give this certainty that they can work with their health care provider to make sure the bills they are paying are accurate, without being hounded by a debt collector,\" added Margetta Morgan, who currently serves as the president of The Century Foundation, a left-leaning policy think tank.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "What does the ruling say about medical debt and credit reports?",
      "Jordan ruled that the \"medical debt rule exceeds the [CFBP]'s statutory authority by violating the plain text\" of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or FCRA, a 1970 law that oversees credit reporting.",
      "\"The rule exceeded the CFPB's statutory authority because FCRA explicitly allows credit reporting agencies to report, and creditors to obtain and use, information about medical debt that is properly coded to obscure the name of the provider and the nature of the services provided,\" Dan Smith, CEO of the Consumer Data Industry Association, said in a July 11\u00a0statement.",
      "Had the CFPB rule gone into effect?",
      "No, the rule hadn't yet gone into effect, according to Jordan's ruling.",
      "While the rule was slated to take effect about 60 days after it was published, the CFPB asked for a three-month delay after the Trump administration put new leadership at its helm, the decision noted. That request was granted by the court as the lawsuit to block the rule moved forward.",
      "Could the court decision be appealed?",
      "It's unclear. While the CFPB could appeal in theory, the agency is now essentially in a state of limbo.",
      "In February, President Trump appointed White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought as acting director of the CFPB. Days after his appointment, Vought issued a memo to CFPB staff that directed employees not to issue any proposed or formal rules, stop pending investigations and not open new investigations, among other actions.",
      "What steps are available to consumers with medical debt?",
      "According to the CFPB, 20% of Americans has at least one medical debt collection account on their credit reports, while and over half of the collections on credit reports are for medical debt.",
      "In some states, consumers can rely on government protections to help them with medical debt and their credit reports, Morgan noted. Colorado and New York both enacted laws in 2023 that provide some protections for consumers who have medical debt, for instance.",
      "And last year, Experian, Equifax and TransUnion, the three national credit reporting agencies, said that they were removing medical collections debt under $500 from U.S. consumer credit reports.",
      "\"From my experience reading these accounts from consumers, there are a lot of flaws in our medical billing and reporting system, and it lands in the consumer's lap and they are supposed to try to figure out how to deal with it,\" Morgan said. \"I would make sure the bills you receive are accurate,\" as well as check whether your insurer is paying the correct amount, she added.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Todd Blanche, the second-highest ranking official at the Justice Department, said Tuesday that he plans to meet with Ghislaine Maxwell \"in the coming days\" about the case involving convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"Justice demands courage. For the first time, the Department of Justice is reaching out to Ghislaine Maxwell to ask: what do you know?\" Blanche wrote on social media. He added that he contacted Maxwell's lawyers at the direction of Attorney General Pam Bondi. \"I intend to meet with her soon. No one is above the law \u2014 and no lead is off-limits,\" Blanche wrote.",
      "On Capitol Hill, a subcommittee of the House Oversight and Reform Committee approved a motion from GOP Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee that directs the committee's chairman to subpoena Maxwell to appear for a deposition, a signal of lawmakers' interest in speaking to Epstein's former partner.",
      "Blanche, who was President Trump's private defense attorney before joining the Justice Department, said that the department and the FBI continue to stand by a memo released earlier this month that concluded Epstein did not have a \"client list\" and confirmed that he died by suicide. The memo, which detailed the findings of a review of Epstein's case, also said there was no \"credible evidence\" that the disgraced financier blackmailed prominent people.",
      "The Justice Department and FBI also said they would not release any additional information about Epstein's case, and noted that the review did not uncover evidence that would prompt an investigation into uncharged third parties.",
      "\"President Trump has told us to release all credible evidence,\" Blanche said in a second statement shared by Bondi. \"If Ghislane Maxwell has information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims, the FBI and the DOJ will hear what she has to say.\"",
      "The deputy attorney general said the Justice Department in prior administrations had not asked about her willingness to meet with the government, and he anticipates \"meeting with Ms. Maxwell in the coming days.\"",
      "David Oscar Markus, Maxwell's lawyer, said in a statement, \"I can confirm that we are in discussions with the government and that Ghislaine will always testify truthfully. We are grateful to President Trump for his commitment to uncovering the truth in this case.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that he did not know about Blanche's bid to speak with Maxwell but said it \"sounds appropriate to do.\"",
      "\"It's sort of a witch hunt,\" he said in the Oval Office. \"Just a continuation of the witch hunt.\"",
      "Maxwell was an associate of Epstein's and convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. She is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence. Her lawyers have asked the Supreme Court to take up an appeal of her conviction.",
      "Blanche's outreach to Maxwell's lawyers comes after the Justice Department asked a federal court in New York on Friday to unseal transcripts from grand jury proceedings involving Epstein. He was indicted in 2019 on one count of sex trafficking of minors and one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors.",
      "Federal prosecutors alleged that Epstein sexually exploited and abused dozens of underage girls from 2002 through 2005, and worked with others who set up sexual encounters with victims at Epstein's residences in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "He died by suicide while in federal custody before his trial. Epstein had been arrested in Florida in 2006 and pleaded guilty to two state prostitution charges in 2008.",
      "In addition to asking the court to release the grand jury transcripts related to Epstein's indictment, the Justice Department also asked it to make public grand jury transcripts associated with Maxwell's case. U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer, who is now handling Maxwell's case, ordered the Justice Department to submit additional filings to the court about its request to unseal the grand jury records, and gave Maxwell and victims until Aug. 5 to lay out their positions on the proposed disclosure.",
      "Whether the transcripts become public will be up to the judges overseeing the cases, though the records will likely be heavily redacted to shield information related to victims. If the Justice Department's requests are granted by the court, the material is unlikely to be available immediately, and it could be weeks or months before it is unsealed.",
      "Federal rules typically require matters before a grand jury to be kept secret.",
      "The president and his administration have been dealing with backlash from Mr. Trump's allies that arose after the Justice Department released the memo about Epstein.",
      "Some top administration officials, such as Vice President JD Vance and FBI Director Kash Patel, suggested before Mr. Trump's reelection that Democrats were deliberately concealing information about Epstein and his purported list of clients. But now, with the Justice Department under Mr. Trump's control, some of his allies are skeptical of its claim that there is nothing left to disclose.",
      "Mr. Trump has tried to downplay the focus on Epstein and lashed out at some of his supporters, calling them \"weaklings\" who have been fooled by Democrats. He referred to claims about Epstein as the \"Jeffrey Epstein Hoax.\"",
      "Epstein and Mr. Trump moved in the same social circles in New York and Florida from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. They were friends for years, until they had a falling out around 2004. Mr. Trump has previously acknowledged he crossed paths with Epstein in Palm Beach, but said in 2019 following Epstein's arrest that they haven't spoken in 15 years.",
      "Last week, the president lashed out at a story in the Wall Street Journal that chronicled the pair's relationship, which the president has said ended before Epstein's first arrest in 2006. The Journal reported that Mr. Trump had signed a \"bawdy\" letter to Epstein in the early 2000s to mark his 50th birthday that said, in part, \"may every day be another wonderful secret.\" CBS News has not independently seen or verified the letter.",
      "Mr. Trump called the letter \"fake\" and filed a defamation lawsuit against the Journal's publisher, parent company News Corporation, its leader Rupert Murdoch and the reporters who wrote the Epstein story. Mr. Trump is seeking at least $20 billion in damages.",

      "\"President Trump has decided to withdraw the United States from UNESCO \u2013 which supports woke, divisive cultural and social causes that are totally out-of-step with the commonsense policies that Americans voted for in November,\" White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said. \"This president will always put America First and ensure our country's membership in all international organizations aligns with our national interests.\"",
      "The New York Post first reported Mr. Trump's decision to yet again withdraw the U.S. from the international organization.",
      "Mr. Trump requested a 90-day review of America's involvement in UNESCO in February, particularly asking for \"an analysis of any anti-Semitism or anti-Israel sentiment within the organization.\"",
      "The first Trump administration announced in 2017 that the U.S. would withdraw from UNESCO citing an anti-Israel bias. But the U.S. also cut off funding to UNESCO during the Obama administration, after UNESCO voted to include the Palestinian state as a full member state in 2011. The U.S. also withdrew from UNESCO under President Ronald Reagan and rejoined two decades later under President George W. Bush.",

      "\"The Department of Labor is proud to lead the way by eliminating unnecessary regulations that stifle growth and limit opportunity,\" Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a statement, which boasted the \"most ambitious proposal to slash red tape of any department across the federal government.\"",

      "The proposed changes have several stages to get through before they can take effect, including a public comment period for each one.",
      "Some rollbacks under consideration",
      "Home health care workers help elderly or medically fragile people by preparing meals, administering medications, assisting with toilet use, accompanying clients to doctor appointments and performing other tasks. Under one of the Labor Department's proposals, an estimated 3.7 million workers employed by home care agencies could be paid below the federal minimum wage - currently $7.25 per hour - and made ineligible for overtime pay if they aren't covered by corresponding state laws.",
      "The proposed rule would reverse changes made in 2013 under former President Barack Obama and revert to a regulatory framework from 1975. The Labor Department says that by lowering labor and compliance costs, its revisions might expand the home care market and help keep frail individuals in their homes longer.",
      "Judy Conti, director of government affairs at the National Employment Law Project, said her organization plans to work hard to defeat the proposal. Home health workers are subject to injuries from lifting clients, and \"before those (2013) regulations, it was very common for home care workers to work 50, 60 and maybe even more hours a week without getting any overtime pay,\" Conti said.",
      "Others endorse the proposal, including the Independent Women's Forum, a conservative nonprofit based in Virginia. Women often bear the brunt of family caregiving responsibilities, so making home care more affordable would help women balance work and personal responsibilities, the group's president, Carrie Lukas, said.",
      "\"We're pleased to see the Trump administration moving forward on rolling back some of what we saw as counterproductive micromanaging of relationships that were making it hard for people to get the care they need,\" Lukas said.",
      "Samantha Sanders, director of government affairs and advocacy at the nonprofit Economic Policy Institute, said the repeal wouldn't constitute a win for women.",
      "\"Saying we actually don't think they need those protections would be pretty devastating to a workforce that performs really essential work and is very heavily dominated by women, and women of color in particular,\" Sanders said.",
      "Migrant farmworkers",
      "Last year, the Labor Department finalized rules that provided protections to migrant farmworkers who held H-2A visas. The current administration says most of those rules placed unnecessary and costly requirements on employers.",
      "Under the new proposal, the Labor Department would rescind a requirement for most employer-provided transportation to have seat belts for those agriculture workers.",
      "The department is also proposing to reverse a 2024 rule that protected migrant farmworkers from retaliation for activities such as filing a complaint and testifying or participating in an investigation, hearing or proceeding.",
      "\"There's a long history of retaliation against workers who speak up against abuses in farm work. And with H-2A it's even worse because the employer can just not renew your visa,\" said Lori Johnson, senior attorney at Farmworker Justice.",
      "Michael Marsh, president and CEO of the National Council of Agricultural Employers, applauded the deregulation efforts, saying farmers have been hit with thousands of pages of regulations pertaining to migrant farmworkers in recent years.",
      "\"Can you imagine a farmer and his or her spouse trying to navigate 3,000 new pages of regulation in 18 months and then be liable for every one of them?\" he asked.",
      "Construction workers",
      "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, part of the Labor Department, wants to rescind a requirement for employers to provide adequate lighting at construction sites, saying the regulation doesn't substantially reduce a significant risk.",
      "OSHA said if employers fail to correct lighting deficiencies at construction worksites, the agency can issue citations under its \"general duty clause.\" The clause requires employers to provide a place of employment free from recognized hazards that are likely to cause death or serious physical harm.",
      "Worker advocates think getting rid of a specific construction site requirement is a bad idea. \"There have been many fatalities where workers fall through a hole in the floor, where there's not adequate lighting,\" Reindel said. \"It's a very obvious thing that employers should address, but unfortunately it's one of those things where we need a standard, and it's violated all the time.\"",
      "Miners and more",
      "Several proposals could impact safety procedures for mines. For example, employers have to submit plans for ventilation and preventing roof collapses in coal mines for review by the Labor Department's Mine Safety and Health Administration. Currently, MSHA district managers can require mine operators to take additional steps to improve those plans.",
      "The Labor Department wants to end that authority, saying current regulations give the district manager the ability to draft and create laws without soliciting comments or action by Congress.",
      "Similarly, the department is proposing to strip district managers of their ability to require changes to mine health and safety training programs.",
      "The general duty clause allows OSHA to punish employers for unsafe working conditions when there's no specific standard in place to cover a situation.",
      "An OSHA proposal would exclude the agency from applying the clause to prohibit, restrict or penalize employers for \"inherently risky professional activities that are intrinsic to professional, athletic, or entertainment occupations.\"",
      "A preliminary analysis identified athletes, actors, dancers, musicians, other entertainers and journalists as among the types of workers the limitation would apply to.",
      "\"It is simply not plausible to assert that Congress, when passing the Occupational Safety and Health Act, silently intended to authorize the Department of Labor to eliminate familiar sports and entertainment practices, such as punt returns in the NFL, speeding in NASCAR, or the whale show at SeaWorld,\" the proposed rule reads.",
      "Debbie Berkowitz, who served as OSHA chief of staff during the Obama administration, said she thinks limiting the agency's enforcement authority would be a mistake.",
      "\"Once you start taking that threat away, you could return to where they'll throw safety to the wind, because there are other production pressures they have,\" Berkowitz said.",

    "story": [
      "An appellate court has allowed the Trump administration to end a program that grants temporary deportation protections and work permits to more than 10,000 people from Afghanistan and Cameroon.",
      "In a brief order Monday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit wrote that the plaintiff \u2014 an immigration advocacy group called CASA \u2014 has a plausible case against the administration for choosing to end temporary protected status, or TPS, for Afghans and Cameroonians. But the court said \"there is insufficient evidence to warrant the extraordinary remedy\" of blocking the government from phasing out TPS while the lawsuit works its way through the courts.",
      "One week ago, the appeals court temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending TPS for Afghanistan for one week, while it considered the merits of CASA's case.",
      "The administration had planned to end the program for Afghans last week. The program is set to end for Cameroonians in two weeks, on Aug. 4.",
      "The appellate court on Monday directed a lower court to \"move expeditiously\" to hear the case.",
      "Around\u00a011,700 Afghans\u00a0and\u00a05,200 Cameroonians\u00a0are enrolled in TPS, the government estimates. But roughly 3,600 of the Afghans and 200 of the Cameroonians have green cards, so they will not be affected. Those who lose their TPS protections can apply for asylum or some other form of legal status, but otherwise, they will be at risk of deportation.",
      "AfghanEvac, a group that has helped relocate Afghans, said in a statement it is \"deeply alarmed\" by Monday's ruling.",
      "\"Lives will be upended. Families will be separated. Allies will be detained, deported, or forced into hiding\u2014while their legal rights remain unsettled,\" AfghanEvac President Shawn VanDiver said in a statement Monday night.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House, the Department of Homeland Security and CASA for comment.",
      "The Trump administration has sought for months to roll back TPS, a program that allows the government to grant relief from deportation and work permits for people whose home countries are deemed unsafe due to natural disasters or war.",
      "The government argues that the TPS program is intended to be temporary, and Cameroon and Afghanistan are now safe enough for TPS recipients to return.",
      "Earlier this year, the Trump administration said Afghanistan's security situation and economy have improved despite the Taliban's 2021 takeover of the country following the U.S. military's withdrawal. And the government said a pair of armed conflicts in Cameroon \u2014 including a separatist conflict and an insurgency by the extremist group Boko Haram, which the U.S. designated a foreign terrorist organization in 2013 \u2014 are \"contained in limited regions\" and don't imperil people's personal safety in most of the country.",
      "\"This administration is returning TPS to its original temporary intent,\" Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said in a May statement announcing the Afghanistan decision.",
      "The State Department has placed a \"Do Not Travel\" advisory on Afghanistan, warning of the risk of \"civil unrest, crime, terrorism, risk of wrongful detention, kidnapping, and limited health facilities.\"  The department advises travelers to Cameroon to exercise caution, and not to travel to certain parts of the country due to armed violence, crime and terrorism.",
      "CASA has argued in court papers that both countries are unsafe, and TPS recipients could be endangered if they're forced to return to their home countries. The group says the conflict in Cameroon \u2014 which involves English-speaking separatists in a mostly French-speaking country \u2014 has created a humanitarian crisis and wrecked the African country's economy. And people from Afghanistan, the group notes, were made eligible for TPS because of repression by the Taliban and conflict between the group and ISIS-K insurgents.",
      "CASA also argues the administration hasn't followed the correct legal processes to end TPS, and contends the decision was \"preordained\" and based partly on \"racial animus.\"",
      "\"That animus is evidenced by the Trump Administration's efforts to eliminate lawful immigration status for noncitizens from countries the Administration believes are predominantly non-white, while simultaneously removing immigration barriers to noncitizens from countries the Administration believes are predominately white,\" the group said.",
      "Earlier this month, a lower court judge denied DHS's request to dismiss CASA's lawsuit, but also denied CASA's motion to halt the administration's policy. CASA appealed, causing it to reach the 4th Circuit.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to wind down TPS for hundreds of thousands of other migrants from Honduras, Nicaragua, Venezuela and Haiti. In May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to end TPS for Venezuelan migrants.",

      "Washington \u2014 Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia asked a federal judge overseeing his criminal case to put off his release from custody for 30 days if the judge rejects a Justice Department bid to keep him in confinement while awaiting a trial.",
      "Abrego Garcica's lawyers said in a filing that the 30-day pause in issuing a release order would give him time to evaluate his legal options in response to likely efforts by the Department of Homeland Security to deport him.",
      "\"We have been advised by the government that if the court denies the government's motion for revocation, the defendant would be transferred to the custody of the Department of Homeland Security ('DHS'), and DHS would begin removal proceedings,\" they wrote.",
      "The Justice Department does not object to the request, and Abrego Garcia's legal team said that the delay would not affect their ability to come up with a proposed schedule leading up to his criminal trial.",
      "A federal grand jury in Tennessee indicted Abrego Garcia\u00a0in late May on two counts of human smuggling. He has pleaded not guilty to both counts. A trial in his case is set to begin in January.",
      "Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador in March as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign, but his removal gained headlines after a federal immigration official acknowledged it was an administrative error. An immigration judge had granted Abrego Garcia a withholding of removal in 2019, which prevented DHS from deporting him to his home country of El Salvador because he was likely to face persecution by local gangs.",
      "Abrego Garcia, who has lived in Maryland after coming to the U.S. illegally in 2011, and his wife filed a civil lawsuit against the Trump administration in March challenging his removal, and a federal judge in Maryland ordered the government to facilitate his return to the U.S.",
      "After weeks of back-and-forth \u2014 and his case reaching the Supreme Court \u2014 Attorney General Pam Bondi announced in early June that Abrego Garcia had been released from Salvadoran custody and brought back to the U.S. to face criminal charges stemming from his alleged participation in a scheme to smuggle undocumented migrants into the country.",
      "A federal magistrate judge last month ordered Abrego Garcia's release from federal law enforcement custody while he awaits a trial, but that raised concerns that he would be swiftly detained by immigration agents and possibly deported. The Justice Department appealed that decision and asked a U.S. district judge to revoke the release order.",
      "The judge overseeing the criminal case, Waverly Crenshaw, held a hearing last week on the government's motion but has not yet ruled on whether to grant it. If Crenshaw denies the bid, it would give the green-light for Abrego Garcia to be released from criminal custody.",
      "But the prospect that Abrego Garcia would then swiftly be detained by the Department of Homeland Security for removal proceedings has created a new tangle for the courts to unravel. He has remained in the custody of U.S. Marshals as the legal proceedings have continued.",
      "In the ongoing civil case in Maryland, the federal judge is considering a separate request from Abrego Garcia's lawyers to return him to Maryland immediately after he is released from confinement in the criminal proceedings that are ongoing in Tennessee. They also asked the judge to bar the Trump administration from removing Abrego Garcia from the U.S.",

      "The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the documents, which number over 230,000 pages, \"had never been digitized and sat collecting dust in facilities across the federal government for decades, until today.\"",
      "The records include the FBI's \"discussion of potential leads, internal FBI memos detailing the progress of the case, and documents related to James Earl Ray's former cellmate, who stated he discussed with Ray an alleged assassination plot,\" according to ODNI. The agency says the release also includes CIA records on the search for Ray, who fled the U.S. before he was eventually captured and pleaded guilty to assassinating King.",
      "\"The American people have waited nearly sixty years to see the full scope of the federal government's investigation into Dr. King's assassination,\" Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said in a statement.",
      "ODNI called Monday's release \"the first time these records are published online in one collection with minimal redactions,\" though it said some records had been made public previously through Freedom of Information Act requests.",
      "ODNI said King's relatives were \"provided an opportunity to review the files\" two weeks ago.",
      "Prior to the release, some relatives of King pushed back on the plan, saying: \"For us, the assassination of our father is a deeply personal family loss that we have endured over the last 56 years. We hope to be provided the opportunity to review the files as a family prior to its public release.\"",
      "King's two living children, Bernice King and Martin Luther King III, said in a statement Monday they understood the records have \"long been a subject of interest,\" but urged people to engage with the files \"with empathy, restraint, and respect for our family's continued grief.\"",
      "The statement \u2014 released by the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change \u2014 pointed to the FBI's yearslong surveillance of King in the 1960s, which a Justice Department report later concluded was \"very probably\" illegal.",
      "\"While we support transparency and historical accountability, we object to any attacks on our father's legacy or attempts to weaponize it to spread falsehoods,\" the family members said. \"Those who promote the fruit of the FBI's surveillance will unknowingly align themselves with an ongoing campaign to degrade our father and the Civil Rights Movement.\"",
      "Bernice King addressed the release of the files in a \"Vanity Fair\" article Monday, writing, \"I wonder why I have to be confronted once again with something that was very confusing and distressing for me as a five-year-old. I am, honestly, not prepared to revisit the gruesome details of this painful history. For me, there is no real value in it; there is only reliving the trauma.\"",
      "Later Monday, she wrote on X, \"Now, do the Epstein files.\"",
      "King's niece, Alveda King, said in ODNI's statement that she supported the release, calling it \"a historic step towards the truth that the American people deserve.\"",
      "Shortly after returning to office, Mr. Trump ordered the government to declassify and release federal records on President John F. Kennedy's 1963 assassination, along with the 1968 killings of King and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. Records on JFK were released in March, and the government released several tranches of documents on RFK starting in April.",
      "All three assassinations have drawn decades of public curiosity, including theories about whether the people accused and convicted of assassinating the three men acted alone or were even responsible for the killings.",
      "Ray pleaded guilty to murdering King in Memphis one year after the assassination, and was sentenced to 99 years in prison, but he later recanted his guilty plea and spent years unsuccessfully seeking a new trial. He died in 1998.",

Their statement Monday pointed to a 1999 wrongful death suit in Tennessee civil court in which a jury concluded a man named Loyd Jowers and other co-conspirators, \"including government agencies,\" were linked to King's assassination.",
      "Other official findings have varied. The Justice Department conducted reviews of the assassination in 1977 and 2000, which asserted that Ray was the assassin and that he didn't act as part of a conspiracy.

    "published": "Mon, 21 Jul 2025 19:23:46 -0400",
    "summary": "Tulsi Gabbard released a memorandum and files regarding the intelligence community's assessment of Russia's actions during the 2016 election.",
    "story": [
      "The release of more than 100 pages of declassified files and a memorandum by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has reignited political battles over Russia's actions during the 2016 presidential election, a topic that has long incensed President Trump and put the actions of the U.S. intelligence community in partisan crosshairs.",
      "Gabbard's office on Friday alleged in the memorandum, which accompanied the files, that they contained what she called evidence of \"suppression\" and manipulation of the intelligence underlying a 2017 community-wide assessment of Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. The files include email exchanges, excerpts from a President's Daily Brief and a readout from a principals committee meeting, chiefly from a period during the Obama administration.",
      "In a statement and social media posts, Gabbard claimed the materials, which were marked declassified on July 17, 2025, were evidence of a \"treasonous conspiracy\" and \"years-long coup\" plotted by Obama administration officials against Mr. Trump, and said she would forward them to the Department of Justice as part of a criminal referral. She also said in subsequent media appearances that more declassifications about the matter would be made.",
      "Democrats fiercely disputed her claims, pointing to the findings of a bipartisan Senate investigation that concluded Russia had attempted to influence the 2016 election. They accused Gabbard herself of misrepresenting intelligence findings and processes.",
      "\"What you saw from the Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, was not just a lie, but a very dangerous lie, because when you start throwing around language like sedition and treason, somebody is going to get hurt,\" said Congressman Jim Himes, ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday.",
      "\"[T]he intelligence community is full of very good people who do their jobs every single day, and now they're watching their leader do something that each and every one of them knows is dishonest,\" Himes said.",
      "\"This is just another example of the DNI trying to cook the books, rewrite history, and erode trust in the intelligence agencies she's supposed to be leading,\" Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner of Virginia said in a statement.",
      "The memorandum released by Gabbard appears to conflate different kinds of Russian operations during the 2016 election cycle while alleging Obama administration officials fabricated a narrative designed to undermine Mr. Trump. It points several times to select phrases in the documents that say Russia lacked the intent or the capability to use cyber operations to target U.S. election infrastructure, change vote tallies, and overturn the election \u2014 which previous investigations agreed did not happen.",
      "But while no evidence emerged to indicate Russia engaged in a vote-switching cyberattack, there was evidence that showed a multi-pronged Kremlin influence campaign that attempted to sway American voters. That influence campaign included hack-and-leak operations and social media posts designed to undermine the candidacy of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and bolster then-candidate Trump's, according to the intelligence community's assessment.",
      "In the years after the 2016 presidential election, multiple reviews of the intelligence community's findings \u2014 including the Senate report and an investigation led by special counsel John Durham, who was appointed by Mr. Trump \u2014 reinforced its conclusions.",
      "A CIA review of the tradecraft involved in the agency's assessment released earlier this month found some of its judgments may have been rushed and the confidence levels attached to one of them may have been too high, but it did not change the conclusion that Russia's efforts were designed to benefit Mr. Trump's candidacy.",
      "Gabbard's statements on Friday were praised and recirculated multiple times by the president, senior White House officials and Republican lawmakers. Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Tom Cotton wrote in a social media post, \"It will take decades for the Intelligence Community to recover from the damage done during the Obama and Biden presidencies.\"",
      "Senior White House official Stephen Miller wrote that Gabbard had \"exposed the startling depths of a seditious coup against the Republic.\"",
      "The memorandum also criticizes leaks from what it terms \"IC officials\" or \"Deep State officials in the IC\" \u2014 with \"IC\" referring to the intelligence community \u2014 to media outlets at the time the assessments were being drafted that said Russia had intervened in the election in an effort to help President Trump. The memo does not, however, identify these individuals or provide other evidence about the origin of those disclosures.",
      "It also highlights instances in which certain agencies disputed or pushed to change language included in evolving intelligence assessments of Russia's cyber activity. For instance, it cites an FBI official who suggested in an exchange in September of 2016 that language about Russia's intent to use cyber attacks to disrupt the 2016 election be \"softened.\"",
      "\"[W]e would prefer for the first sentence regarding Russia's intent to be softened,\" the official wrote. \"The way it currently reads, it would indicate that we have definitive information that Russia does intend to disrupt our elections and we are uncomfortable making that assessment at this point.\"",
      "Dissents from different agencies are common and conclusions can change as more intelligence is collected or analysis is done, according to current and former officials familiar with the drafting process for intelligence assessments. It is not clear from the redacted selection of emails released by Gabbard how the language flagged by the FBI was finalized.",
      "Warner has expressed concerns about the effect of Gabbard's recent actions on intelligence sharing by partners of the United States, noting that representatives of the intelligence-sharing alliance known as the Five Eyes \u2014 which includes the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Canada \u2014 had approached him for answers.",
      "\"I have had Five Eye partners say, 'Warner, what the hell is going on?'\" Warner said during a panel discussion at last week's Aspen Security forum, hours before the 2016 files were released. \"I do believe our Five Eyes partners and others are not sharing as much information as they would.\"",

      "A Wall Street Journal reporter was slated to join the president and a small group of other reporters aboard Air Force One as a part of the traveling press pool for Mr. Trump's trip to Scotland later this month. But White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that because of what she called the paper's \"fake and defamatory conduct,\" the Wall Street Journal will not participate. Mr. Trump filed a libel lawsuit over the story on Friday, asking for at least $20 billion in damages.",
      "\"Thirteen diverse outlets will participate in the press pool to cover the president's trip to Scotland. Due to the Wall Street Journal's fake and defamatory conduct, they will not be one of the thirteen outlets on board,\" Leavitt said in a statement. \"Every news organization in the entire world wishes to cover President Trump, and the White House has taken significant steps to include as many voices as possible.\"",
      "The Wall Street Journal has not yet responded to a request for comment. The paper has stood by its reporting.",
      "On Thursday, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0published a story\u00a0claiming the letter, from the early 2000s, featured Mr. Trump's signature as well as a birthday message and a drawing of a nude woman. According to the Journal's report, it was collected in a book along with letters from other friends and acquaintances to mark Epstein's 50th birthday in 2003.",
      "The president has denied the report, calling the letter a \"FAKE.\" CBS News has not reviewed or verified the letter.",
      "Mr. Trump is visiting his ancestral home of Scotland from July 25-29, with stops in Aberdeen and Turnberry, where he owns golf courses.",
      "Being a part of the press pool allows a small but rotating group of reporters access to the president's daily happenings and travels, often offering journalists opportunities to ask questions of the president.",
      "The White House Correspondents' Association urged the Trump administration to reverse its decision.",
      "\"This attempt by the White House to punish a media outlet whose coverage it does not like is deeply troubling, and it defies the First Amendment. Government retaliation against news outlets based on the content of their reporting should concern all who value free speech and an independent media,\" said WHCA President Weijia Jiang, who also serves as CBS News' senior White House correspondent.",
      "The Trump administration has asserted more power over the press pool than prior administrations, which have usually deferred to the White House press corps to decide who participates and when.",
      "The Associated Press's access to\u00a0spaces like the Oval Office and Air Force One was curtailed earlier this year for not abiding by Mr. Trump's decision to change the Gulf of Mexico's name to the Gulf of America. The wire service sued over the change, winning an early victory in district court, but an appeals court eventually let the Trump administration limit the AP's access to restricted spaces.",
      "\"As the appeals court confirmed, the Wall Street Journal or any other news outlet are not guaranteed special access to cover President Trump in the Oval Office, aboard Air Force One, and in his private workspaces,\" Leavitt said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "Sen. Maria Cantwell is urging President Trump to prioritize modernizing the nation's weather forecasting system, saying the investment will save lives as well as money down the road. She released a letter to the president Monday, following through on her pledge to provide guidance that the administration can use to upgrade weather forecasting infrastructure.",
      "\"The money will save you money, for sure,\" Cantwell said in an interview on CBS News Monday. \"The kind of investments you could make here are about taking a $20 billion [disaster] event and saying, if we would have done these things in advance, it wouldn't have cost us that much money. If storms are costing us this much, we have to come up with better solutions.\"",
      "The Democratic congresswoman, a prominent voice in environmental policy on Capitol Hill and ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, which oversees weather and disasters. Cantwell penned the letter in the wake of disastrous flooding that killed at least 135 people in Central Texas. The July 4 flash flood prompted a massive search and recovery operations and raised questions about whether forecasts and warnings could have been more effective\u00a0ahead of time.",
      "Cantwell's letter outlined five bipartisan recommendations to improve U.S. forecasting. It comes as\u00a0the Trump administration continues to make cuts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the federal agency focused on weather and climate, and the National Weather Service, its subagency in charge of daily forecasts.",
      "NOAA\u00a0is slated to see a 27% reduction in its budget at the start of the 2026 fiscal year, which could impact weather forecasting in a number of ways, including terminating research programs aimed at helping predict future precipitation rates and improve flash flood warning systems. The committee recently held a confirmation hearing for Dr. Neil Jacobs to become NOAA's new leader.",
      "\"Communities across the United States are experiencing more frequent, intense, and costly flash floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, atmospheric rivers, landslides, heatwaves, and wildfires,\" Cantwell's letter said. She cited deadly \u2014 and costly \u2014 natural disasters that have ravaged communities around the United States in the last two years alone, including the Texas floods as well as last year's flooding from Hurricane Helene in\u00a0North Carolina\u00a0and the devastating fires in\u00a0Los Angeles\u00a0and the Hawaiian island of Maui.",
      "Examples like these suggest \"that providing Americans with more timely and accurate weather information can avoid billions in property losses and save lives,\" she wrote.",
      "Responding to the letter, a White House spokesperson told CBS News in a statement that \"the Trump administration has already been hard at work on re-orienting NOAA and NWS [the National Weather Service] away from pursuing climate change activism to instead focus on its core mission and modernizing the agencies' outdated technology to provide faster, more accurate weather models.\"",
      "Cantwell's recommendations emphasize improvements in how weather data is collected and analyzed, as well as systems for notifying communities of severe weather. They include:",
      "Upgrading the country's Doppler radar network with \"phased array radar,\" a higher resolution system to monitor weather conditions, profile wind patterns and perform aircraft tracking simultaneously. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has said this type of radar allows for more \"focused observations of storms,\" compared with Doppler's abilities, and provides quicker updates for meteorologists tasked with predicting and alerting the public to sudden changes during an extreme event.Replacing older weather satellites, relied on by NOAA and its National Weather Service, with next-generation satellites, which \"can track lightning strikes that start wildfires, wildfire smoke, red tides that poison fisheries, and generally provide better extreme weather early warning capabilities,\" according to Cantwell's letter.Improving NOAA's Integrated Ocean Observing System, which uses instruments like buoys to collects ocean data that is often integral to weather forecasting, including for search and rescue initiatives and navigation more broadly.Investing in supercomputing, data analytics, and a forecasting technique called data assimilation, to increase the accuracy of NOAA's weather prediction model, which tends to be less accurate than its European counterpart.Bolstering weather and climate research through NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research. The office is a bedrock of climate prediction efforts worldwide, multiple meteorologists currently and formerly employed by the federal agency have told CBS News. But Mr. Trump's 2026 budget plan proposes eliminating it altogether.Modernizing weather alert systems to help first responders and the public prepare for, and react to, extreme weather events.Advancing bipartisan legislation that supports expanding weather research and forecasting endeavors, such as the Weather Act Reauthorization Act of 2024, which Cantwell introduced alongside Sen.

    "published": "Mon, 21 Jul 2025 17:56:34 -0400",
    "summary": "Trump said he wants a \"simple redrawing\" of Texas' congressional map \u2014 it would enable Republicans to pick up five seats.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Texas Legislature is convening Monday for a special session where it will attempt to redraw the state's congressional map to boost President Trump and his allies' efforts to maintain the GOP's grip on the U.S. House in next year's midterm elections.",
      "The state's decision to recraft the boundaries of House districts comes midway through the decade and several years after its GOP-controlled Legislature adopted a redistricting plan in the wake of the 2020 Census.",
      "Under that plan, Republicans hold 25 of the state's 38 congressional seats, while Democrats control 12. (The death of Rep. Sylvester Turner, a Democrat, has left one seat open.)",
      "But with Republicans holding a razor-thin majority in the House, and the risk the GOP could lose control of the chamber in the 2026 midterms, a reshaping of the congressional districts could give Mr. Trump's party an edge heading into next year's elections.",
      "Mr. Trump's political team had been pushing Texas GOP leaders to look into redrawing the state's congressional map, The New York Times reported last month. Gov. Greg Abbott confirmed the Legislature would undertake the effort, among 17 other agenda items, when it meets. Ahead of the start of the special session, the Texas House speaker announced the creation of a new 21-member select committee on congressional redistricting. The panel consists of 12 Republican state House members and nine Democrats.",
      "\"I don't think this has anything to do with Texas \u2014 this has to do with Trump,\" said Joshua Blank, the research director of the Texas Politics Project. \"This has nothing to do with the internal dynamics of the state, the political trajectory of the state. This is purely about this election cycle and one person's benefit.\"",
      "How did we get here?",
      "States undergo the redistricting process after every 10-year census, when voting lines are redrawn to account for population changes. After the 2020 Census, Texas crafted a new congressional map to include two new districts, bringing its total number of House seats to 38.",
      "The maps drawn by the GOP-led Texas Legislature aimed to protect Republican seats in Congress and the statehouse. Democrats flipped two congressional districts and 12 state House seats in the 2018 midterms.",
      "\"In 2021, they spent a lot of time and effort making sure they had the best maps possible with the primary goal to ensure that the Republican majority was rock solid,\" said Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University. \"And they created 24 of 38 districts where there is no way, shape or form that a Republican is losing those districts, absent some type of murder indictment or a serial adulterer, etc.\"",
      "But the final version of the congressional map was met with criticism, and it has been challenged in court. Among the issues raised by voting rights groups is that 95% of Texas' growth has been driven by non-White voters, but the map crafted in 2021 created more majority-White districts.",
      "A three-judge panel in El Paso is currently considering a consolidated challenge to the map brought by voting rights groups, Latino voters and lawmakers. The plaintiffs argue that the new lines violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. A trial ended in June.",
      "Texas has a part-time Legislature, which meets for 140 days every two years. The governor has the power to call special sessions to cover specific topics, and the special sessions constitutionally cannot last longer than 30 days. The governor can, however, call as many special sessions as he deems necessary. After the 88th legislative session in 2023, Abbott called four special sessions that stretched into December.",
      "Redistricting is one of 18 topics that Abbott has asked the Legislature to address. Four of those topics include disaster relief for the Central Texas floods and improving the state's warning system.",
      "\"I'm not convinced that the goal is to pass everything, but ultimately, Abbott gets the credit for trying, and the Legislature will get the credit for what it can accomplish, but it'll also get the blame for what it fails to do,\" Blank said.",
      "Although the Democrats could leave the state to deny Republicans a quorum, like they did in 2021 to protest a voting bill, it's unlikely they would do so if it meant holding up flood relief.",
      "Where does Trump and his administration come into play?",
      "Texas has conducted two congressional elections under the 2021 map. But earlier this month, the Justice Department sent Abbott a letter alleging that some of the districts were racial gerrymanders that violate the Constitution's 14th Amendment.",
      "Harmeet Dhillon, who heads the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, specifically pinpointed four districts \u2014 the 9th, 18th, 29th and 33rd \u2014 that she said constitute \"coalition districts\" that should be redrawn. All three are currently represented by Democrats, and Turner, who died in March, represented the fourth.",
      "Coalition districts are those that bring two or more racial minorities together to make up a majority of the population, and where voters from these groups vote together to elect their preferred candidate.",
      "In her letter, Dhillon wrote that the state had to \"immediately\" rectify the alleged racial gerrymanders, and if it chose not to, it was at risk of legal action by the attorney general.",
      "\"The congressional districts at issue are nothing more than vestiges of an unconstitutional racially based gerrymandering past, which must be abandoned, and must now be corrected by Texas,\" she wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump appears to be on board with the recrafting of Texas' voting boundaries. Before leaving the White House on Tuesday, the president said he is looking for a \"simple redrawing\" where Republicans pick up five seats.",
      "\"Texas would be the biggest one,\" he said.",
      "But during the trial in the case involving the congressional map, state officials repeatedly said they were motivated not by race when they drew the district lines, but instead driven by politics. State Sen. Joan Huffman, a Republican who led the 2021 Senate Redistricting Committee, testified that the congressional map was \"drawn blind to race\" and \"racial data was not considered at all during the drawing of the maps,\" according to court records.",
      "\"There is no legal justification for doing this. It sort of walks and talks and quacks like a political move,\" said Michael Li, a redistricting expert at New York University's Brennan Center for Justice. \"The problem is that it's really difficult to get more seats in Texas without heavily undermining the political power of communities of color.\"",
      "In claims of racial gerrymandering, those challenging a map have to show that race predominated for how the lines were drawn.",
      "\"This can't be a racial gerrymander if they didn't consider race,\" Li said. \"This is a textbook, easy it's-not-a-racial-gerrymander. \u2026 If you didn't consider race, it can't be a racial gerrymander.\"",
      "Has Texas drawn new maps in the middle of the decade before?",
      "A divided Texas Legislature drew up a congressional map in 2001, but two years later, in a plan engineered by then-U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay and Texas House Speaker Tom Craddick, Republicans wanted to redraw the lines to make the most of the growing GOP majority in the state.",
      "Fifty-one Democrats in the state House fled to Oklahoma for four days, denying the Republicans the quorum they needed to bring the redistricting plan to the floor and letting the clock run out on the regular session. Then-Gov. Rick Perry called the Legislature back for a special session, but state Senate Democrats left the state to deny a quorum.",
      "Although the Democrats remained out of state for more than a month, they couldn't stop the maps from eventually passing, and Republicans ultimately picked up five seats. The Supreme Court upheld the congressional districts in 2018.",
      "But former Democratic Rep. Mark Strama, who ran for office after that round of redistricting, warned the effort did have some downsides for Republicans. The drama was covered nationally, and Strama himself flipped a Central Texas district in 2005.",
      "\"Voters were mad at both sides,\" Strama said. \"They hate all these political shenanigans. But there's no question voters hate this.\"",
      "While Texas has redrawn the lines of congressional districts in the middle of a decade before, Li said the current situation is far from normal.",
      "\"Outside of litigation, it is extremely rare,\" he said. \"And it's exceptionally rare \u2014 in fact, I can't think of another circumstance, where a party drew the map, and then that same party redrew the map. Where there are mid-decade redistrictings, it's usually because political control changes hands.\"",
      "Could this plan backfire?",
      "While Democrats have not won statewide office in Texas since 1994, the best year Democrats have had at the ballot in the past two decades was in 2018. In that midterm election, former Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke came within three points of GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, and Democrats flipped two congressional seats and 12 state House seats.",
      "Republicans have managed to quell those gains and, as Jones noted, the 2024 election was a high point for the party. But the dynamics of the 2026 election could mirror those in 2018, when Democrats ran aggressive campaigns targeting Mr. Trump and retook the House. Any changes to the congressional map might not be enough to stem Democratic gains this time around.",
      "\"If Republicans do engage, do go all out and try with the goal of flipping, say three, four, even five seats as President Trump says \u2014 it's far more likely Republicans see a net loss than a net gain,\" Jones said.",
      "Plus, any map adopted by the GOP-led Legislature and approved by Abbott is likely to be swiftly met with lawsuits. If a federal court blocks its use, the new district lines may not even be in place for the 2026 midterms.",
      "\"President Trump is talking about five more seats out of Texas, and the only way you get five more seats out of Texas is if you seriously undermine the political power and the political voice of communities of color,\" Li said. \"And that is a Texas-sized lawsuit with potentially huge ramifications.\"",
      "Li said the redrawing of political bounds to give Republicans a leg up in the 2026 midterm elections is not only a legally risky move, but could be politically perilous too.",
      "\"The essence of trying to get more seats is that you have to spread your voters out more if you're a Republican,\" he said. \"So you have a bunch more districts that you're not winning by 65 or 70%. You're going to have a bunch of districts that you're winning by 52, 53% and in a state that is changing as fast as Texas, that's growing as fast as Texas, that's changing demographically as fast as Texas. By 2030, these districts could look and perform very differently.\"",
      "The 2020 Census showed that people of color accounted for 95% of Texas' population growth over the prior decade. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau released last year also showed that the number of Asian Americans in Texas grew by nearly 92,000 people, while there were more than 91,000 new Black residents in the state.",
      "\"When you gerrymander, you're making a bet that you know what the politics of the future will look like,\" Li said. \"There are many places where you can safely bet on what the politics of the future will look like in the country. Texas is not one of those places. It's just changing too fast.\"",
      "Republicans have made big gains in South Texas' Rio Grande Valley, once considered a Democratic stronghold. But even with those GOP gains \u2014 and running on the maps drawn in 2021\u00a0 \u2014 two of the three seats remained Democratic in 2024.",
      "\"People talk about the Rio Grande Valley as if it's somehow indicative of Texas,\" said Blank of the Texas Politics Project. \"It's less than 3.5% of the total statewide vote, and it's incredibly economically depressed and it's overwhelmingly Hispanic. It's not really indicative of any part of the state, it's indicative of its region of the country that happens to share a border with Mexico.\"",
      "What can Democrats do?",
      "Democrats on Capitol Hill and in the states have lambasted Republicans for pushing to redraw congressional district lines to hold onto power in the House.",
      "\"Elected officials should earn the support of voters they hope to represent,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters Tuesday. \"Republicans want a country where politicians choose their voters, not the other way around. It reeks of desperation, and we're going to do everything that we can in Texas and beyond to respond.\"",
      "Jeffries said the reason for the special session in Texas is to \"try to steal the midterm elections by rigging\" the state's congressional map.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, meanwhile, has suggested that Democrats mount their own partisan gerrymander. California has 52 congressional districts, and Democrats represent 43 of them.",
      "\"There are *currently* 9 Republicans in the California Congressional Delegation. Just thought folks might like to know that fun fact,\" he wrote on X\u00a0on Tuesday.",
      "During an appearance on the podcast \"Pod Save America,\" Newsom accused Republicans of trying to \"rig the game\" because they're concerned about maintaining control of the House next year.",
      "California voters approved a constitutional amendment in 2010 that handed over the task of crafting congressional and state legislative districts to an independent commission. But Newsom suggested there are still two paths that could lead to a new congressional map: calling a special session of the California Legislature to put a measure on the ballot for a special election that would clear the way for new House district lines; or having the state Legislature create a new map under the idea that it's coming mid-decade and not after the census.",
      "\"It ups the stakes of the redistricting war, with the acknowledgment that Democrats have a limited hand to play,\" Li said of Texas' decision to draw new congressional lines.",
      "Just 15 states have Democratic trifectas, where they control the state legislature and the governorship. Two of those states, Colorado and Michigan, leave the drawing of political voting lines to independent commissions like California does. Republicans are in full control in 23 states.",
      "Plus, in other states where Democrats control the legislature and governor's mansions, the congressional delegations already heavily skew Democratic. In Illinois, for example, Democrats hold 14 of its 17 House seats. Maryland's eight-member congressional delegation contains just one Republican.",
      "Texas Democrat Beto O'Rourke, a former House lawmaker who has left the door open for a Senate run next year, told CBS News' \"The Takeout\" on Monday that Democrats should \"fight fire with fire,\" referring to Newsom's suggestion of taking on redistricting in California.",
      "\"Far too often, Democrats are more interested in being right than they are in being in power,\" O'Rourke said. \"If we're coloring in the lines while the Republicans are tearing up the coloring book right in front of us, we're going to continue to lose power and be less relevant to the Americans that we want to support and help\"",

      "Last week, the Pentagon released about 2,000 of the 4,000 members of the National Guard in L.A. With the Marines headed home, there are still about 2,000 guardsmen in the L.A. area to protect federal property and personnel as they conduct law enforcement.",

    "summary": "The gap between the RNC and DNC is wider now than it was at this same stage of the first midterm cycle after Trump's 2016 victory.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican National Committee ended the first half of 2025 with a $65.56 million cash on hand advantage over the Democratic Party, as the left works to rebound from 2024 election losses and the right continues to deeply intertwine its future with President Trump.",
      "New campaign finance filings show the RNC had more than $80.7 million at the end of June, while the Democratic National Committee finished with around $15.2 million in cash on hand as both parties prepare for next year's midterm elections.",
      "\"The RNC has been working hand in glove with President Trump's team to build the war chest needed to protect and expand our Republican majorities in Congress next year,\" RNC spokesperson Kiersten Pels said in a statement. \"Vice President Vance has done an amazing job as the RNC's finance chair working with Chairman Whatley to do just that, and we're not going to stop.\"",
      "The gap between the two is far wider than this same time period before the 2018 midterms, when the RNC's cash on hand advantage over the DNC was $37.2 million at the end of June 2017. The political dynamics at that point were similar to now, with President Trump months removed from winning the White House and Republicans controlling the House and Senate. In the 2018 midterms, Democrats won back the House and started to build momentum that carried over into Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election.",
      "While the midterms are still more than a year away, it already appears likely the House will be Democrats' easiest route to winning back power in Washington. Republicans are also contending with the potential challenge that often befalls the party of the president, where the midterms become a referendum on the commander in chief.",
      "Democrats are facing continued questions about their approach moving forward after last fall's election setbacks, where Mr. Trump won a second term as president and the party lost the Senate and failed to retake the House. Earlier this year, party leaders chose Ken Martin, then the head of Minnesota's Democratic Party, to take over the DNC in an attempt to gain stronger footing with next year's midterms and the 2028 presidential election in mind.",
      "But in his first months as party chair, Martin was forced to contend with intraparty tensions and disputes as he attempted to offer a stronger counter to Mr. Trump's second term and Republican control in Washington.",
      "The Martin-led DNC has succeeded however in raising more money than the national party organization did at this same stage in 2017, and in a recent news release, the DNC shared its finding that \"contributions during the first five months of Chair Martin's leadership are nearly 2:1 dollars raised in the months after the 2016 cycle.\"",
      "\"The DNC is breaking grassroots fundraising records, bringing on more volunteers than ever, and raising record-setting funds to beat Republicans. Democrats are back in the ring thanks to grassroots energy across all 50 states, and together, we're going to defeat the toxic Republican agenda and put this country back on track for hard-working families,\" Martin said in a statement.",
      "But the new round of campaign finance disclosures also underscores the challenges Democrats continue to face this year. Through the first six months of 2025, filings show the DNC taking in a little more than $69 million while the RNC's total receipts were over $96 million.",

      "When Alina Habba was installed by President Trump as acting U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey on March 24, a 120-day stopwatch was immediately triggered.",
      "That's how long an interim U.S. attorney can serve without Senate confirmation, unless the state's district court judges vote in a rare meeting to extend that deadline, which expires Tuesday.",
      "Habba has not received Senate confirmation and faces an uphill battle in a state represented by two Democratic senators adamantly opposed to her holding the office. That leaves it up to the state's judges, who have a decision to make Monday about Habba.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche urged the judges to allow her to remain in the job in a pair of social media posts on Sunday evening and Monday morning.",
      "Habba \"has brought steady leadership and sound judgment as interim U.S. Attorney for New Jersey,\" wrote Blanche. \"She has the full confidence of [the president] and DOJ. District judges should use their authority to keep her in place.\"",
      "Habba did not immediately reply to questions from CBS News. She was nominated by Mr. Trump on July 1 for a full term as U.S. attorney.",
      "Blanche led Mr. Trump's personal criminal defense team, and Habba led his personal civil defense team in multiple major cases during the years between his terms in office. Habba had never worked in law enforcement prior to her appointment to the U.S. attorney's office.",
      "Blanche wrote that \"Habba has the full confidence of DOJ leadership because she's doing the job\u2014aggressively, independently, and by the book. The district judges should not be swayed by political noise. Keep her in place.\"",
      "Habba's brief tenure as the top federal law enforcer in her home state has been tumultuous. But she has received permission to hire 20 new prosecutors, according to the New Jersey Globe, a major achievement amid drastic workforce cuts across the federal government.",
      "She has also repeatedly clashed with the state's top Democrats.",
      "The role of a U.S. attorney is traditionally viewed as nonpartisan, but Habba told an interviewer early in her time in office that she aimed to help \"turn New Jersey red,\" referring to the color associated with Republicans. \"I think New Jersey is absolutely close to getting there,\" she told right-wing outlet Real America's Voice. \"So, hopefully while I'm there, I can help that cause.\"",
      "She also announced investigations into New Jersey's Democratic governor and attorney general, who oppose the president's immigration measures. In May, Habba's office charged Newark Mayor Ras Baraka with criminal trespassing and U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver with assault after a protest at an immigration facility.",

    "summary": "Immigration agents will arrest anyone they find in the country illegally, even if they lack a criminal record, acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said in an exclusive CBS News interview.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 In an exclusive interview with CBS News, the head of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said his agents will arrest anyone they find in the country illegally, even if they lack a criminal record, while also cracking down on companies hiring unauthorized workers.",
      "Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, said his agency will prioritize its \"limited resources\" on arresting and deporting \"the worst of the worst,\" such as those in the U.S. unlawfully who also have serious criminal histories.",
      "But Lyons said non-criminals living in the U.S. without authorization will also be taken into custody during arrest operations, arguing that states and cities with \"sanctuary\" policies that limit cooperation between ICE and local law enforcement are forcing his agents to go into communities by not turning over noncitizen inmates.",
      "\"What's, again, frustrating for me is the fact that we would love to focus on these criminal aliens that are inside a jail facility,\" Lyons said during his first sit-down network interview on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"A local law enforcement agency, state agency already deemed that person a public safety threat and arrested them and they're in detention.\"",
      "\"I'd much rather focus all of our limited resources on that to take them into custody, but we do have to go out into the community and make those arrests, and that's where you are seeing (that) increase\" in so-called \"collateral\" arrests, Lyons added, referring to individuals who are not the original targets of operations but are nonetheless found to be in the U.S. unlawfully.",
      "If ICE encounters someone \"that is here in the country illegally, we will take them into custody,\" Lyons said.",
      "\"We have opened up the whole aperture\"",
      "Collateral arrests by ICE were effectively banned under the Biden administration, which issued rules instructing deportation officers to largely focus on arresting serious criminal offenders, national security threats and migrants who recently entered the U.S. illegally. That policy was reversed immediately after President Trump took office for a second time in January.",
      "As part of Mr. Trump's promise to crack down on illegal immigration, his administration has given ICE a broad mandate, with White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller pushing the agency to conduct 3,000 daily arrests. While ICE has so far not gotten close to that number, the agency just received tens of billions of dollars in additional funds from Congress to turbo-charge its deportation campaign.",
      "Lyons said \"it's possible\" to meet the administration's target of 1 million deportations in a year with the new infusion of funds. ICE has recorded nearly 150,000 deportations in Mr. Trump's first six months in office, according to internal government data obtained by CBS News.",
      "From Jan. 1 to June 24, ICE deported around 70,000 people with criminal convictions, but many of the documented infractions were for immigration or traffic offenses, according to data obtained by CBS News.",
      "While the administration frequently highlights arrests of non-citizens convicted of serious crimes like murder and rape, ICE also has sparked backlash in communities across the country due to some of its tactics and actions, including the use of masks by agents (which Lyons said will continue due to concerns about the safety of his officers), arrests of asylum-seekers attending court hearings and raids on worksites.",
      "\"ICE is always focused on the worst of the worst,\" Lyons said. \"One difference you'll see now is under this administration, we have opened up the whole aperture of the immigration portfolio.\"",
      "Lyons promises to hold companies accountable",
      "Another major policy at ICE under the second Trump administration is the lifting of a Biden-era pause on large-scale immigration raids at worksites.",
      "In recent weeks, federal immigration authorities have arrested hundreds of suspected unauthorized workers at a meatpacking plant in Nebraska, a horse racetrack in Louisiana and cannabis farms in southern California. At the cannabis farms alone, officials took into custody more than 300 immigrants who were allegedly in the country unlawfully, including 10 minors.",
      "Amid concerns from industry leaders that Mr. Trump's crackdown was hurting their businesses, ICE in June ordered a halt to immigration roundups at farms, hotels and restaurants. But that pause lasted only a matter of days. Since then, the president has talked about giving farmers with workers who are not in the U.S. legally a \"pass,\" though his administration has not provided further details on what that would entail.",
      "In his interview with CBS News, Lyons said ICE would continue worksite immigration enforcement, saying there's no ban on such actions. He said those operations would rely on criminal warrants against employers suspected of hiring unauthorized immigrants, which he said is not a \"victimless crime,\" noting such investigations often expose forced labor or child trafficking.",
      "\"Not only are we focused on those individuals that are, you know, working here illegally, we're focused on these American companies that are actually exploiting these laborers, these people that came here for a better life,\" Lyons said.",
      "Asked to confirm that ICE plans to hold those employing immigrants in the U.S. illegally accountable \u2014 and not just arrest the workers themselves \u2014 Lyons said, \"One hundred percent.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting director Todd Lyons that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 20, 2025.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 Director Lyons, thank you so much for your time.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR OF IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT TODD LYONS: Oh, appreciate it. Appreciate it. Thanks for coming.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: You are leading the agency that is at the center of President Trump's top domestic policy agenda, immigration enforcement and cracking down on illegal immigration. How do you see ICE's role in this administration?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 Well, I think, definitely, I see it as a law enforcement tool, right? So ICE is really focused on its public safety mission. I think under all administrations, that what ICE truly is, it's a law enforcement entity. And I really think right now, our main focus is public safety, and that's- that's my focus. The main focus is to keep American people safe and to enact our law enforcement mission.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 The administration has set a goal of carrying out about a million deportations per year annually. Congress just gave your agency $45 billion just to fund its detention network, and also another $30 billion to boost deportation efforts. What exactly will that money fund, and what do we expect that to look on the ground?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 On the ground, what we're really focused on is definitely hiring more in our ranks. In order to achieve the President's mission, and under Secretary Noem's vision, we definitely need more officers and agents.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Do you know how many?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 We're looking to hire about 10,000 and- but that's we've been depleted over the past four years. Our ranks have really shrunk, and we really don't have enough to do law enforcement mission. One of the big hampers for us is with the increase in sanctuary cities and sanctuary policies, we have to send more officers and agents out into the community, out on the street. Where we'd only take us two agents, say, going into a secure facility or a police station, county jail to arrest a public safety threat, well, we have to send out four to five agents, and with the increase of assaults on officers, we sometimes have to send out eight to ten just to provide security for those officers that are making the arrest. So that's one of the big things that we're looking forward to with this increased funding is increasing our manpower. Not only just officers, but our attorneys as well, to ensure that we have enough of legal support to go ahead and deal with the Department of Justice, immigration court appeals, things like that.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Detention facilities too.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 Detention facility as well, yeah.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Is the goal of 1 million deportations per year now possible because of this money?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 I definitely think it's possible. One thing though, that ICE is historically known for in our mission is we detain to remove, we don't detain punitively. So people do hear that increase in the bed space, but it's not for long-term. We, you know, it's- we detain people to remove them. So what we want to do, too, is focus on the removal efforts as well, because one thing we want to do is remove people in a safe, humane manner, but also efficiently as well, quickly. There's no reason for someone to linger in a detention facility after they've been lawfully ordered by immigration judge. We want to ensure that they can get back to their home country safely and quickly.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 More than a dozen individuals are facing charges for that violent attack against an ICE facility in Texas. The Department of Homeland Security, as you know, has also reported a sharp increase in attacks against your agents. What do you think is behind that?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 You know, I honestly have to say, I think it's just the increased rhetoric that we hear against ICE officers and the ICE mission. If we think back to when you and I did a ride along last year, in October. You know, you and I spent a good amount of time together observing teams in the field, and you didn't see the officers and agents that day masked up, right? You didn't see any kind of violence towards us, any protests. Even going back to January 20, beginning of this administration, up until the middle of February, you really didn't see that kind of rhetoric or violence coming against ICE officers and agents like you do now. I think the sharp increase in the rhetoric, especially from a lot of elected officials that are shaming, if you will, or speaking out against the ICE law enforcement mission, is what's really increasing these attacks on officers. And that, unfortunately, the Alvarado incident down in Prairieland, that is one that's really taken it to the next level. We've seen protests. We've seen rocks. Rocks, in itself, could be a deadly weapon, but now we have individuals laying in ambush with firearms to attack an ICE facility. Just the increase is amazing. The fact that, like you said, 830% increase from last year assaults on officers. That's what really keeps me up at night, is because we have to focus on the men and women of ICE, keeping them safe, making sure they go home to their families, our other partners, as well as the people in the community we interact with. You know, someone might interject themselves into this arrest of someone that's wanted for, say, a murder in their home country, a violent felon who has nothing to lose. And one of these people, agitators or protesters, might get involved in an ICE law enforcement arrest, and they could get injured as well. So there's a lot of factors that really come with this rhetoric against ICE officers and agents.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 Do you think the increase in attacks against ICE officers is connected to the broader increase in ICE arrests across the country? Because you're seeing more arrests, you're seeing more attacks, too.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 I think we're seeing both. I think because we are more visible in the community. You know, there was- recently, people had talked about the amount of support that ICE had under President Obama. Well, during those times, we did make more custodial arrests, those arrests like you would--",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: In jails--",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: --in the jails, right? We weren't really out there. We just don't see that now with a lot of the sanctuary policies and just a lot of- lot of lack of cooperation. So you are seeing us out more, and I think there is more of a tension, kind of like you said, the immigration mission is one of the forefront of this administration, so it is a lot of scrutiny and publicity to it. So I think that's also leading to a lot of the, you know, the rhetoric, the criticism, and just a lot more of the increased violence on officers.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 And you have cited those concerns about officer safety when defending your agents wearing masks during operations. That has become a polarizing debate. What do you say, director, to the criticism that law enforcement officials, including ICE officers, should be identifying themselves, and that the use of masks could be potentially dangerous, including because it could lead to imposters posing as ICE agents.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yeah, and that's one of our biggest concerns, and I've said it publicly before, I'm not a proponent of the masks. However, if that's a tool that the men and women of ICE to keep themselves and their family safe, then I will allow it. I do kind of push back on the criticism that they don't identify themselves. If you see a lot of the photos, like we were out that day, like I would go back to our ride along. Men and women of ICE and our DOJ partners in local law enforcement do help us. They are identified on their vest. You can see the HSI, ERO, federal police officer, FBI on the back of the vest. So I would push back on the notion that we aren't identifying themselves. Now, what I would advocate for, and I've said this many times, is I know a lot of elected officials have put forward legislation or proposed legislation about banning of the masks, things like that. I would also want, you know, elected officials to help us hold those people accountable that do doxx or threaten an ICE officer or agent or their family. I think that's key. If we- if we had that kind of support and had those laws or regulations in place, that we can hold those folks accountable to give ICE agents and officers and other law enforcement officers the peace of mind that someone that does threaten their life or their families or doxxes them will be held accountable. I think that'd go a long way.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 So you will continue to allow ICE officers to wear masks during operations.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: I will.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Okay, what is the policy regarding that? It's not mandatory.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: It's not mandatory. As you see- I don't know, I wasn't with your ride-along yesterday, but if you see some of the media coverage, there are officers and agents that don't. Recently, there's been some officers that have been interviewed by other networks who- who've talked about the fears and some of the issues with the job. So there are some that don't, but there are some that have been severely doxxed. You know, speaking from experience, last administration I had multiple protesters from antifa show up at my residence. My address has been put out there. My family's information has been put out there. So I know firsthand what these men and women go through, and it's a scary experience for someone's family, because as a law enforcement officer, you don't sign up for that. You don't bring- you don't bring the work home to your job. But when you have folks, or even elected officials saying that there's going to be no rest for an ICE officer, an agent, that we're going to expose them, you know, no rest for their family. That really concerns me.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Let's get into who ICE is arresting.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Sure.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Do you know how many of the individuals arrested by ICE are people here illegally, but who also have serious criminal records?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yeah, we- we- like I said from the get go, and even, again, going back to when we were together in October, ICE is always focused on the worst of the worst. One difference you'll see now is under this administration, we have opened up the whole aperture of the immigration portfolio, meaning that if you're here illegally and ICE goes out and arrests someone that is released from a sanctuary jurisdiction or wanted in their home country, and an ICE officer finds other individuals with them who are in the country illegally, we're going to take them as well. We are still focused on the worst of the worst. More than half the individuals we have in custody right now have either a conviction or pending criminal charges, since they're released from a sanctuary jurisdiction. One thing, though, that I'd like to highlight is the fact that foreign criminal records aren't in U.S. data systems. So when we do go out and say, arrest someone that has an Interpol Red Notice because they're wanted in their home country, they're still a criminal, but under the American judicial state, they don't have an American criminal history, but that doesn't mean they don't have a criminal history in their home country. I think that's one of the statistic that kind of gets lost in someone and they say, well, this person is non criminal- he doesn't have a criminal history in the United States. Well, that individual can have a criminal history, say, in Brazil, Uruguay, Ukraine, Russia. So there's a lot too that goes into that, what ICE offices and agents do arrest people for.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: And you're saying that now, if your agents encounter anyone who is here illegally, irrespective of whether or not they have a criminal record, that person will be taken into custody?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: If they're here in the United States illegally, yes, they will.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: They're so-called collateral arrests.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Correct.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Okay. We just, as you mentioned, rode along with Border- not Border Patrol, but ICE agents in Maryland, and we saw the agents arresting sex offenders, suspected gang members, the individuals that the president has promised to deport from the country. He often talks about getting rid of the worst of the worst who are in the country illegally. But we have also seen ICE arrest day laborers outside of Home Depots, in some cases, farm workers, people attending their court hearings in immigration court. Is the policy still to prioritize the arrests and deportation of people who are here illegally, but also are violent offenders?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yes, that's one thing, and that's one thing I'm extremely focused on since I became the acting director, is the fact that the president and Secretary Noem have made a promise to the American public that ICE is going to focus on the worst of the worst, and that's what we do need to focus our limited resources on. That's one thing I've always said from the start. What's, again, frustrating for me is the fact that we would love to focus on these criminal aliens that are inside a jail facility, right? A local law enforcement agency, state agency already deemed that person a public safety threat and arrested them and they're in detention. I'd much rather focus all of our limited resources on that to take them into custody, but we do have to go out into the community and make those arrests, and that's where you are seeing those increase of if we encounter someone say, that- that is here in the country illegally, we will take them into custody. In regards to the work site, like you mentioned, one thing that I'd really like to highlight, especially what kicked off June 6 in LA, is the fact that when you see ICE doing these work raids, like the marijuana grow farm, you- we are going there with criminal search warrants or criminal arrest warrants. Not only are we focused on those individuals that are, you know, working here illegally, we're focused on these American companies that are actually exploiting these laborers, these people that came here for a better life. You know, either, you know, forced labor, child trafficking, you know, a lot of these work site cases just isn't a victimless crime of someone here working illegally and that's why we're going there with these criminal warrants to focus on these American businesses that are trying to make an extra dollar on the backs of these people that came here for a better life.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: So you are planning on holding accountable the employers, the companies that are hiring people who are here illegally, not just the workers.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: 100%.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Because that has been a concern.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: It is- it is. I can definitely see that concern, but what I would say is that we have to hold these American businesses accountable, especially when it comes to human trafficking, or child trafficking, forced labor, because those are victims, right? That, you know, that's where illegal employment isn't just a victimless crime, it's a victim at the end of that being exploited. And these American companies do exploit individuals who come here illegally just to make an extra dollar, and that's just not right. We have to hold those county- companies accountable.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Should anyone here illegally now be scared of ICE agents potentially arresting them? Should that be something that they should be worried about?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: No- I- what I can- I can speak for with ICE is, we've always done targeted enforcement. That's one thing I- I always stress. You saw it when you- when you and I rode together in Baltimore last year. ICE knows who they're going after that day. There are other DHS entities, Border Patrol has a different mission, CBP has a different mission than us. I can't speak to them, but I will speak to ICE, and the fact that, when ICE does go out, the person we're looking for, it- has a criminal record, has been released from a jail, that's considered a public safety threat, or has been ordered lawfully removed from the United States by an immigration judge. That's another one of our big things as well. But again, to go back to my point earlier, if we do go out--",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Who may not be criminals, but have been ordered deported.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yeah. Ordered deported. There are millions of people that are here in the United States that have had their due process, went through the entire immigration process, and have been lawfully ordered deported by a Department of Justice immigration judge, and have just not left the country. We are focused on them as well. But again, to go back to what I said earlier, if we go ahead and go out into the community, and we do effectuate an arrest of one of those individuals, but there might be two or three other individuals with that person that's here illegally, we're just not going to walk away like we did in the past. We are going to, you know, conduct our law enforcement mission and arrest those individuals.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: I want to read you, Director, a letter that Congressman Tony Gonzales and other Republicans wrote to you, actually. They said, \"every minute that we spend pursuing an individual with a clean record is a minute less that we dedicate on apprehending terrorists or cartel operatives.\" Isn't that just objectively true from an operational standpoint, because you don't have the agents and facilities, perhaps, to detain everyone who is here illegally?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: I would say that. Operationally, I've always said we do have limited resources. Now we are going to get that funding with the president's Big Beautiful Bill. To the congressman, I would say that ICE is still focused on going after terrorists. We've- we've- you know, arrested over 3,000 TDA gang members, which is now a foreign terrorist organization. But much- what I would say is, much like any local law enforcement agency, if you pull somebody over in a vehicle, and that person has a misdemeanor warrant, say, or a civil warrant, that local law enforcement agency isn't going to walk away from that individual. They're going to arrest that individual. And it's the same with ICE. So while we still are going out after the rapists, murderers, terrorists, we are going to encounter individuals that are here illegally. But what I can promise is, our main focus is those public safety threats, are those national security concerns, because that's what ICE's mission is. Now we are going to encounter those other people which are listed as collaterals, but we just can't walk away from them. We need to do our law enforcement mission as well.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: You're not ignoring those cases anymore.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: No.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: On worksite enforcement, there have been some mixed messages, if you will, from the administration. Initially, there was an effective pause on arrests at hotels, restaurants, and farms. That was quickly reversed. The president has talked about, Director, giving a pass to farmers who are in the country with workers who are here illegally. What is the policy now, when it comes to immigration worksite enforcement?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Which is- kind of what I said earlier in the interview, is the fact that work- when we do a worksite enforcement, it's based on a criminal case. So ICE is still going to focus on a criminal case, whether that be, like you saw on the marijuana grow farm in California, whether it be suspected human trafficking or child forced labor, issues like that. So our policy is still, if we're going to worksite enforcement, we are focused on that criminal aspect of the investigation. So that's what ICE's policy is. I can't speak to the administration. I don't want to get ahead of the president or secretary when it comes to any type of long term immigration plan they do have for the workers, but I will say for ICE, our policy is, we're still going to build solid criminal cases on those worksites to include the businesses, and that's what we're focused on.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Including farms, hotels and restaurants?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Well, we have seen, in many instances, where certain organizations do exploit labor like that, whether it be child labor, human trafficking, things like that. We can't walk away from a criminal case when it comes to real victims there, we'll still focus on those. Now administratively, I- we're gonna focus more heavily on the criminal side of that.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: But there's no ban on enforcement operations at certain work sites?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: No. And I think, like I said, you'll see, when we show up at a work site, it's because a signed federal judge warrant has brought us there for a criminal reason.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Like in the case of the cannabis farms in California?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Correct.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: White House Deputy Chief of Staff, Stephen Miller, who plays a major role on immigration policy in this administration, has talked about ICE carrying out at least 3,000 daily arrests. Right now, you are not hitting that number. Is that target realistic? And can you get to it just by apprehending criminals?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: I- if you look at the amount of criminals that we've already arrested, I think you see we can. I think when you look at those larger numbers, when people talk about those certain goals, you have to also look at those individuals that do have those final orders of removals. Those are what we're really focused on as well. There was many people that were let in the last administration that have gone through their immigration process, who have not shown up for immigration court and have been ordered deported. We still have to focus on those. So I would still say that you're going to see what ICE resources going out daily will be still those criminal cases and those final orders.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Can you get to that 3,000 number per day?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: I think operationally, we can get to any number we set our- set our mind on. I think we just need to be limited in our scope, and use our limited resources to focus on the worst of the worst. I- you know, operationally, when we're trying to protect the American public, I can't be focused on a number. We have to be focused on, number one, getting those public safety threats and those national security threats out of the country, like we did just recently, when we arrested some of those Iranians. There were potential, known, suspected terrorists that came in on the last administration. And we also had to worry about the safety of the men and women of ICE as well. Those are the two main focus that I need to focus on, on our daily operations.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Do you know what the current daily arrest average is right now?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: I wouldn't say this daily arrest average. It just really depends on size and scope of what we're doing nationwide. It can go anywhere from 2,500 to 1,700 a day.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Got it, okay. Our colleague Margaret Brennan recently obtained ICE data showing that only a small percentage of the convicted criminals that ICE has deported over the past six months had convictions for violence offenses. For example, fewer than 1% had homicide convictions. What do you make of that data?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: What I make of that is the fact that we can't look at it just based on the violence or the propensity of violence in that crime. What I looked at is, someone has committed a crime in the United States. Now, if you look at someone that has just been arrested, say, for DUI. Well, some people might say that's only a misdemeanor. We may have prevented vehicular homicide down the road for someone that's a habitual traffic offender. I can't look at the larger scale of what specific crimes are. You know, whether it's a rape, a homicide, of course, you want to get those worst of the worst. But if someone's committed a crime here in the United States and been let back into the community, into here illegally, we need to focus on that. So what I focus on is ensuring that those individuals that have committed a crime are the first ones we're focused on, and that's who we are going to remove.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: As you know, Director, the Supreme Court recently allowed third-country deportations to continue. Should we expect those deportations to increase in the near future? And are other countries, additional nations, now stepping up and saying, I will take back people who are not my citizens?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yeah, I would say you'd see that. But what I'd go back to is the fact that safe third-country removals has been a part of the Immigration Nationality Act for decades. This isn't something that's new, ICE has always done this, so obviously it's come to the forefront now, because, as we talked about earlier, immigration enforcement is at the forefront of the President's administration. But this has been part of the Immigration Nationality Act, which has been enacted by Congress for decades. So we've been doing this for years. That's been part of one of ICE's tools to remove individuals from these recalcitrant countries that just won't take anyone back. Prime example, if we had a country that won't take a homicide suspect back, and under the Supreme Court ruling of Zadvydas, we don't hold punitively, so we can only hold someone for six months to effectuate their removal. If their country won't take them back, we have to release this rapist and murderer back into the community. What Congress did under the Immigration Nationality Act, when enacting the Safe Third Country Agreement, gives us an option to remove these offenders back to a country that will take them.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: So you will continue those deportations.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: We will continue those deportations.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: To countries like South Sudan, for example.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yes.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Does it make sense to send people to countries where they have no ties, though? Even if they are convicted criminals.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Well, I would say, is I- my main focus, like I said, is the safety and security in the United States. Why would we let child rapists with a propensity of violence back into the community, because their home nation won't take them, when they're not here lawfully, or they have no right to stay here. That's our focus. Is to make sure that we are removing these individuals from the country in the most effective and meaningful way that we can. And if their home country won't take them back, then we need to seek other options, other than letting them just roam in the United States.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: The Associated Press, director, just reported that ICE now has access to the personal information of millions of people enrolled in Medicaid, including names and addresses. Can you confirm that that is true? And if so, what does ICE plan to do with that information?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: You know, one thing that we have seen is the fact that under the last administration, we have so many known got-aways, or individuals that came into the United States and just totally disappeared off the grid. What ICE is doing is working with all of our other federal partners to try to gain intelligence, to locate these individuals that have been ordered deported by a judge or have been released from a sanctuary jurisdiction like we talked about. That is what ICE is using that data for, whether it be data from the Department of Labor, data from health and service- Health and Human Services, Medicaid, we are using that data to try to locate, again, the worst of the worst, those people that have been lawfully deported. So I think that's what you're going to see that data used for.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 To identify and arrest people who are here illegally.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yes.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Let's talk about Alligator Alcatraz. Florida just opened a facility, as you know, in the Everglades, that is holding people awaiting deportation because they're here illegally. Some of them have committed crimes. How much of that facility is designed to help you operationally versus to send the message? That message being, if you're here illegally, you could potentially be sent to this scary-sounding place like Alligator Alcatraz.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: It's more of an operational. State of Florida had partnered with us for that. We had limited, we had limited space in Florida, obviously. What I would say is that we don't have the detention space capacity to remove people. Partnering with states like this definitely does help us. It is an operational need for us, is to have those partnerships with states, especially a state like Florida that does have the 287(g) agreement, where their local, State and County deputies are deputized to be ICE officers who are encountering these individuals. That definitely helps us in the- in the mission of removing individuals from the United States.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: As you underscore, there have been some growing tensions in some communities because of ICE enforcement actions. Do you think there's any way, Director, to de-escalate the situation, and can you carry out the mass deportation operation that the President has promised without losing the trust of many in the public?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: I think one of the main things for us is that open line of communication, interviews like this, actually people looking at what ICE is doing, us highlighting these criminal offenders that we are arresting. I think a key thing too, is working with elected officials to come to common ground, to really focus on the safety of neighborhoods and communities, and really focus on what ICE does in their law enforcement mission, and totally take out the rhetoric of what's being said right now, and just really focus on that ICE is a viable law enforcement partner that does a significant public safety mission for the United States. I think that's very key in keeping these open line of communications, and working with local and state government- governments and elected officials to ensure that we are removing these public safety threats from their communities.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Director, is there something I didn't ask you that you wanted to underscore?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: No, I just really liked- appreciate you taking the time to come here, and let me highlight exactly what the ICE mission is. And I just appreciate the opportunity to have that conversation.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: All right. Thank you, Director.",

    "published": "Sun, 20 Jul 2025 19:44:15 -0400",
    "summary": "Republicans and MAGA remain solidly behind Trump.",
    "story": [
      "After six months that included a string of achievements on President Trump's legislative goals, views of his second term are increasingly defined by the difference between his political base, which likes what it sees, and the rest of the country, which has growing doubt.",
      "On the economic front, it comes from continued calls to focus more on prices, rather than tariffs, which most Americans oppose. And now, there's the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which at least initially, most believe will help the wealthy.",
      "On matters of deportation, differences hinge on who, and how many, Americans see as being targeted, as well as the use of detention facilities. Here again, the Republican and MAGA political base remain overwhelmingly approving of it all, but the rest of the American public has become less so.",
      "(On another matter, by comparison, most say the case of Jeffrey Epstein is not very important in their evaluations of the president, and in particular, the president's MAGA base remains overwhelmingly approving of his job performance, especially on immigration.)",
      "Most now say the administration is not prioritizing dangerous criminals for deportation and also is deporting more people than they thought it would.",
      "The program had majority support earlier in the term, but today it does not, moving along with that perception of who is being deported.",
      "Meanwhile, most disapprove of the way the administration is using detention facilities.",
      "Approval of the deportation program has slipped over these months to become slightly net-negative now, with support becoming more exclusively drawn from Republicans and MAGA identifiers.",
      "Hispanic Americans, along with Americans overall, say Hispanic people are being targeted more than others for searches, and those who think so say that's unfair.",
      "As a result, Hispanic approval of the deportation program and of Mr. Trump more generally is lower today than it was earlier in the term. (For broader context, too, during the 2024 election, Mr. Trump made gains with Hispanic voters and started his term with approval from half of Hispanics. Today he has one-third.)",
      "This, despite widespread public views that Mr. Trump's policies have reduced border crossings.",
      "That suggests that Mr. Trump's declining marks on immigration generally are more connected to his deportation program than activity at the border, these days.",
      "And on balance, it's an example of how a policy pendulum can swing in American politics: in the first year of Joe Biden's presidency, most Americans said he and Democrats were not being tough enough on immigration. Today, most Americans say Mr. Trump and the Republicans are being too tough.",
      "Half the country (again, largely outside that political base) now says the president is focusing too much on deportation.",
      "Economics, tariffs and \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\"",
      "What do people want Mr. Trump to focus on? That part isn't news: it's still prices, as it's been throughout the term. Seven in 10 say the administration isn't doing enough to try to lower them.",
      "Inflation and prices are important to most in how they evaluate Mr. Trump overall.",
      "Nearly two-thirds now disapprove of how Mr. Trump is handling inflation, the highest disapproval for him on that yet.",
      "And for the first time, a plurality says the administration is focusing too much on cutting spending.",
      "More broadly, and after having campaigned heavily on immigration and inflation, most Americans still say Mr. Trump is doing what he promised in the campaign. However, fewer say that now than did near the beginning of his term, with the difference being in part, fewer independents and fewer Democrats thinking so. Republicans largely say it's consistent.",
      "On the debate, such as it is, around interest rates, Americans are split in their general desire for the economy \u2014 whether the bigger priority should be to keep interest rates where they are to control inflation, or lower them to make borrowing money easier.",
      "Amid the discussion surrounding Mr. Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, a large majority say the Fed should act independently from the president.",
      "But there's a caveat to all this, as many admit they don't know a lot about what the Fed does.",
      "Powell gets mixed confidence, with Democrats expressing more confidence in him than Republicans, perhaps another example of how partisanship may stand in for more technical economic viewpoints.",
      "Six in 10 disapprove of the One Big Beautiful Bill legislation. Views of it today are similar to what they were before the bill was passed: Most think it will hurt poor people and help the wealthy. Fewer believe it will help the middle or working class.",
      "With so many Americans saying they don't know a lot of the bill's specifics, the initial response to it appears very partisan, opening up what may be a months-long fight to define and sell it.",
      "And so Mr. Trump's overall approval also continues to slide as it has consistently, if incrementally, since the start of his term. It's now closer to where it spent a lot of time in his first term, in the low 40s, with similar structure underneath of negative sentiment beyond that strong approval from the base.",
      "Most MAGA back Trump on Epstein matter",
      "For all the week's punditry, the matter over the Epstein files isn't affecting Mr. Trump's overall approval among his MAGA base. For one thing, Republicans and MAGA like his handling of immigration, especially, and say they gauge him on that more.",
      "The Epstein case doesn't compare on importance. Few Republicans, including MAGA, say issues surrounding the Epstein case matter \"a lot\" to how they evaluate Mr. Trump's presidency.",
      "That said, there is some relative dissatisfaction within the GOP, including in the MAGA base, with how the administration is handling it.",
      "Americans do want the files released \u2014 that includes Democrats, Republicans, MAGA in particular, across a wide range of groups.",
      "Americans overwhelmingly suspect that the files contain damaging information about powerful and wealthy people.",

      "Washington \u2014 In an exclusive interview, Todd Lyons, the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told CBS News he's not a \"proponent\" of agents wearing masks during arrest operations, but said he will allow the practice to continue due to concerns about his officers' safety.",
      "He also confirmed ICE plans to use data from government programs like Medicaid to locate immigrants suspected of living in the U.S. illegally, including those with criminal histories.",

      "\"However, if that's a tool that the men and women of ICE to keep themselves and their family safe, then I will allow it,\" Lyons said during his first television network sit-down interview at ICE headquarters in Washington. \"I do kind of push back on the criticism that they don't identify themselves.\"",

      "Lyons cited the increase in attacks faced by agents at ICE, the agency at the center of President Trump's promise of carrying out the largest deportation operation in American history.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has said attacks against ICE officials have increased by more than 800% this year compared to the same time period in 2024. Numerous instances of violence directed at ICE agents and facilities have occurred in recent weeks, including an armed attack against a detention center in Texas earlier this month that has led to more than a dozen arrests.",
      "Lyons agreed the increase in attacks faced by ICE agents could be partially attributed to the dramatic expansion in immigration arrests under the second Trump administration, acknowledging that the agency is \"more visible in the community.\"",
      "But he argued his agents are being forced to go into communities more often to arrest individuals living in the U.S. illegally, including those with criminal records, because more cities and states have adopted \"sanctuary\" policies that limit local law enforcement cooperation with ICE. Those policies lead many jurisdictions to refrain from notifying ICE when they release inmates who are also in the U.S. illegally.",
      "\"So you are seeing us out more, and I think there is more of a tension,\" Lyons added. \"The immigration mission is one of the forefront of this administration, so it is a lot of scrutiny and publicity to it.\"",
      "Lyons says Medicaid data will be used to \"locate\" those in the U.S. illegally",
      "CBS News also asked Lyons about a report from the Associated Press that an inter-agency agreement had granted ICE access to the personal information of millions of Medicaid enrollees, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers and data on patients' race and ethnicity.",

      "Can you teach an old dog new tricks? Atlantic staff writer Olga Khazan set out to change aspects of her personality she didn't like by forcing herself outside of her comfort zone, and documented the progress she made in her new book, \"Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change\" (Simon & Schuster/Simon Element).",
      "Among the challenges that Khazan, a lifelong introvert, set for herself: Tackling her social anxiety by enrolling in an improv class. Yes, and \u2026 how did that go?",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Susan Spencer's interview with Olga Khazan on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" July 20!",
      "\"Me, But Better\" by Olga Khazan",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "My journey into extroversion began solitarily, with me watching the improv show Middleditch & Schwartz on Netflix one night. The episode opened with two well-known actors, Thomas Middleditch and Ben Schwartz, spending an uncomfortably long time pulling a premise for their sketch out of a random audience member\u2014a photography intern. Then, on a bare stage, Middleditch pretended to interview Schwartz for a photography job, making up absurd questions like \"embody a gazelle.\"",
      "The audience laughed along gamely, but mostly, the scene reminded me that I needed to file my expense report. I felt uneasy for the actors, like at any moment the crowd could turn on them, leaving them groping for laughs in ghostly silence. I wondered why they couldn't have just written out better scenes ahead of time. And even worse, I knew that soon, I would be in their exact same position, except without the advantage of being a famous comedian.",
      "For my personality-change project, I had decided to focus on each of the five traits intensively for a few months at a time, and I tackled extroversion first. In recent years my life had descended into a rut that I didn't particularly like, and extroversion seemed like the way out. Most days, I worked, made dinner, watched TV, and worked some more. Rich and I were planning to relocate, and it occurred to me that I would have both moved into and out of my house without having met any of my neighbors. A test in a self-help book reminded me that I have \"high loneliness.\"",
      "My \"very low\" extroversion score was probably not surprising to people who know me: My friend Anastasia once sentenced me to attending a party on pain of ending our friendship. But my hard-core introversion could turn pernicious, shading at times into loneliness and isolation. I have a career in which work can expand to fill every crevice of the day, and sometimes I thought that was a good thing, because I didn't have many hobbies or friends to otherwise occupy my time. (And say what you will about extroverts, but they have plenty of hobbies and friends.) I had always told myself I could focus on socializing after my life had stabilized, but the absence of social interaction was, itself, destabilizing.",
      "Of all five traits, extroversion offers the simplest path to personality change: You just have to go out and talk to people. You don't even have to be particularly good at it, or to proclaim yourself an \"extrovert\" while you do it. You just go, and extroversion will find you, like the entire wedding follows the first intrepid dancer.",
      "Coincidentally, this is also the ethos behind improv comedy: You just have to say something. Anything! For the uninitiated, \"improv\" is short for \"improvisational theater.\" The idea is that two or more actors get up on stage without knowing what they'll say or do. They get to the \"scene\" by accepting and building on a partner's improvisations\u2014a concept known as \"yes, and.\" When this is done well, improvisers say there is virtually no difference between improv and scripted theater\u2014a claim about which opinions surely differ.",
      "I knew I needed a commitment device for extroversion\u2014something to force me out of my house and into gregariousness. I decided to try improv, which seemed like the full-immersion extrovert experience.",
      "It also felt like full-immersion insanity. Rich saw me entering my credit-card information into the website of Dojo Comedy, a cozy-looking D.C. improv theater whose logo incorporates a pair of mustachioed Groucho Marx comedy glasses. \"You doing improv is like Larry David doing ice hockey,\" he said.",
      "It's true. My general vibe is less \"yes, and\" and more \"well, actually.\" I've never really liked improv as an art form. I don't find it particularly funny\u2014it's more like an extended inside joke you're never going to get. I thought Middleditch would warm me to improv, but it only turned me off more.",
      "Before the first class a few weeks later, I donned a Groundlings-ready black T-shirt and jeans, hoping to draw as little attention to myself as possible. I tried to shake memories of being so timid in middle-school drama class that I only qualified to be the understudy for the smallest role\u2014Bob Cratchit's daughter. When I typed the address of the improv studio into my phone, I was relieved when the red snake of \"heavier than usual traffic\" indicated that I would have at least an hour to mentally prepare.",
      "The improv class met in an old townhouse, in a room that was, for no discernible reason, filled with dozens of sculptures of elephants. Six of us novices sat in a circle on chairs that looked like they'd been salvaged from Victorian funerals.",
      "The instructor, a short brunette with a brisk, friendly manner, opened by asking us about our past improv experience\u2014none, in my case. One of the other women rattled off a long list of improv classes she had taken. What kind of crazy person does improv multiple times? I wondered. (Me, as it would turn out.)",
      "Right after the instructor said, \"Let's get started,\" I prayed for someone to grab an elephant and knock me unconscious. That didn't happen, so instead I stood up to play warm-up games with a software engineer, two lawyers, and a guy who worked on the Hill. The games were meant to loosen us up for what was to come, which was \"scene work,\" or acting out unscripted mini plays with one another.",
      "First, we learned the improv standard Zip Zap Zop, which involves whooshing beams of energy at one another and taking turns saying \"Zip,\" \"Zap,\" and\u2014you guessed it\u2014 \"Zop.\" The point of the game is to stay unflustered enough to keep up the Zip-Zap-Zop sequence while still whooshing on to someone else in the circle.",
      "I struggled for several reasons: Because of the pandemic, I hadn't been in a room with other people for more than a year. On top of that, I have poor reflexes, and, because we wore masks, you had to determine whether someone was about to Zop you solely by the angle of their eyes.",
      "If someone messed up the sequence\u2014said \"Zip\" to another's \"Zip,\" for instance\u2014we would all stop, clap, and say, \"yay!,\" reinforcing the idea that it's okay to screw up in improv. The spirit of all this was so different from my job, where you can get fired for screwing up, that it felt like some sort of rehab for perfectionists.",
      "Then we moved on to juggling various invisible items between one another, including an invisible ball, which, humiliatingly, we had to refer to as \"invisible ball!\" I sensed that the others were as nervous as I was, but this being D.C., an air of try-hard overachievement subsumed everyone's true emotions. People, myself included, will behave ridiculously if they feel they have no alternative. I imagined all my fellow ball-jugglers back at work the next day, writing emails in which they promised to circle back and touch base. I wondered whether they would think back to this moment of whimsy at their brown-bag lunches, as they gravely discussed the situation in Burkina Faso. Maybe it would make the situation in Burkina Faso seem less chaotic by comparison.",
      "Soon it was time to call an invisible hawk to my arm. I noted with gratitude that at least the blinds were closed, so no one could see us from the street.",

    "summary": "Writer Olga Khazan, a lifelong introvert obsessed with work, was unhappy with who she was, and so vowed to redesign her personality by living outside her comfort zone \u2013 a journey she documented in her new book, \"Me, But Better.\"",
    "story": [
      "For years, Olga Khazan, a Virginia-based staff writer at The Atlantic, knew she had a big problem: she hated much of her own personality. \"I was constantly worried about everything,\" she said. \"Just never living in the moment. And I didn't really like doing anything fun with other people. Just wasn't my thing.\"",
      "How might she function at a party? \"I would kind of stand off to myself, and honestly, sometimes just, like, read articles on my phone or just basically not engage,\" she laughed.",
      "Not surprisingly, a lot of folks didn't want to engage with Khazan, either. \"One person called me a pressure addict, that I was sort of obsessed with working, and just doing as much work as possible, and never taking a minute to appreciate life,\" she said. \"One person told me that she was kind of afraid of me when we worked together.\"",
      "Predictably, when she took a personality test four years ago, she was off the charts \u2013 way off \u2013 in neuroticism, or negative emotions \u2026 not that she hadn't tried to find help: \"This whole time I'd been in therapy,\" Khazan said. \"I had taken different medications. I did yoga. And I did all the self-care things. Nothing was truly working.\"",
      "Frustrated, Khazan set out to do something much more radical: She vowed to redesign her whole personality. \"I decided to spend a year trying to change my personality traits,\" she laughed.",
      "Professor Shannon Sauer-Zavala described one's personality as \"your characteristic way of thinking, feeling, and behaving. It's how you think about your behavior and how you act.\"",
      "I asked, \"I always assumed that once you had reached a certain age, your personality was your personality?\"",
      "\"That really is, I think, the prevailing way to think about personality, but it doesn't line up with our science,\" Sauer-Zavala replied.",
      "Personality science is her specialty, and her research at the University of Kentucky could be a game-changer for how we approach mental health issues. She says data tells us it is possible to scientifically change your personality, and that, with the right intervention, introverts can become extroverts \u2026 sloppy people can get neater \u2026 slackers can gain ambition \u2026 and anxious people can learn to be calm. \"In my almost 20 years of treating people with anxiety disorders, I've seen dramatic changes in 12, 16, 20 weeks,\" Sauer-Zavala said.",
      "Step one is a baseline personality test, which asks questions such as: \"I sometimes manipulate people into doing what I want.\"",
      "The next step is forcing yourself to act the opposite of how you normally would. If you're shy, make conversations. If you're messy, make the bed.",
      "Sauer-Zavala said, \"When we make intentional changes to our thinking, our feeling, and our behaviors, and we maintain those changes over time, then we're essentially shifting our personality. We're changing the way we're gonna fill out those bubbles on the personality questionnaire.\"",
      "\"So, you consciously adopt the behavior of the personality that you think you want?\" I asked. \"You make it sound easy.\"",
      "\"It's not easy,\" Sauer-Zavala replied. \"The principles are simple, but the execution is difficult.\"",
      "It wasn't easy for Olga Khazan, the lifelong introvert. Among other strategies to tackle her social anxiety, she enrolled in an improv class with total strangers \u2026 something completely outside her comfort zone. \"I was very, very scared,\" she said. \"Probably for the first three or four months that I did it, my heart was really beating in my chest, and I was deeply uncomfortable.\"",
      "What about it scared her? \"I didn't like looking silly!\" she laughed.",
      "Murphy McHugh, who was Khazan's improv teacher, said, \"For me, doing improv was a life-changing thing. I opened up socially. I became a better listener, a better collaborator.\"",
      "He said as Khazan continued coming to class, he noticed changes in her: \"Relaxing, a little bit less of the cross-armed body language. You see someone relaxed, you see their shoulders drop. You see them laughing, and coming into scenes with an idea.\"",
      "Along with improv, Khazan meditated, went sailing, took conversation classes, and kept a journal, as she describes in a new book, \"Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change.\"",
      "\"Journaling kind of helps you focus on some of the more positive elements of your life that, if you're very neurotic, you tend to kind of gloss over or forget,\" she said.",
      "I asked, \"Is this a case of fake it 'til you make it?\"",
      "\"Yeah, it is fake it 'til you make it,\" Khazan said. \"Because if you think about it, anything is gonna feel fake if it feels new, right? Anything that you're not accustomed to doing is gonna feel really unnatural. But the only way to make it natural is to do it over and over and over again\"",
      "\"And just incorporate it in who you are?\"",
      "\"Exactly.\"",
      "Today, Khazan is happily married, with a 14-month-old baby. As for that personality she once so disliked, she said, \"I feel like I am a different person today than I was three years ago. I think I genuinely have a different way of living my life, and approaching problems, than I did before.\"",
      "So, what advice does Shannon Sauer-Zavala have for everyone watching with completely unsatisfactory personalities? \"Not to get stuck in a personality-type box,\" she said. \"Think about the life that you want to have, and then know that you can intentionally develop the traits that will facilitate that journey for you.\"",

    "summary": "A groundbreaking IVF trial has raised hope that women with genetic mutations in their own DNA could one day have children without passing on deadly diseases.",
    "story": [
      "Eight healthy babies have been born in the U.K. using a new IVF technique that successfully reduced their risk of inheriting genetic diseases from their mothers, the people behind a world-first trial said Wednesday.",
      "The findings were hailed as a breakthrough, which raises hopes that women with mutations in their mitochondrial DNA could one day have children without passing debilitating or deadly diseases on to the children. One out of every 5,000 births is affected by mitochondrial diseases, which cannot be treated, and include symptoms such as impaired vision, diabetes and muscle wasting.",
      "In 2015, Britain became the first country to approve an in-vitro fertilization technique that uses a small amount of healthy mitochondrial DNA from the egg of a donor \u2014 along with the mother's egg and father's sperm.",
      "Some have called the result of this process \"three-parent babies,\" though researchers have pushed back at this term because only roughly 0.1% of the newborn's DNA comes from the donor.",
      "The results of the much-awaited U.K. trial were published in several papers in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "8 children with DNA from 3 people currently healthy",
      "Out of 22 women to undergo the treatment at the Newcastle Fertility Centre in northeast England, eight babies were born. The four boys and four girls now range from under 6 months to over 2 years old.",
      "The amount of mutated mitochondrial DNA \u2014 which causes disease \u2014   was reduced by 95-100% in six of the babies, according to the research. For the other two newborns, the amount fell by 77-88%, which is still below the range that causes disease.",
      "This indicates the technique was \"effective in reducing transmission\" of diseases between mother and child, one of the studies said.",
      "The eight children are currently healthy, though one had a disturbance of their heart's rhythm which was successfully treated, the researchers said.",
      "Their health will be followed up over the coming years to see if problems arise.",
      "Oxford University reproductive genetics expert Dagan Wells noted that among the eight children, three have shown some signs of what is known as \"reversal,\" which is still little understood.",
      "It is \"a phenomenon where the therapy initially succeeds in producing an embryo with very few defective mitochondria, but by the time the child is born the proportion of abnormal mitochondria in its cells has significantly increased,\" he explained.",
      "Nevertheless, Nils-Goran Larsson, a Swedish reproductive expert not involved in the research, hailed it as a \"breakthrough.\"",
      "The new technique offers a \"very important reproductive option\" for families affected by \"devastating\" mitochondrial diseases, he added.",
      "While the U.K. trial is the first to involve multiple mothers, the eight babies born to them are not the first to be born with DNA from three people. That first came in 2016, after a woman was treated by U.S. fertility specialists in Mexico, where there were no laws regulating the practice. A similar IVF method was used in that groundbreaking case.",
      "Ethical concerns over embryos and \"designer babies\"",
      "Mitochondrial donation remains controversial and has not been approved in many countries, including the United States and France.",
      "Religious leaders have opposed the procedure because it involves the destruction of human embryos. Other opponents have expressed fears it could pave the way for genetically engineered \"designer babies.\"",
      "An ethical review carried out by the U.K.'s independent Nuffield Council on Bioethics was \"instrumental\" in conducting the new research, the council's director Danielle Hamm said Wednesday.",
      "Peter Thompson, head of the U.K.'s Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which approved the procedure, said only people with a \"very high risk\" of passing on a mitochondrial disease would be eligible for the treatment.",
      "Ethical concerns have also been raised over the use of mitochondrial donation for infertility in Greece and Ukraine.",
      "French mitochondrial disease specialist Julie Steffann told AFP that \"it is a question of the risk-benefit ratio: for a mitochondrial disease, the benefit is obvious.\"",
      "\"In the context of infertility, it has not been proven,\" she added.",

      "The centuries-old complete skeleton of a medieval knight was found under the former site of a famous ice cream shop in Poland, researchers said.",
      "The discovery was made on a small plot in Gda\u0144sk, a city on the country's coast. The site was once home to an ice cream parlor called Mi\u015b, which operated there since 1962 but has since moved to a new location. Researchers say several other archaeological discoveries have been made at the site in recent years, including the remains of cottages dating back to the 12th and 13th century and an ancient city street.",
      "Archaeologists from the ArcheoScan Archaeological and Conservation Workshop were working on the site in July when they found the knight's tombstone. The stone, made of limestone, was engraved with the image of a knight, the organization said on social media. On July 8, the headstone was moved to Gda\u0144sk's Archaeological Museum. Early analysis determined the stone likely dates back to the 13th or 14th century.",
      "Two days later, the team found the complete skeleton of the medieval knight. He was buried about five inches under the tombstone, researchers said on social media. He appears to have been about 40 years old when he died, anthropologist Dr. Aleksandra Pud\u0142o said in an article published on Gda\u0144sk's official website. The knight appears to have been between about 5'6\" and 5'10\" tall, researchers said. Pud\u0142o said the skull and bones of the skeleton were very well-preserved. Gda\u0144sk's website noted that the skull is in worse shape than the other bones.",
      "It's not clear who the knight may have served, according to Gda\u0144sk's official website. The city was captured by a German Catholic military order called the Teutonic Knights in the early 13th century. It's also unclear if the burial predates or postdates the event, researchers said. The knight may have also served the Sobies\u0142aw dynasty, which ruled Gda\u0144sk during the 11th and 12th century.",
      "More research will be conducted on the skeleton and the tombstone, as well as other relics found during the dig. Researchers have found several other notable tombstones, though the knight's appears to be the most impressive. The tombstone will be examined with 3D software, and archaeologists will likely attempt a detailed reconstruction of the artifact. Pud\u0142o said that the skeleton of the knight will undergo a \"thorough examination,\"\u00a0 and the results of that may be available as early as next year.",

      "Astronomers have, for the first time, discovered the moment when planets started to form around a sun-like baby star, scientists reported Wednesday.",
      "The specks of planet-forming material are emerging around HOPS-315, a protostar or baby star located 1,300 light-years away from us. One light year is approximately 5.88 trillion miles.",
      "While astronomers have seen discs of gas and dust around protostars before, they've never before identified a new planetary system at such an early stage. Minerals in the system around HOPS-315 are just starting to form.",
      "\"We're seeing a system that looks like what our Solar System looked like when it was just beginning to form,\" study co-author Merel van 't Hoff, a professor at Purdue University, said in a news release from the European Southern Observatory (ESO).",
      "The observatory paired up with NASA's Webb Space Telescope to identify the minerals forming the new solar system. Researchers turned to data from our own solar system to determine that these minerals show the start of a new system. In Earth's solar system, the first solid materials to form can now be found inside ancient meteorites. Those ancient meteorites contain a mineral called silicon monoxide, which only forms at extremely high temperatures, like those near a young star.",
      "Scientists were able to identify the formation of silicon monoxide around HOPS-315, which they said tells them they've caught the development of a solar system at an early stage.",
      "\"This is the first time this early stage of planet-building has ever been observed outside our own Solar System,\" the Planetary Society wrote in a social media post about the discovery.",
      "The discovery marks \"the birth of the seeds of the planets,\" study co-author Edwin Bergin, a professor at the University of Michigan, told CBS News. The silicate-mineral rich material around HOPS-315 will make planets after another million years or so.",
      "\"So we are watching the beginnings of the construction of planets,\" Bergin said.",
      "With the discovery, Bergin said researchers now know what to look for to find other budding systems.",
      "ESO's Alma telescope network in Chile captured an image of the still-forming planetary system around HOPS-315. In orange, the image shows the distribution of carbon monoxide blowing away from HOPS-315. Blue shows a narrow jet of silicon monoxide, which is also beaming away from the baby star.",

      "HOPS-315 is much younger than the Sun; it's about 100,000 years old, Bergin said.",
      "\"So we get a glimpse of the system in its infancy,\" Bergin said in an email. \"Given that the Sun is 4.6 Billion years old this is a baby star that is still gaining mass and getting bigger.\"",

    "story": [
      "A bidder here on Earth shelled out a lot of green for a piece of the red planet on Wednesday when Sotheby's put a Martian meteorite up for auction.",
      "NWA 16788, the largest piece of Mars on Earth, was expected to fetch between $2 million and $4 million during the auction\u00a0in New York City, according to Sotheby's. The final price was $5,296,000, which includes the hammer price, premiums and local taxes, according to the auction house. Sotheby's has not publicly identified the buyer.",
      "Pieces of Mars found on Earth are rare. According to the auction house, just 400 of the more than 77,000 officially recognized meteorites found on Earth \u2014 or about 0.6% \u2014 are from Mars. The meteorite represents approximately 6.5% of all Martian material currently known on Earth.",
      "Meteorites come from meteors, space rocks that enter Earth's atmosphere. Most meteors burn up as they fall toward Earth, but the ones that survive the trip through Earth's atmosphere are considered meteorites. The chunk of Martian rock that was auctioned off by Sotheby's was likely dislodged from the planet by an asteroid strike.",
      "NWA 16788 traveled 140 million miles through space before it crashed in the Sahara Desert, where it was found in Niger's remote Agadez Region in 2023, according to Sotheby's.",
      "\"The odds of this getting from there to here are astronomically small,\" Cassandra Hatton, Sotheby's vice chairman of science and natural history, said in an auction house video.",
      "The meteorite weighs just over 54 pounds, which makes it the largest meteorite from Mars, but not the largest meteorite ever found. According to NASA, a meteorite originally weighing over 100 tons once fell to Namibia.",
      "It's believed that NWA 16788 is a \"relative newcomer here on Earth, having fallen from outer space rather recently,\" Sotheby's said in its auction listing. The meteorite was on public view at Sotheby's New York galleries ahead of the auction on Wednesday.",
      "\"This isn't just a miraculous find, but a massive dataset that can help us unlock the secrets of our neighbor, the red planet,\" Hatton said in the auction house video.",
      "Sotheby's regularly auctions meteorites.",
      "\"Specimens of the Moon and Mars are among the greatest of rarities on our planet \u2014 as every bit of both would fit in the cargo hold of a large SUV,\" the auction house wrote in a 2022 collector's guide.",

      "\"We can confirm that Google DeepMind has reached the much-desired milestone, earning 35 out of a possible 42 points - a gold medal score,\" the U.S. tech giant cited IMO president Gregor Dolinar as saying. \"Their solutions were astonishing in many respects. IMO graders found them to be clear, precise and most of them easy to follow.\"",
      "Around 10% of human contestants won gold-level medals, and five received perfect scores of 42 points.",
      "U.S. ChatGPT maker OpenAI said its experimental reasoning model had also scored a gold-level 35 points on the test.",
      "The result \"achieved a longstanding grand challenge in AI\" at \"the world's most prestigious math competition,\" OpenAI researcher Alexander Wei said in a social media post.",
      "\"We evaluated our models on the 2025 IMO problems under the same rules as human contestants,\" he said. \"For each problem, three former IMO medalists independently graded the model's submitted proof.\"",
      "Google achieved a silver-medal score at last year's IMO in the city of Bath, in southwest England, solving four of the six problems.",
      "That took two to three days of computation \u2014 far longer than this year, when its Gemini model solved the problems within the 4.5-hour time limit, it said.",
      "The IMO said tech companies had \"privately tested closed-source AI models on this year's problems,\" the same ones faced by 641 competing students from 112 countries.",
      "\"It is very exciting to see progress in the mathematical capabilities of AI models,\" said IMO president Dolinar.",
      "Contest organizers could not verify how much computing power had been used by the AI models or whether there had been human involvement, he noted.",

      "Google DeepMind CEO\u00a0Demis Hassabis predicted\u00a0that AI technology was on track to understand the world in nuanced ways, and to not only solve important problems, but even to develop a sense of imagination, within a decade, thanks to an increase in investment.",
      "\"It's moving incredibly fast,\" Hassabis said. \"I think we are on some kind of exponential curve of improvement. Of course, the success of the field in the last few years has attracted even more attention, more resources, more talent. So that's adding to the, to this exponential progress.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Jul 2025 15:30:29 -0400",
    "summary": "Backers of the Genius Act, a potentially landmark bill that could help \"stablecoins\" go mainstream, say it would greatly speed electronic payments.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Friday is signing the Genius Act, the first major federal law governing cryptocurrencies.",
      "The law establishes federal regulations for \"stablecoins,\" which are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency because their value is pegged to fixed assets, like the dollar.",
      "The Genius Act passed in the House on Thursday by a 308-122 vote after being approved\u00a0in the Senate\u00a0last month with broad bipartisan support. The measure is part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.",
      "\"For the first time in history, Congress has passed bipartisan digital assets legislation through both the Senate and the House. The Genius Act marks a major milestone in securing America's leadership in payments innovation while protecting consumers and strengthening our national security,\" South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a statement Thursday following the bill's passage by Congress.",
      "The Genius Act, which is sponsored by Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, has two Democratic co-sponsors \u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland \u2014 and two Republican co-sponsors \u2014 South Carolina's Sen. Tim Scott and Wyoming's Sen. Cynthia Lummis.",
      "Here's what to know about stablecoin and how the Genius Act could affect its use.",
      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backed the passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What will the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) established guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",
      "The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "With the Genius Act passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get \"depegged\" from its underlying asset if that asset's value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity, according to S&P Global Ratings.",
      "In 2023, for example, the failure of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins \u2014 the USDC and DAI \u2014 to depeg.",
      "Stablecoins are also subject \"to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity,\" according to S&P Global.",
      "Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?",
      "As the Genius Act awaited approval from Congress, some of the nation's largest banks were already considering how they could integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.",
      "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, is already developing its digital currency capabilities in an attempt to expand revenue and attract clients, she added.",
      "\"We are closely monitoring developments in the legislative and regulatory space on coin issuance and evaluating how to best to support our clients' needs through our existing 24/7 products like [Citi Token Services], in addition to exploring options around issuing our own external token or coin and working with existing providers,\" Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships & innovation for Citi's Services business, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, also plans to use stablecoin, CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts in an earnings call on Tuesday.",
      "Outside of the banking world, companies like Walmart and Amazon are also exploring the idea of issuing their own stablecoins, Sam Mcingvale, head of product at blockchain technology company Optimism, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email on Tuesday.",
      "\"If new stablecoin legislation is passed, we expect it to open the floodgates even further,\" he said.",
      "What is Trump's position?",
      "Congress' approval of the Genius Act aligns with Mr. Trump's\u00a0commitment in March to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "At a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last year, Mr. Trump\u00a0also said\u00a0it would be his administration's policy to \"keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has taken other actions that point to his interest in cryptocurrency. In January, shortly before taking office, he and his wife Melania Trump launched their own meme coins, a highly volatile type of crypto whose value derives from their online popularity.",
      "The president on Tuesdy\u00a0posted\u00a0his support for the Genius Act on Truth Social.",
      "\"The Genius Act is going to put our Great Nation lightyears ahead of China, Europe and all others, who are trying endlessly to catch up, but they just can't do it,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",

    "story": [
      "Hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were easily found with a simple search on TikTok and available to a user under the age of 18, in violation of the platform's own policies, CBS News has found.",
      "CBS News created a TikTok account for a hypothetical 15-year-old female user in the United States and found that, at the very least, hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were searchable and watchable on the platform using the account.",
      "Once the CBS News account interacted with a handful of these videos, similar content was then recommended to the account on TikTok's \"For You\" feed.",
      "Searchable videos ranged from content with captions such as, \"nothing feels better than an empty stomach,\" to \"what I eat in a day\" videos promoting restrictive, 500-calorie-per-day diets. Guidelines published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health suggest that girls between the ages of 14 and 18 ingest between 1,800 and 2,400 calories per day.",
      "Many of the videos promoted thin body types as aspirational targets and included the hashtag \"harsh motivation\" to push extreme weight loss advice.",
      "Some of those videos included messages or slogans such as \"skinny is a status symbol\" and \"every time you say no to food, you say yes to skinny.\"",
      "TikTok's community guidelines say the platform only allows users over the age of 18 to see content promoting restrictive, low-calorie diets, including videos promoting medications for weight loss or idealizing certain body types. The Chinese-owned platform also says it bans users under the age of 18 from viewing videos that promote cosmetic surgery without warning of the risks, such as before-and-after images, videos of surgical procedures, and messages discussing elective cosmetic surgery.",
      "But CBS News found a range of videos by entering basic search terms on the platform, such as \"skinny,\" \"thin,\" and \"low cal,\" that promoted thin bodies as ideal, while also pushing harmful weight management behaviors. One such video showed an image of a scale with a weight of 39.9 kg (88 pounds) alongside a caption saying \"weight loss\" and the hashtag \"ed,\" which is a common abbreviation for \"eating disorder.\"",
      "Another graphic video with the caption \"ana gives you wings\" showed a series of models with protruding collar bones and spines. The term \"ana\" is an abbreviation for the eating disorder anorexia.",
      "Responding to CBS News' research, a TikTok spokesperson said Thursday that it was \"based on a very limited sample size and does not reflect the experience of the vast majority of our community.\"",
      "\"TikTok does not allow content that promotes disordered eating or extreme weight loss behaviours, and we work with health experts to provide in-app support resources where needed,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The spokesperson pointed to a study published in May by the University of Southern California, which found that a majority of the eating disorder content on TikTok is discussion among users about recovery from such conditions.",
      "The same study noted, however, the platform's \"dual role in both challenging harmful cultural norms and potentially perpetuating them,\" regarding body image perceptions and eating disorders.",
      "\"We know that this isn't a one-off error on TikTok's part and that children are coming across this content on a scale,\" said Gareth Hill, a spokesperson for the Molly Russell foundation, a charity in the United Kingdom that works to prevent young people from committing self-harm.",
      "\"The question for TikTok is, if this is not representative, then why has this account [created by CBS News], which is a child's account, been shown this content in the first place, and then why is it continuing to get recommended to it?\"",
      "CBS News also found a wide variety of videos available to the under-18 user promoting the weight loss drug Ozempic and various forms of cosmetic surgery. That included videos that showed up on the recommended \"For You\" feed, which promotes cosmetic surgeries such as rhinoplasty, breast augmentation, and liposuction.",
      "In one case, a user talking about their waist reduction surgery included a voiceover saying: \"I would rather die hot than live ugly.\"",
      "A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment specifically on CBS News' findings regarding cosmetic surgeries being promoted to underage users.",
      "TikTok says it has taken a range of measures over the past several months to address criticism regarding the availability of extreme weight loss content on the platform. In early June, the platform suspended search results for the viral hashtag #SkinnyTok, after drawing criticism from health experts and European regulators. The hashtag had been associated primarily with videos promoting extreme weight loss, calorie restriction and negative body talk, often presented as wellness advice.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson also told CBS News on Thursday that searches for words or phrases such as #Anorexia would lead users to relevant assistance, including localized eating disorder helplines, where they can access further information and support.",
      "\"I think we're understanding more and more about how this content shows up and so even when you ban a particular hashtag, for example, it's not long until something similar jumps up in its place,\" Doreen Marshall, who leads the American nonprofit National Eating Disorders Association [NEDA], told CBS News.",
      "\"This is going to be an evolving landscape both for creating content guidelines, but also for the platforms themselves and, you know, while some progress has been made, there's clearly more that can be done,\" Marshall said.",
      "TikTok is not the only social media platform that has faced criticism for the accessibility of extreme weight loss content.",
      "In 2022, 60 Minutes reported on a leaked internal document from Meta that showed the company was aware, through its own research, of content on its Instagram platform promoting extreme weight loss and fueling eating disorders in young people.",
      "At the time, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, declined 60 Minutes' request for an interview but its global head of safety, Antigone Davis, said, \"We want teens to be safe online\" and that Instagram doesn't \"allow content promoting self-harm or eating disorders.\"",
      "Last year, 60 Minutes reported that the Google-owned YouTube video platform, which is hugely popular among teenagers, was also serving up extreme weight loss and eating disorder content to children.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-security-aarp-study-retirement-income-90th-anniversary/",
    "published": "Tue, 22 Jul 2025 12:03:49 -0400",
    "summary": "More than three-quarters of Americans fear Social Security won't provide enough to live on when they retire, AARP study finds.",
    "story": [
      "Social Security is facing a growing number of challenges that threaten to undermine the retirement program's stability even as more retirees today say they urgently need the monthly payments compared with 20 years ago, according to a new AARP survey.",
      "About two-thirds of retirees said they substantially rely on Social Security for retirement income, or plan to do so, according to the survey, which polled more than 1,200 retirees as well as more than 2,000 younger Americans. When the advocacy group for older Americans asked the same question in 2005, about half of retirees indicated a heavy reliance on their monthly checks.",
      "The surge in retirees who largely rely on Social Security income to make ends meet comes as the program faces key challenges, from recent staffing cuts to a long-term financial crunch that could cause payments to be slashed starting in 2034.",
      "The AARP survey, conducted to mark the 90th anniversary of President Franklin D. Roosevelt signing the Social Security Act on August 14, 1935, underscores both the ever-growing importance of the program as well as its vulnerabilities.",
      "\"More than three-quarters of people in the U.S. \u2014 78% \u2014 are worried that Social Security won't provide enough to live on during retirement,\" AARP CEO Myechia Minter-Jordan said in a conference call to discuss the group's findings. \"That's an increase from five years ago, when 74%\" expressed concern.\"",
      "Confidence in the future of Social Security is also declining, with only 36% of Americans today saying they believe it will continue to pay out reliably and at the same level, a dip of seven percentage points from 2020, the study found. At the same time, 96% of Americans said they believed Social Security is important, with little difference between age groups or political party affiliations, AARP said.",
      "\"We're concerned that faith in the system ... is waning,\" Minter-Jordan added. \"We're concerned about their confidence that they will be able to receive benefits that they have paid into over time.\"",
      "Americans in their 30s are the most pessimistic about the future of Social Security, although confidence in the program's outlook tends to rise as people approach retirement age and get closer to claiming their benefits, the study found.",
      "\"Younger people have always underestimated how important Social Security will be to them in the future,\" noted Bill Sweeney, senior vice president of government affairs at AARP, said on the call.",
      "He added, \"Receiving Social Security changes how people view the program. They realize how important that inflation-adjusted treatment income is.\"",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the survey's findings.",
      "Social Security filings at a record",
      "Meanwhile, Social Security Administration data shows that Americans are filing for benefits at a record rate in 2025. This comes as experts are pointing to rising concerns about the program's reliability and future solvency, given job cuts at the agency and other changes.",
      "Wealth inequality is also a growing issue among retirees, with some white-collar workers heading into their golden years with hefty retirement savings thanks to corporate 401(k) programs with company matches. But about half of all private-sector workers lack access to corporate retirement accounts, creating hurdles for saving for retirement, a recent Pew Charitable Trusts study found.",
      "Last year, a record 68 million retirees, disabled people and survivors of deceased workers relied on Social Security, a 42% jump from two decades ago,\u00a0data shows. The number of Social Security beneficiaries is forecast to swell to 82 million by 2035, AARP said.",
      "Despite the retirement program's importance, many Americans lack a grasp of the basics of Social Security, the new AARP study also found. For instance, only 24% of those surveyed correctly identified 70 years old as the age at which individuals can maximize their Social Security benefits.",
      "And about one-third of respondents said the potential insolvency of the Social Security trust funds would lead to a complete cessation of benefits, which is false. If the trust funds aren't shored up and they run out of money, which is currently forecast to occur in 2034, monthly benefits would be reduced by about 20%.",

    "published": "Tue, 22 Jul 2025 12:00:33 -0400",
    "summary": "Ghislaine Maxwell, an associate of Jeffrey Epstein, was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Todd Blanche, the second-highest ranking official at the Justice Department, said Tuesday that he plans to meet with Ghislaine Maxwell \"in the coming days\" about the case involving convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"Justice demands courage. For the first time, the Department of Justice is reaching out to Ghislaine Maxwell to ask: what do you know?\" Blanche wrote on social media. He added that he contacted Maxwell's lawyers at the direction of Attorney General Pam Bondi. \"I intend to meet with her soon. No one is above the law \u2014 and no lead is off-limits,\" Blanche wrote.",
      "On Capitol Hill, a subcommittee of the House Oversight and Reform Committee approved a motion from GOP Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee that directs the committee's chairman to subpoena Maxwell to appear for a deposition, a signal of lawmakers' interest in speaking to Epstein's former partner.",
      "Blanche, who was President Trump's private defense attorney before joining the Justice Department, said that the department and the FBI continue to stand by a memo released earlier this month that concluded Epstein did not have a \"client list\" and confirmed that he died by suicide. The memo, which detailed the findings of a review of Epstein's case, also said there was no \"credible evidence\" that the disgraced financier blackmailed prominent people.",
      "The Justice Department and FBI also said they would not release any additional information about Epstein's case, and noted that the review did not uncover evidence that would prompt an investigation into uncharged third parties.",
      "\"President Trump has told us to release all credible evidence,\" Blanche said in a second statement shared by Bondi. \"If Ghislane Maxwell has information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims, the FBI and the DOJ will hear what she has to say.\"",
      "The deputy attorney general said the Justice Department in prior administrations had not asked about her willingness to meet with the government, and he anticipates \"meeting with Ms. Maxwell in the coming days.\"",
      "David Oscar Markus, Maxwell's lawyer, said in a statement, \"I can confirm that we are in discussions with the government and that Ghislaine will always testify truthfully. We are grateful to President Trump for his commitment to uncovering the truth in this case.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that he did not know about Blanche's bid to speak with Maxwell but said it \"sounds appropriate to do.\"",
      "\"It's sort of a witch hunt,\" he said in the Oval Office. \"Just a continuation of the witch hunt.\"",
      "Maxwell was an associate of Epstein's and convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. She is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence. Her lawyers have asked the Supreme Court to take up an appeal of her conviction.",
      "Blanche's outreach to Maxwell's lawyers comes after the Justice Department asked a federal court in New York on Friday to unseal transcripts from grand jury proceedings involving Epstein. He was indicted in 2019 on one count of sex trafficking of minors and one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors.",
      "Federal prosecutors alleged that Epstein sexually exploited and abused dozens of underage girls from 2002 through 2005, and worked with others who set up sexual encounters with victims at Epstein's residences in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "He died by suicide while in federal custody before his trial. Epstein had been arrested in Florida in 2006 and pleaded guilty to two state prostitution charges in 2008.",
      "In addition to asking the court to release the grand jury transcripts related to Epstein's indictment, the Justice Department also asked it to make public grand jury transcripts associated with Maxwell's case. U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer, who is now handling Maxwell's case, ordered the Justice Department to submit additional filings to the court about its request to unseal the grand jury records, and gave Maxwell and victims until Aug. 5 to lay out their positions on the proposed disclosure.",
      "Whether the transcripts become public will be up to the judges overseeing the cases, though the records will likely be heavily redacted to shield information related to victims. If the Justice Department's requests are granted by the court, the material is unlikely to be available immediately, and it could be weeks or months before it is unsealed.",
      "Federal rules typically require matters before a grand jury to be kept secret.",
      "The president and his administration have been dealing with backlash from Mr. Trump's allies that arose after the Justice Department released the memo about Epstein.",
      "Some top administration officials, such as Vice President JD Vance and FBI Director Kash Patel, suggested before Mr. Trump's reelection that Democrats were deliberately concealing information about Epstein and his purported list of clients. But now, with the Justice Department under Mr. Trump's control, some of his allies are skeptical of its claim that there is nothing left to disclose.",
      "Mr. Trump has tried to downplay the focus on Epstein and lashed out at some of his supporters, calling them \"weaklings\" who have been fooled by Democrats. He referred to claims about Epstein as the \"Jeffrey Epstein Hoax.\"",
      "Epstein and Mr. Trump moved in the same social circles in New York and Florida from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. They were friends for years, until they had a falling out around 2004. Mr. Trump has previously acknowledged he crossed paths with Epstein in Palm Beach, but said in 2019 following Epstein's arrest that they haven't spoken in 15 years.",
      "Last week, the president lashed out at a story in the Wall Street Journal that chronicled the pair's relationship, which the president has said ended before Epstein's first arrest in 2006. The Journal reported that Mr. Trump had signed a \"bawdy\" letter to Epstein in the early 2000s to mark his 50th birthday that said, in part, \"may every day be another wonderful secret.\" CBS News has not independently seen or verified the letter.",
      "Mr. Trump called the letter \"fake\" and filed a defamation lawsuit against the Journal's publisher, parent company News Corporation, its leader Rupert Murdoch and the reporters who wrote the Epstein story. Mr. Trump is seeking at least $20 billion in damages.",

      "The first Trump administration announced in 2017 that the U.S. would withdraw from UNESCO citing an anti-Israel bias. But the U.S. also cut off funding to UNESCO during the Obama administration, after UNESCO voted to include the Palestinian state as a full member state in 2011. The U.S. also withdrew from UNESCO under President Ronald Reagan and rejoined two decades later under President George W. Bush.",

      "Mr. Trump, who is known to be a fan of Diet Coke, wrote in the July 16 post on Truth Social that he had been \"speaking to Coca-Cola\" about the suggestion and that \"they have agreed to do so.\"",
      "Coke said the new product will use cane sugar produced in the U.S. and will expand its product range. \"This addition is designed to complement the company's strong core portfolio and offer more choices across occasions and preferences,\" the company said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "Coca-Cola already makes soda with cane sugar in Mexico, where it's sold in glass bottles. Coke's U.S. cola formula uses high-fructose corn syrup,\u00a0according\u00a0to Coca-Cola's website. The Mexican version is typically pricier when it's imported and sold in the U.S.",

      "Two adult men were treated on site. One was transferred to a local clinic in critical condition, the Costa Rican Red Cross said. They tried to resuscitate the other man, but he didn't show vital signs and was declared dead. The Costa Rican Red Cross didn't provide an update on the man transferred to a local clinic.",
      "Warner starred as Theo Huxtable on \"The Cosby Show\" from 1984 to 1992. His performance earned him an Emmy nomination for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series in 1986.",

      "\"That show had such an impact on the culture here in America but also a global impact on how Black people saw ourselves globally and how the rest of the world saw us,\" he said. \"So I'm proud to have been part of that legacy and it's been a great ride ever since.\"",
      "Warner said in a 2015 interview with The Associated Press that he was saddened that the show's legacy was \"tarnished\" by \"Cosby Show\" patriarch Bill Cosby, who was\u00a0accused of sexual assault by multiple women. Cosby's\u00a0conviction in a Pennsylvania case\u00a0was later overturned.",

He knew, you know, that he was America's son. He literally was America's son as the only male child on that historic show, 'The Cosby Show.'\"",

      "Powell recalled publishing a poem Warner wrote in a special issue of the magazine \"African Voices\" for the 50th anniversary of hip-hop in 2023.",
      "Warner was a lifelong hip-hop fan, Powell said, but he also was \"concerned about a lot of the images that were being put out there.\"",
      "\"So that became kind of his thing in the last few years, like how are we representing ourselves as a community, as a people, with the art that we're creating?\" he said. \"That sticks with me because he was someone who understood he had a huge platform. He had a famous name and people would pay attention if he said certain things. ... That's who Malcolm-Jamal was.\"",
      "The news of Warner's death was \"devastating,\" a spokesperson for Bill Cosby said. The spokesperson, Andrew Wyatt, said Cosby compared it to learning of the death of his son Ennis, who was shot and killed in a robbery in 1997. \"It felt the same way,\" Wyatt said.",

      "The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the documents, which number over 230,000 pages, \"had never been digitized and sat collecting dust in facilities across the federal government for decades, until today.\"",
      "The records include the FBI's \"discussion of potential leads, internal FBI memos detailing the progress of the case, and documents related to James Earl Ray's former cellmate, who stated he discussed with Ray an alleged assassination plot,\" according to ODNI. The agency says the release also includes CIA records on the search for Ray, who fled the U.S. before he was eventually captured and pleaded guilty to assassinating King.",
      "\"The American people have waited nearly sixty years to see the full scope of the federal government's investigation into Dr. King's assassination,\" Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said in a statement.",
      "ODNI called Monday's release \"the first time these records are published online in one collection with minimal redactions,\" though it said some records had been made public previously through Freedom of Information Act requests.",
      "ODNI said King's relatives were \"provided an opportunity to review the files\" two weeks ago.",
      "Prior to the release, some relatives of King pushed back on the plan, saying: \"For us, the assassination of our father is a deeply personal family loss that we have endured over the last 56 years. We hope to be provided the opportunity to review the files as a family prior to its public release.\"",
      "King's two living children, Bernice King and Martin Luther King III, said in a statement Monday they understood the records have \"long been a subject of interest,\" but urged people to engage with the files \"with empathy, restraint, and respect for our family's continued grief.\"",

      "\"While we support transparency and historical accountability, we object to any attacks on our father's legacy or attempts to weaponize it to spread falsehoods,\" the family members said. \"Those who promote the fruit of the FBI's surveillance will unknowingly align themselves with an ongoing campaign to degrade our father and the Civil Rights Movement.\"",
      "Bernice King addressed the release of the files in a \"Vanity Fair\" article Monday, writing, \"I wonder why I have to be confronted once again with something that was very confusing and distressing for me as a five-year-old. I am, honestly, not prepared to revisit the gruesome details of this painful history. For me, there is no real value in it; there is only reliving the trauma.\"",
      "Later Monday, she wrote on X, \"Now, do the Epstein files.\"",
      "King's niece, Alveda King, said in ODNI's statement that she supported the release, calling it \"a historic step towards the truth that the American people deserve.\"",
      "Shortly after returning to office, Mr. Trump ordered the government to declassify and release federal records on President John F. Kennedy's 1963 assassination, along with the 1968 killings of King and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. Records on JFK were released in March, and the government released several tranches of documents on RFK starting in April.",
      "All three assassinations have drawn decades of public curiosity, including theories about whether the people accused and convicted of assassinating the three men acted alone or were even responsible for the killings.",
      "Ray pleaded guilty to murdering King in Memphis one year after the assassination, and was sentenced to 99 years in prison, but he later recanted his guilty plea and spent years unsuccessfully seeking a new trial. He died in 1998.",
      "Members of King's family have contended that Ray was not the shooter. Their statement Monday pointed to a 1999 wrongful death suit in Tennessee civil court in which a jury concluded a man named Loyd Jowers and other co-conspirators, \"including government agencies,\" were linked to King's assassination.",
      "Other official findings have varied. The Justice Department conducted reviews of the assassination in 1977 and 2000, which asserted that Ray was the assassin and that he didn't act as part of a conspiracy. In the 1970s, the House Select Committee on Assassinations found that King was likely assassinated as part of a conspiracy involving Ray, but that the government wasn't involved.",

      "A\u00a0heat dome is trapping over 90 million Americans in extreme temperatures this week with the\u00a0National Weather Service issuing heat alerts from Nebraska to Florida.",
      "Dangerous heat threatens to bake much of the Mississippi Valley and parts of the Southeast from Tuesday through at least Thursday, with temperatures over 100 degrees Fahrenheit expected in some areas. Some places could see heat index values, or feels-like temperatures, of 110 to 115 degrees.",
      "While not expected to reach record highs, temperatures are still forecast to be about 10 to 15 degrees above average compared to what they typically are this time of year.",
      "Maps show July heat alerts and forecasts",
      "As the extreme heat hits parts of the Corn Belt, a region over part of the Plains and Central Mississippi Valley where heat index values could reach between 105 and 110 degrees, high humidity is also expected. The common phenomenon is known as corn sweat, which occurs when extreme heat beats down on corn crops and causes it to perspire and increase the humidity in the air.",
      "Although record highs aren't forecasted this week, overnight lows in the mid 70s to low 80s could possibly break record high minimums in states like Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, South Carolina and Tennessee, according to\u00a0Climate Central, a nonprofit that analyzes climate change data.",
      "High humidity coupled with extreme temperatures is dangerous because the combination significantly increases the likelihood of heat-related illnesses. Little to no overnight relief also poses a greater threat to health, NWS Prediction Center says.",
      "Heat waves increasingly intensified by climate change",
      "Climate change has made excessive heat in July at least three times more likely for nearly 160 million people in the U.S., nearly half the population, a Climate Central analysis found.",
      "Using its calculation of data and what is called a Climate Shift Index (CSI), the nonprofit said Monday that human-caused climate change made this extreme heat at least five times more likely for certain areas, from Salt Lake City and Santa Fe, New Mexico, to Tallahassee, Florida, and Montgomery, Alabama.",
      "The CSI uses real-time data to estimate how climate change has increased the likelihood of a particular daily temperature, according to Climate Central.",
      "Last month, another heat dome exposed nearly half of the country to dangerously high temperatures. On June 24, seven states tied or broke monthly high temperature records, many exceeding triple digits. One of those states, Maryland, reported that 472 people needed medical assistance for heat-related illnesses during that time when the heat index topped 110 degrees in some places.",
      "With such events becoming more common, Democratic lawmakers last week proposed legislation to classify extreme heat as a disaster, which would allow federal funding to flow into areas where hotter temperatures cause significant physical and economic distress.",

    "summary": "The gap between the RNC and DNC is wider now than it was at this same stage of the first midterm cycle after Trump's 2016 victory.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican National Committee ended the first half of 2025 with a $65.56 million cash on hand advantage over the Democratic Party, as the left works to rebound from 2024 election losses and the right continues to deeply intertwine its future with President Trump.",
      "New campaign finance filings show the RNC had more than $80.7 million at the end of June, while the Democratic National Committee finished with around $15.2 million in cash on hand as both parties prepare for next year's midterm elections.",
      "\"The RNC has been working hand in glove with President Trump's team to build the war chest needed to protect and expand our Republican majorities in Congress next year,\" RNC spokesperson Kiersten Pels said in a statement. \"Vice President Vance has done an amazing job as the RNC's finance chair working with Chairman Whatley to do just that, and we're not going to stop.\"",
      "The gap between the two is far wider than this same time period before the 2018 midterms, when the RNC's cash on hand advantage over the DNC was $37.2 million at the end of June 2017. The political dynamics at that point were similar to now, with President Trump months removed from winning the White House and Republicans controlling the House and Senate. In the 2018 midterms, Democrats won back the House and started to build momentum that carried over into Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election.",
      "While the midterms are still more than a year away, it already appears likely the House will be Democrats' easiest route to winning back power in Washington. Republicans are also contending with the potential challenge that often befalls the party of the president, where the midterms become a referendum on the commander in chief.",
      "Democrats are facing continued questions about their approach moving forward after last fall's election setbacks, where Mr. Trump won a second term as president and the party lost the Senate and failed to retake the House. Earlier this year, party leaders chose Ken Martin, then the head of Minnesota's Democratic Party, to take over the DNC in an attempt to gain stronger footing with next year's midterms and the 2028 presidential election in mind.",
      "But in his first months as party chair, Martin was forced to contend with intraparty tensions and disputes as he attempted to offer a stronger counter to Mr. Trump's second term and Republican control in Washington.",
      "The Martin-led DNC has succeeded however in raising more money than the national party organization did at this same stage in 2017, and in a recent news release, the DNC shared its finding that \"contributions during the first five months of Chair Martin's leadership are nearly 2:1 dollars raised in the months after the 2016 cycle.\"",
      "\"The DNC is breaking grassroots fundraising records, bringing on more volunteers than ever, and raising record-setting funds to beat Republicans. Democrats are back in the ring thanks to grassroots energy across all 50 states, and together, we're going to defeat the toxic Republican agenda and put this country back on track for hard-working families,\" Martin said in a statement.",
      "But the new round of campaign finance disclosures also underscores the challenges Democrats continue to face this year. Through the first six months of 2025, filings show the DNC taking in a little more than $69 million while the RNC's total receipts were over $96 million.",

      "Gaza City\u00a0\u2014 The head of Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City said on Tuesday that 21 children had died across the Palestinian territory in the past three days \"due to malnutrition and starvation.\"",
      "\"These deaths were recorded at hospitals in Gaza, including Al-Shifa in Gaza City, Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir el-Balah and Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis... over the past 72 hours,\" Mohammed Abu Salmiya told reporters.",
      "United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned Monday evening that \"the last lifelines keeping people alive are collapsing\" in Gaza, and that there were growing reports of children and adults exhibiting symptoms of malnutrition.",
      "Abu Salmiya told reporters that new cases of malnutrition and starvation were arriving at Gaza's remaining functioning hospitals \"every moment,\" adding: \"We are heading towards alarming numbers of deaths due to the starvation inflicted on the people of Gaza.\"",
      "In a statement issued Tuesday, the U.N. human rights office said many people were arriving at Gaza's hospitals \"in a state of severe exhaustion caused by a lack of food. Others are collapsing in the streets. Many more may be dying unreported... These deaths and the horrendous physical and psychological suffering caused by hunger are the result of Israel's interference with and militarization of humanitarian assistance.\"",
      "Photos emerging from Gaza in recent days have shown children and infants with severe malnutrition, including some said by hospital workers to have died of the condition. According to the National Institutes of Health, severe malnutrition typically causes symptoms including dramatic wasting, or fat and muscle loss, poor circulation and extreme fatigue.",
      "\"Hospitals are already overwhelmed by the number of casualties from gunfire. They can't provide much more help for hunger-related symptoms because of food and medicine shortages,\" Khalil al-Deqran, a spokesperson for the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health, told the Reuters news agency. Deqran said there were 600,000 people suffering from malnutrition symptoms such as dehydration and anemia, including 60,000 pregnant women.",
      "After talks to extend a six-week ceasefire broke down, Israel imposed a full blockade on Gaza on March 2 this year, allowing no aid in until trucks were again permitted to cross the border in late May. The U.N. and aid organizations say the quantity of food and other emergency supplies being allowed into Gaza since then has been vastly insufficient, however.",
      "Food stocks accumulated inside the Palestinian territory during the ceasefire have depleted, leaving the territory's more than two million inhabitants experiencing the worst shortages since the start of the war sparked by the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023. Some 1,200 Israelis were killed and 251 others taken hostage during that siege more than 650 days ago, and 20 of the captives are still thought to be alive in Gaza.",
      "World Food Program director Carl Skau, who visited Gaza City in early July, called the situation \"the worst\" he had ever seen.",
      "Last Sunday, the civil defense agency in Hamas-run Gaza reported that at least three infants had died from \"severe hunger and malnutrition\" over the previous week.",
      "On Monday, the governments of 25 countries, including Israeli and U.S. allies Britain, France, Australia and Canada, urged an immediate end to the war, the unconditional release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas, and the free flow of aid.",
      "In their joint statement, they accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's U.S.-backed government of the \"drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians, including children\" in Gaza.",
      "The nations also condemned a new system for aid distribution backed by Israel's military that was launched in late May with the support of the Trump administration, but no support from other nations or humanitarian organizations.",
      "The U.N.'s human rights office said Tuesday that Israeli forces have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians trying to get food aid in Gaza since the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation started operations on May 26.",
      "Officially a private effort, the GHF began working in Gaza \u2014 with virtually no information provided about its funding or management \u2014 after Israel imposed the more than two-month blockade on all supplies entering Gaza.",
      "The group's operations, focused around four \"humanitarian hubs\" for food distribution, have been marred by chaotic scenes and near-daily reports of Israeli forces firing on people waiting to collect rations in the Palestinian territory, where the Israeli military is seeking to destroy Hamas.",
      "\"As of July 21, we have recorded 1,054 people killed in Gaza while trying to get food; 766 of them were killed in the vicinity of GHF sites and 288 near U.N. and other humanitarian organizations' aid convoys,\" U.N. human rights office spokesman Thameen Al-Kheetan told the AFP news agency. He said the agency's data was \"based on information from multiple reliable sources on the ground, including medical teams, humanitarian and human rights organizations.\"",
      "GHF says it has distributed more than 1.4 million boxes of foodstuffs to date and that it adjusts its \"operations in real time to keep people safe and informed, and we stand ready to partner with other organizations to scale up and deliver more meals to the people of Gaza.\"",
      "The U.N. and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with the GHF over concerns it was designed to cater to Israeli military objectives and violates basic humanitarian principles. The group has never commented, despite numerous questions from CBS News, on any links it has with the U.S. or Israeli governments.",
      "The Trump administration announced its first public support for the GHF \u2014 $30 million in funding \u2014 earlier this month, and called on other organizations and countries to cooperate with the group, saying that, in its view, it provides the only  means of delivering aid in Gaza without the risk of Hamas stealing it.",

      "The court sentenced the director of a servicing company called Anavim, a Kyrgyz woman in her 40s, to two years behind bars, and another two years suspended.",
      "She had denied being responsible for the housing conditions, and blamed the two other defendants suspected of recruiting the harvesters.",
      "The court sentenced the two others, both men in their 30s, to one year in jail, alongside suspended terms. One is a man from the country of Georgia and the other is a Frenchman, the BBC reported.",
      "All three were found guilty of human trafficking \u2014 defined under French law as \"recruiting, transporting, transferring, housing or receiving a person to exploit them,\" by means of coerced employment, abusing a position of authority, abusing a vulnerable situation or in exchange of payment or benefits.",
      "Some workers were recruited via a Whatsapp group message for the West African Soninke ethnic community living in Paris, which promised \"well-paid work\" in the Champagne region, the BBC reported.",
      "The Anavim director was also found guilty of crimes including concealing employment of workers.",
      "The court in Chalons-en-Champagne dissolved the servicing company and ordered a wine-making cooperative it worked with to pay a $87,000 fine.",

      "\"My client is the ideal culprit for an industry that has long turned a blind eye to its own practices,\" said Bruno Questel.",
      "\"No food, no water, no nothing\"",
      "Maxime Cessieux, an attorney for the victims, said the 2025 harvest \"will be closely scrutinized and no one will be able to say 'I didn't know, I didn't understand, I didn't know who these people in my vineyards were.'\"",
      "In September 2023, the labor inspectorate found that the accommodation provided by Anavim for grape-pickers southwest of Reims \"seriously undermined\" their safety, health and dignity.",
      "The accommodation was subsequently closed by the prefecture, which had pointed to makeshift bedding and \"the appalling state of the toilets, washrooms and communal areas.\"",
      "Camara Sikou, one of the victims, told the court the workers had been treated \"like slaves.\"",
      "\"They put us in an abandoned building, with no food, no water, no nothing,\" added Modibo Sidibe, who said the workers were in the fields from 5 a.m. until 6 p.m.",
      "\"I never thought the people who made champagne would put us up in a place which even animals would not accept,\" Kanouiti\u00e9 Djakariayou, 44, told La Croix newspaper, per the BBC.",

      "Every year, around 120,000 seasonal workers are recruited to pick the grapes grown across 84,000 acres in the Champagne region.",
      "In 2023, four harvesters died, possibly the result of sunstroke after working in scorching heat.",

    "summary": "25 nations condemn Israel over \"drip feeding\" of aid to Palestinians and say \"the war in Gaza must end,\" just as it looks set to expand.",
    "story": [
      "Twenty-five nations, including Britain, Canada and Japan, issued a joint statement on Monday with \"a simple, urgent message: the war in Gaza must end now.\"",
      "The statement by the U.S. allies and partners across the globe and published online by the U.K. government condemns Israel's tightly-controlled aid distribution method, accusing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's U.S.-backed government of the \"drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians, including children.\"",
      "\"It is horrifying that over 800 Palestinians have been killed while seeking aid,\" said the statement, which was published after one of the deadliest days for aid seekers during the 21-month war in Gaza. Health officials in the Hamas-run enclave said more than 80 people were killed trying to access emergency food supplies on Sunday alone.",
      "In addition to the U.K., the nations that signed the joint statement were Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.",
      "\"The suffering of civilians in Gaza has reached new depths. The Israeli government's aid delivery model is dangerous, fuels instability and deprives Gazans of human dignity,\" the statement says. \"The Israeli Government's denial of essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population is unacceptable. Israel must comply with its obligations under international humanitarian law.\"",
      "The war in Gaza was sparked by the Hamas-orchestrated terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, during which some 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken as hostages. Most of those captives have since been released, but Netanyahu said earlier this month that 50 remain in Gaza, including 20 he said were still alive.",
      "\"The hostages cruelly held captive by Hamas since 7 October 2023 continue to suffer terribly,\" the 25 nations said in the statement. \"We condemn their continued detention and call for their immediate and unconditional release. A negotiated ceasefire offers the best hope of bringing them home and ending the agony of their families.\"",
      "Israel does not allow foreign journalists into Gaza to report on the war, making it impossible to independently verify figures provided by the Palestinian enclave's Hamas-run health ministry and other agencies. The Israeli government rejects these numbers as falsely inflated, but the United Nations says the ministry's figure of more than 59,000 people being killed in total since the war started is the most credible information available.",
      "In a statement shared on social media, Foreign Ministry spokesman Oren Marmorstein said Israel rejected the joint international statement, \"as is disconnected from reality and sends the wrong message to Hamas.\"",
      "CBS News' own team inside Gaza has spoken with medical workers and family members of aid seekers who say Israeli forces have routinely opened fire on people near food distribution sites since at least the end of May, when a new, controversial, U.S.- and Israeli-backed organization started operating a handful of \"humanitarian hubs\" in the enclave.",
      "The deaths reported on Sunday, near a convoy of aid trucks operated by the U.N.'s World Food Program, were not linked to the U.S.-based Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which is run by an evangelical preacher who worked previously as an adviser to President Trump. But Palestinian authorities say most of the aid seekers killed by Israeli forces over the last month and a half were trying to access GHF hubs.",
      "GHF director Rev. Johnnie Moore told CBS News earlier this month that while he didn't \"want to diminish these reports\" about killings near GHF hubs, \"we can't control what happens outside our distribution sites.\"",
      "He repeated his previous calls \u2014 which have been echoed by the White House \u2014 for the United Nations and its humanitarian agencies to join the GHF's efforts to feed people in Gaza.",
      "None of the established humanitarian agencies that have worked for decades in Gaza have agreed to work with the GHF, saying it forces already-displaced Palestinians to trek for miles to reach its hubs and that it violates basic humanitarian principles.",
      "The Trump administration announced its first public support for the GHF in early July: $30 million in funding.",
      "In a statement on Monday, COGAT, the Israeli military agency in charge of affairs in the Palestinian territories, said: \"Israel acts in accordance with international law and is leading efforts to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza in coordination with the international organizations.\"",
      "Israel has blamed Hamas for all deaths in Gaza since the war began, accusing it of using civilians as human shields and of seizing aid materials for its own use, both of which the group \u2014 long designated a terrorist organization by the U.S., Israel and the European Union \u2014 denies doing.",
      "Pope Leo XIV also renewed his call over the weekend for \"an immediate end to the barbarity of this war and for a peaceful resolution to the conflict\" in Gaza.",
      "Netanyahu has said repeatedly that the war will continue until Hamas is rendered impotent militarily and politically, and all the hostages are returned.",
      "The international outcry and mounting demands for an immediate ceasefire come at a time when there's little to suggest any imminent breakthrough in ongoing negotiations for a truce. They come instead as Israel says it is again expanding its ground war in Gaza, forcing thousands of Palestinians to once again flee for safety.",
      "Israel warns of new ground operation in central Gaza",
      "On Sunday, Israel widened its evacuation orders for Gaza to include an area that has been somewhat less hard-hit than others, indicating a new battleground may be opening up and squeezing Palestinians into ever tinier areas.",
      "In an Arabic language social media post published Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces warned that it was operating \"with great force to destroy the enemy's capabilities and terrorist infrastructure\" in the central city of Deir al-Balah, \"as it expands its activities in this region to operate in an area it has not operated in before.\"",
      "\"For your safety, evacuate the area immediately and move south,\" the IDF said.",
      "The U.N.'s humanitarian agency OCHA estimated that between 50,000 and 80,000 people were in the area under the new evacuation order, and families were seen carrying what few items they could on donkey carts, bicycles and even dragging sleds behind them as they headed south.",
      "Deir el-Balah resident Abdullah Abu Saleem, 48, told the French news agency AFP that \"during the night, we heard huge and powerful explosions shaking the area as if it were an earthquake,\" which he attributed to \"artillery shelling in the south-central part of Deir el-Balah and the southeastern area.\"",
      "\"We are extremely worried and fearful that the army is planning a ground operation in Deir el-Balah, and the central camps where hundreds of thousands of displaced people are sheltering,\" he told AFP.",
      "The Israeli military did not provide immediate comment on the operations, but the GLZ Radio network, which is funded by the Israeli government and affiliated directly with the IDF, reported Monday that soldiers had, \"for the first time since the start of the war,\" entered Deir al-Balah on the ground.",
      "GLZ said a single combat brigade, \"including engineering and armor forces, have recently entered a maneuver in the southern Deir al-Balah area in the central camps in the Gaza Strip. The attacks were preceded by air and artillery strikes during the night and morning, and in the afternoon the forces went into action.\"",
      "The announced expansion of ground operations drew a quick statement of concern from the group that represents the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza \u2013 the precise whereabouts of whom remain unknown.",
      "\"The families demand that the Prime Minister, Defense Minister, Chief of Staff, and IDF Spokesperson appear before them and the Israeli public this evening to clearly explain why the offensive in the Deir al-Balah area does not put the hostages at serious risk,\" the Hostages Families Forum Headquarters said in a statement. \"As of this moment, we have received no official, organized updates or satisfactory answers on this matter. The people of Israel will not forgive anyone who knowingly endangered the hostages \u2014 both the living and the deceased. No one will be able to claim they didn't know what was at stake.\"",

      "At least 85 Palestinians were killed while trying to reach aid at locations across Gaza on Sunday, the Hamas-run Health Ministry said, in one of the deadliest days yet for aid-seekers in over 21 months of war.",
      "There was new alarm as Israel's military issued evacuation orders for areas of central Gaza, one of the few areas where it has rarely operated with ground troops and where many international organizations attempting to distribute aid are located.",
      "The largest toll was in northern Gaza, where at least 67 Palestinians were killed while trying to reach aid entering through the Zikim crossing with Israel, according to the Health Ministry and local hospitals. The U.N. World Food Program said 25 trucks with aid had entered for \"starving communities\" when it encountered massive crowds that came under gunfire. It called violence against aid-seekers \"completely unacceptable.\"",
      "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a U.S.-based organization that has been distributing aid in the territory, said in a statement Sunday that its workers were \"deeply saddened by reports that more than 30 people were killed while trying to access food from a U.N. convoy at the Zikim crossing in Northern Gaza as humanitarian efforts face escalating violence.\" The foundation said it distributed 31,968 boxes of aid throughout the day at two distribution sites.",
      "Some witnesses said Israel's military shot into the crowd at the Zikim crossing. The Israel Defense Forces said they \"fired warning shots in order to remove an immediate threat.\"",

      "The military said it was attempting to facilitate the entry of aid, and accused Hamas militants of creating chaos and endangering civilians.",
      "More than 150 people were wounded overall, with some in critical condition, hospitals said. Separately, seven Palestinians were killed while sheltering in tents in Khan Younis in the south, including a 5-year-old boy, according to the Kuwait Specialized Field Hospital, which received the casualties.",
      "The killings in northern Gaza didn't take place near aid distribution points associated with the recently created Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a U.S.- and Israel-backed group. Witnesses and health workers say hundreds of people have been killed by Israeli fire while trying to access the group's aid distribution sites.",
      "The new evacuation orders cut access between the central city of Deir al-Balah and the southern cities of Rafah and Khan Younis in the narrow territory. The military also reiterated evacuation orders for northern Gaza.",

      "The announcement came as Israel and Hamas have been holding ceasefire talks in Qatar, but international mediators say there have been no breakthroughs. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly asserted that expanding Israel's military operations in Gaza will pressure Hamas in negotiations.",
      "Also on Sunday, Pope Leo XIV reiterated his call for an immediate ceasefire, urging the international community to respect international laws and protect civilians in the wake of an Israeli attack on Gaza's only Catholic church last week, which killed three people and wounded 10 others, including the priest.",
      "Earlier this month, Israel's military said it controlled more than 65% of Gaza.",
      "Gaza's population of more than 2 million Palestinians are in a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, now relying largely on the limited aid allowed into the territory. Many people have been displaced multiple times.",
      "Hamas triggered the war when militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 others hostage. Most of the hostages or their remains have been released through various deals, while 50 remain in Gaza, but fewer than half are thought to be alive.",
      "Israel's military offensive has killed more than 58,800 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, which doesn't say how many militants have been killed but says more than half of the dead have been women and children. The ministry is part of the Hamas government, but the U.N. and other international organizations see it as the most reliable source of data on casualties.",
      "The Hostages Family Forum, a grassroots organization that represents many families of hostages, condemned the new evacuation announcement and demanded that Netanyahu and Israel's military explain what they hope to accomplish in central Gaza, accusing Israel of operating without a clear plan.",
      "\"Enough! The Israeli people overwhelmingly want an end to the fighting and a comprehensive agreement that will return all of the hostages,\" the forum said. On Saturday night, during a weekly protest, tens of thousands marched in Tel Aviv to the branch of the U.S. Embassy, demanding an end to the war.",
      "Ambulances in front of three major hospitals in Gaza sounded their alarms simultaneously Sunday morning in an urgent appeal as the hunger crisis grows. The Health Ministry posted pictures on social media of doctors holding signs about malnourished children and the lack of medication.",
      "A ministry spokesperson, Zaher al-Wahidi, said at least nine children under 5 years old have died of malnutrition since Israel imposed a blockade on the entry of aid in March. The blockade was partially eased in May.",
      "He said tracking malnutrition deaths is difficult because some people might be suffering from other medical conditions that could be compounded with severe hunger.",
      "In northern Gaza, Shifa Hospital director Abu Selmiyah said the hospital recorded 79 people who died of malnutrition in the past month.",

    "story": [
      "A Ukrainian man who previously worked as a senior official in an anti-organized crime agency was found dead late last month in the pool at his apartment complex in the southern Spanish resort town of Villajoyosa. Ukrainian and Spanish media say Ihor Hrushevskyi's body was found late last month at the same apartment complex where a Russian military helicopter pilot-turned-defector was gunned down in February of 2024.",
      "El Espa\u00f1ol newspaper's edition for the Alicante region in southeast Spain said it had interviewed at least 20 residents of the Cala Alta apartment complex, where neighbors found the 61-year-old Ukrainian floating face-down in the pool on June 29.",
      "The newspaper cited local authorities as saying there were no apparent signs of a violent attack, but that foul play was not being ruled out as the investigation proceeded. They said a medical crisis, such as a stroke or heart failure, could have been a factor, but told the newspaper that the death appeared suspicious.",
      "Many residents of the resort, which is popular with Russian and Ukrainian expats, told El Espa\u00f1ol they weren't even aware of the death until reporters came asking questions. The paper said its efforts to dig up personal information on Hrushevskyi were challenging, which it put down to the nature of his former employment in Ukraine.",
      "\"The confidentiality inherent in one of the Ukrainian government's elite units turns Ihor into a ghost, with no trace in official documents or public information,\" El Espa\u00f1ol said.",
      "According to the newspaper, Hrushevskyi moved to the Cala Alta apartment complex about 16 months before he was found dead.",
      "Ukraine's Pravda daily newspaper also reported that Hrushevskyi had worked as a senior official at the Interior Ministry's Department for Combating Organized Crime during the 1990s. Russia's state-run TASS news agency also reported the details of the story, citing El Espa\u00f1ol's report.",
      "There was no immediate comment from Ukrainian authorities on the death, though the foreign ministry was quoted by national public broadcaster Suspilne as saying the Ukrainian consulate in Spain was handling the repatriation of Hrushevskyi's body.",
      "His body was discovered about a year and a half after police found the bullet-riddled remains of former Russian military helicopter pilot Maksim Kuzminov in the parking garage of the same apartment complex in Villajoysa \u2014 a town on the Mediterranean coast whose name means \"joyful village.\"",
      "Kuzminov, who was killed at the age of 28, first made headlines in his home region when he defected from Russia, flying his Mi-8 helicopter below radar in August 2023 across the border into Ukraine.",
      "He handed over the helicopter, sensitive military equipment and top secret Russian intelligence to Ukrainian authorities before appearing on Ukrainian television and calling the war launched by President Vladimir Putin \"a genocide of Ukrainian people.\"",
      "Just days after he was killed, Russian state news agencies quoted Sergei Naryshkin, the head of Russia's SVR foreign intelligence service, as calling Kuzminov a \"traitor and criminal\" who had become \"a moral corpse at the very moment when he planned his dirty and terrible crime.\"",
      "Naryshkin did not confirm or deny Russian involvement in the former pilot's murder, but months earlier, Russian state TV said the GRU intelligence agency had \"been given the order\" to eliminate Kuzminov.",
      "CBS' 60 Minutes reported last year that the Ukrainian government gave Kuzminov about $500,000 and a new Ukrainian identity, and officials warned him not to leave the country due to the threat of possible retaliation by Russia. But he decided to risk a life in the sunshine of Villajoyosa regardless.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting director Todd Lyons that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 20, 2025.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 Director Lyons, thank you so much for your time.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR OF IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT TODD LYONS: Oh, appreciate it. Appreciate it. Thanks for coming.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: You are leading the agency that is at the center of President Trump's top domestic policy agenda, immigration enforcement and cracking down on illegal immigration. How do you see ICE's role in this administration?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 Well, I think, definitely, I see it as a law enforcement tool, right? So ICE is really focused on its public safety mission. I think under all administrations, that what ICE truly is, it's a law enforcement entity. And I really think right now, our main focus is public safety, and that's- that's my focus. The main focus is to keep American people safe and to enact our law enforcement mission.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 The administration has set a goal of carrying out about a million deportations per year annually. Congress just gave your agency $45 billion just to fund its detention network, and also another $30 billion to boost deportation efforts. What exactly will that money fund, and what do we expect that to look on the ground?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 On the ground, what we're really focused on is definitely hiring more in our ranks. In order to achieve the President's mission, and under Secretary Noem's vision, we definitely need more officers and agents.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Do you know how many?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 We're looking to hire about 10,000 and- but that's we've been depleted over the past four years. Our ranks have really shrunk, and we really don't have enough to do law enforcement mission. One of the big hampers for us is with the increase in sanctuary cities and sanctuary policies, we have to send more officers and agents out into the community, out on the street. Where we'd only take us two agents, say, going into a secure facility or a police station, county jail to arrest a public safety threat, well, we have to send out four to five agents, and with the increase of assaults on officers, we sometimes have to send out eight to ten just to provide security for those officers that are making the arrest. So that's one of the big things that we're looking forward to with this increased funding is increasing our manpower. Not only just officers, but our attorneys as well, to ensure that we have enough of legal support to go ahead and deal with the Department of Justice, immigration court appeals, things like that.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Detention facilities too.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 Detention facility as well, yeah.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Is the goal of 1 million deportations per year now possible because of this money?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 I definitely think it's possible. One thing though, that ICE is historically known for in our mission is we detain to remove, we don't detain punitively. So people do hear that increase in the bed space, but it's not for long-term. We, you know, it's- we detain people to remove them. So what we want to do, too, is focus on the removal efforts as well, because one thing we want to do is remove people in a safe, humane manner, but also efficiently as well, quickly. There's no reason for someone to linger in a detention facility after they've been lawfully ordered by immigration judge. We want to ensure that they can get back to their home country safely and quickly.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 More than a dozen individuals are facing charges for that violent attack against an ICE facility in Texas. The Department of Homeland Security, as you know, has also reported a sharp increase in attacks against your agents. What do you think is behind that?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 You know, I honestly have to say, I think it's just the increased rhetoric that we hear against ICE officers and the ICE mission. If we think back to when you and I did a ride along last year, in October. You know, you and I spent a good amount of time together observing teams in the field, and you didn't see the officers and agents that day masked up, right? You didn't see any kind of violence towards us, any protests. Even going back to January 20, beginning of this administration, up until the middle of February, you really didn't see that kind of rhetoric or violence coming against ICE officers and agents like you do now. I think the sharp increase in the rhetoric, especially from a lot of elected officials that are shaming, if you will, or speaking out against the ICE law enforcement mission, is what's really increasing these attacks on officers. And that, unfortunately, the Alvarado incident down in Prairieland, that is one that's really taken it to the next level. We've seen protests. We've seen rocks. Rocks, in itself, could be a deadly weapon, but now we have individuals laying in ambush with firearms to attack an ICE facility. Just the increase is amazing. The fact that, like you said, 830% increase from last year assaults on officers. That's what really keeps me up at night, is because we have to focus on the men and women of ICE, keeping them safe, making sure they go home to their families, our other partners, as well as the people in the community we interact with. You know, someone might interject themselves into this arrest of someone that's wanted for, say, a murder in their home country, a violent felon who has nothing to lose. And one of these people, agitators or protesters, might get involved in an ICE law enforcement arrest, and they could get injured as well. So there's a lot of factors that really come with this rhetoric against ICE officers and agents.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 Do you think the increase in attacks against ICE officers is connected to the broader increase in ICE arrests across the country? Because you're seeing more arrests, you're seeing more attacks, too.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS:\u00a0 I think we're seeing both. I think because we are more visible in the community. You know, there was- recently, people had talked about the amount of support that ICE had under President Obama. Well, during those times, we did make more custodial arrests, those arrests like you would--",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: In jails--",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: --in the jails, right? We weren't really out there. We just don't see that now with a lot of the sanctuary policies and just a lot of- lot of lack of cooperation. So you are seeing us out more, and I think there is more of a tension, kind of like you said, the immigration mission is one of the forefront of this administration, so it is a lot of scrutiny and publicity to it. So I think that's also leading to a lot of the, you know, the rhetoric, the criticism, and just a lot more of the increased violence on officers.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 And you have cited those concerns about officer safety when defending your agents wearing masks during operations. That has become a polarizing debate. What do you say, director, to the criticism that law enforcement officials, including ICE officers, should be identifying themselves, and that the use of masks could be potentially dangerous, including because it could lead to imposters posing as ICE agents.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yeah, and that's one of our biggest concerns, and I've said it publicly before, I'm not a proponent of the masks. However, if that's a tool that the men and women of ICE to keep themselves and their family safe, then I will allow it. I do kind of push back on the criticism that they don't identify themselves. If you see a lot of the photos, like we were out that day, like I would go back to our ride along. Men and women of ICE and our DOJ partners in local law enforcement do help us. They are identified on their vest. You can see the HSI, ERO, federal police officer, FBI on the back of the vest. So I would push back on the notion that we aren't identifying themselves. Now, what I would advocate for, and I've said this many times, is I know a lot of elected officials have put forward legislation or proposed legislation about banning of the masks, things like that. I would also want, you know, elected officials to help us hold those people accountable that do doxx or threaten an ICE officer or agent or their family. I think that's key. If we- if we had that kind of support and had those laws or regulations in place, that we can hold those folks accountable to give ICE agents and officers and other law enforcement officers the peace of mind that someone that does threaten their life or their families or doxxes them will be held accountable. I think that'd go a long way.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 So you will continue to allow ICE officers to wear masks during operations.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: I will.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Okay, what is the policy regarding that? It's not mandatory.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: It's not mandatory. As you see- I don't know, I wasn't with your ride-along yesterday, but if you see some of the media coverage, there are officers and agents that don't. Recently, there's been some officers that have been interviewed by other networks who- who've talked about the fears and some of the issues with the job. So there are some that don't, but there are some that have been severely doxxed. You know, speaking from experience, last administration I had multiple protesters from antifa show up at my residence. My address has been put out there. My family's information has been put out there. So I know firsthand what these men and women go through, and it's a scary experience for someone's family, because as a law enforcement officer, you don't sign up for that. You don't bring- you don't bring the work home to your job. But when you have folks, or even elected officials saying that there's going to be no rest for an ICE officer, an agent, that we're going to expose them, you know, no rest for their family. That really concerns me.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Let's get into who ICE is arresting.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Sure.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Do you know how many of the individuals arrested by ICE are people here illegally, but who also have serious criminal records?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yeah, we- we- like I said from the get go, and even, again, going back to when we were together in October, ICE is always focused on the worst of the worst. One difference you'll see now is under this administration, we have opened up the whole aperture of the immigration portfolio, meaning that if you're here illegally and ICE goes out and arrests someone that is released from a sanctuary jurisdiction or wanted in their home country, and an ICE officer finds other individuals with them who are in the country illegally, we're going to take them as well. We are still focused on the worst of the worst. More than half the individuals we have in custody right now have either a conviction or pending criminal charges, since they're released from a sanctuary jurisdiction. One thing, though, that I'd like to highlight is the fact that foreign criminal records aren't in U.S. data systems. So when we do go out and say, arrest someone that has an Interpol Red Notice because they're wanted in their home country, they're still a criminal, but under the American judicial state, they don't have an American criminal history, but that doesn't mean they don't have a criminal history in their home country. I think that's one of the statistic that kind of gets lost in someone and they say, well, this person is non criminal- he doesn't have a criminal history in the United States. Well, that individual can have a criminal history, say, in Brazil, Uruguay, Ukraine, Russia. So there's a lot too that goes into that, what ICE offices and agents do arrest people for.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: And you're saying that now, if your agents encounter anyone who is here illegally, irrespective of whether or not they have a criminal record, that person will be taken into custody?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: If they're here in the United States illegally, yes, they will.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: They're so-called collateral arrests.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Correct.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Okay. We just, as you mentioned, rode along with Border- not Border Patrol, but ICE agents in Maryland, and we saw the agents arresting sex offenders, suspected gang members, the individuals that the president has promised to deport from the country. He often talks about getting rid of the worst of the worst who are in the country illegally. But we have also seen ICE arrest day laborers outside of Home Depots, in some cases, farm workers, people attending their court hearings in immigration court. Is the policy still to prioritize the arrests and deportation of people who are here illegally, but also are violent offenders?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yes, that's one thing, and that's one thing I'm extremely focused on since I became the acting director, is the fact that the president and Secretary Noem have made a promise to the American public that ICE is going to focus on the worst of the worst, and that's what we do need to focus our limited resources on. That's one thing I've always said from the start. What's, again, frustrating for me is the fact that we would love to focus on these criminal aliens that are inside a jail facility, right? A local law enforcement agency, state agency already deemed that person a public safety threat and arrested them and they're in detention. I'd much rather focus all of our limited resources on that to take them into custody, but we do have to go out into the community and make those arrests, and that's where you are seeing those increase of if we encounter someone say, that- that is here in the country illegally, we will take them into custody. In regards to the work site, like you mentioned, one thing that I'd really like to highlight, especially what kicked off June 6 in LA, is the fact that when you see ICE doing these work raids, like the marijuana grow farm, you- we are going there with criminal search warrants or criminal arrest warrants. Not only are we focused on those individuals that are, you know, working here illegally, we're focused on these American companies that are actually exploiting these laborers, these people that came here for a better life. You know, either, you know, forced labor, child trafficking, you know, a lot of these work site cases just isn't a victimless crime of someone here working illegally and that's why we're going there with these criminal warrants to focus on these American businesses that are trying to make an extra dollar on the backs of these people that came here for a better life.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: So you are planning on holding accountable the employers, the companies that are hiring people who are here illegally, not just the workers.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: 100%.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Because that has been a concern.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: It is- it is. I can definitely see that concern, but what I would say is that we have to hold these American businesses accountable, especially when it comes to human trafficking, or child trafficking, forced labor, because those are victims, right? That, you know, that's where illegal employment isn't just a victimless crime, it's a victim at the end of that being exploited. And these American companies do exploit individuals who come here illegally just to make an extra dollar, and that's just not right. We have to hold those county- companies accountable.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Should anyone here illegally now be scared of ICE agents potentially arresting them? Should that be something that they should be worried about?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: No- I- what I can- I can speak for with ICE is, we've always done targeted enforcement. That's one thing I- I always stress. You saw it when you- when you and I rode together in Baltimore last year. ICE knows who they're going after that day. There are other DHS entities, Border Patrol has a different mission, CBP has a different mission than us. I can't speak to them, but I will speak to ICE, and the fact that, when ICE does go out, the person we're looking for, it- has a criminal record, has been released from a jail, that's considered a public safety threat, or has been ordered lawfully removed from the United States by an immigration judge. That's another one of our big things as well. But again, to go back to my point earlier, if we do go out--",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Who may not be criminals, but have been ordered deported.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yeah. Ordered deported. There are millions of people that are here in the United States that have had their due process, went through the entire immigration process, and have been lawfully ordered deported by a Department of Justice immigration judge, and have just not left the country. We are focused on them as well. But again, to go back to what I said earlier, if we go ahead and go out into the community, and we do effectuate an arrest of one of those individuals, but there might be two or three other individuals with that person that's here illegally, we're just not going to walk away like we did in the past. We are going to, you know, conduct our law enforcement mission and arrest those individuals.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: I want to read you, Director, a letter that Congressman Tony Gonzales and other Republicans wrote to you, actually. They said, \"every minute that we spend pursuing an individual with a clean record is a minute less that we dedicate on apprehending terrorists or cartel operatives.\" Isn't that just objectively true from an operational standpoint, because you don't have the agents and facilities, perhaps, to detain everyone who is here illegally?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: I would say that. Operationally, I've always said we do have limited resources. Now we are going to get that funding with the president's Big Beautiful Bill. To the congressman, I would say that ICE is still focused on going after terrorists. We've- we've- you know, arrested over 3,000 TDA gang members, which is now a foreign terrorist organization. But much- what I would say is, much like any local law enforcement agency, if you pull somebody over in a vehicle, and that person has a misdemeanor warrant, say, or a civil warrant, that local law enforcement agency isn't going to walk away from that individual. They're going to arrest that individual. And it's the same with ICE. So while we still are going out after the rapists, murderers, terrorists, we are going to encounter individuals that are here illegally. But what I can promise is, our main focus is those public safety threats, are those national security concerns, because that's what ICE's mission is. Now we are going to encounter those other people which are listed as collaterals, but we just can't walk away from them. We need to do our law enforcement mission as well.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: You're not ignoring those cases anymore.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: No.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: On worksite enforcement, there have been some mixed messages, if you will, from the administration. Initially, there was an effective pause on arrests at hotels, restaurants, and farms. That was quickly reversed. The president has talked about, Director, giving a pass to farmers who are in the country with workers who are here illegally. What is the policy now, when it comes to immigration worksite enforcement?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Which is- kind of what I said earlier in the interview, is the fact that work- when we do a worksite enforcement, it's based on a criminal case. So ICE is still going to focus on a criminal case, whether that be, like you saw on the marijuana grow farm in California, whether it be suspected human trafficking or child forced labor, issues like that. So our policy is still, if we're going to worksite enforcement, we are focused on that criminal aspect of the investigation. So that's what ICE's policy is. I can't speak to the administration. I don't want to get ahead of the president or secretary when it comes to any type of long term immigration plan they do have for the workers, but I will say for ICE, our policy is, we're still going to build solid criminal cases on those worksites to include the businesses, and that's what we're focused on.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Including farms, hotels and restaurants?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Well, we have seen, in many instances, where certain organizations do exploit labor like that, whether it be child labor, human trafficking, things like that. We can't walk away from a criminal case when it comes to real victims there, we'll still focus on those. Now administratively, I- we're gonna focus more heavily on the criminal side of that.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: But there's no ban on enforcement operations at certain work sites?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: No. And I think, like I said, you'll see, when we show up at a work site, it's because a signed federal judge warrant has brought us there for a criminal reason.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Like in the case of the cannabis farms in California?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Correct.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: White House Deputy Chief of Staff, Stephen Miller, who plays a major role on immigration policy in this administration, has talked about ICE carrying out at least 3,000 daily arrests. Right now, you are not hitting that number. Is that target realistic? And can you get to it just by apprehending criminals?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: I- if you look at the amount of criminals that we've already arrested, I think you see we can. I think when you look at those larger numbers, when people talk about those certain goals, you have to also look at those individuals that do have those final orders of removals. Those are what we're really focused on as well. There was many people that were let in the last administration that have gone through their immigration process, who have not shown up for immigration court and have been ordered deported. We still have to focus on those. So I would still say that you're going to see what ICE resources going out daily will be still those criminal cases and those final orders.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Can you get to that 3,000 number per day?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: I think operationally, we can get to any number we set our- set our mind on. I think we just need to be limited in our scope, and use our limited resources to focus on the worst of the worst. I- you know, operationally, when we're trying to protect the American public, I can't be focused on a number. We have to be focused on, number one, getting those public safety threats and those national security threats out of the country, like we did just recently, when we arrested some of those Iranians. There were potential, known, suspected terrorists that came in on the last administration. And we also had to worry about the safety of the men and women of ICE as well. Those are the two main focus that I need to focus on, on our daily operations.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Do you know what the current daily arrest average is right now?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: I wouldn't say this daily arrest average. It just really depends on size and scope of what we're doing nationwide. It can go anywhere from 2,500 to 1,700 a day.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Got it, okay. Our colleague Margaret Brennan recently obtained ICE data showing that only a small percentage of the convicted criminals that ICE has deported over the past six months had convictions for violence offenses. For example, fewer than 1% had homicide convictions. What do you make of that data?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: What I make of that is the fact that we can't look at it just based on the violence or the propensity of violence in that crime. What I looked at is, someone has committed a crime in the United States. Now, if you look at someone that has just been arrested, say, for DUI. Well, some people might say that's only a misdemeanor. We may have prevented vehicular homicide down the road for someone that's a habitual traffic offender. I can't look at the larger scale of what specific crimes are. You know, whether it's a rape, a homicide, of course, you want to get those worst of the worst. But if someone's committed a crime here in the United States and been let back into the community, into here illegally, we need to focus on that. So what I focus on is ensuring that those individuals that have committed a crime are the first ones we're focused on, and that's who we are going to remove.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: As you know, Director, the Supreme Court recently allowed third-country deportations to continue. Should we expect those deportations to increase in the near future? And are other countries, additional nations, now stepping up and saying, I will take back people who are not my citizens?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yeah, I would say you'd see that. But what I'd go back to is the fact that safe third-country removals has been a part of the Immigration Nationality Act for decades. This isn't something that's new, ICE has always done this, so obviously it's come to the forefront now, because, as we talked about earlier, immigration enforcement is at the forefront of the President's administration. But this has been part of the Immigration Nationality Act, which has been enacted by Congress for decades. So we've been doing this for years. That's been part of one of ICE's tools to remove individuals from these recalcitrant countries that just won't take anyone back. Prime example, if we had a country that won't take a homicide suspect back, and under the Supreme Court ruling of Zadvydas, we don't hold punitively, so we can only hold someone for six months to effectuate their removal. If their country won't take them back, we have to release this rapist and murderer back into the community. What Congress did under the Immigration Nationality Act, when enacting the Safe Third Country Agreement, gives us an option to remove these offenders back to a country that will take them.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: So you will continue those deportations.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: We will continue those deportations.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: To countries like South Sudan, for example.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yes.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Does it make sense to send people to countries where they have no ties, though? Even if they are convicted criminals.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Well, I would say, is I- my main focus, like I said, is the safety and security in the United States. Why would we let child rapists with a propensity of violence back into the community, because their home nation won't take them, when they're not here lawfully, or they have no right to stay here. That's our focus. Is to make sure that we are removing these individuals from the country in the most effective and meaningful way that we can. And if their home country won't take them back, then we need to seek other options, other than letting them just roam in the United States.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: The Associated Press, director, just reported that ICE now has access to the personal information of millions of people enrolled in Medicaid, including names and addresses. Can you confirm that that is true? And if so, what does ICE plan to do with that information?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: You know, one thing that we have seen is the fact that under the last administration, we have so many known got-aways, or individuals that came into the United States and just totally disappeared off the grid. What ICE is doing is working with all of our other federal partners to try to gain intelligence, to locate these individuals that have been ordered deported by a judge or have been released from a sanctuary jurisdiction like we talked about. That is what ICE is using that data for, whether it be data from the Department of Labor, data from health and service- Health and Human Services, Medicaid, we are using that data to try to locate, again, the worst of the worst, those people that have been lawfully deported. So I think that's what you're going to see that data used for.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ:\u00a0 To identify and arrest people who are here illegally.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: Yes.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Let's talk about Alligator Alcatraz. Florida just opened a facility, as you know, in the Everglades, that is holding people awaiting deportation because they're here illegally. Some of them have committed crimes. How much of that facility is designed to help you operationally versus to send the message? That message being, if you're here illegally, you could potentially be sent to this scary-sounding place like Alligator Alcatraz.",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: It's more of an operational. State of Florida had partnered with us for that. We had limited, we had limited space in Florida, obviously. What I would say is that we don't have the detention space capacity to remove people. Partnering with states like this definitely does help us. It is an operational need for us, is to have those partnerships with states, especially a state like Florida that does have the 287(g) agreement, where their local, State and County deputies are deputized to be ICE officers who are encountering these individuals. That definitely helps us in the- in the mission of removing individuals from the United States.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: As you underscore, there have been some growing tensions in some communities because of ICE enforcement actions. Do you think there's any way, Director, to de-escalate the situation, and can you carry out the mass deportation operation that the President has promised without losing the trust of many in the public?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: I think one of the main things for us is that open line of communication, interviews like this, actually people looking at what ICE is doing, us highlighting these criminal offenders that we are arresting. I think a key thing too, is working with elected officials to come to common ground, to really focus on the safety of neighborhoods and communities, and really focus on what ICE does in their law enforcement mission, and totally take out the rhetoric of what's being said right now, and just really focus on that ICE is a viable law enforcement partner that does a significant public safety mission for the United States. I think that's very key in keeping these open line of communications, and working with local and state government- governments and elected officials to ensure that we are removing these public safety threats from their communities.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Director, is there something I didn't ask you that you wanted to underscore?",
      "ACTING DIRECTOR LYONS: No, I just really liked- appreciate you taking the time to come here, and let me highlight exactly what the ICE mission is. And I just appreciate the opportunity to have that conversation.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: All right. Thank you, Director.",

      "The environmental project, named Belreefs, aims to turn the wreckage into a biodiversity sanctuary.",
      "Flat oysters form reefs that purify water and that other sea animals, from fish to algae, use as breeding and feeding grounds, explained Stratigaki.",
      "\"There is a lot of predation in the sea, it's a wild environment,\" she said, with about 30,000 of the oyster larvae expected to survive their first year at sea. \"Then they will start reproducing, extending the reef and also supporting the biodiversity of the reef.\"",
      "The laying of the oyster stash is the culmination of two years' work for the Belgian government project, which is supported by European Union funding.",
      "\"Until around the 1850s, the North Sea and the European waters were full of these oyster reefs,\" Stratigaki explained.",
      "Then overfishing, the spreading of an imported parasite called Bonamia and \"climatic adverse effects\" caused them to disappear, she said.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 We turn now to Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. Good morning, Madam Mayor.",
      "LOS ANGELES MAYOR KAREN BASS:\u00a0 Good morning, good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Glad you can hear me. We are looking at immigration issues six months in. You have had such a firsthand experience out in LA, given the deployment of U.S. troops. The President ordered the early release of nearly half of the National Guard from LA. Have they departed yet? What are the remaining ones doing?",
      "MAYOR BASS:\u00a0 Well, I believe they've departed, but they were never needed in the first place, and the remaining ones are doing what they were doing all along, which is essentially protecting two federal buildings, one of which in Westwood, where there never has been a big protest against the immigration raids. This is just such an incredible misuse of, not only taxpayers money, but of the young people who are in the National Guard, who have had to leave their families, their jobs and their education for this deployment that is completely unnecessary. 4,000 troops, my understanding, is, most of their time has been spent in complete boredom, playing video games and essentially waiting around. Because again, 4,000 deployed, and about 200 actually used.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 The White House, of course, argues they deployed them because there was interference with the operations of law enforcement in carrying out some of the roundups. There are still enforcement actions by ICE taking place. You have talked about your objections, as you described them to \"masked men, unmarked cars, drawing guns, snatching people off the street.\" You filed a Freedom of Information request to quote, \"know who these masked men are.\" Why, though, is their identity important to you? Do you plan to prosecute them?",
      "MAYOR BASS:\u00a0 Well, no, let me just explain, because you have people who are literally walking down the street, sitting at bus stops, are individual vendors selling fruit on the street. These masked men pull up in unmarked cars and jump out of the cars with rifles and detain people. So for the average citizen, it looks like it's a violent kidnapping. So you should never have that. They don't identify themselves. And furthermore, to your previous guest, how on earth do they know that they're a threat when they're just chasing random people through parking lots at Home Depots, going to car washes and rounding up people. It's difficult to get your car washed in Los Angeles now, because most of the car washes, the employees won't come to work out of fear that a raid will take place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the acting director says that his agents, some of them fear that their families will be retaliated against, and that's why they are covering their faces, that they do wear markings for the agencies that they work with. How do you respond?",
      "MAYOR BASS:\u00a0 Well, well, first of all, let me just tell you that the masked men are not from Los Angeles, and so how their families could be retaliated against. And then what is that to say to local law enforcement, the Los Angeles Police Department, none of whom are ever masked who always identify themselves and even hand someone a business card. So that makes absolutely no sense at all. And I don't know, but I have a hard time believing that the woman selling pineapples on the corner is going to attack an ICE agent. And then when he says that there's identification, the problem is many of these men are in plain clothes with vests on that say 'police,' it looks like something that they could have gotten online. I think it's really important to point out the extreme nature of the randomness. And you know, Homan has said, he's mentioned a number of criteria for why they stop people. One of the points of criteria is physical appearance. Los Angeles is 3.8 million people, and about 50% of our population is Latino, so I guess that means 50% of Los Angeles could be possible suspects in an immigration raid.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Tom Homan has- Tom Homan has said physical description cannot be the sole factor for reasonable suspicion, but things like location, occupation, physical appearance add up, particularly if a person runs away, or if there's a tattoo or something. You don't seem to believe that.",
      "MAYOR BASS: Location, sitting at a- well, location, sitting at a bus stop, walking down the street, selling fruit? No, I do dispute that, absolutely. And you know, again, the National Guard should have never been deployed in the first place. We did not ask for them. This is the federal seizure of power from a governor deploying the National Guard when the National Guard were not even needed. We had protests at the end of the- at the end of the peaceful protest, there absolutely was some violence and some looting and vandalism, we brought that completely under control. The troops have never been involved in crowd control, never involved in the protest. They have been guarding a building. Our police department and our sheriff's department are the ones that brought the protests, when it devolved into violence, under control. We never needed the National Guard in the first place. This is a political stunt, a terrible misuse of taxpayers' dollars.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's more we could talk about here but I want to ask you about fires, because we are now officially in fire season. It was just six months ago we saw those blazes in LA, you fired the then fire chief for you said a failure to prepare. But you still don't have a permanent fire chief in that role. Isn't that a problem? Are you prepared?",
      "MAYOR BASS:\u00a0 No, no, I don't think that that's a problem at all. Our interim fire chief has 40 years of experience. In fact, he had just recently retired. I called him in, out of retirement, during the fires. He was doing the emergency operation center. So he stepped in, didn't miss a beat by taking over the fire department. And we are prepared. We do know that it's fire season.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So is your plan to keep him in place since you brought him out of retirement?--",
      "MAYOR BASS: --No--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:--put him in an interim basis?",
      "MAYOR BASS:\u00a0 I'm sorry, no, we're doing a national search, and he is certainly open to apply. But the nation's second-largest city needs to make sure that we search the nation for the best talent. And I'm sure that there will be people in the department that apply, but we want to cast the net wide. We did the same type of search for our police chief--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Well okay--",
      "MAYOR BASS:--in the meantime he is more than capable of managing well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, wish the city well. We will be watching as you move through fire season. Thank you--",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Jim Himes. He joins us from Connecticut. Good morning to you. Congressman, you are on the Financial Services Committee, so let's pick up right there. The Supreme Court indicated that the President of the United States does not have the authority to fire the Fed Chair unless there is cause. It sounds like the White House is trying to build a case that they have cause. If they go ahead with it, what happens?",
      "CONGRESSMAN JIM HIMES: Yeah, well, you know, Margaret, the last question you asked the Secretary, shows what a con man he is. And I just listened to his whole thing. And, you know, if you're over the age of five, you've dealt with hucksters and con men. Everything is going to be great in two weeks. By August 1st, we're going to have a deal. The American people are going to be so happy. Complete failure to understand the facts, right? He said that tariffs are paid by foreign countries. Tariffs are not paid by foreign countries. He said, Jay Powell is torturing the American people. Margaret, you didn't have the time, but if you'd had a minute, you would have said, wait a minute. There's a Federal Open Market Committee that is comprised of seven Fed governors, and all of the heads of the central bank offices around the country. That committee, comprised of people who have been appointed by Democratic and Republican Presidents, set the interest rates, right? So, this notion that Jay Powell is unilaterally stopping a decline in interest rates, which, by the way, in the of- in the face- for those of those folks who know a little bit about economics, in the face of up-ticking inflation, which we're seeing, would be absolutely bananas. So, what you just saw was a master class by a huckster and a con man who uses words like torture that are very, very dangerous words, not just for the economy, but for the physical safety of people like Jay Powell.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, just to be clear, that's why I said it's not the Chairman's unilateral decision for exactly the reason you raised, that there is a committee that makes the decision. The inflation rate for the CPI was 2.7% if you strip out food- energy and food, which is more volatile, it's up two-tenths of a percent. So, that economic data is what we are pointing to there, not opinion on pricing. But, is there congressional pushback that can be done? I mean, what happens if there's a tweet that says the Fed chair is gone?",
      "REP. HIMES: Well, interestingly, inside the White House, and I don't know who it is, my guess is it's maybe the Treasury Secretary is saying, and this is a very difficult thing to say to a person like Donald Trump, that if you fire the Fed chair, either illegally, which they're happy to do, or because you trump up some baloney-like-charge associated with a renovation of the headquarters, there is going to be a massive market reaction, because you cannot lie to the capital markets. We saw this the day after Liberation Day, before we all were familiarized with the TACO trade. The day after liberation day, the stock and the bond markets took a nosedive. So, my guess is that somebody is saying to the president because he doesn't care if he follows the law or not, and the law is very clear that he can't fire the Fed chair. But somebody is saying to the President, the economic instability that gets caused when the cornerstone of the global economy and capital markets all of the sudden has a politically driven interest rate policy. I think that's the one thing that's holding them off.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, we're going to take a quick break and continue our conversation on a variety of topics. We need to bring up with you on the other side of it, stay with us.",
      "[COMMERCIAL BREAK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We are continuing our conversation now with Connecticut Congressman Jim Himes, who is the ranking member on the Intelligence Committee. Congressman, I want to pick up on that topic. Just a statement of fact here: A bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee investigation found that the US intelligence community assessment of Russian interference in the 2016 election was correct. They deemed it to be so on a bipartisan basis. I'm saying that because today and yesterday, the director of the intelligence community, Tulsi Gabbard, has said that she is referring for prosecution former American officials she accused of treasonous conspiracy, a years-long coup against President Trump, because they assessed Russia had tried to influence the election. This is weeks after the CIA Director issued a report critiquing the tradecraft that went into that 2016 assessment. Is there any legal basis for any kind of prosecution here?",
      "REP. HIMES: None, absolutely none. Margaret, what you saw from the Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, was not just a lie, but a very dangerous lie, because when you start throwing around language like sedition and treason, somebody is going to get hurt. Now, you pointed out that the Senate committee, then led by Marco Rubio, a Republican and now Secretary of State, found unanimously that Russia meddled in the election to try to assist Donald Trump. John Durham, special counsel appointed by Donald Trump, investigated this, found that the Senate report was correct. Now, what Tulsi is doing it's a little sleight of hand, but it's worth focusing on. She is saying that the Intelligence Committee, early on, said that the Russians could not use cyber tools to mess with the voting infrastructure, the machines that tally our votes. And that was true then, and it is true now, though the Russians tried to break into a couple of states, you know, election technical infrastructure. They didn't do it, but it is well known and well established that the Russians hacked into the DNC and undertook any number of other influence operations, including buying reams of Facebook ads to discredit Hillary Clinton. That is not in contention, right? And what is horrifying about this whole lie out of Gabbard is, number one, it puts people at risk. And right now, you know, the mouth-breathers on MAGA online are just going out of their minds based on a lie. And number two, the intelligence community is full of very, good people who do their jobs every single day, and now they're watching their leader do something that each and every one of them knows is dishonest and it is a really, really bad thing for the safety and security of the American people when that dynamic is- is out there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That Senate report is online, the findings are there, but I understand your distinction there, and it's an important one in influence versus physical hacking. You're--",
      "REP. HIMES: -- By- by the way Margaret, if I may- if I may, you asked about the referral. Here's the test. This is Epstein all over again. Criminal referrals. We're going to prosecute Barack Obama, you know, treasonous and seditious. Here's the thing, and I hope that 4, 5, 6, weeks from now- don't take it from this Democrat. 4,5,6, weeks from now, let's see if this administration, Tulsi Gabbard, accusing a former president of treason. Let's see if they bring charges. They won't. They won't, because there's not a judge in the land, not a single judge who will treat this with anything other than laughter that will be heard from the Atlantic to the Pacific in this country. So the test of this is 4,5,6 weeks from now, is the DOJ bringing charges? And the answer to that is no. And now we're going to be in Epstein world. We're like, wait a minute, treasonous conspiracy by a former president. Why isn't the Department of Justice bringing charges? And the answer to that question is that it is a lie.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. On the other topic, I want to ask you about as a Democrat, the New York Times-- the DNC--\u00a0 is reporting the DNC examination of what went wrong in the last election is going to steer clear of the decisions made by the Biden turned Harris campaign. You were very direct early on in calling for then President Biden to drop out of this race. You don't parse your words normally. Do you actually think it is possible for your party to self-diagnose problems without looking at the presidential race itself in terms of the candidates?",
      "REP. HIMES: Look, we need to acknowledge and every- and all of America saw it on the night of that disastrous debate in the July before the election that Joe Biden was not going to win the election. That was not just evident in the debate. It was evident in the polling that his people were keeping from him. Okay, so that is a fact. Now, Democrats are a big tent party. We go from Joe Manchin, who's practically a Republican, to AOC who is a Democratic socialist. So, we always have a struggle in coming up with sort of one set of policies, one set of messaging, and it's particularly hard to do when we don't have a presidential candidate. You know, a presidential candidate, of course, attracts the attention, is sort of the one person who must run nationwide and speak for the party as a whole. Right now, we're having a lot of conversations with a lot of different views, and I understand that's enormously frustrating to Democrats who are so upset over the result of the election. But you know, other than fight back with the tools that we have right now, we've got to be introspective about what we have done wrong that resulted in a dramatic win by Donald Trump in 2020*. There's an awful lot of rage in the Democratic Party, and my message to my Democratic friends is fine. I get the rage, believe me. I was in the chamber on January 6, 2021, and worried for my own life. But the thing to do right now is to be introspective and ask yourself, what can we do better to appeal to more people, including those people that we have lost time and time again in elections.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: 15 months out from the midterm races. Congressman Jim Himes, thank you. We'll be right back.",
      "*President Donald Trump won the 2024 election. Former President Biden won the 2020 election."

    "story": [
      "The centuries-old complete skeleton of a medieval knight was found under the former site of a famous ice cream shop in Poland, researchers said.",
      "The discovery was made on a small plot in Gda\u0144sk, a city on the country's coast. The site was once home to an ice cream parlor called Mi\u015b, which operated there since 1962 but has since moved to a new location. Researchers say several other archaeological discoveries have been made at the site in recent years, including the remains of cottages dating back to the 12th and 13th century and an ancient city street.",
      "Archaeologists from the ArcheoScan Archaeological and Conservation Workshop were working on the site in July when they found the knight's tombstone. The stone, made of limestone, was engraved with the image of a knight, the organization said on social media. On July 8, the headstone was moved to Gda\u0144sk's Archaeological Museum. Early analysis determined the stone likely dates back to the 13th or 14th century.",
      "Two days later, the team found the complete skeleton of the medieval knight. He was buried about five inches under the tombstone, researchers said on social media. He appears to have been about 40 years old when he died, anthropologist Dr. Aleksandra Pud\u0142o said in an article published on Gda\u0144sk's official website. The knight appears to have been between about 5'6\" and 5'10\" tall, researchers said. Pud\u0142o said the skull and bones of the skeleton were very well-preserved. Gda\u0144sk's website noted that the skull is in worse shape than the other bones.",
      "It's not clear who the knight may have served, according to Gda\u0144sk's official website. The city was captured by a German Catholic military order called the Teutonic Knights in the early 13th century. It's also unclear if the burial predates or postdates the event, researchers said. The knight may have also served the Sobies\u0142aw dynasty, which ruled Gda\u0144sk during the 11th and 12th century.",
      "More research will be conducted on the skeleton and the tombstone, as well as other relics found during the dig. Researchers have found several other notable tombstones, though the knight's appears to be the most impressive. The tombstone will be examined with 3D software, and archaeologists will likely attempt a detailed reconstruction of the artifact. Pud\u0142o said that the skeleton of the knight will undergo a \"thorough examination,\"\u00a0 and the results of that may be available as early as next year.",

    "summary": "Scientists find that diet, especially ultraprocessed foods, has a greater impact on obesity than physical activity levels, challenging common weight gain assumptions.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel weighs in on the MAHA Commission's report on chronic disease rates in children and explains what is contributing to the obesity epidemic on 'Fox Report.'",
      "Obesity among adults continues to be a major public health issue in the United States and other economically developed countries, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO).",
      "\"It's a mix of poor diet, high stress levels, lack of muscle and lack of frequent movement,\" Lindsay Allen, a registered dietitian nutritionist and owner of Back in Balance Nutrition in Florida, told Fox News Digital.",
      "While both overeating and lack of exercise are often to blame, a new global study suggests that one factor far outweighs the other.",
      "YOUR DNA COULD BE STOPPING YOU FROM LOSING WEIGHT, NEW STUDY SUGGESTS",
      "Scientists studied more than 4,000 adults from 34 populations, ranging from hunter-gatherer communities to office workers.",
      "They analyzed each person\u2019s total energy expenditure (TEE), which is the number of calories burned daily, along with body fat percentage and BMI (body mass index).",
      "One dietitian says a mix of poor diet, high stress levels, lack of muscle and lack of frequent movement are behind rising obesity numbers. (iStock)",
      "When adjusted for body size, people across all lifestyles and income levels burned similar amounts of energy, even if their daily routines were drastically different.",
      "\"The differences in body fat that we see across populations likely aren't due to major differences in activity level or total daily energy burned,\" study authors Amanda McGrosky (from Elon University in North Carolina) and Amy Luke (Loyola University in Illinois) told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Rather, excess body fat is\u00a0likely\u00a0primarily the product of too many 'calories in,' or eating more calories than are burned.\"",
      "SCIENTISTS MAY HAVE DISCOVERED WHY THE POUNDS COME BACK AFTER LOSING WEIGHT",
      "People in more economically developed areas burned more calories, the researchers noted \u2014 but that\u2019s primarily because they tend to weigh more, and heavier bodies naturally burn more energy.",
      "Published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), the study concluded that how much people eat plays a far greater role than the amount of exercise when it comes to putting on weight.",
      "The findings suggest that overeating is roughly 10 times more important than a lack of exercise in skyrocketing obesity rates. (iStock)",
      "\"Our analyses suggest that increased energy intake has been roughly 10 times more important than declining activity rates in driving the modern obesity crisis,\" the authors stated.",
      "Dr. Brett Osborn, a Florida neurosurgeon and longevity expert, agrees with the adage that \"you can\u2019t out-train a bad diet.\"",
      "\"Exercise burns far fewer calories than people want to believe,\" Osborn, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"We\u2019re not gaining weight because we stopped moving. We\u2019re gaining because we\u2019re overfed.\"",
      "\"This latest data only confirms what I\u2019ve seen in my clinic: We\u2019re not gaining weight because we stopped moving. We\u2019re gaining because we\u2019re overfed.\"",
      "Allen pointed out that muscle mass should also be considered.",
      "\"Having sufficient muscle is what drastically improves metabolism and fat-burning capabilities,\" she told Fox News Digital, also emphasizing the importance of stress levels. \"People\u00a0who live in high-stress societies tend to be fatter because stress hormones change our metabolism and shift us into 'survival mode.'\"",
      "SCIENTISTS CAN DETECT JUNK FOOD CONSUMPTION IN BLOOD AND URINE TESTS",
      "Another finding involves ultraprocessed foods (UPFs), which have long ingredient lists that are often calorie-dense, shelf-stable and \"highly palatable.\"",
      "\"As more populations are exposed to increasing amounts of highly processed, highly palatable foods, we will likely see increases in obesity in regions with relatively low rates currently,\" the study authors predicted.",
      "Ultraprocessed foods are less likely to help people feel full, causing them to overeat, experts say. (iStock)",
      "Ultraprocessed foods tend to be easier to overeat due to their flavor and texture, and they also don't keep people feeling full, the study found.",
      "They are also more calorie-dense, meaning they pack more energy into smaller volumes, and are more easily absorbed, making it harder for the body to eliminate excess energy.",
      "\"Ultraprocessed foods are engineered to override our biology, namely our satiety signaling in the brain,\" Osborn told Fox News Digital. \"They also promote inflammation and shift our physiology to a state that favors fat accumulation over fat burning.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "The researchers pointed out that physical activity is still important, particularly for cardiovascular health, mental well-being and longevity.",
      "Allen noted that people \"need to consider all the other benefits of exercise and shift the mindset away from how many calories they are burning (which actually doesn't work very well for weight loss) toward building as much strength and muscle as they can.\"",
      "People should consider the benefits of exercise beyond just weight loss, a researcher advised. (iStock)",
      "Osborn agreed, recommending \"progressively intense and challenging workouts\" \u2014 strength training in particular \u2014 to help boost the metabolic rate and facilitate fat-burning.",

      "However, Allen noted, when it comes to preventing obesity, the findings point to excess calorie consumption \u2014 particularly ultraprocessed foods \u2014 as the major contributing factor.",
      "\"If you\u2019re worried about excess body fat, focus on calories in,\" McGrosky and Luke advised. \"Especially over the long term, it\u2019s much harder to meaningfully change the total number of calories you burn than it is to change the number of calories you take in.\"",

    "summary": "Mental health experts discuss the hidden toll of the Texas floods that victims will face long after emergency crews leave. Dr. Sabrina Browne shares warning signs with parents.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Sabrina Browne, a Texas-based psychiatrist, explains what flood survivors might experience and how to know when it's time to get professional help.",
      "As rescue crews and volunteers work to clean up after the tragic flooding that violently swept through central Texas over the July 4 weekend, others are looking to help survivors and victims\u2019 loved ones mentally recover. Dallas-based pediatric psychiatrist and assistant professor at UT Southwestern Medical Center Dr. Sabrina Browne spoke with Fox News Digital about what survivors and those close to victims could be grappling with.",
      "\"Tragedies like this, in a very literal sense, hit close to home, right? It\u2019s one thing when you see things playing out on TV, but when it happens in your community, it really affects your life on every level,\" Browne told Fox News Digital. \"The reality for these families is that once the camera crews are gone and once the aid organizations are packing up, they\u2019re still going to be living with the repercussions of this.\"",
      "There are several possible reactions people may have in the wake of a tragedy, like the recent flooding. According to Browne, one of the most common reactions is a loss of a \"feeling of safety\" and a \"sense of stability.\"",
      "\"You take for granted that you're gonna wake up in the morning, go about your day, you're going to come home to your house, right? And all of those things. And so they lose that sense of stability,\" Browne said.",

      "TEXAS FLOOD SURVIVORS LOOK FOR GOD IN THE FACE OF TRAGEDY",
      "She added that along with this loss of stability, some people can experience anxiety, worry or even fear that another disaster is around the corner. The mental health professional also mentioned that flood survivors could experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and even survivor\u2019s guilt.",
      "Browne has unique experience in helping Texas families through tragedy, having supported families in the wake of the 2022 Uvalde school shooting, in which 19 children and two teachers were killed at Robb Elementary School.",
      "Like the case of the Uvalde shooting, many of the flood victims in Texas were children. Browne spoke to the differences in treating adults versus children, emphasizing that \"kids aren\u2019t just little adults.\"",
      "\"When we talk about kids, that's a wide spectrum of ages and developmental levels,\" Browne said. \"A child who is 12 is going to be having a different experience than a child who\u2019s seven, right? Because they\u2019re more mature, they cognitively can understand things.\"",
      "Beyond their ability to understand what has happened, this could be a child\u2019s first time dealing with disaster and death.",
      "\"Oftentimes, kids are encountering [death] in the setting of losing a grandparent or someone where it feels removed from them. But when they're seeing their peers, other kids in camp, when school starts back up, starting school and seeing maybe their friends aren't there, that brings it to a very real level so that now they're having to wrap their heads around, what does that mean? And then they're also struggling with, is this something that could happen to me? And so that can add another layer.\"",

      "Texas professionals like Browne aren\u2019t alone in their work to help flood victims recover, Spring Health, a company focused on providing mental health solutions, recently committed $500,000 in free services for flood victims in Texas, North Carolina and New Mexico.",
      "\"Recovering from a disaster isn\u2019t just about rebuilding what was lost. It is also about caring for the emotional toll that follows. We want people to know they are not alone,\" Spring Health CEO April Koh told Fox News Digital. \"This program is here to ensure that those impacted have a way to access high-quality, confidential mental health support at no cost.\"",
      "As part of its commitment to providing care, Spring Health is making virtual sessions with licensed clinicians available for those who cannot access physical in-person help.",

      "When it comes to knowing if your child needs professional help, Browne told Fox News Digital that it comes down to noticing changes in day-to-day behavior. She said that there are reactions parents can expect to see, such as their child regressing and maybe wanting to sleep in their room to feel safe.",
      "\"If we notice that, you know, they're, they are not sleeping, they don't want to eat, they don\u2019t want to play, right? Those big shifts, that is a sign of we need to get them in to see somebody for more support,\" Browne said.",

      "In the closing weeks ahead of New York City's Democratic Party mayoral primary, as he appeared to be cruising toward capturing his party's nomination, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo focused his campaign's spotlight on President Donald Trump. But an unexpected loss to democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani forced his campaign to make an abrupt change in messaging.",
      "\"Trump\u2019s coming for New York. Who do you think can stop him?\" the narrator in a Cuomo campaign ad said, over images of the June rioting in Los Angeles sparked by Trump's immigration crackdown.",
      "\"Trump\u2019s at the city gates. We need someone experienced to slam them shut,\" the narrator said, as he suggested that Cuomo was the most experienced candidate to push back against the president's agenda.",
      "The former three-term governor, who resigned amid twin scandals in 2021, pledged, if elected mayor, to protect New York City from what he suggested could be a possible future federal crackdown against immigration protests in the city. And he vowed to mount a national campaign to try and thwart Trump's agenda.",
      "POLL POSITION: MAMDANI'S THE FRONTRUNNER, BUT ISN'T RUNNING AWAY WITH THE NYC MAYORAL RACE",
      "Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, in a speech to supporters, acknowledges that rival Zohran Mamdani 'won' the New York City Democratic Party mayoral primary, on June 24, 2025, in New York, N.Y. (Paul Steinhauser - Fox News)",
      "But Mamdani's stunning victory over Cuomo and nine other candidates last month to capture the Democratic Party nomination rocked the race for mayor in the nation's most populous city.",
      "And as Cuomo resets as he runs in the mayoral general election as an independent candidate, references to Trump have plummeted as the former governor stands for interviews. He didn't mention the president once in his video announcing his general election campaign.",
      "Longtime Cuomo adviser and spokesman Rich Azzopardi said \"that's not the case\" when asked by Fox News Digital if the former governor was de-emphasizing Trump messaging.",
      "\"It\u2019s silly. It\u2019s only been eight days since the campaign had a relaunch,\" Azzopardi said. And he said that in the local interviews Cuomo has done, \"it has been more local and pocketbook issues that have come up.\"",
      "\"I think New Yorkers know that the person best equipped to protect New York from any excesses that may come out of Washington is Andrew Cuomo, because he\u2019s done it before,\" Azzopardi added.",
      "But Mamdani's campaign argues that Cuomo is taking a page from their playbook as he shines a spotlight on his proposals to lower the rent, build more housing, and improve public transportation.",

      "The 33-year-old Ugandan-born state assemblyman from Queens, who was backed by progressive champions Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, surged to a come-from-behind primary victory, thanks to an energetic campaign that put a major focus on affordability and New York City's high cost of living.",

      "Mamdani made smart use of social media platforms, including TikTok, as he engaged low-propensity voters. He proposed eliminating fares to ride New York City's vast bus system, making CUNY (City University of New York) \"tuition-free,\" freezing rents on municipal housing, offering \"free childcare\" for children up to age 5 and setting up government-run grocery stores.",
      "And Mamdani, thanks in part to the efforts of a massive grassroots army of volunteers, rode a wave of support from younger and progressive voters to catapult himself into first place.",
      "Cuomo now says he's committed to making New York a city with \"lower rent, safer streets, where buying your first home is once again possible, where child care won\u2019t bankrupt you.\"",
      "And he's taken aim at Mamdani for putting out \"slick slogans, but no real solutions.\"",
      "POTUS THE PUNDIT: TRUMP SAYS CUOMO'S GOT A 'GOOD SHOT' OF BEATING MAMDANI",
      "Cuomo is one of four candidates in the general election who are taking on Mamdani, who, as the Democratic Party nominee, is the front-runner in a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans by a roughly six-to-one margin.",
      "Also in the race are Mayor Eric Adams, the embattled incumbent who announced earlier this year that he would seek re-election as an independent candidate, and Guardian Angels co-founder Curtis Sliwa, who for a second straight election is the Republican mayoral nominee.",
      "And Jim Walden, a former federal prosecutor, is also running as an independent.",
      "Former New York State Gov. Andrew Cuomo has remained in the New York City mayoral race as an independent after his defeat in the Democratic Party primary. (Alex Kent/Getty Images)",

      "\"Only 13% of New Yorkers voted in the June primary,\" Cuomo said in his general election launch video.",
      "And as he now faces a broader and more moderate electorate than that in the Democratic Party primary, Cuomo's apparent pivot away from Trump and towards issues of affordability appears strategic.",
      "Azzopardi, pointing to the campaign re-launch, told Fox News, \"It was important to hit the ground running to meet New Yorkers where they are, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\"",
      "\"The message is a simple one. It\u2019s New Yorkers are generally not hard-core pro-MAGA Trumpers, nor are they socialists. They are in the middle, and the governor is making the case about how he is the person best equipped to bring the first competent administration back to City Hall in 12 years,\" Azzopardi said.",

      "\"Cuomo already had his chance to make New York more affordable, and he did just the opposite.\u00a0So he can try to slap another label on his campaign, but New Yorkers already know they don\u2019t like what he\u2019s selling,\" Hitt said.",

With aging populations and ongoing labor shortages, these adaptable robots could support routine and emergency tasks in hospital settings. This robot could take immense pressure off medical staff. The versatility and ability to be remotely controlled make it particularly appealing for settings that require rapid response and tools that can carry out a wide range of tasks.",

From performing emergency procedures in remote areas to helping with routine physical exams in crowded hospitals, these robots could ease bottlenecks and improve care access.",
      "For patients, that could mean shorter wait times, faster treatment, and safer hospital environments where medical teams are less stretched. For families in rural or underserved areas, this technology could offer critical care support where medical staff is limited. And for healthcare workers, it could bring much-needed relief by taking on repetitive or physically taxing tasks.",
      "While the tech is still evolving, these early results suggest a future where hospitals have robotic teammates, not just tools, helping deliver faster, smarter care.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "While humanoid robots like the Unitree G1 are not ready to fully replace humans, they're steadily proving how capable they are in medical environments. The researchers just need to solve issues like force control, sensitivity, and dexterity. Once they do, we will see these robots in operating rooms around the world assisting with surgeries.

      "AI-powered warehouse robot learns tasks on the fly",
      "KR1 doesn't just move intelligently, it learns. Kinisi equipped the robot with built-in AI that allows it to adapt in real time to its surroundings. It recognizes obstacles, modifies its arm movement and executes precise trajectories even as the warehouse layout changes. This means workers don't need to reprogram the system each time workflows shift. One of KR1's most impressive features is its ability to learn from demonstration. Warehouse staff can guide the robot through a task once, and KR1 can replicate it accurately without complex coding. This speeds up onboarding and makes it easy to scale up operations. In a recent demo video, KR1 moved across a warehouse floor on its own. It approached various shelving units, selected a range of items, and placed them into totes with deliberate and smooth movements. It then transported the loaded containers to the correct location, all while avoiding obstacles and adjusting to its environment in real time.",
      "The Kinisi 01, also known as KR1, is a powerful autonomous humanoid robot. (Kinisi Robotics)",
      "This robot works offline without relying on cloud computing",
      "While many robots rely on cloud computing, Kinisi took a different approach. KR1 processes data locally, which means it can function reliably even in environments with weak or unstable internet connections. Local processing also improves response times and enhances data privacy. This design ensures KR1 continues working even during network disruptions. It also allows the robot to make split-second decisions, which is essential in fast-paced warehouses.",

      "Where this humanoid warehouse robot can work beyond logistics",
      "KR1 is already proving useful in logistics, but its design makes it suitable for a wide range of industries. In addition to streamlining warehouse fulfillment, KR1 is built to assist with tasks in retail stocking, light manufacturing, and maintenance work. Kinisi developed the robot to blend into existing workflows, which eliminates the need for expensive infrastructure upgrades. Because the robot combines physical strength with the ability to learn, it can handle repetitive tasks that require both accuracy and endurance. As a result, companies can reduce labor costs, improve workplace safety and increase operational flexibility.",
      "The Kinisi 01, also known as KR1, is a powerful autonomous humanoid robot. (Kinisi Robotics)",
      "How much does KR1 cost? Here's what we know",
      "During a recent presentation at Automate 2025, Kinisi CEO Brennand Pierce revealed that the robot currently costs around $4,000 per month. That rate appears to be part of a subscription-based model, which may include the robot, its onboard AI and ongoing support. Instead of selling KR1 outright, Kinisi is targeting small to mid-size warehouses with a flexible, monthly pricing strategy.",
      "This approach allows businesses to adopt automation without making large upfront investments or overhauling their infrastructure. Although the company hasn't confirmed what the monthly fee includes, the model positions KR1 as a scalable, low-risk solution for logistics teams looking to boost productivity fast.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Kinisi KR1 shows that the future of work is already here. This robot lifts like a human, moves like a worker and learns like a fast-thinking employee. With rapid deployment, low maintenance and powerful onboard intelligence, KR1 offers a compelling solution to the rising demand for fast, flexible automation.",

    "story": [
      "Google Maps Location Sharing is now built into Android settings; no need for Maps settings. Tech expert Kurt Knutsson discusses the welcome improvement for Android users.",
      "A team of academic researchers has uncovered a new Android security exploit that raises a lot of questions about the platform\u2019s permission system. The technique, named TapTrap, uses user interface animations to visually deceive you into granting sensitive permissions or performing harmful actions. Unlike earlier tapjacking attacks, TapTrap Android attack works by launching transparent system prompts over regular app interfaces. The result is a near-invisible layer that silently captures your taps and interactions.",

      "NEW GOOGLE AI MAKES ROBOTS SMARTER WITHOUT THE CLOUD",
      "A person holding an Android phone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the TapTrap Android exploit tricks you into granting permissions",
      "As reported by Bleeping Computer, TapTrap takes advantage of how Android handles activity transitions between apps. A malicious app can launch a system-level screen using the standard start Activity function but modify how the screen appears using a custom animation. By setting both the start and end opacity to a very low value, such as 0.01, the activity becomes nearly invisible to the user.",
      "Touch input is still fully registered by the transparent screen, even though users only see the visible app underneath. Attackers can also apply a scaling animation that enlarges a specific user interface element, such as a permission button, so that it fills the screen. This increases the chance that a user will unknowingly tap the button.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The researchers released a video showing how this technique could be used in a gaming app to quietly launch a Chrome browser permission prompt. The prompt asks for camera access, and the user taps \"Allow\" without realizing what they have done. Because the malicious screen is transparent, there are no visual cues to suggest anything suspicious is happening.",
      "Image of an Android phone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why 76% of Android apps are vulnerable to TapTrap",
      "To assess how widespread the vulnerability might be, the researchers tested nearly 100,000 apps from the Play Store. About 76% were found to be potentially vulnerable, not because they are malicious, but because they lack key safeguards. These apps had at least one screen that could be launched by another app, shared the same task stack, failed to override the default transition animation, and did not block user input during the transition.",
      "Android enables these animations by default. Users can only disable them through settings that are typically hidden, such as Developer Options or Accessibility menus. Even the latest Android version, tested on a Google Pixel 8a, remains unprotected against this exploit.",
      "GrapheneOS, a security-focused operating system based on Android, confirmed that its current version is also affected. However, it plans to release a fix in its next update.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Google has acknowledged the issue and said a future Android update will contain a mitigation. While no exact timeline has been announced, Google is expected to change how input and animations are handled to prevent invisible tap interception.",
      "The company added that developers must follow strict Play Store policies and that any app found abusing this vulnerability will face enforcement actions.",
      "A person holding an Android phone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "4 ways you can stay safe from TapTrap attack",
      "1) Consider a mobile security app:\u00a0Use a trusted antivirus or mobile security app that can detect suspicious behavior or alert you to apps using overlays or accessibility features improperly.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech",
      "2) Be selective about the apps you install:\u00a0Avoid installing apps just because they\u2019re trending or have flashy ads. Check developer credibility, recent reviews and app permissions before downloading.",
      "3) Stick to the Google Play Store:\u00a0While not perfect, the Play Store has better safeguards than random APK sources. Avoid installing apps from third-party stores or unknown websites.",
      "4) Pause before granting permissions:\u00a0If an app suddenly asks for access to your camera, microphone, or other sensitive features, take a moment. Always ask yourself if this app really needs this permission right now.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "TapTrap shows that security threats do not always come from complex code or aggressive malware. Sometimes, small oversights in visual behavior can open paths for serious abuse. In this case, the danger lies in what users do not see. People trust what they can see on their screens. This attack breaks that link by creating a visual mismatch between intent and outcome.",

      "Bring in the experts of 3D printing construction",
      "To tackle a project of this scale, UCC Holding brought in the experts. The company partnered with Danish firm COBOD, a global leader in 3D construction printing. As a result, COBOD supplied two massive, custom-built BOD2 printers. Each machine measures approximately 164 feet long, 90 feet wide, and 49 feet high, about the size of a Boeing 737 hangar.",
      "These industrial printers can build structures up to five stories tall. They enable fast, accurate and cost-effective construction that traditional methods can't match.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Before launching the project, UCC's team of architects, engineers and technicians carried out extensive tests. At a trial site in Doha, they completed more than 100 full-scale component prints using a BOD2 printer. To further prepare for Qatar's desert climate, the team engineered a custom concrete mix designed to cure properly in high heat. Additionally, they developed a special extrusion nozzle to ensure smooth, precise printing.",

      "UCC Holdings and COBOD construction team's launch Qatar\u2019s 3D Printed Schools Project. (UCC Holding)",
      "How 3D printing enhances sustainability and innovation",
      "Qatar's 3D-printed school project goes beyond architectural innovation; it also marks a major step toward sustainable construction. 3D printing technology reduces material waste by up to 60% compared to traditional building methods. It also minimizes labor requirements and shortens construction timelines, leading to lower overall emissions and energy use.",

      "What is Amazon\u2019s Starfish AI project?",
      "Starfish is a multi-year initiative built around generative AI. According to an internal Amazon document obtained by Business Insider, the system gathers product data from across the web, including external websites and images. It then uses large language models (LLMs) to create \"complete, correct and consistent\" product listings. This isn't a small update. Amazon expects Starfish to boost sales by $7.5 billion in 2025 alone by improving conversion rates and expanding product variety.",

It's not yet clear whether Amazon's own web crawler, Amazonbot, is powering Starfish. But the company confirmed to Business Insider that Starfish is already supporting its new \"Buy for Me\" feature. This feature recommends products from external websites and lets shoppers buy them directly within Amazon's app.",
      "A person shopping on Amazon (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why Amazon built the Starfish AI for marketplace listings",
      "Manually creating product listings is slow and often inconsistent. That's a problem when Amazon wants to offer a massive selection with reliable information. If shoppers can't find what they're looking for, or if the listings are vague, they may head elsewhere. Starfish addresses this by automating the tedious parts of listing creation. That helps sellers spend less time writing and more time selling. For Amazon, better listings mean higher conversion rates and happier customers. Plus, this move positions Amazon to compete more directly with Google Shopping, which also aims to be a central hub for product information.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Amazon\u2019s Starfish AI is expanding globally",
      "Amazon is testing Starfish's effectiveness with A/B comparisons, measuring sales performance of AI-enriched listings versus standard ones. It's also rolling out bulk listing tools and preparing to expand the system globally. This isn't just about improving Amazon's website. It's about changing the way product information is gathered, created and shared at scale.",
      "A person shopping on Amazon\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What does this mean for you as an Amazon shopper or seller",
      "If you're a shopper on Amazon, this could mean faster access to clearer, more accurate product listings, especially for obscure or hard-to-find items. As Amazon's AI fills in missing details and improves titles and descriptions, the results should help you make better decisions with less research.",
      "For sellers, this streamlines the work of creating listings. If you've struggled to write compelling descriptions or keep up with Amazon's catalog standards, the Starfish project may do much of the heavy lifting. That could save time, reduce errors and improve sales performance.",
      "However, there are some trade-offs. As Amazon scrapes more data from across the web to power its listings, brands and smaller websites may worry about how their product information is being used. And if AI-generated content becomes widespread, quality and trust in listings may vary depending on how well the system works.",

      "The Bluetooth flaws in question are built into Airoha chips commonly used in true wireless audio devices, as reported by BleepingComputer. Three flaws were disclosed, each allowing an attacker to gain some level of unauthorized access. The most serious flaw lets an attacker read or manipulate data by exploiting a custom protocol used by the chip.

Once connected, they could listen in on any sound the phone picked up.",

Furthermore, not every device faces all the same risks. For instance, at least one manufacturer seems to have already addressed CVE-2025-20700 and CVE-2025-20701. However, we do not know if this fix was intentional or accidental.",

If you haven't seen an update yet, it should be arriving soon, though some may already be available.",
      "However, there's a catch. According to a report by German outlet Heise, many of the most recent firmware updates for affected devices were released before Airoha provided its official fix. This means some products may still be running vulnerable code, despite appearing up to date.",
      "To make matters more complicated, consumers typically aren't notified directly about these updates. Firmware patches for headphones and similar devices often install silently, or in some cases, may not be delivered at all.

      "1. Regularly check for firmware updates:\u00a0Visit the manufacturer's app or website to manually check for firmware updates, even if you haven\u2019t received a notification. Automatic updates aren\u2019t always reliable, especially for headphones and earbuds.",
      "2. Turn off Bluetooth when not in use:\u00a0Disabling Bluetooth when you're not actively using it reduces your exposure window and makes it harder for attackers to target your device.",
      "3. Use devices in low-risk areas:\u00a0Since these attacks require close proximity, avoid using Bluetooth audio devices in crowded or unfamiliar public places where someone nearby could exploit vulnerabilities.",
      "4. Pair devices with trusted sources only:\u00a0Avoid pairing your Bluetooth headphones with unfamiliar phones, computers or public terminals. Once paired, those devices can sometimes maintain a connection or reestablish one without your knowledge, increasing the risk of abuse if they're compromised.",
      "5. Remove unused paired devices: Go into your Bluetooth settings and delete old or unfamiliar pairings. This helps prevent unauthorized reconnections from previously trusted devices that may now be compromised.",

      "The real concern here isn\u2019t the Bluetooth flaw itself, but what happens when the software inside everyday devices fails quietly. Vulnerabilities like this aren\u2019t unusual, but the way they are handled often leaves users in the dark. As long as consumers can\u2019t see or control the software running inside their own headphones, problems like this will keep happening.",

      "\"Unfortunately, a lot of credentials are harvested and sold on the dark web between different threat actor groups despite strong passwords or MFA barriers. Maybe someone lost their password or an administrator had theirs saved on a laptop that was part of another breach. Once those passwords are collected, they get traded or sold,\" Daniel explained.",
      "While brute-force attacks still happen, most criminals don't waste time hammering away at complex passwords. Instead, they exploit simpler routes: snatching passwords from old breaches, targeting users directly or hijacking password vaults, especially those managed by social media admins.",

      "Tobok points out, \"There really isn't public-facing software that notifies you. Sometimes, you might get an email saying, 'We noticed unusual activity. Was this you?' That typically comes through MFA channels. But most executives don't manage their own social media accounts. It's usually someone on their team or a designated admin. So, if something goes wrong, they're not necessarily the ones who will see it.\"",

Most threat actors, once they're in, will immediately change the password and the email linked to the account so they can take full control. If you're locked out, you need to contact the platform and provide proof that it's your account. Request that they shut it down or help you recover it.

Never reuse passwords across platforms, and update them regularly for maximum protection.\u00a0 Consider using a password manager, which securely stores and generates complex passwords, reducing the risk of password reuse.

      "Researchers at the China Building Materials Academy (CBMA) and their partners designed the material to weigh just 12.5 pounds per cubic foot. That's about one-tenth the weight of standard concrete. Its strength comes from a network of microscopic bubbles, each coated with a special maleated rosin. This structure allows the foam to crush in a controlled way and cushion even the heaviest aircraft.",

      "An airliner taking off \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why traditional runway safety systems fall short",
      "The most dangerous parts of any flight are takeoff and landing. To reduce risk, airports use Runway End Safety Areas (RESAs). These zones are meant to stop planes that overshoot the runway. In the past, airports used sand, soil, grass, or water pools for this purpose. But each of these materials has serious drawbacks.",
      "Soil becomes unstable in wet or freezing conditions. Water can freeze in winter and attract wildlife, creating new hazards. Sand and grass don't always perform well, especially with heavier aircraft. These weaknesses have made it clear that airports need a more reliable and consistent safety solution.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "How marshmallow concrete works: The science behind the softness",
      "Marshmallow concrete is engineered with a precise strength between 0.30 and 0.35 megapascals. If it's too strong, it won't crush and absorb energy. If it's too weak, it won't slow the plane. The research team compared the process to blowing bubbles into a concrete mix. These bubbles create the soft, crushable texture that helps stop a plane during an emergency.",
      "To make the bubbles strong enough to last until impact, the team used a special air-entraining agent. This forms a tough coating around each bubble. As a result, the material stays intact until an aircraft overruns the runway, then it collapses at the right moment to maximize safety.",
      "An airliner coming in for a landing (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Durability and cost benefits of marshmallow concrete for airports",
      "Unlike some international systems that rely on expensive calcium sulfoaluminate cement, marshmallow concrete uses ordinary cement, making it far more affordable for airports, especially those with limited budgets. The team also developed a two-stage strength-control system that helps the material adapt to harsh climates and maintain consistent performance throughout the year.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Real-world data from 14 airports in China, including one in the challenging climate of Tibet, show that the material's properties fluctuated by just three percent over a year. This result is well below the design tolerance of ten percent, which means airports can depend on the material to perform reliably, regardless of the weather.",
      "A China Building Materials Academy researcher at work\u00a0 (CBMA)",
      "Marshmallow concrete airport safety: The future standard?",
      "With its unique combination of low cost, environmental resilience, and life-saving performance, marshmallow concrete is poised to become the new global standard for runway safety. The material has already been installed at 14 Chinese airports, where it has demonstrated consistent and reliable performance even in extreme conditions. As more airports seek affordable ways to enhance safety, marshmallow concrete offers a promising solution that can save lives and reduce costs worldwide.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you fly in the U.S., whether for business, vacation, or visiting family, marshmallow concrete could soon make your journeys safer. While this breakthrough is currently being used at airports in China, its performance is turning heads worldwide, including among U.S. aviation experts looking for better runway safety solutions.",
      "Runway overruns don\u2019t happen often in the United States, but when they do, the consequences can be deadly. Think of high-traffic airports like LAX, JFK, or Atlanta, where a single overrun can disrupt thousands of flights and put lives at risk. Marshmallow concrete offers a low-cost, highly effective safety upgrade that could prevent these incidents or dramatically reduce their severity.",
      "The best part? This isn't some billion-dollar overhaul. Because it uses standard cement and is designed to work in all kinds of weather, including harsh winters and extreme heat, it\u2019s a practical option for airports from Maine to Arizona. That means even smaller regional airports across the U.S. could benefit.",
      "You may never see this material, but it could be quietly protecting your flight behind the scenes, ready to absorb impact and bring a plane to a safe stop if something goes wrong. As U.S. airport authorities and the FAA explore more innovative, more cost-effective ways to modernize infrastructure, marshmallow concrete could be one of the safest bets in American aviation's future.",

      "Marshmallow concrete is changing the way airports think about safety. By combining strength, flexibility, and affordability, this new material offers airports a smarter way to protect passengers and crews. As more airports around the world look for reliable solutions, marshmallow concrete stands out as a proven option that delivers results.

Additionally, users can enable two-factor authentication and manage sharing permissions to protect their files. However, like all cloud services, Google Drive is not immune to security threats.",
      "Phishing attacks targeting Google accounts remain common, and attackers may exploit weak passwords or compromised credentials. Furthermore, some third-party integrations request extensive permissions, which could be misused if not carefully managed. While Google has experienced security incidents in the past, such as the 2018 Google+ data breach, these have not directly impacted Google Drive. It's important to note that most major cloud storage providers face similar risks, and Google provides tools to help users mitigate them.",

      "Vanguard underwater habitat. (Deep)",
      "The history of underwater living",
      "Underwater habitats are not a new concept. In the 1960s, Jacques Cousteau built and lived in underwater modules, proving that humans could survive beneath the waves for short periods. Since 2001, NASA has been sending researchers to the Aquarius Reef Base off Florida's coast. There, they live and work for up to two weeks about 65 feet below the surface.",
      "How technology is advancing underwater living",
      "Recent advances are making long-term underwater living a real possibility. British company DEEP is developing two modular habitats designed for extended stays. These habitats use advanced manufacturing methods such as Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing to build strong, efficient structures. These innovations help the units withstand the intense pressure of the deep sea.",
      "Sentinel underwater habitat. (Deep)",
      "Can humans thrive underwater?",
      "Living underwater is not easy. Humans need oxygen, sunlight and stable pressure. Yet, history shows we can adapt to extreme environments. For instance, astronauts have lived on the International Space Station for over a year at a time, dealing with challenges similar to those found underwater.",
      "Even so, recent experiments are encouraging. German engineer Rudiger Koch spent 120 days in a submerged capsule without health issues. Likewise, Professor Joseph Dituri lived 100 days underwater and emerged healthier, with better sleep, reduced cholesterol and even a younger biological age.",
      "Vanguard underwater habitat: DEEP\u2019s prototype for ocean living",
      "The Vanguard underwater habitat is DEEP's innovative engineering prototype for advancing underwater living. Vanguard is a compact underwater module designed for short-term missions that can support three people at most. It lets DEEP test new designs and technologies in real-world conditions. It also helps the company gather valuable user feedback.",
      "Vanguard underwater habitat. (Deep)",
      "How the Vanguard underwater habitat is built and tested",
      "The development of the Vanguard underwater habitat starts with dry assembly. All parts, including the wet porch and pressure vessel, are built, tested and put together on land. Then, the team conducts dry testing by pressurizing the vessel with air to check for leaks and confirm it can maintain the necessary ambient pressure.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "After that, dockside testing begins. The habitat is placed in water beside a dock for gradual submersion, which makes it easy to test for water-tightness and electrical safety.",
      "Finally, the team conducts full underwater testing. In this phase, Vanguard operates on the seafloor and receives air, power, water, and communications from the surface. This final step offers key feedback on how people live and work in the habitat, helping DEEP improve Vanguard and design the larger Sentinel system.",
      "Vanguard underwater habitat test schedule. (Deep)",
      "Why the Vanguard underwater habitat matters",
      "Success with the Vanguard underwater habitat will demonstrate what's achievable for underwater missions. It can reduce time, cost and weather risk for deep-sea operations. Moreover, it can unlock new discoveries beneath the waves.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Sentinel: Extended underwater living",
      "The larger Sentinel subsea habitat system offers comfortable living quarters, research facilities and panoramic views. It supports stays of up to 28 days at depths reaching 656 feet. By keeping researchers in a \"saturated\" state, DEEP reduces the risk of decompression sickness. This allows for longer and safer underwater residencies. According to the company's website, Sentinel is scheduled to be in the water by the end of 2027.",
      "These habitats will help scientists study both the ocean and the effects of extended underwater living. Ultimately, they mark an important milestone toward a permanent human presence beneath the sea.",
      "Sentinel underwater habitat. (Deep)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The ocean presents both immense challenges and incredible opportunities. As innovation continues, underwater living could become our next great frontier. We may soon witness the rise of permanent ocean habitats and with them, discoveries that transform our understanding of life on Earth.",

      "Beetles were chosen for their strength, agility and resilience. Despite their small size, they can carry equipment nearly equal to their own body weight, which makes them an ideal platform for compact sensors and control systems in tight, dangerous spaces.",

      "How biology is shaping the next generation of rescue tech",
      "Unlike custom-built robots, these beetles don\u2019t need motors or gears to move. Their natural ability to climb, squeeze and maneuver through tight spaces eliminates the need for complex mechanical systems. The programmable backpack simply adds directional control without harming the beetle or shortening its lifespan. The result is a biological tool that can access places humans and machines cannot. This could help reduce the time it takes to locate survivors in critical situations.",

      "Researchers are now working to integrate miniature cameras and compact power systems to make the beetles even more effective. The goal is to create a lightweight, mobile, and affordable tool that can deliver real-time information from inside collapsed structures and hazardous environments. The team hopes to test the system in a live emergency simulation within the next five years. If successful, cyborg beetles could become a valuable part of urban response efforts around the world.",

      "Researchers are proving that cyborg beetles could play a real role in saving lives. By guiding beetles through tight, dangerous spaces using tiny backpacks and simple controls, scientists are exploring a low-cost and high-impact way to locate survivors where robots and humans can't go. The technology is still in development, but the potential is clear, especially in situations where every second counts.",

      "The Lake County Coroner\u2019s Office released a statement Monday following its autopsy on Megan Bos, 37, saying a key finding contradicted media reports as well as a statement by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that claimed she had been beheaded.",
      "Bos\u2019 body was found by police in April in a container in a yard belonging to Jose Luis Mendoza-Gonzalez, 52,\u00a0a Mexican illegal immigrant who was arrested and charged in the case but released under Illinois' bail reform laws after his first court appearance, sparking outrage.

      "\"At no point was Megan decapitated before or after her death,\" the office said, adding that no signs of trauma or struggle were found in the April 11 autopsy. Bos\u2019s body was in an advanced state of decomposition and exposed to chemical substances, complicating cause-of-death analysis, the office said.",
      "\"This misinformation has caused unnecessary distress to the family and misrepresents the facts of this investigation.\"",

      "Bos\u2019 cause of death remains undetermined, with toxicology showing fentanyl, cocaine and morphine in her system, the coroner's office said.",
      "The coroner\u2019s office said her death is suspicious, potentially drug-related or homicidal, but not conclusively one or the other. The office said that asphyxial death is possible but hard to confirm due to decomposition.",
      "\"These circumstances raise the suspicion of a homicidal death or possibly a drug-related death,\" the coroner\u2019s office said. \"Asphyxial homicides may include no external or internal evidence of injury. Furthermore, the decomposition of the body at the time of discovery complicates interpretation of sometimes minute physical findings suggestive of asphyxia.\"",
      "Bos\u2019 body was found in a plastic garbage container in Mendoza-Gonzalez\u2019s yard in\u00a0Waukegan, Illinois.",
      "\"Fentanyl, cocaine metabolites and morphine were identified in the liver tissue, indicating recent potentially lethal cocaine, fentanyl and probable heroin use,\" the statement reads. \"Making a distinction between an accidental drug intoxication and an asphyxial death based solely on the autopsy findings, both the absence of significant trauma and the presence of potentially lethal drugs in the decedent's body, is not possible.\"",

      "Bos' mother, Jenniefer Bos, is joining local leaders and Illinois lawmakers in demanding changes to the state\u2019s first-in-the-nation law eliminating cash bail, known as SAFE-T Act, which allowed Mendoza-Gonzalez to walk free just hours after being charged.",

      "\"What has been going on over the past six months, several different things,\" said Jurinsky. \"She has dismissed cases that absolutely should have been prosecuted. She has given out a lot of probation for felony crimes, misdemeanor crimes, crimes that should have warranted several years in prison.\"",

      "Aurora police previously reported that Galligan is a registered sex offender, with his registration tied to the Pueblo County Sheriff\u2019s Office. He was found incompetent to stand trial, which in the state of Colorado, means he must be released from custody, Padden's office told Fox News Digital earlier this month.",

      "\"My knowledge of this individual is they have been found mentally incompetent multiple times on previous criminal cases in different judicial districts outside [Arapahoe County],\" Ross said. \"So there is a history of documented mental illness. It's not like this is a one-and-done where this person has never been on anyone's radar, and they found somebody to write them a note to say that they're mentally incompetent.\"",
      "\"And instead of coming out and saying that Amy Padden is at least going to hold this individual in the state mental health hospital, she just makes a statement that charges are going to be dismissed, and this individual is going to be released,\" said Jurinsky. \"She is trying to now walk that back and say that Solomon is going to go to the state mental health hospital, but not giving a timeline, not giving any information.\"",

We don't need a lot of money for this effort, but we will need some to print the petition packets and probably hire some signature gatherers. And then we will be well underway.

      "The effects of both President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine on NATO have forced swift and potentially permanent changes in the alliance.",
      "Following last month's announcement that the majority of NATO's 32 members had agreed to increase defense spending to hit 5% of each nation's GDP, Trump drew headlines after he drastically changed his tone and declared the alliance was no longer a \"rip-off.\" But his previously tough stance saw undeniable results in how the security group operates.",
      "\"Trump has changed the game,\" Peter Doran, an expert on Russia, Ukraine, and transatlantic relations, and an adjunct senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said. \"[Then] there's Vladimir Putin, who has clearly awakened the Europeans to the danger that Russia presents to them.\"",
      "Beginning in his first term, Trump made clear his resentment that only five NATO allies were meeting their 2% GDP defense spending pledges, and those criticisms rang loudly following his return to the campaign trail for the 2024 election amid Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "Questions ran rampant over whether Trump would not only continue to provide strong U.S. support for Ukraine, but whether Washington would remain a reliable ally for Europe when confronted with the reality of a war-ready Russia.",

      "Though an increasing number of NATO nations began upping their defense spending commitments following Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, several allies began pushing for changes before Trump even re-entered the White House.",
      "Trump not only threatened to remove troops from Europe and divert them to positions in Asia, but he suggested he might not come to the defense of a NATO ally should they be attacked, infamously saying at a February 2024 campaign event, \"You don\u2019t pay your bills; you get no protection.

      "\"If Vladimir Putin and the Russians in the post-Cold War period had sought to engage Europe and chosen more of a democratic future, there might not be a NATO Alliance today,\" Rough said. \"But Putin has given NATO a real reason to exist, and President Trump has done his part by\u2026 cajoling, pushing, nudging the allies.\"",

      "\"But that's what happens in NATO when confronted with an external crisis,\" he added.",

      "\"The answer is very clearly no,\" Doran argued. \"If anything, Trump came back and did exactly the same thing he did in the first administration, and that was to remind the Europeans that they are chronically under-spending on defense.",
      "\"If anything, Trump hasn't changed at all. It's the Europeans' awareness that they need to spend more, and they have responded positively to that challenge, and that is very encouraging,\" he added.",

      "The U.K. government, controlled by the Labour Party, announced Thursday that 16- and 17-year-olds will be given the right to vote as part of other new \"seismic changes.\" Other election reforms include extending voter ID to bank cards, issuing new rules meant to \"guard against foreign political interference and abuse of campaigners,\" and tightening laws restricting foreign donations to British political parties.",

And I think if you pay in, you should have the opportunity to say what you want your money spent on, which way the government should go,\" British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told reporters on Thursday. \"I'm really pleased that we're able to bring more young people into our democracy.\"",
      "\"Young people already contribute to society by working, paying taxes and serving in the military. It's only right they can have a say on the issues that affect them,\" Rayner wrote on X.

      "The change still requires parliamentary approval but was a campaign promise by the Labour Party, which won last year's general election and holds majority control. The next general election is in 2029.",

Simultaneously, northern units loyal to the Yemeni government could advance toward the capital, Sanaa. Allied airpower would provide the necessary cover to enable a southern-northern pincer movement that could collapse the Houthi hold on Yemen and eliminate the threat entirely.\"",
      "He argued that \"This would pave the way for future negotiations\u2014not with Tehran\u2019s proxies\u2014but with a federated, pro-Western Yemeni government independent of Iranian influence. \"",

      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche intends to meet with convicted sex trafficker and Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell in the next several days, Attorney General Pam Bondi said Tuesday morning.",
      "Maxwell was convicted of sex trafficking in 2021 for recruiting and grooming multiple teenage girls for over a decade to be sexually abused by Epstein. She was investigated and indicted during the first Trump administration and tried and convicted during the Biden administration.",
      "The meeting was confirmed by Maxwell's attorney, David Oscar Markus, who has been requesting meetings with Trump administration officials and has argued that Maxwell did not receive a fair trial.",
      "\u201cI can confirm that we are in discussions with the government and that Ghislaine will always testify truthfully,\" Markus said. \"We are grateful to President Trump for his commitment to uncovering the truth in this case.\u201d",
      "NBC News has reported that Maxwell did not ask for a plea agreement and was not offered one before her trial, according to statements made by federal prosecutors at the time. After being convicted in New York, she was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison.",
      "Blanche, in a statement on Tuesday on X posted by Bondi, said the Justice Department stood by its July 6 decision to release no further documents in the Epstein case, which sparked an uproar among Trump supporters that has proven to be one of the largest political challenges of Trump\u2019s second term. The president has repeatedly called on his supporters to move on and focus on other topics, and at one point called them \u201cstupid.\u201d",
      "Trump supporters criticized the decision, citing repeated promises from Bondi that she would release documents related to the Epstein case. Multiple Republican members of Congress and right-wing influencers have also criticized Bondi, whom Trump has defended.",
      "Blaming other prosecutors",
      "In an unusual step, Blanche appeared to publicly criticize the work of the Justice Department prosecutors who investigated Epstein during George W. Bush\u2019s second term, Trump\u2019s first term and Biden\u2019s term.",
      "\"Until now, no administration on behalf of the Department had inquired about her willingness to meet with the government.\" Blanche said, referring to Maxwell. \"That changes now.\"",
      "\"Justice demands courage,\" Blanche added in a separate X post. \"For the first time, the Department of Justice is reaching out to Ghislaine Maxwell to ask: what do you know?\"",
      "Legal experts have questioned the credibility of Maxwell's claims, given her role in enabling Epstein's abuse of minors for over a decade. They have also criticized the investigation of Epstein carried out by the Justice Department during the George W. Bush administration.",
      "In a 2008 plea deal overseen by then-U.S. Attorney in South Florida Alex Acosta, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges of procuring a person under 18 for prostitution and felony solicitation of prostitution.",
      "The agreement required Epstein to register as a sex offender and serve about a year in a Florida county jail. But he was able to leave almost daily for work, and was allowed to have his own private security detail behind bars.",
      "Eleven years later, Epstein was indicted on July 8, 2019, during Trump's first administration, on federal charges of sex trafficking minors in New York. His case ended after he was found dead in his jail cell roughly one month later.",
      "A medical examiner\u2019s office ruled he died by suicide, a conclusion that Bondi and Blanche supported in the July 6 statement issued by the Justice Department and the FBI.",
      "Roughly a year later, Maxwell was indicted indicted on federal charges on July 9, 2020. Maxwell was found guilty on Dec. 29, 2021, of multiple counts of conspiring to sex traffic minors and later sentenced to 20 years in federal prison. But her trial did not reveal proof that other men sexually abused the minors.",
      "Continued conspiracy theories",
      "For years, the cause of Epstein\u2019s death, his high-profile contacts, his initial plea bargain, and the graphic details of his alleged crimes have fueled conspiracy theories and demands that the government release all it knows about the case.",
      "Trump helped fuel these theories in the past, saying during his  presidential campaign last year that he would have \u201cno problem\u201d looking into an Epstein client list.",
      "After becoming attorney general, Bondi repeatedly promised to release documents related to the Epstein case. In a Fox News interview in February, Bondi said an Epstein client list was \u201csitting on my desk right now to review.\u201d",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino also called for the release of Epstein documents before being chosen by Trump for their current positions.",
      "But the July 6 joint statement by the DOJ and FBI said that an exhaustive internal review of Epstein-related records had not produce enough evidence to prosecute any other individuals.",
      "\"A systematic review revealed no incriminating 'client list,'\" the agencies said. \"There was also no credible evidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions. We did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\"",
      "Multiple federal judges have rejected appeals of Maxwell's conviction, and her current appeal is before the Supreme Court. She is serving her 20-year sentence at a federal prison in Florida.",
      "On Monday, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., continued to criticize Trump's handling of the Epstein case.",
      "\u201cIf you tell the base of people, who support you, of deep state treasonous crimes, election interference, blackmail, and rich powerful elite evil cabals, then you must take down every enemy of The People,\u201d Greene said in a social media post. \u201cIf not. The base will turn and there\u2019s no going back.",
      "\"Dangling bits of red meat no longer satisfies,\" she added. \"They want the whole steak dinner and will accept nothing else.\u201d"

    "summary": "House Republicans cancelled a day of votes because of a fight over the Jeffrey Epstein files.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The GOP-controlled House is cutting short its last workweek before the summer recess because of a fight on Capitol Hill over the release of the government\u2019s files on the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "The House was scheduled to hold votes on Thursday before lawmakers departed for their five-week recess.",
      "But Republican leaders informed rank-and-file lawmakers on Tuesday that the final vote of the week would now be a day earlier, on Wednesday afternoon. The shift in schedule occurred because of a standoff on the Rules Committee, which decides how legislation comes to the floor but has been ground to a halt by the Epstein issue.",
      "The panel, which is closely aligned with Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., typically passes a rule for legislation on Monday that sets up debate and allows bills to come to the floor for the week. But Democrats had promised Monday to force the committee to take more votes on whether to require the Trump administration to release all remaining files from the Epstein case.",
      "To avoid embarrassing votes on Epstein, Republicans decided to recess the committee and not attempt to pass a rule for bills this week. Without a rule, Republicans would be left with nothing to vote on after Wednesday.",
      "The Epstein saga has dominated chatter on Capitol Hill for more than a week as many Trump supporters have clamored for the release of all documents related to the convicted sex offender and the president and his administration sought to downplay the issue. It appeared to be dying down in recent days, but the Trump administration breathed new life into the story Tuesday morning, when the Justice Department announced that Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche will meet with Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell in the coming days.",
      "A short while later, conservative Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., passed a motion in a subcommittee meeting to have the House Oversight Committee issue a subpoena for Maxwell to appear for a deposition. Oversight Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., said through a spokesperson that he had encouraged Burchett to make the motion and that the subpoena will be issued \u201cas expeditiously as possible.\"",
      "The House GOP leadership's final news conference before the August recess was dominated by the Epstein matter as well, with Johnson addressing the issue at the outset and fielding several questions from reporters about Epstein.",
      "Johnson said earlier that the remaining Epstein files should be released, but he also cautioned that there needed to be a process to protect the identities of Epstein's victims.",
      "\"The president has said clearly, and he has now ordered his DOJ to do what it is we've all needed DOJ to do for years now, and that is to get everything released. So they're in the process of that. There's no purpose for Congress to push an administration to do something that they're already doing. And so this is for political games,\" Johnson told reporters.",
      "\"We can both call for full transparency and also protect victims. And if you run roughshod or you do it too quickly, that's not what happens,\" the speaker said.",
      "Johnson attempted to blame Democrats for stalling floor action and playing \"gotcha politics\" with the Epstein matter. He said Democrats had a chance to release information about the case when they controlled the entire government under President Joe Biden.",
      "But the speaker also directed much of his ire at a fellow conservative, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who is working with Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and other Democrats to force a vote in September that would compel DOJ to release the remaining Epstein files. Johnson said Massie, who has repeatedly clashed with Trump and GOP leadership, is trying to \"bite\" his fellow Republicans.",
      "\u201cSome people seem to enjoy trying to inflict political pain on their own teammates. \u2026 There\u2019s a small, small, tiny handful, but one in particular who\u2019s given me lots of consternation. I don\u2019t understand Thomas Massie\u2019s motivation. I really don\u2019t. I don\u2019t know how his mind works. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s thinking,\u201d Johnson said in a lengthy and unusual tirade.",
      "\u201cThomas Massie could have brought his discharge petition anytime over the last four years of the Biden administration. He could have done that at any time, and now he\u2019s clamoring as if there\u2019s some sort of timeline on it,\u201d Johnson continued.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to me that he chose the election of President Trump to bring this, to team up with the Democrats and bring this discharge petition. \u2026 I try to follow Ronald Reagan\u2019s 11th Commandment, never speak evil of another Republican,\" the speaker said. \"My gosh, it\u2019s hard to do sometimes around here.\u201d",
      "For his part, Massie appears to be relishing all of the scrutiny and attention. He was spotted walking around the Capitol on Monday holding a large white binder that read: \"The Epstein Files: Phase 2 ... DECLASSIFIED.\"",
      "Massie and Khanna need the signatures of at least 218 members of the House to get a vote on their Epstein bill in the fall, and the Kentucky Republican predicted they'll get there.",
      "\"Over the August recess, I think momentum will build for transparency. I don't think this is going to go away,\" Massie said. \"And I think, when we return in September, we'll get Phase 2 of the Epstein files because we'll get ... every Democrat and at least a dozen Republicans who want transparency and justice.\""

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s intelligence chiefs are conducting a systematic campaign to rewrite the history of the 2016 election, seeking to reverse an eight-year-old assessment that Russia waged an information war to boost Trump\u2019s candidacy.",
      "National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe have cited declassified emails to allege in social media posts and television appearances that Obama administration officials manipulated intelligence and conspired to undermine the legitimacy of Trump\u2019s electoral victory in 2016.",
      "But a bipartisan Senate investigation in 2020 and a recent CIA review both found that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, launching a disinformation campaign designed to damage Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy.",
      "A three-year investigation by special counsel John Durham reported no criminal conspiracy by Obama administration officials to sabotage Trump, and Durham filed no charges against CIA officials.",
      "On Monday, Fox News reported that Gabbard\u2019s office made a criminal referral to the Justice Department related to the 2017 intelligence assessment of Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 election, without specifying the nature of the referral.",
      "In an apparent reference to the report, Trump posted online a fake video generated by artificial intelligence of former President Barack Obama being led out of the Oval Office by police.",
      "NBC News could not verify that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence had filed a criminal referral. The Justice Department and the National Intelligence Director\u2019s Office did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Distraction from Epstein case",
      "The allegations from Trump\u2019s intelligence chiefs come when he  faces demands from many of his supporters to release files linked to financier Jeffrey Epstein. Democratic lawmakers accused the administration of seeking to distract from the Epstein case and to \u201crewrite\u201d history for partisan purposes.",
      "Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, vice chair of the Intelligence Committee, said the panel\u2019s unanimous, bipartisan conclusion in 2020 was that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to benefit Trump.",
      "\u201cThis is just another example of the DNI trying to cook the books, rewrite history, and erode trust in the intelligence agencies she\u2019s supposed to be leading,\u201d Warner said in a statement, referring to Gabbard.",
      "On Friday, Gabbard alleged that declassified emails released by her office revealed a \u201ctreasonous conspiracy\u201d by Obama administration officials to play up Russia\u2019s actions during the 2016 election to undermine Trump\u2019s authority as president.",
      "\u201cTheir goal was to subvert the will of the American people and enact what was essentially a years-long coup with the objective of trying to usurp the President from fulfilling the mandate bestowed upon him by the American people,\u201d Gabbard said in a statement. She added that \u201cevery person involved in this conspiracy must be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, to ensure nothing like this ever happens again.\u201d",
      "Gabbard was referring to a U.S. intelligence assessment in early 2017 that Russia had tried to skew the outcome of the election in favor of Trump. Russia orchestrated a leak of stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee and created fake social media accounts. The 2020 Senate committee investigation, which interviewed more than 200 witnesses and reviewed a million documents over three years, came to the same conclusion.",
      "Trump\u2019s secretary of state, Marco Rubio, signed off on the committee\u2019s findings at the time, when he was acting chair of the Intelligence Committee.",
      "The committee found no evidence of \u201ccollusion\u201d between the Trump campaign and Russia, Rubio said in a statement after the report was released. But he added: \u201cWhat the Committee did find however is very troubling. We found irrefutable evidence of Russian meddling.\u201d",
      "Trump has always bristled at the idea that Russia interfered in the election on his behalf and has accused intelligence and FBI officials of plotting against him.",
      "Ratcliffe and Gabbard claims",
      "Ratcliffe, the CIA director, released an internal agency review of the 2017 intelligence assessment of the 2016 election this month. The review found that some standard procedures were not followed, with analysts having been given an unusually short time to produce their report. But the review did not refute the findings of the intelligence assessment that Russia sought to interfere in the election.",
      "Ratcliffe, however, argued on social media that the review showed that Democratic appointees \u201cmanipulated intelligence and silenced career professionals \u2014 all to get Trump.\u201d",
      "Both the intelligence agency assessment and the Senate investigation found that Russia hacked into voting systems in some states but did not try to change votes or alter ballot counting.",
      "Gabbard\u2019s office said that in December 2016, talking points were prepared for the national intelligence director at the time, James Clapper, stating: \u201cForeign adversaries did not use cyberattacks on election infrastructure to alter the US Presidential election outcome.\u201d",
      "The National Intelligence Director\u2019s Office suggested that intelligence about cyberattacks was later contradicted in a new finding. The intelligence agencies concluded in their assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201caspired\u201d to help Trump\u2019s election chances, the ODNI noted.",
      "'Doing Trump's bidding'",
      "Democrats in Congress said Gabbard was conflating two separate issues: whether Russia sought to tamper with voting or whether Moscow tried to influence the election through disinformation and leaked emails stolen from the Democratic Party.",
      "The Obama administration never said Russia had tried to alter votes through its cyber intrusions.",
      "Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Gabbard\u2019s allegations of treason were \u201cbaseless\u201d and an attempt to revive conspiracy claims that had already been debunked.",
      "Gabbard is \u201crehashing decade-old false claims about the Obama Administration,\u201d Himes said in a statement Friday. \u201cFew episodes in our nation\u2019s history have been investigated as thoroughly as the Intelligence Community\u2019s warning in 2016 that Russia was interfering in the election. \u201c",
      "Larry Pfeiffer, a former senior intelligence official who served both Republican and Democratic presidents over more than three decades, said Gabbard\u2019s \u201canalysis is grossly flawed and inconsistent with the findings of years-long investigations by the Department of Justice and the U.S. Senate.\u201d",
      "He added that Gabbard\u2019s partisan political behavior as director would be likely cause her to lose the trust of rank-and-file members of the country\u2019s spy agencies.",
      "The senior CIA officer who helped oversee the 2017 intelligence assessment of Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 election, Susan Miller, rejected the CIA director\u2019s portrayal of the analysis, though she objected to an annex that was added to the report.",
      "Miller said she was angry at the time that senior officials chose to include an annex to the intelligence assessment referring to an unverified dossier about Trump compiled by a former British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele.",
      "But Miller said she agreed with the assessment\u2019s core finding that Putin tried to aid Trump in 2016, and she accused Ratcliffe, the CIA\u2019s current director, of engaging in partisan politics.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s doing Trump\u2019s bidding to go after those of us who dared to write a report that simply said the Russians tried to influence the election towards Trump,\u201d Miller told the investigative newsletter SpyTalk. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a crime?\u201d"

      "Gonz\u00e1lez Vega, who still retains the lucidity and memory of a historian, recalls in detail how at age 18 he had to report to Fort Buchanan, in San Juan. After a week of medical and physical evaluations, his name echoed over the camp\u2019s loudspeaker.",
      "\u201cI was waiting for that call,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez Vega proudly remarked in his native Spanish. Lined up alongside all the other young Puerto Ricans, Gonz\u00e1lez Vega handed in his shoes, socks, pants, underwear and shirt before he left the camp to fight in the war.",
      "Having lunch with her father at his home, Gonz\u00e1lez said it has been a challenge for her father to write his memoir because Don Andr\u00e9s \u201calways likes to talk about the good things,\" though life has both ups and downs, she said.",
      "But Gonz\u00e1lez Vega, known as a defender and promoter of Puerto Rican culture, is also acknowledging past struggles and challenges as he talks about his life.",
      "Both he and his daughter remember walking down the streets of New York, where they lived for many years, and seeing signs reading, \u201cPuerto Ricans Go Home.\u201d They also recalled the dozens of times they had to paint over their home after it was tagged with racial slurs like \u201cSpic Go Home.\u201d",
      "The memoir will document Don Andr\u00e9s\u2019 time in the war, his experiences in New York as one of the founders of the iconic National Puerto Rican Day Parade and his accomplishments in Puerto Rico as the creator of the Coconut Festival in Luquillo and a festival coordinator at the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture.",
      "Eating his favorite chicken wings with tostones, or fried plantains, Don Andr\u00e9s nostalgically reminisced about the days when most Puerto Ricans walked barefoot through the countryside and fetched water from a well.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez Vega, who was born on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques on May 30, 1924, said that as a child, he would cross a river on his way to school and harvest the bananas and avocados he loved to eat with cod.",
      "Despite having lived outside Puerto Rico for 29 years, Gonz\u00e1lez Vega still considers himself a \u201cj\u00edbaro,\u201d a rural Puerto Rican who in recent years has become a symbol of Puerto Rican folklore.",
      "Known for wearing a distinctive straw hat called \u201cla pava,\u201d \"j\u00edbaros\" historically were people who lived in rural Puerto Rico and worked on farms. Today, artists like Bad Bunny, with his latest album, \u201cDeB\u00cd TIRAR M\u00e1S FOToS,\u201d seek to highlight images and scenes depicting j\u00edbaros like Don Andr\u00e9s.",
      "Going to war",
      "Upon completing his military training in the town of Gurabo, Gonz\u00e1lez Vega received an order: \u201cPack everything up, we\u2019re going to leave,\u201d he recalled. Dozens of trucks began picking up the Puerto Rican soldiers and transporting them to San Juan. There, they all boarded a gigantic ship \u2014 he had never been on one before. At night, as they set sail, all they could see were the lights of the capital city.",
      "\u201cGoodbye, my beloved Borinquen, goodbye, my land of the sea, I\u2019m leaving, but one day I\u2019ll return,\u201d he repeated melancholically, similar to the lyrics of the iconic song \u201cEn Mi Viejo San Juan,\u201d as he recalled the day he left Puerto Rico for the first time.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez Vega, alongside thousands of other soldiers, arrived at the Guant\u00e1namo Bay military base in Cuba. They stayed there for several days until a naval escort took them to their final destination \u2014 Panama, as he recalled the journey there.",
      "\u201cSometimes the sirens sounded, and they had to turn off all the lights, and everyone had to go down to their cabins and be quiet. Then, they told us there was a German submarine surrounding the ship. We had about three scares in Cuba, not knowing where we were going,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez Vega said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many days, because the ship was coasting, until we reached Panama.\u201d",
      "Upon his arrival in the city of Balboa, in Panama, a group of U.S. soldiers surprised him with coffee and fresh milk after an arduous journey with scarce food.",
      "Knowing only a few words of English \u2014 which he learned from a popular Puerto Rican children\u2019s song from the 1930s created by a bilingual teacher \u2014 Gonz\u00e1lez Vega crossed the Panamanian jungle to reach his assigned station.",
      "Shortly after he arrived, Gonz\u00e1lez Vega was promoted to private first class and later to sergeant, overseeing a group of Puerto Rican soldiers.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez Vega said that one of his most difficult moments was when his mother, Mar\u00eda Vega, was hospitalized with asthma in Puerto Rico. One afternoon at the Panama Canal, he was working on an intense target practice session, so desperate to be with his mother that his head hurt, he said. Minutes later, he was told he had to report to the military airport and was taken to Puerto Rico on the mail plane.",
      "Don Andr\u00e9s cared for his mother until she recovered. Fifteen days later, he returned to the Panama Canal until the end of the war.",
      "For his service, Don Andr\u00e9s received the American Theater Service Medal, the Good Conduct Medal and the World War II Victory Medal.",
      "Facing racism and challenges",
      "In 1947, Gonz\u00e1lez Vega was part of a wave of Puerto Ricans who migrated to New York for economic reasons.",
      "In the city, he unexpectedly ran into one of his friends from Panama. Together, they remembered former World War II colleagues, many of whom later died serving in the Korean War.",
      "\u201cMaybe that [death] would have happened to me, too,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez Vega said.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez Vega raised his daughter, Julia, with his wife in the Big Apple.",
      "One of his daughter\u2019s childhood memories is when she returned from school one day and saw her father painting part of the house after someone had tagged it with an insult: \u201cSpics Go Home,\u201d they both recounted.",
      "At that time, minority groups in the United States faced the racial tensions of the segregation era and the struggle for civil rights. That deeply affected Don Andr\u00e9s, who saw how a Black person could be sitting in one place and, if a white person arrived, would have to give up the seat immediately, the veteran said.",
      "To channel his indignation, Gonz\u00e1lez Vega was part of the founding group creating the National Puerto Rican Parade in New York. He remembers how the group pressured the mayor, Robert Wagner, to grant them access to the famous Fifth Avenue for the parade.",
      "\u201cThey went to Wagner, \u2018If you want our vote, we want to march on Fifth Avenue,\u2019\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez Vega recalled, who also remembered the many Puerto Ricans who fought to also have voter registration forms in Spanish. \"From there, Puerto Rican politics began, with many emerging leaders running for office, and today, you see that,\" he said.",
      "Making crafts, recording memories",
      "Don Andr\u00e9s later returned to Puerto Rico, where he completed his bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration and worked as a festival coordinator at the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture and founded the Coconut Festival in Luquillo.",
      "The father and daughter live 50 feet from each other, in concrete houses surrounded by plants that grow avocados, pigeon peas and plantains. Gonz\u00e1lez calls her father every morning to go over the day\u2019s errands. After their chat, Don Andr\u00e9s goes down 12 steps from the second floor of his house to sit in the dining room for breakfast: a glass of hot milk with bananas and oranges.",
      "He makes handmade crafts, including traditional Puerto Rican musical instruments like his signature g\u00fciros and maracas.",
      "When Gonz\u00e1lez Vega visits El Yunque to sell his work, he sometimes wonders whether he should stop, as his daughter is the one who helps him carry the heavy table and set up his shop with his handmade instruments.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want you to stop. I want you to continue,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez said with great emotion.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez, who dreams of creating a place that offers Puerto Rican crafts, coffee and wine, said that while she has to make a list to try to remember the things she has to accomplish, \"my dad has everything in his mind. I want to continue to do everything in the way he has always done them.\u201d",
      "Don Andr\u00e9s said, \u201cI thank God for giving me a daughter like Julia, who means everything to me.\u201d",
      "Asked whether he has told his whole story, he replied with a smile: \u201cI haven\u2019t told you anything yet.\u201d",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez Vega continues his days reminiscing about his memories and enjoying the time he has with his daughter while singing his own version of Bad Bunny\u2019s hit \u201cCaf\u00e9 Con Ron,\u201d which rhymes in Spanish and loosely translates to \u201cCoffee in the morning, and in the afternoon ham (jam\u00f3n), we enjoy everything sitting in the balcony\u201d (balc\u00f3n).",

    "story": [
      "When the Trump administration announced a new 17% tariff on Mexican tomatoes, Florida-based growers celebrated the win. They\u2019d pushed for years to end a trade agreement that they said failed to keep Mexican imports from flooding the market.",
      "But greenhouse growers, importers and industry groups in Arizona and Texas are blasting the Commerce Department\u2019s withdrawal from the agreement, warning that it could raise prices and cost U.S. jobs.",
      "\u201cThere has to be a better way of doing business than just putting duties on products that the consumers want,\u201d said NatureSweet CEO Rodolfo Spielmann, who grows greenhouse tomatoes in Arizona and Mexico.",
      "Since President Donald Trump took office in January, he\u2019s waged a sweeping trade war to promote domestic industries and specific political demands. Earlier this month, he threatened to impose a 30% tariff on Mexico for allegedly failing to dismantle drug cartels. But the tomato levy is distinct. It stems from the termination of a nearly 30-year-old trade agreement specific to Mexican tomatoes.",
      "Growers like Spielmann hoped \u2014 and still hope \u2014 the agreement would be renegotiated instead. Because NatureSweet works on both sides of the border, he says it\u2019s impossible to scale back Mexican operations without also hurting domestic ones.",
      "The footprint of NatureSweet\u2019s Arizona greenhouse could hold 30 football fields, Spielmann said. The company, whose tomatoes are primarily sold in grocery stores, planned to more than double its capacity in the United States, in response to growing demand and a desire to innovate. But it has now put that expansion on hold, he said, because of the change in trade policy."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The GOP-controlled House is cutting short its last workweek before the summer recess because of a fight on Capitol Hill over the release of the government\u2019s files on the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "The House was scheduled to hold votes on Thursday before lawmakers departed for their five-week recess.",
      "But Republican leaders informed rank-and-file lawmakers on Tuesday that the final vote of the week would now be a day earlier, on Wednesday afternoon. The shift in schedule occurred because of a standoff on the Rules Committee, which decides how legislation comes to the floor but has been ground to a halt by the Epstein issue.",
      "The panel, which is closely aligned with Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., typically passes a rule for legislation on Monday that sets up debate and allows bills to come to the floor for the week. But Democrats had promised Monday to force the committee to take more votes on whether to require the Trump administration to release all remaining files from the Epstein case.",
      "To avoid embarrassing votes on Epstein, Republicans decided to recess the committee and not attempt to pass a rule for bills this week. Without a rule, Republicans would be left with nothing to vote on after Wednesday.",
      "The Epstein saga has dominated chatter on Capitol Hill for more than a week as many Trump supporters have clamored for the release of all documents related to the convicted sex offender and the president and his administration sought to downplay the issue. It appeared to be dying down in recent days, but the Trump administration breathed new life into the story Tuesday morning, when the Justice Department announced that Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche will meet with Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell in the coming days.",
      "A short while later, conservative Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., passed a motion in a subcommittee meeting to have the House Oversight Committee issue a subpoena for Maxwell to appear for a deposition. Oversight Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., said through a spokesperson that he had encouraged Burchett to make the motion and that the subpoena will be issued \u201cas expeditiously as possible.\"",
      "The House GOP leadership's final news conference before the August recess was dominated by the Epstein matter as well, with Johnson addressing the issue at the outset and fielding several questions from reporters about Epstein.",
      "Johnson said earlier that the remaining Epstein files should be released, but he also cautioned that there needed to be a process to protect the identities of Epstein's victims.",
      "\"The president has said clearly, and he has now ordered his DOJ to do what it is we've all needed DOJ to do for years now, and that is to get everything released. So they're in the process of that. There's no purpose for Congress to push an administration to do something that they're already doing. And so this is for political games,\" Johnson told reporters.",
      "\"We can both call for full transparency and also protect victims. And if you run roughshod or you do it too quickly, that's not what happens,\" the speaker said.",
      "Johnson attempted to blame Democrats for stalling floor action and playing \"gotcha politics\" with the Epstein matter. He said Democrats had a chance to release information about the case when they controlled the entire government under President Joe Biden.",
      "But the speaker also directed much of his ire at a fellow conservative, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who is working with Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and other Democrats to force a vote in September that would compel DOJ to release the remaining Epstein files. Johnson said Massie, who has repeatedly clashed with Trump and GOP leadership, is trying to \"bite\" his fellow Republicans.",
      "\u201cSome people seem to enjoy trying to inflict political pain on their own teammates. \u2026 There\u2019s a small, small, tiny handful, but one in particular who\u2019s given me lots of consternation. I don\u2019t understand Thomas Massie\u2019s motivation. I really don\u2019t. I don\u2019t know how his mind works. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s thinking,\u201d Johnson said in a lengthy and unusual tirade.",
      "\u201cThomas Massie could have brought his discharge petition anytime over the last four years of the Biden administration. He could have done that at any time, and now he\u2019s clamoring as if there\u2019s some sort of timeline on it,\u201d Johnson continued.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to me that he chose the election of President Trump to bring this, to team up with the Democrats and bring this discharge petition. \u2026 I try to follow Ronald Reagan\u2019s 11th Commandment, never speak evil of another Republican,\" the speaker said. \"My gosh, it\u2019s hard to do sometimes around here.\u201d",
      "For his part, Massie appears to be relishing all of the scrutiny and attention. He was spotted walking around the Capitol on Monday holding a large white binder that read: \"The Epstein Files: Phase 2 ... DECLASSIFIED.\"",
      "Massie and Khanna need the signatures of at least 218 members of the House to get a vote on their Epstein bill in the fall, and the Kentucky Republican predicted they'll get there.",
      "\"Over the August recess, I think momentum will build for transparency. I don't think this is going to go away,\" Massie said. \"And I think, when we return in September, we'll get Phase 2 of the Epstein files because we'll get ... every Democrat and at least a dozen Republicans who want transparency and justice.\""

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The White House is facing backlash from press groups after booting The Wall Street Journal from a cohort of media outlets set to cover President Donald Trump's upcoming trip to Scotland.",
      "\"This attempt by the White House to punish a media outlet whose coverage it does not like is deeply troubling, and it defies the First Amendment,\" Weijia Jiang, the president of the White House Correspondents' Association, said in a statement.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that The Wall Street Journal would not be part of the group of media outlets set to travel with Trump when he visits Scotland on July 25-29. The move comes after The Journal reported that Trump in 2003 sent Jeffrey Epstein a birthday card with a drawing of a naked woman, calling Epstein a \u201cpal\u201d and signing off, \u201cmay every day be another wonderful secret.\u201d",
      "\"Due to the Wall Street Journal\u2019s fake and defamatory conduct, they will not be one of the thirteen outlets on board,\" Leavitt said in a statement, though she did not explicitly refer to the Journal's Epstein article.",
      "The day after the article was published, Trump filed a libel lawsuit seeking $10 billion in damages. The suit named The Wall Street Journal's parent company and publisher, two reporters and two executives, including the paper's owner, Rupert Murdoch.",
      "Dow Jones, The Wall Street Journal\u2019s publisher, declined to comment being kicked out of the pool. After Trump\u2019s lawsuit, a Dow Jones spokesperson defended The Journal\u2019s reporting, saying, \u201cWe have full confidence in the rigor and accuracy of our reporting, and will vigorously defend against any lawsuit.\u201d",
      "Jiang urged the White House to reverse its decision, noting that the White House Correspondents' Association was ready to work with the administration on a resolution.",
      "\"Government retaliation against news outlets based on the content of their reporting should concern all who value free speech and an independent media,\" she said.",
      "A spokesperson for The New York Times also condemned the White House's move, calling it \"an attack on core constitutional principles underpinning free speech and a free press.\"",
      "\"This is simple retribution by a president against a news organization for doing reporting that he doesn\u2019t like,\" the spokesperson said. \"Such actions deprive Americans of information about how their government operates.\"",
      "Press pools have had a longstanding role in White House media coverage. Space at events with the president \u2014 such as in the Oval Office or on Air Force One \u2014 is limited, so media outlets take turns serving in the smaller press pool to provide information for the larger media cohort. Pool journalists shoot footage, ask questions and provide inside-the-room details for shared use.",
      "The Wall Street Journal has regularly been part of the White House pool, and was recently as last week, before its Epstein story broke. It is unclear whether the White House plans to bar the outlet from other pooled coverage events outside of the president's trip to Scotland.",
      "During prior administrations, the White House Correspondents' Association coordinated which outlets would take on pool roles at what time. Leavitt said in February that the White House would take over pool control, ending the precedent.",
      "The White House also sought to ban The Associated Press from media events, marking a sharp departure from prior administrations. Trump repeatedly criticized The AP for referring to what the White House calls the \"Gulf of America\" as the Gulf of Mexico.",
      "An appeals court ruled in June that Trump was allowed to block The AP from some media events as litigation continues, which Leavitt pointed to in her statement on Monday.",
      "\"As the appeals court confirmed, the Wall Street Journal or any other news outlet are not guaranteed special access to cover President Trump in the Oval Office, aboard Air Force One, and in his private workspaces,\" she said.",
      "The Epstein case has engulfed the administration in controversy and sparked rare criticism from Trump\u2019s own base. In recent weeks, a growing number of people \u2014 including some close Trump allies \u2014 are calling on the White House to release more files related to Epstein, who died in jail while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Tuesday that Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche would meet with Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for grooming and recruiting girls for Epstein's sexual abuse.",
      "Epstein initially came under investigation in 2005, two years before the Journal said Trump sent the birthday greeting. Trump told New York magazine in 2002 that Epstein was a \"terrific guy.\"",
      "Trump later distanced himself from Epstein, saying after the billionaire's 2019 arrest that the two had a falling out \"a long time ago.\""

    "story": [
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche intends to meet with convicted sex trafficker and Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell in the next several days, Attorney General Pam Bondi said Tuesday morning.",
      "Maxwell was convicted of sex trafficking in 2021 for recruiting and grooming multiple teenage girls for over a decade to be sexually abused by Epstein. She was investigated and indicted during the first Trump administration and tried and convicted during the Biden administration.",
      "The meeting was confirmed by Maxwell's attorney, David Oscar Markus, who has been requesting meetings with Trump administration officials and has argued that Maxwell did not receive a fair trial.",
      "\u201cI can confirm that we are in discussions with the government and that Ghislaine will always testify truthfully,\" Markus said. \"We are grateful to President Trump for his commitment to uncovering the truth in this case.\u201d",
      "NBC News has reported that Maxwell did not ask for a plea agreement and was not offered one before her trial, according to statements made by federal prosecutors at the time. After being convicted in New York, she was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison.",
      "Blanche, in a statement on Tuesday on X posted by Bondi, said the Justice Department stood by its July 6 decision to release no further documents in the Epstein case, which sparked an uproar among Trump supporters that has proven to be one of the largest political challenges of Trump\u2019s second term. The president has repeatedly called on his supporters to move on and focus on other topics, and at one point called them \u201cstupid.\u201d",
      "Trump supporters criticized the decision, citing repeated promises from Bondi that she would release documents related to the Epstein case. Multiple Republican members of Congress and right-wing influencers have also criticized Bondi, whom Trump has defended.",
      "Blaming other prosecutors",
      "In an unusual step, Blanche appeared to publicly criticize the work of the Justice Department prosecutors who investigated Epstein during George W. Bush\u2019s second term, Trump\u2019s first term and Biden\u2019s term.",
      "\"Until now, no administration on behalf of the Department had inquired about her willingness to meet with the government.\" Blanche said, referring to Maxwell. \"That changes now.\"",
      "\"Justice demands courage,\" Blanche added in a separate X post. \"For the first time, the Department of Justice is reaching out to Ghislaine Maxwell to ask: what do you know?\"",
      "Legal experts have questioned the credibility of Maxwell's claims, given her role in enabling Epstein's abuse of minors for over a decade. They have also criticized the investigation of Epstein carried out by the Justice Department during the George W. Bush administration.",
      "In a 2008 plea deal overseen by then-U.S. Attorney in South Florida Alex Acosta, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges of procuring a person under 18 for prostitution and felony solicitation of prostitution.",
      "The agreement required Epstein to register as a sex offender and serve about a year in a Florida county jail. But he was able to leave almost daily for work, and was allowed to have his own private security detail behind bars.",
      "Eleven years later, Epstein was indicted on July 8, 2019, during Trump's first administration, on federal charges of sex trafficking minors in New York. His case ended after he was found dead in his jail cell roughly one month later.",
      "A medical examiner\u2019s office ruled he died by suicide, a conclusion that Bondi and Blanche supported in the July 6 statement issued by the Justice Department and the FBI.",
      "Roughly a year later, Maxwell was indicted indicted on federal charges on July 9, 2020. Maxwell was found guilty on Dec. 29, 2021, of multiple counts of conspiring to sex traffic minors and later sentenced to 20 years in federal prison. But her trial did not reveal proof that other men sexually abused the minors.",
      "Continued conspiracy theories",
      "For years, the cause of Epstein\u2019s death, his high-profile contacts, his initial plea bargain, and the graphic details of his alleged crimes have fueled conspiracy theories and demands that the government release all it knows about the case.",
      "Trump helped fuel these theories in the past, saying during his  presidential campaign last year that he would have \u201cno problem\u201d looking into an Epstein client list.",
      "After becoming attorney general, Bondi repeatedly promised to release documents related to the Epstein case. In a Fox News interview in February, Bondi said an Epstein client list was \u201csitting on my desk right now to review.\u201d",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino also called for the release of Epstein documents before being chosen by Trump for their current positions.",
      "But the July 6 joint statement by the DOJ and FBI said that an exhaustive internal review of Epstein-related records had not produce enough evidence to prosecute any other individuals.",
      "\"A systematic review revealed no incriminating 'client list,'\" the agencies said. \"There was also no credible evidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions. We did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\"",
      "Multiple federal judges have rejected appeals of Maxwell's conviction, and her current appeal is before the Supreme Court. She is serving her 20-year sentence at a federal prison in Florida.",
      "On Monday, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., continued to criticize Trump's handling of the Epstein case.",
      "\u201cIf you tell the base of people, who support you, of deep state treasonous crimes, election interference, blackmail, and rich powerful elite evil cabals, then you must take down every enemy of The People,\u201d Greene said in a social media post. \u201cIf not. The base will turn and there\u2019s no going back.",
      "\"Dangling bits of red meat no longer satisfies,\" she added. \"They want the whole steak dinner and will accept nothing else.\u201d"

      "Initially, Coca-Cola did not confirm the news. The company told NBC News last week that it appreciated Trump's \"enthusiasm for our iconic Coca-Cola brand\" but that \"details...will be shared soon.\"",

      "What attracts flies in the home?",
      "There are a few common causes for flies around the home, according to our experts. While there are a few different types of flies, in addition to other flying insects that are often confused for one another, like mosquitoes and gnats, many of them are typically caused by the following factors:",
      "Fruit and sugar: Both fruit flies and house flies, which are categorized as \u201cfilth flies,\u201d are extremely attracted to the smell of fruit, according to Bloom.  \u201cIn the home, they are typically introduced as eggs on fruit and produce which then emerge once fermentation starts,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can see this relationship if you look at fruit stands.\u201d This problem arises when the fruit is left out, unwashed, overripe and/or rotting in a trash, fridge or cabinet or on a countertop. Additionally, fruit flies gravitate toward sugar substances like soda, fruit juice and candy.",
      "Fermentation: Similarly, fruit flies are often attracted to the smell of fermented foods and drinks, such as beer, wine, kombucha, yogurt, cheese and bread. While you keep these items in the fridge, things like small spills or crumbs left on the counter can attract flies. Plus, when you throw these items out, they can still attract flies due to residual matter. This is why Bloom recommends regularly rinsing out containers, cans and bottles before throwing them out to prevent flies.",
      "Decaying matter and filth: Other types of filth flies, such as the house fly, may gravitate towards fruit, but they\u2019re also attracted to dirtier materials, according to Bloom. This includes leaking drains, dirty mops, compost and pet litter.  This could also include bits of food sitting in your garbage disposal.",
      "Windows and weather: Lastly, leaving windows and doors open, even for a few seconds, gives flies the easiest entry into your home. That said, you may also notice an increase in flying insects like flies, fruit flies, mosquitoes and fungus gnats during late spring and throughout summer, according to Williams. \u201cFlies and fruit flies have more access to food sources in the warmer months, as they\u2019re attracted to rotting produce that is more abundant this time of year,\u201d he says. In other words, a more humid environment makes it easier for flies to survive and reproduce.",

      "How to shop for plastic food container alternatives",
      "Many plastic food container sets have chemical additives (many of which companies aren\u2019t required to disclose) with adverse health effects. This includes BPA, phthalates and PFAS \u2014 and those are only the handful of ones researchers know about, according to Woodruff. The easiest way to avoid leaching consequences is to simply avoid plastic food containers altogether. Here\u2019s how to find the best plastic-free container:",
      "Glass is arguably the best material to look for as an eco-friendly alternative to plastic food containers, according to experts. To a lesser extent, stainless steel containers can also be a reliable option. Glass allows for versatility since it\u2019s usually oven-, microwave- and dishwasher-safe, and isn\u2019t susceptible to leaching like plastic. Stainless steel doesn\u2019t always have these features, though it isn\u2019t susceptible to breaking or cracking and it often allows food to stay warm for longer. Also, many glass food storage containers have plastic lids, even if they\u2019re free of BPA, PFAS and other chemicals.",
      "If you plan on only using storage containers to prepare food \u2014 whether it be on the stove or in the oven \u2014 and then transfer food to them, then they don\u2019t need to be oven- or microwave-safe. If you don\u2019t want to have to dirty more dishes or transfer the food to a plate for reheating, then you should make sure that whatever you buy is microwave or oven safe. If you\u2019re someone who likes to meal prep and then freeze food, be sure to purchase something that\u2019s freezer compatible.",
      "In addition to buying new containers, Woodruff also recommends reusing store-bought glass containers, like those for condiments or sauces, to store food (not necessarily heat it), similar to how you would a mason jar. Doing this can help you save money and it reduces your single-use plastic consumption.",
      "Frequently asked questions",
      "Leaching is what happens when molecular particles and chemicals in microplastics, like BPA and PFAS, slough off from plastic (in this case, food containers) and get into food, according to Woodruff. While this happens at any temperature, leaching is much more probable when you heat the plastic material, according to Woodruff. This is because heat agitates the molecules in the plastic, making them more susceptible to breaking apart. Additionally, some chemicals, such as BPA, leach more when you prepare acidic foods, such as tomato-based sauces, in them.",
      "Many people and organizations call PFAS \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because of how long they take to degrade and break down in the environment, according to The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Since these chemicals last so long they eventually make their way into food, water and animals, according to the EPA. From there, they can lead to health complications in humans, like infertility and cancer, according to Woodruff.",

    "story": [
      "One Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader is breaking the mold with her signature hairstyle, and it's causing quite the stir.",
      "When rookie Faith Ward recently announced that she'd earned a spot on the 2025-2026 DCC squad, some social media users noticed that her hair looked a bit different than the rest of the cheerleaders.",
      "In \"America's Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders,\" the members of the iconic squad are typically seen wearing their hair down, with lots of volume.",
      "However, Ward was spotted rocking a perky ponytail while sporting the DCC uniform in multiple TikTok and Instagram posts.",
      "Now, the New Zealander is addressing the question on everyone\u2019s mind: Will the ponytail stick around?",
      "During a July 21 interview with ABC Perth, Ward said she understands why people have been curious to know whether she's allowed to wear a different hairstyle than the rest of the squad.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s crazy because obviously the DCC hairstyle is hair out, fluffy, voluminous, luscious, long locks. I\u2019ve, you know, broken that stereotype,\u201d she said.",
      "The cheerleader then explained how the ponytail hairstyle came about in the first place.",
      "\u201cSo, I\u2019m in rehearsal one of the days with my hair out and I am, you know, sweating after doing \u2018Thunderstruck.' (DCC Director Kelli Finglass is) looking at me and she\u2019s like, \u2018You know what? I really want to see what your hair would look like tied up,\u2019\u201d she recalled.",
      "The change helped Ward focus more on her choreography and resulted in an unexpected, yet positive perk.",
      "\u201cSo I put it up for her and she really liked the way it danced, which was really cool because I was super excited about that because your girl doesn\u2019t want to have her hair out, sweaty in her face (while) dancing,\u201d she said.",
      "When Ward went to uniform fittings, she kept her hair in the ponytail \"in hopes that\" Kelli Finglass would like it. Luckily, she did.",
      "\u201cI walk in and she goes, \u2018You\u2019re giving Ariana Grande! Like, we need an Ariana Grande moment on the team,\u201d she said of Finglass' reaction. \"I was like, \u2018Are you serious right now, Kelli? Like this is so exciting!\u2019 She was like, \u2018Yeah, but I want your ponytail longer, I want it blonder and then I want to see a cameo day (to determine) whether I prefer you with your hair out or in a ponytail.\u201d",
      "Moving forward, Ward still isn't positive that the hairstyle will stick around, but she's cautiously optimistic.",
      "\u201cSo right now, it\u2019s looking very hopeful that I will be a DCC with a ponytail. But, we still have to keep an open mind to the possibility that I could be going back to be hair out. So we can\u2019t get too excited yet!\u201d she said.",
      "Second-year DCC veteran Ava Lahey also recently opened up about her hair, which she wears straight instead of curly. In an Instagram video posted on June 27, she said her hair is \"naturally really soft and fine\" and used to \"fall flat after 20 minutes and look really stringy\" when she curled it during training camp.",
      "Similar to Ward, Lahey was told her hair \"dances better\" when she wears it straight.",
      "\u201cI did end up getting cut from training camp that year, but when I made it back to training camp again, I wore it straight right off the bat,\u201d she said.",
      "During the makeover phase, Lahey was told her hair looked great \"straight, sleek and blonde\" and she was \"so happy.\""

      "\u201cThere are times where I know there are things that I say that won\u2019t necessarily jive with a lot of people, but this is a place where we want to discuss all lanes of the Black community, and all of those lanes don\u2019t necessarily agree all the time but this is a place where we can have civil discourse and respectful challenging,\u201d he continued.",

      "In addition to his cultural work, Warner remained an actor. He starred in nearly the entirety of \"The Resident\" as surgeon AJ Austin and recently made appearances in \"Grown-ish\" and \"9-1-1.\"",

      "Costa Rica\u2019s Judicial Investigation Agency also provided a statement, obtained by TODAY.com, with more details about Warner\u2019s death.",
      "\u201cOn Sunday afternoon, July 20, 2025, agents of the Judicial Investigation Agency (OIJ), stationed at the Bribri Regional Subdelegation, carried out the removal of the body of a male who apparently died as a result of Asphyxia by Submersion,\u201d the agency said.",
      "The OIJ said that the preliminary report showed that the accident occurred between 2 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. local time.",
      "According to the report, the male victim entered the water and \u201capparently was dragged by a current offshore.\u201d The man was rescued and taken to the shore before the Costa Rican Red Cross attempted to revive him. \u201cHowever, he was declared without vital signs at the scene,\u201d the report said.",
      "OIJ agents examined the body and confirmed Warner\u2019s identity. His body has been sent to the Judicial Morgue in San Joaquin de Flores for an autopsy.",
      "Warner first became a household name in 1984 when he landed the role of Theo Huxtable on \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d with Bill Cosby, Phylicia Rashad, Keshia Knight Pulliam and Tempestt Bledsoe. He remained on the beloved sitcom for its entire eight-season run. His portrayal landed him an Emmy nomination in 1986.",
      "Following the show\u2019s series finale in 1992, he began voicing The Producer in the animated series \u201cThe Magic School Bus\u201d before booking a leading role in another comedy, \u201cMalcolm & Eddie.\u201d He co-starred alongside Eddie Griffin in the sitcom about two close friends who are the complete opposites of each other.",
      "In 2011, he teamed up with fellow comedy icon Tracee Ellis Ross for a family sitcom called \u201cReed Between the Lines\u201d that aired on BET. The show followed Warner's and Ross' characters as they led their modern, blended family. The two actors also served as producers.",
      "A few years after \u201cReed Between the Lines\u201d ended, Warner donned a lab coat to play surgeon AJ Austin when he joined the cast of Fox\u2019s \u201cThe Resident\u201d in Season 1 as a recurring character. He became a series regular when the medical drama returned for Season 2 and continued to star on the show until its last episode in 2023.",
      "In between his starring roles, Warner, who also worked as a director, booked smaller parts on popular shows like \u201c9-1-1,\u201d \u201cSuits,\u201d \u201cAmerican Crime Story,\u201d \u201cCommunity,\u201d \u201cSons of Anarchy\u201d and more. His final role was playing Chief Inspector Bill Houston on \u201cAlert: Missing Persons Unit.\u201d He appeared in the drama\u2019s series finale, which aired on May 27.",
      "He also had roles on the silver screen, playing characters in films like \u201cFool\u2019s Gold\u201d with Matthew McConaughey, Kate Hudson and Donald Sutherland and \u201cRestaurant\u201d with Adrien Brody.",
      "Warner was a star on the stage, as well. He acted in plays like \u201cA Midsummer Night's Dream\u201d and \u201cGuess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner,\u201d giving his take on Sidney Poitier\u2019s legendary role.",
      "Warner was a two-time Grammy nominee, winning best traditional R&B performance in 2015 for \"Jesus Children.\"",
      "When he appeared on TODAY in June 2024, Warner spoke about his podcast \u201cNot All Hood,\u201d which tackled, in his words, the \u201cdifferent facets of being Black.\u201d (The most recent episode of his podcast, which he co-hosted with Candace Kelley, was uploaded on July 18.)",
      "During the conversation, he opened up about becoming a child star. \u201cIt was a phenomenon out the box. I\u2019m 14 and my mom says to me, \u2018Listen, baby, it\u2019s great that this show is the phenomenon that it is, but you know how this business is. This show could be over next year.\u2019 She said, \u2018What are you going to do when the show\u2019s over?\u2019\u201d",
      "He said that conversation made him always think about \u201clongevity\u201d in his career and that it might be difficult to transfer into adult roles. So, he started mapping out his future.",
      "As the interview ended, he offered some powerful parting words: \u201cVulnerability can be a scary thing, even when we\u2019re on the mend. Black boys boast bravado not to seem broken, and often so do Black men.\u201d",
      "Aside from his work in Hollywood for over four decades, Warner was a proud father, too. In September 2019, he gushed about his daughter, whose name he did not publicly share, in a sweet Instagram post that featured photos showing the toddler wearing a Puerto Rico shirt and playing in a fountain.",
      "In the caption, he wrote in part, \u201cGrowing up, when people would praise my mother for being such an incredible parent, she would always say that, in me, she had great material to work with. Mom, I get it now. We have also been blessed in that way. And we feel honored and blessed to be backed by a village of family and intimate friends to who love our daughter deeply and share in the honor our job to nurture, support, encourage, and protect her precious light.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cThank you for sharing in my joy as a father even though I don\u2019t post her face. She has the rest of her life for that life. Right now I just want her to BE...but it doesn\u2019t stop me from BEing a proud papa!\u201d"

      "In March 1998, 23-year-old Amy Bradley disappeared from a Royal Caribbean cruise ship as it approached the island of Cura\u00e7ao.",
      "Her parents and younger brother were with her on the trip \u2014 a family vacation before she moved into her first apartment. By sunrise on the fourth day of the cruise, she was gone.",
      "Nearly three decades later, her case remains unsolved. Did she fall off the boat, or \u2014 as her family believes \u2014 did something else happen to her?",
      "\u201cSomebody knows something, somebody saw something, somebody heard something, somebody told somebody something,\u201d her mother, Iva Bradley, says in the docuseries. \u201cNobody can keep a secret their entire life.\u201d",
      "But for Amy Bradley\u2019s family, time hasn\u2019t dulled the urgency. In \u201cAmy Bradley Is Missing,\u201d a new Netflix docuseries directed by Ari Mark and Phil Lott, her parents Ron and Iva Bradley and her brother Brad Bradley revisit those early days and reflect on what it means to live in limbo \u2014 to keep believing, even when answers don\u2019t come.",
      "What has Amy Bradley's family said about her disappearance?",
      "Before the headlines and investigations, there was just a family of four from Virginia. In the docuseries, Amy Bradley\u2019s childhood friend Erin Cullather describes the Bradleys\u2019 home as warm and welcoming, full of joy. Amy Bradley and her brother, close in age, were especially tight. At the time of the cruise, she was 23 and he was 21.",
      "The trip \u2014 a prize their parents won through their work \u2014 felt like a final sendoff for Amy Bradley, a chance to celebrate before beginning her next chapter. She had just signed a lease on her first apartment and was preparing to start a new job. It was meant to be one last family adventure before adult life began.",
      "But everything changed in the early hours of March 24, when Amy Bradley vanished from the ship without a trace.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a really terrible feeling,\u201d Iva Bradley says in the docuseries. \u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re going to go shopping and you\u2019ve got your children with you. The children are playing around underneath all the clothes and you look up and one of the children\u2019s not there. It\u2019s sheer panic. And that feeling is something that doesn\u2019t go away.\u201d",
      "Ron Bradley says he replays that day over and over. \u201cYou wake up thinking about it, go to bed thinking about it. It\u2019s just, everything around reminds you of her.\u201d",
      "For Iva Bradley, the memory is just as present: \u201cEvery day,\u201d she says when asked how often she thinks about her daughter. \u201cNot occasionally, not every other day. Not once a month. Every day.\u201d",
      "The ship\u2019s staff suggested she may have gone overboard, as did officials. At the time of her disappearance, Netherlands Antilles Coast Guard Lt. Sjoerd Soethout said, to reporters, she likely fell from her balcony.",
      "But her family didn\u2019t \u2014 and still doesn\u2019t \u2014 believe that. Over the years, they\u2019ve chased down sightings, tips and eyewitness accounts across the Caribbean. They\u2019ve appeared on \"America\u2019s Most Wanted,\" worked with the FBI and hired private investigators.",
      "\u201cTwenty six years of looking for Amy every day,\u201d Iva Bradley says. \u201cIt\u2019s a life goal.\u201d",
      "Brad Bradley recalled his sister's last words to him in a recent interview with WWBT.",
      "\u201cShe said, I\u2019m going to stay out here on the chaise lounge and a lot of fresh air and wind. I don\u2019t want to go in a closed room right now,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I told her I loved her.\u201d",
      "Where are Amy Bradley\u2019s parents now?",
      "Today, Iva and Ron Bradley are in their 70s and still live in Virginia. They continue to speak publicly about their daughter\u2019s case and remain actively involved in efforts to keep her story in the spotlight.",
      "In the documentary, they reflect on how the last two decades have shaped their lives \u2014 not as a gradual healing process, but as a state of suspended grief. There\u2019s no closure, only the enduring hope that something \u2014 or someone \u2014 might one day bring her home.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve lost a lot of years, you know, of our life searching,\u201d Iva Bradley says. \u201cBut we won\u2019t stop.\u201d",

      "The filmmakers behind \u201cAmy Bradley Is Missing\u201d say the Bradleys\u2019 resilience left a deep impression on them.",
      "\u201cHow could you not relate to this family or align yourself with their mission, when we all have parents and kids and loved ones,\u201d director Ari Mark told TODAY.com. \u201cIt\u2019s unfathomable to think that somebody that you care so much about would just vanish without any type of why.\u201d",
      "Where is Brad Bradley now?",
      "Amy\u2019s younger brother Brad Bradley, now in his late 40s, also continues to speak out about her disappearance. In the docuseries, he recounts the final hours he spent with his sister \u2014 dancing at the ship\u2019s nightclub, talking on their cabin\u2019s balcony, planning the next day.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell she could have gotten into to be in this type of situation,\u201d he says in the docuseries.",
      "After Amy Bradley disappeared, Brad Bradley paused college and moved back home.",
      "\u201cBefore Amy\u2019s disappearance, life is good, everything\u2019s great, everything\u2019s going well, and then all of a sudden the rug gets pulled out from under us,\u201d he says in the series. \u201cIt felt like this depressing period where one of the most important people in my life was gone.\u201d",
      "Brad Bradley and his father flew back to Cura\u00e7ao shortly after the end of their vacation to search for her themselves, they describe in the documentary series.",
      "They followed a tip from a taxi driver who claimed to have seen Amy Bradley in distress. They visited resorts, walked dangerous roads, and checked abandoned buildings \u2014 anything to follow the trail.",
      "Like his parents, Brad Bradley still believes his sister may be alive. \u201cThe attention she got on that ship wasn\u2019t normal,\u201d he says in the documentary, referring to cruise staff who appeared to take a special interest in his sister. Some of them even asked if she wanted to go out drinking off the boat \u2014 an invitation that now haunts the family.",
      "Years later, the experience continues to shape him.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have children,\u201d Brad Bradley says. \u201cI\u2019ll be 48 in December. Subconsciously, I think I\u2019d have to admit, watching my parents lose a child was so traumatic for me that I\u2019m not willing to put myself in a position to go through that.\u201d",
      "Still, he holds out hope.",
      "\u201cWe all have this gut feeling that she\u2019s out there,\u201d Brad Bradley says. \u201cThe lack of closure or the not knowing allows us to continue to hope. So I actually prefer it that way, you know, than the finality of having an answer.\u201d",
      "Still waiting",
      "Amy Bradley\u2019s case remains open with the FBI. Her family has been searching for her for almost 10,000 days \u2014 and they say they have no plans to stop.",
      "\u201cWe will never give up on her,\u201d Iva Bradley says. \u201cIn the morning when we wake up, we say, \u2018Well maybe today,\u2019 and then when we get ready to go to bed at night we have a special little kiss for Amy, and we say, \u2018Maybe tomorrow.\u2019\u201d",
      "They still believe the right person might speak up \u2014 or that Amy Bradley herself might see something, somewhere, and reach out.",
      "\u201cWe put a lot of pictures up online, sentimental things, in case she happens to be able to look at it,\u201d Brad Bradley says. \u201cHopefully she\u2019d see it and know that we\u2019re still trying and still thinking about her.\u201d",
      "For the filmmakers, the Bradleys\u2019 enduring hope shaped every aspect of the project. \u201cWhen you meet this family and you hear how present and alive Amy is for them every single second of every single day, the responsibility for getting a show onto the air is about life and death,\u201d director Phil Lott told TODAY.com.",
      "They don\u2019t pretend to know what happened. But they believe the right eyes on the story could change everything.",
      "\u201cSomething happened to Amy,\u201d Iva says. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what that is, but we have to have answers. If you know something, please give us that one thing that we need.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "J Balvin is returning to his roots but with a fresh perspective on life with his latest album, \u201cMixteip.\u201d",
      "Before becoming the household name he is now, the Colombian superstar began his career releasing mixtapes, including 2007\u2019s \u201cReal\u201d and 2008\u2019s \u201cEl Negocio.\u201d",
      "\u201cMixteip,\u201d he tells TODAY.com, takes it back to those early days, describing the 10-track project as \u201ca collection of songs that I love and want to share with my fans.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s showing my versatility, like I can go back to the essence of why people started listening to J Balvin,\u201d he says, sharing how the songs jump from trap, R&B, salsa and a variety of reggaeton sounds. He says it's \u201cshowing that (I) like to do different sounds and different flows.\u201d",
      "At 40 years old, Balvin \u2014\u00a0whose given name is Jos\u00e9 \u00c1lvaro Osorio Balv\u00edn \u2014 feels more secure in his work and fearless in elevating Latino culture on a global stage.",
      "His approach to music is all about what brings him joy \u2014 creating without a strict timeline, releasing music videos based on audience reception, and focusing on conquering new spaces.",
      "\u201c(\u2018Mixteip\u2019) is like a warm up of this year, zero expectations,\u201d Balvin says. \u201cI just hope people connect with whichever song they want.\u201d",
      "Read on for TODAY.com's conversation with the artist, including his must-have songs for your summer playlist.",
      "This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "When you create a song, do you think about how it will play on the dance floor first, or the message?",
      "When I finish the song and we play it, then we just start dancing and see the feeling that I get from it. It's not like I'm planning it. We go have fun in the studio and then we realize that's definitely a song to perrear (get down) or to be in the car with your friends or to dedicate it to someone. We just feel the vibe after we record the songs.",
      "Is there a specific song on 'Mixteip' that you're really proud of or is extra special to you?",
      "\u201cMisterio\u201d with (salsa legend) Gilberto Santa Rosa, who is one of my biggest idols in salsa, really makes me so proud that he said yes (to this song) and that he likes my music.",
      "The first song \u201cBruz Wein\u201d is definitely one of my favorite songs. I chose these songs because I love them all. But of course, you always have those that you feel really proud of.",
      "Do you have plans to release more music videos for other songs on 'Mixteip'?",
      "Yeah, definitely. We are releasing the video for \u201cZun Zun\u201d (July 18). Then we have another video that we have coming up, and, like, two more. Then we\u2019ll see if the people choose one song that becomes the hit of the album. We\u2019ll go and shoot the video.",
      "That\u2019s kind of the way I want to work now. I just want to make sure the fans get what they want.",
      "What are 3 songs from 'Mixteip' that people should add to their summer playlist?",
      "I think \u201cMisterio\u201d because it includes Gilberto Santa Rosa and we mix reggaeton with salsa. The song makes such a big switch because it starts with a romantic reggaeton and then out of the blue it becomes a salsa song. It\u2019s really beautiful.",
      "\u201cZun Zun\u201d with Justin Quiles and Lenny Tavarez is really special because it takes me back to the 2000s reggaeton \u2014 especially my first approach to reggaeton. So that\u2019s also one of my favorites.",
      "And I think the song \u201cBruz Wein,\u201d which is the first song that opens the mixtape. It\u2019s really elegant and classy, sexy, kind of like trap R&B.",
      "Reggaeton and Latin music continue to dominate globally. How do you see your role in the movement now compared to before?",
      "I don't have anything else to prove, you know \u2014 and I'm not saying that in a bragging way. I feel more mature and understand what I have done for the culture, what we have done. It's definitely about how you can get lucky at different levels, right? That\u2019s always been my mission: taking Latinos out of the box, conquering different parts of the world, like India, Asia. And I think my position right now is to keep unlocking new places. I always ask myself, \u201cWhen was the last time you did something for the first time?\u201d And that\u2019s what I want to do.",
      "You recently celebrated your 40th birthday. Did your perspective change on your life or career change in any way?",
      "Yeah, I'm constantly evolving and when I turned 40, I just felt more secure and more like, I don't have time for bulls---. I just want to focus on things that really elevate me or make me feel better or good or happier. Also learning how to say no, because that makes me feel free.",
      "So when it comes to your music, are you on a timeline or do you have the luxury of creating when you want to?",
      "Yeah, I think that's the magic. We can do whatever we want to do as long as it's a positive thing that you want to do in the world. I go to the studio anytime I feel that I want to because I really want to have fun. So it's definitely dropping music just because I really enjoy it.",
      "You just performed at the FIFA Club World Cup final halftime show. What is something else you're really looking forward to right now?",

      "Kim Kardashian has long been known for her legal advocacy, and she recently convinced Ryan Murphy, the creator of Netflix's \"Monsters: The Erik and Lyle Menendez Story,\" that the Menendez brothers should be released from prison.",
      "Murphy spoke about how Kardashian, who is also starring in his upcoming legal drama \"All's Fair,\" was able to change his mind on the July 20 episode of California Gov. Gavin Newsom's podcast, \"This is Gavin Newsom.\"",
      "Murphy told Newsom, who can grant the Menendez brothers clemency as governor, that when he was writing the series, he was on the fence about whether Erik and Lyle Menendez should be freed or not.",
      "\"We had an interesting writers room, where I was the one person in the room who kept saying, 'I'm not so ... I don't think they should get out.' I was the voice of, 'I don't know,'\" Murphy said.",
      "\"In a weird way, what has happened through the show is, I was really, really educated a lot by the other people in the writers room and by the actors,\" he added. \"I was astonished at how I went into something with such a predetermined point of view and came out of it at the end of it thinking, where I am today is, I really do think they should be released. I do think there should be paroled, and I did not think that when I started.\"",
      "Newsom asked how his point of view was able to evolve and asked him to share his journey to coming to his conclusion.",
      "\"What happened to me, was there was a lot of very interesting voices in my path along the way,\" Murphy said. \"For example, one of my good friends who's the star of one of my shows coming up, Kim Kardashian, you may have heard of her, arguably the most famous woman on the face of the earth.\"",
      "Murphy added it's hard to get Kardashian on the phone to talk about \"All's Fair\" because she's studying for the bar exam after completing her law program earlier this year.",
      "Newsom interjected to say Kardashian is constantly reaching out to his office to talk about cases, including advocating for incarcerated fire crews in California.",
      "\"She said, 'Can I see this?' and then I sent (the show) to her early, and she was really obsessed with it, and then went to visit (Erik and Lyle Menendez). Then she called me up and said, 'I really feel like they deserve to be paroled.' And I said, 'Why?'\" Murphy recalled.",
      "\"She talked a lot about really interesting points of view that I had not really thought about, which is, they were under 25, which I think is an interesting point of view,\" he added.",
      "Murphy cited studies that show the prefrontal cortex does not fully develop in men until they are about 26.",
      "\"So there's that argument. Also, they've been model prisoners. Also, I was very moved by their family recently and how the family is so unified,\" Murphy said. \"And I guess it just begs the question, 'If not now, when?' Like, what benefit to society do we have by keeping them there, if they can come out of prison and actually serve some good. I think that's a powerful thing.\"",
      "Newsom said he's had people ask him about the flip side: \"What good can come from sending a message that you can kill both your parents and be released? Why is the society benefited with them being released?\"",
      "Erik and Lyle Menendez have been serving life sentences for the murders of Jose and Kitty Menendez, their father and mother, in 1989.",

      "\"I think that\u2019s what your series did, is it really elevated that conversation,\" Newsom said. \"Because there\u2019s a lot of the people in prison that don\u2019t get any attention, that don\u2019t even get in front of the parole board, that don\u2019t have advocates, that don\u2019t have Kim Kardashian making phone calls, they don\u2019t have their day in court, so to speak, at least the court of the parole board and so it\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s trying to balance all that.\"",
      "In February, Newsom directed the state's parole board to investigate whether Erik and Lyle Menendez would pose a safety risk to the public if they were to be released from prison. The parole board's decision is set to be released in a set of hearings scheduled for Aug. 21 and 22.",
      "As the governor of California, Newsom can grant clemency to the brothers at any time, and he will be tasked with reviewing the California State Parole Board's recommendation.",
      "\"That's heavy stuff,\" Murphy told Newsom when the governor explained the process on his podcast.",
      "\"Heavy stuff,\" Newsom replied. \"I kept having a temptation to want to see (the show), but with the recognition always in the back of my mind that this thing may land on my desk. I don't want to be persuaded by something that's not in the files.\"",
      "Murphy later called the publicity over the Menendez brothers' case \"a very slippery slope\" and \"a really hard road.\"",
      "\"I feel for you,\" he told the governor.",
      "Murphy then joked that Newsom can watch \"Monsters\" over Labor Day weekend, after he receives the parole board's recommendation in late August.",
      "\"I'm going to see if I made the right decision,\" Newsom said while laughing.",
      "\"I would love for you to watch it, actually, because the thing about that show that I love is it asked the question, 'Are monsters made, or are they born?'\" Murphy said.",
      "Newsom asked what Murphy thinks the show decides about the Menendez brothers.",
      "\"I think ultimately, in the case of these two brothers, I think they were made,\" Murphy said."

    "summary": "Elizabeth Weber opens up about her marriage to Billy Joel in a rare interview 43 years after their divorce. Here's what she says.",
    "story": [
      "Billy Joel and Elizabeth Weber\u2019s love story didn\u2019t have a fairy tale start or even a happy ending.",
      "But in between the beginning and the end, the couple got married, forged a powerful partnership that catapulted his career and, according to Weber, created something that was \u201cgreater than the sum of the parts.\u201d",
      "And that\u2019s just a small part of what the \u201cPiano Man\u2019s\u201d ex-wife had to say about him and their union in the first installment of HBO\u2019s two-part documentary, \u201cBilly Joel: And So It Goes.\u201d",
      "Weber and Joel first met in the late 1960s, as he was best friends and bandmates with Jon Small, Weber\u2019s then-husband. In 1969, for the sake of musical convenience and financial benefit, Joel moved in with the couple and their young son, Sean.",
      "Soon Joel and Weber found themselves falling for each other.",
      "\u201cWhen you just find someone you\u2019re comfortable with, who can finish your sentences and knows what you\u2019re thinking without saying anything, sometimes it\u2019s a slow build,\u201d Weber explained in the documentary.",
      "But things changed quickly after they started an affair. Joel confessed his betrayal to Small, and for a time, Weber left both men.",
      "In her absence, a broken-hearted and deeply depressed Joel penned a number of songs about her, and he sent her the recordings.",
      "\u201cHearing those songs was overwhelming,\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt was stunning that he could accomplish something like that. And so, it had an impact.\u201d",
      "The former lovers got back together, and Weber became the supportive partner Joel had long lacked. Suddenly he had a fire to launch his career in earnest, with her help.",
      "In 1973, pair were married in a courthouse ceremony. And her efforts to help bring his music to the masses led her to take on the role of his manager, too. In fact, she created an entire management group to ensure his success.",
      "Weber took on record company execs, producers and venues to make sure he made it, and it worked. But she wasn't always rewarded for the results.",
      "\"The man is strong and assertive, it\u2019s all good,\" she noted in the documentary. \"But if you\u2019re a woman who makes a decision that people don\u2019t like, the gendered language comes out.\"",
      "And she heard plenty of it.",
      "In the documentary, even Joel admitted, \"it must have been hard being married to me.\"",
      "Ultimately, Weber agreed.",
      "\"Everyone thinks that fame is something special, and there was a lot of nice things about the life we had, but the sense of humor of the gods is fantastic,\" Weber said in the wake of Joel's career trajectory. \"Because you get this, and this is what you pay for it.\"",
      "So as Joel\u2019s musical success soared, it created a strain on both his professional and personal relationship with Weber. To counter that, Weber dropped out as his manager. But Joel\u2019s lifestyle of an indulgent rocker pushed her even further away.",
      "Eventually, even joining the superstar performer on tour became out of the question. Weber couldn\u2019t stand to see what alcohol and drugs was doing to Joel and his band. And as a mother, she couldn\u2019t risk continuing to expose her son to it.",
      "The only time she and Joel spent together after that was when he wasn\u2019t on the road \u2014 and even when he wasn\u2019t touring, he hit the road in another way. He paired his love of booze with a new passion for motorcycling, a move that frightened Weber.",
      "He even wrote a song about her concern after one close call \u2014 \u201cYou May Be Right.\u201d",
      "In it, he sang, \u201cEven rode my motorcycle in the rain / And you told me not to drive / But I made it home alive / So you said that only proves that I\u2019m insane.\u201d",
      "But that 1981 track, from his \u201cGlass Houses\u201d album, wasn\u2019t the end of the subject.",
      "Months after the song\u2019s release, Joel was in a serious motorcycle accident that left him hospitalized with multiple injuries. For him, it was a scary ordeal. For Weber, it was the final straw.",
      "\u201cI would have stayed,\u201d she said, thinking back on that time and their growing emotional distance. \u201cI would have been able, like so many women before, to make that accommodation for someone you love. But there was no way that I could stand by and watch him kill himself. I just didn\u2019t have that in me.\u201d",
      "Today, Weber still cares for the man she divorced in 1982.",
      "\u201cI still have room in my heart,\u201d she said. \u201cI love Bill. I always will.\u201d",
      "Joel went on to marry three more times and is now married to Alexis Roderick Joel."

      "The kiss cam portion of a Coldplay concert now comes with a playful warning from frontman Chris Martin.",
      "Martin made sure to give the crowd a heads-up that they were about to potentially be on the big screen during a Coldplay show on July 19 at Camp Randall Stadium in Madison, Wisconsin.",
      "The performance was the band's first concert stop since a CEO of a data operations company resigned in the wake of a viral video from a Coldplay show on July 16 in Massachusetts. The clip showed a man and woman embracing on camera before they tried to duck out of sight.",
      "During the concert in Wisconsin, Martin made sure to alert the crowd that cameras might be showing them on the stadium's big screens.",
      "\"We'd like to say hello to some of you in the crowd,\" Martin said. \"How we're going to do that is we're going to use our cameras and put some of you on the big screen. So please, if you haven't done your makeup, do your makeup now.\"",
      "A smiling Martin made no reference to the viral moment, which was followed by the data operations company Astronomer announcing on X that CEO Andy Byron had tendered his resignation.",
      "Byron was identified by social media users as one of the people in the viral video from the July 16 Coldplay concert. NBC News has not independently verified that Byron was in the footage.",
      "After the two people were seen evading the camera on July 16, Martin said onstage, \u201cEither they\u2019re having an affair or they\u2019re just very shy.\"",
      "Three days later, Astronomer announced Byron's resignation.",
      "\"As stated previously, Astronomer is committed to the values and culture that have guided us since our founding,\" the company wrote in its statement. \"Our leaders are expected to set the standard in both conduct and accountability, and recently, that standard was not met.\"",
      "The viral video also prompted several professional baseball teams to have fun with the moment over the weekend. The iconic Phillie Phanatic mascot re-created the scene at a Philadelphia Phillies game on July 18, while the Arizona Diamondbacks' mascot did his own version the same night."

      "Avdic said he heard shots, felt sharp pain in his right side and right arm and blacked out. When he woke up, more prisoners were being lined up for execution. When the small truck that brought him to the site drove away, Avdic and another wounded man escaped in the darkness. After walking through the woods for days, they crossed into Muslim-controlled central Bosnia.",
      "Last week, Avdic recounted his experience to members of the German parliament at an event in Berlin marking the 30th anniversary of the fall of the United Nations-protected \u201csafe area\u201d of Srebrenica. Two international courts have ruled that Bosnian Serbs\u2019 systematic killing of male Bosnian Muslim prisoners \u2014 at least 7,000 in total \u2014 was the first genocide in Europe since World War II.",
      "The following day, members of the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD party, argued in parliament that the mass killings did not constitute genocide. \u201cThe Serbs shot men there, but generally spared women and children,\u201d Alexander Wolf said in a speech.",
      "A second AfD member, Martin Sichert, invoked a conspiracy theory, warning that Muslims were waging a \u201cbirth jihad\u201d in Germany, a reference to Muslim immigrants someday outnumbering Germans. \u201cSrebrenica reminds us to end multiculturalism before it\u2019s too late,\u201d Sichert warned.",
      "As disinformation spreads online, denialism about war crimes \u2014 both past and ongoing \u2014 is growing increasingly common worldwide, experts warn. From current conflicts in Ukraine, Israel and Gaza to past atrocities in Syria, Bosnia and Rwanda, as well as the Holocaust, basic facts are now disputed or dismissed.",
      "Denialism is proving politically profitable, as well. In February, the AfD won the second-most seats in Germany\u2019s parliament, the best showing by a far-right party since World War II. In Bosnia, a local Serb leader, Milorad Dodik, has gained support by spreading conspiracy theories about Srebrenica, calling it \u201can arranged tragedy.\u201d He dismisses the identification of 6,981 victims \u2014 part of the largest DNA identification project in history\u2014 as a hoax.",
      "Dodik's office did not respond to a request for comment. After this article was published, Sichert said in an email that he believes it's critical to investigate the causes of massacres \"because this way the death of the people at least has a little meaning.\"",
      "He went on to ask why is Srebenica recognized as a genocide but not Hiroshima.",
      "\"Because victors write history,\" Sichert said. \"I think every civilian casualty in a war is one too many, and every civilian casualty should be considered equally no matter who won the war in the end.\"",
      "At a conference in Srebrenica marking the 30th anniversary of the mass killings here, the heads of the Kigali Genocide Memorial in Rwanda and the Auschwitz-Birkenau and Stutthof concentration camp museums in Poland warned that spreading lies online about war crimes has also become financially profitable. War crimes denialism generates so much traffic online that making money \u2014 not political or ideological gain \u2014 appears to motivate some of its purveyors.",
      "At one point, the directors discussed whether better influencers might help, and several of them agreed that they could.",
      "Avdic is determined to be one of them. As denialism spreads, he is more determined than ever to use what is left of his life to speak for the men and boys who died beside him on that gravel 30 years ago.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s becoming more aggressive day by day,\u201d he said, referring to denialism. \u201cYou have to know that we are all foreign bodies on this Earth, and we will all evaporate naturally sooner or later.\u201d",
      "A U.N.-protected \u2018safe area\u2019",
      "I first met Avdic 30 years ago covering the war in Bosnia as a reporter for The Christian Science Monitor. After the fall of Srebrenica, rumors spread that Bosnian Muslim men were describing mass executions. Avdic, then a shell-shocked teenager whose father was later found in a mass grave, was one of nine men who told me they had survived mass executions. When I later visited the gravel plateau beside an earthen dam in the village of Petkovci, I found two human femurs.",
      "Avdic and his father were among the roughly 10,000 Bosnian Muslim men who fled Srebrenica on foot when Bosnian Serb forces attacked in July 1995. The surrounded town had been declared an internationally protected \u201csafe area,\u201d but the United States, Europe and 600 Dutch U.N. peacekeepers did little to protect it",
      "Women, children and elderly men took refuge at a large battery factory that Dutch peacekeepers had turned into their main base. And men, most of them unarmed, set off through the woods on a 60-mile trek to Muslim-controlled central Bosnia.",
      "When Serb forces attacked the column, Avdic and his father were separated in the chaos. \u201cI lost him,\u201d Avdic recalled. \u201cI lost him immediately.\u201d He continued walking with strangers but was eventually captured. Two days later, he and other men were taken to the gravel plateau, and the executions began.",
      "Needing to speak",
      "For the next 12 years, Avdic testified at war crimes trials about the executions under a pseudonym and lived far from Srebrenica, fearing for his safety. In 2007, he returned to Srebrenica, his hometown. He and other Bosnian Muslims felt a duty to return to the area and preserve its Muslim community. Avdic, who had grown up in a village outside the town and also lost four uncles and three cousins in the killings, found being in Srebrenica comforting.",
      "\u201cI have less nightmares,\u201d he said, shrugging his shoulders. \u201cI cannot explain it.\u201d",
      "In 2014, when he visited the execution site during an event with mothers of the victims, he was filled with a desire to speak publicly about the mass killing he survived.",
      "\u201cWhen I came to the place, something forced me to say something; I felt a strong need to talk,\u201d he said. \u201cWords started to flow, something stronger than me.\u201d",
      "He met his wife, Elvisa, a Bosnian Muslim survivor whose uncle and cousin also died in the executions, in Srebrenica in 2008. The following year, they married.

They have three daughters who attend local school alongside Serb children. Serbs and Muslims coexist but generally don\u2019t discuss the war.",
      "\u201cHatred destroys, first of all, those who hate,\u201d Avdic said.",
      "In recent years, Avdic has given dozens of speeches about the massacres in multiple countries and called for the protection of civilians in Ukraine and Syria. Speaking about Srebrenica is difficult but cathartic. \u201cIt was my choice to go to Berlin,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not something that I wish. It is emotional, and it is difficult for me.\u201d",
      "Local Bosnian Muslims have transformed the cavernous former car battery factory that Dutch U.N. peacekeepers used as a base into a museum documenting the genocide. Across the street, the headstones of the thousands of Muslim men and boys killed in the massacres cover a lush green field and hillside.",
      "In recent years, though, Muslims have slowly left Srebrenica, many of them citing economic and safety concerns. Once a majority-Muslim town, Srebrenica is now roughly half-Serb, half-Muslim.",
      "Elvisa, Avdic\u2019s wife, said she worries about her children\u2019s future.",
      "\u201cI was 13 years old then in 1995. My daughter is now 13 years old,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, I\u2019m more emotional about that time. When we are older, we care more and we feel more.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur grandmother was killed,\u201d she added. \u201cThey cut her throat.\u201d",
      "Denial and threats",
      "Avdic said provocations still happen, including when a local priest once played Serb nationalist songs to taunt Muslim residents.",
      "\u201cHe will die with his evil,\u201d Avdic said of the priest.",
      "As denialism spreads, Serb nationalists have grown more defiant. In nearby towns, Avdic is sometimes recognized and mocked by them.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of them,\u201d he said, though he acknowledged the danger. \u201cYou never know what could happen, because I\u2019m a witness.\u201d",
      "Avdic and his wife are torn. Leaving Srebrenica might be better for their children, but Avdic believes it is his duty to raise his family here and speak for the men and boys who died beside him.",
      "\u201cI will die proud,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I believe my children will be proud they were born here.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Soccer fans know it as \u201challowed ground,\u201d so when Billie Sky Walker walked onto the field at London\u2019s Wembley Stadium two years ago, she achieved a dream held by players around the world.",
      "Before a Community Shield men\u2019s match between Manchester City and Arsenal in August 2023, she proudly donned an official shirt as a representative of the Football Association, the regulatory body for soccer in England, that read, \u201cThe FA is for all.\u201d",
      "Today, the 28-year-old is barred from playing in FA-organized tournaments following a landmark judgment by Britain\u2019s Supreme Court in April that said the legal definition of \u201cwoman\u201d is based on biological sex \u2014 a huge blow to campaigners for transgender rights that could have far-reaching implications for a wide range of life in the U.K., be it admission to changing rooms or decisions on hospital beds, equal pay claims and domestic violence shelters.",
      "After the judgment, a number of sporting governing bodies, including the FA, changed their rules so that only those born biologically female are allowed to play, excluding Walker and 28 other transgender players across England from the association. The Scottish Football Association followed suit, and Northern Ireland\u2019s Irish Football Association appears likely to do the same.",
      "Describing the ruling as \u201cconfusing and upsetting,\u201d Walker said she had been welcomed \u201cinto this space\u201d by her cisgender peers, or women whose gender matches the sex they were assigned at birth.",
      "Calling the decision to bar Walker \u201cheartbreaking,\u201d her former teammate Lucy Leiter, 24, said it was not the case that \u201conly trans women think they should play,\u201d adding, \u201cThe support has been unequivocal from everyone I\u2019ve ever played with.\u201d",
      "Walker, who said she felt that she was a girl from the age of 5 and transitioned at the age of 24, said that playing soccer on a women\u2019s team \u201creally established a huge essence of who I am, because it gave me the safety and comfort and knowledge that I\u2019m enough.\u201d",
      "Intense debate",
      "The Supreme Court ruling came amid intense and sometimes toxic public debate in the U.K. over the intersection of transgender and women\u2019s rights. The debate has also simmered in the U.S., where President Donald Trump has made it one of his signature issues by signing an executive order in February banning trans women from women\u2019s sports at the national level.",
      "In December 2022, Scottish lawmakers approved a bill that allowed anyone over the age of 16 to change their gender identity using gender certificates, removing the need for a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria, the medical term for the distress that results from the conflict between someone\u2019s gender identity and sex assigned at birth.",
      "The campaign group For Women Scotland later brought a legal case against the semiautonomous government, arguing that sex-based protections should apply only to people who were born female.",
      "And Britain\u2019s central government blocked the law the following year, invoking for the first time a section of the 25-year-old act that gave the Scottish Parliament control over most of its own affairs.",
      "The For Women Scotland case nonetheless worked its way through the court system, reaching the Supreme Court this spring.",
      "After the court\u2019s 12 justices ruled unanimously in the group\u2019s favor, the presiding judge, Lord Hodge, said the decision should not be seen as \u201ca triumph of one side over the other,\u201d and emphasized that transgender people remain protected under the law.",
      "For Women Scotland campaigners celebrated the verdict with hugs, tears of happiness and Champagne as they left the courtroom.",
      "\u201cThere was elation and disbelief and, yes, I was absolutely thrilled,\u201d Susan Smith, one of the group\u2019s co-founders, told NBC News in a telephone interview last month. \u201cIf people were entitled to say that their sex in law had changed, you can\u2019t control who applies for that.\u201d",
      "For Smith and her group, the issue of legal gender recognition touches on who gets to make decisions about women\u2019s lives and bodies, including their access to spaces from hospital wards to rape crisis centers and prisons."

    "summary": "Ukranian activists warn about corruption and authoritarianism after police raids against several high-profile anti-corruption campaigners and opposition figures.",
    "story": [
      "Ukraine risks backsliding on its endemic corruption problem \u2014 and even creeping toward authoritarianism \u2014 activists warn, following police raids against a high-profile anti-corruption campaigner and opposition figures.",
      "On July 11, armed police raided the home of Vitaliy Shabunin, the co-founder of Ukraine\u2019s Anti-Corruption Action Center. He has accused President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of \u201ctaking the first, but confident steps toward corrupt authoritarianism,\u201d including backing laws offering amnesty to those accused of corruption in the defense industry, and passing over an independently selected candidate for a key anti-graft role.",
      "The move has perturbed even some of Zelenskyy\u2019s supporters \u2014 people who are simultaneously worried about the heavy-handed and potentially spurious crackdown on dissent, and that such criticisms against the Ukrainian leader might be used in bad faith by opponents in Moscow or Washington.",
      "\u201cThis is the red line which President Zelensky has crossed \u2014 and the red line is in a very wrong direction in terms of the development of Ukraine,\u201d said Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, the Kyiv-based watchdog that Shabunin co-founded. She said the State Bureau of Investigations did not have the necessary court documents for the search.",
      "Shabunin has been charged with evading military service and fraud, with prosecutors alleging that while on secondment from the front lines to continue his activism back in Kyiv, he conducted activities unrelated to his military service. His defense team and supporters say the secondment was all aboveboard and ordered by his superiors, and that the allegations are trumped up and political.",
      "The case has caused grave alarm for many inside Ukraine and abroad, with even some of those who praise Zelenskyy for making progress on corruption flagging it as cause for concern that he may be engaging in some of the same questionable practices they\u2019d hoped he was rooting out.",
      "Zelenskyy pledged to reduce corruption when he was elected in 2019, and many expert observers say he has been effective at doing so, but the tide of criticism around Shabunin\u2019s arrest comes when the president is under intense pressure to fight off Russia and keep alive support from the United States and the West that has been at risk of faltering.",
      "It\u2019s not just Shabunin\u2019s own organization that\u2019s concerned. A group of 59 nongovernmental and civil society organizations, both inside Ukraine and abroad, have signed an open letter to Zelenskyy saying the arrest \u201cbears signs of political motivation, abuse of rights\u201d and either \u201cgross incompetence\u201d or \u201ca deliberate attack to pressure\u201d Shabunin.",
      "NBC News has contacted Zelenskyy\u2019s office and the State Bureau of Investigations for comment but has not received a response.",
      "The president has been a longtime vocal advocate on the issue of fighting corruption, particularly when it comes to suggestions from the U.S. and elsewhere that the billions of dollars in military aid his country is receiving might be being misappropriated.",
      "\u201cWhere we saw risks that something could be happening with weapons, we cracked down hard,\u201d he told the \u201cLex Fridman Podcast\u201d in January.",
      "Last year Shabunin himself dismissed the idea that foreign arms could be embezzled, telling the BBC that \u201call weapons supplied by Western allies end up in the hands of Ukrainian troops who use them effectively. It is impossible to steal Western weapons.\u201d",
      "Shabunin appeared in court Tuesday and was released on \u201crecognizance\u201d \u2014 essentially released without having to post bail \u2014 until the next hearing Aug. 20.",
      "The German Marshall Fund, a Washington think tank and one of the international signatories of the letter to Zelenskyy, said Ukraine had made \u201cmonumental strides\u201d on corruption in the past 11 years.",
      "Nevertheless, \u201cit\u2019s always concerning when a government targets its vocal critics with flimsy charges in politically motivated investigations,\u201d said Josh Rudolph, managing director and senior fellow of Strategic Democracy Initiatives at the fund. \u201cAlthough this is not a sign of corruption per se, it displays an alarming disregard for the fundamental values of freedom and the rule of law at a time when the international community has been rallying around Ukraine because it is defending those very values from Russia\u2019s brutal assault.\u201d",
      "Shabunin is not the only recent arrest to cause alarm. The opposition UDAR party, headed by former heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, says that a raid in April on the home of Kyiv City Council deputy Dmytro Bilotserkivets \u2014 again, they said, without the necessary documents \u2014 was a clear attempt to put pressure on political dissent.",
      "Corruption in Ukraine is a fraught and delicate topic, ripe for weaponization often in bad faith.",
      "Russia uses it as an example to support its otherwise untrue criticisms \u2014 such as Ukraine being run by neo-Nazis \u2014 while American and European politicians hold up such examples to bolster their pre-existing arguments about whether to support Kyiv\u2019s defense against Moscow.",
      "\u201cThe issue of corruption in Ukraine has long been highly politicized,\u201d said Mariya Omelicheva, a professor at the Pentagon-funded National War College in Washington, D.C.",
      "Ukrainian \u201ccorruption is almost always co-opted \u2014 either by Ukraine\u2019s supporters or, more problematically, by its adversaries,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is particularly sensitive in the current U.S. political climate, where both parties \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 have used Ukrainian corruption narratives for domestic political purposes.\u201d",
      "There is also a feeling among some Ukrainians that President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d focus has allowed officials abroad to act with greater impunity knowing Washington\u2019s hitherto exacting gaze is currently less troubled by world affairs.",
      "\u201cOur international partners, particularly the United States, don\u2019t care anymore about good governance and anti-corruption and reforms,\u201d Kaleniuk said. Washington \u201cfor the last 12 years had a powerful impact on how Ukraine develops, and the U.S. was usually tough on good governance, anti-corruption reforms and developments critical for democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now America doesn\u2019t care about that.\u201d",
      "While it\u2019s true Trump historically spoke warmly of Russian President Vladimir Putin and appeared to accept many of his war demands, in recent weeks he has been increasingly hostile to the Kremlin and signaled a renewed support for Ukraine, pledging Patriot missiles for Kyiv and tariffs on Moscow.",
      "It\u2019s also true that Ukraine \u2014 and Zelenskyy \u2014 have achieved some progress in the corruption fight in recent years. Transparency International, the best known international group that tracks this topic, says Ukraine has steadily improved in its annual \u201cCorruption Perceptions\u201d index \u2014 although it still ranks 105 of 180 countries worldwide.",
      "Nevertheless, domestically there are plenty of Ukrainians alarmed at what they see is a negative direction of travel when it comes to corruption in their country. Though the immediate fight is against Russia, the ultimate battle is for their values of liberty and democracy, supporters say, without which the battlefield struggle becomes pointless.",
      "\u201cWe are fighting for freedoms and for dignity,\u201d Kaleniuk said. If those are lost, \u201conly Russia will applaud.\u201d",
      "Alexander Smith and Freddie Clayton reported from London. Erin McLaughlin from Washington, D.C., and Anastasiia Parafeniuk and Daryna Mayer from Kyiv."

    "story": [
      "A genetic test may one day predict a child\u2019s risk of obesity in adulthood, paving the way for early interventions.",
      "Certain genetic variants can affect how a person\u2019s body stores fat or make them more prone to overeating. Genetic variation can also predict how well a person will respond to different weight loss drugs.",
      "In a study published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, more than 600 researchers from around the world worked together to compile genetic data from more than 5 million people \u2014 the largest and most diverse genetic dataset to date. They also used genetic data from 23andMe.",
      "From the dataset, the researchers were able to create what\u2019s known as a polygenic risk score, which takes into account which genetic variants a person has that have been linked to a higher BMI in adulthood.",
      "The score, the researchers said, could be used to predict a person\u2019s risk of obesity as an adult \u2014 before they even turn 5.",
      "\u201cChildhood is the best time to intervene,\u201d said study co-author Ruth Loos, a professor at the University of Copenhagen\u2019s Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research. (Research conducted at the center is not influenced by drugmaker Novo Nordisk, though some of the study authors had ties to pharmaceutical companies that make weight loss drugs.)",
      "The findings come as obesity is rising around the world. Rates of obesity in adults have more than doubled globally since 1990, and adolescent rates have quadrupled, according to the World Health Organization. About 16% of adults worldwide have obesity and the situation is worse in the United States, where more than 40% of adults have obesity, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics show.",
      "Twice as effective",
      "The new test is not the first that predicts a person\u2019s risk of obesity, but Loos and her team showed it was about twice as effective as the method doctors currently use to assess their patients. That polygenetic score can account for about 8.5% of a person\u2019s risk for having a high BMI as an adult. The new score increased that to about 17.6%, at least in people with European ancestry.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty powerful risk indicator for obesity, but it still leaves open a lot that is unknown,\u201d said Dr. Roy Kim, a pediatric endocrinologist at Cleveland Clinic Children\u2019s who was not involved with the research.",
      "Based on this score, more than 80% of a person\u2019s risk for obesity can be explained by other factors, such as where they live, what kinds of foods they have access to, and how much they exercise.",
      "The test was not nearly as effective in predicting obesity risk in non-Europeans. It explained about 16% of the risk for having a high BMI in East Asian Americans, but just 2.2% in rural Ugandans.",
      "About 70% of people whose data was included in the study were of predominantly European ancestry. About 14% were Hispanic and typically had a mix of ancestries. About 8% were of predominantly East Asian descent and just under 5% were of predominantly African ancestry. These samples were predominantly from African American people, who largely had mixed ancestry. Just 1.5% were of predominantly South Asian ancestry.",
      "Loos said the new score is a big step forward, but that it\u2019s still a prototype. The next step is to collect more \u2014 and more diverse \u2014 data on people with African ancestry in particular to improve how well the score works for everyone, not just white people.",
      "She said the score could offer one indicator \u2014 what high blood pressure is to heart disease, for example \u2014 that could help predict a person\u2019s risk of developing obesity.",
      "\u201cObesity is not only about genetics, so genetics alone can never accurately predict obesity,\u201d Loos said. \u201cFor the general obesity that we see all over the world, we need other factors such as lifestyle that need to be part of the predictions.\u201d Genetics play a bigger role in severe obesity, meaning a BMI of more than 40, she added.",
      "Still, identifying a person\u2019s genetic risk early on in childhood and intervening early with lifestyle coaching could make a big difference, she said. Research has shown that about 55% of children with obesity go on to have obesity in adolescence, and that about 80% of those individuals will have obesity in adulthood.",
      "\u201cBehavioral things are really important,\u201d Kim said. \u201cTheir environment, their access to healthy food, exercise opportunities, even their knowledge about healthy foods all affect a person\u2019s obesity risk.\u201d",
      "How important are genetics, really?",
      "Although studies in identical twins have found that genetics can account for as much as 80% of the reason a person has obesity, lifestyle factors still play a huge role, Kim said.",
      "\u201cEven with the same genetic makeup, people can have different body types,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a very young age in my practice, we educate patients about the importance of eating protein-rich foods, a lot of fruits and vegetables and not too many refined carbs.\u201d",
      "Dr. Juliana Simonetti, co-director of the Comprehensive Weight Management Program at the University of Utah, has been using genetic testing in her adult patients for about five years. She said understanding a person\u2019s genes can help doctors better treat weight gain.",
      "\u201cObesity is not homogeneous. We have different kinds and different presentations,\u201d said Simonetti, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new study.",
      "Simonetti uses a person\u2019s genes to determine if a patient struggles with satiety, or feeling full.",
      "\u201cThey eat but do not feel full,\u201d Simonetti said, adding that this is a disorder caused by genetic mutations affecting certain pathways in the body. People who have these mutations \u201ctend to have higher weight,\u201d she said.",
      "But such mutations do not tell the whole genetic story of obesity, Simonetti said. The genes that a person inherits from either parent, even if they are not mutations, also determine how a person\u2019s body stores weight or uses energy. Both can play a big role in obesity risk.",
      "Genetic testing is also starting to be able to determine how well certain weight loss drugs will work for a person, Simonetti said, but she added this is just the beginning.",
      "\u201cWe are talking about three out of 80 mutations that we can treat,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are getting better, and the more data we have, I\u2019m hopeful that we are going to do a better job in being more precise in understanding treatment responses.\u201d"

      "Musallet had traveled from his home in Tampa, Florida, to visit his mom, brother and sister.",
      "Huckabee, an evangelical Christian who was governor of Arkansas from 1996 to 2007, maintained an arch-conservative position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict when he ran for president in 2016. He has long been a staunch advocate for settlers\u2019 rights to colonize Palestinian land.",
      "Nizar Milbes, a close family friend of the Musallets, welcomed Huckabee\u2019s statement, saying in a telephone interview Wednesday that it \u201csounded good,\u201d although he questioned whether the demand was \u201cjust talk or is there going to be action behind it?\u201d",
      "Milbes, who is visiting the West Bank from California, added that the family wanted U.S. authorities to be involved in the investigation.",
      "Musallet's friends and family paid their final respects to him at a funeral Sunday, video published by The Associated Press showed. Among the mourners was his father, who raced from Florida to be there.",
      "\u201cWe demand justice against these settler terrorists,\u201d Musallet\u2019s father, identified as Kamil Musallet, told the AP. He called on the U.S. government to \u201cdo something about it.\u201d",
      "A second man identified, as Mohammed al-Shalabi, 23, was also killed in the incident Friday, according to the Palestinian Foreign Affairs Ministry.",
      "It was not immediately clear how the events leading up to their deaths unfolded."

      "Seemingly unfazed by President Donald Trump's 50-day ultimatum to end the fighting, Russia launched hundreds of drones and missile strikes on six Ukrainian regions overnight, officials in the country said.",
      "A child was among at least two people killed and 25 people were injured in the strikes in northern, central and southern Ukraine, according to a statement on Telegram from the Ukrainian air force and data collated by regional military administrations.",
      "The large-scale, long-range attacks targeted energy infrastructure, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on X. Power was cut for 80,000 families in his hometown of Kryvyi Rih and other locations in the Dnipropetrovsk region, Ukraine's largest private energy company DTEK said on the Telegram app.",
      "The attacks came hours after Trump told his Ukrainian counterpart not to target Moscow. It followed a report by the Financial Times citing two people familiar with the conversation that he had encouraged Zelenskyy to step up attacks deep inside Russia.",
      "NBC News has not independently confirmed the Financial Times\u2019 reporting, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later said that Trump \u201cwas merely asking a question, not encouraging further killing.\u201d",
      "Trump, who has previously lavished praise on Vladimir Putin while scorning Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on Monday gave the Russian president 50 days to agree to a peace deal. During a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte at the White House, he also said that he would slap 100% tariffs on any country that buys Russian goods.",
      "At the same time, he said, the United States would sell \u201ctop-of-the-line weapons\u201d including Patriot air defense missiles, to NATO allies \u2014 including the much-demanded Patriot missiles \u2014 so that they can be used in Ukraine.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump said that some of the vaunted missile systems had been shipped to Ukraine. \u201cThey\u2019re coming in from Germany,\u201d he said, adding that NATO members would \u201cpay us back for everything.\u201d",
      "However, the 50-day window has been criticized by some European officials and experts, who have asked why Trump is giving additional time to Putin, who has repeatedly stated his desire to subjugate Ukraine.",
      "And there was no letup in Russian attacks on Ukraine overnight as it bombarded several cities with around 400 drones and an Iskander ballistic missile, Ukraine\u2019s air force said.",
      "\u201cRussia does not change its strategy,\u201d Zelenskyy said Wednesday in a post on Telegram, a day after a strike in his hometown in central Ukraine. \u201cIn order to effectively counteract this terror, we need a systematic strengthening of protection: more aircraft, more interceptors, more determination to make Russia feel our answer.\u201d"
